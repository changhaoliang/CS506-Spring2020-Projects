0,"Constance Fravala : a/k/a Constance Fravala Phillips v. : City of Cranston, by and through its : Director of Finance Jerome I. Baron.",non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The City of Cranston (the city) appeals from a Superior Court judgment declaring Constance Fravala (Constance) 1 to be the common-law wife of Wilbur Phillips (Wilbur) at the time of his death on October 25, 2004, and Constance cross- appeals 2 from the same judgment. These two cases came before the Supreme Court for oral argument pursuant to orders directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in these appeals should not summarily be decided.', 'After examining the written and oral submissions of the parties, we conclude that these appeals may be resolved without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'We refer to the members of the Fravala and Phillips families by their first names for ease of setting forth the facts. No disrespect is intended. 2', 'We consolidate the appeal and the cross-appeal for purposes of this opinion.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'Before Constance and Wilbur met each other, Constance was married to Donald Fravala (Donald), and Wilbur was married to Lillian Cantone (Lillian). Constance married Donald in 1957, and they had five children together. They were granted a divorce on June 17, 1968. Wilbur and Lillian were married in 1959 and had six children together. In 1967, Lillian was granted a divorce from “bed, board and future cohabitation” with Wilbur. It is uncontroverted, however, that this legal separation never was converted into a final decree of divorce from the bonds of marriage.', 'At some point after her separation from Wilbur, Lillian began cohabitating with Nicholas Barone (Nicholas). Lillian and Nicholas thereafter had two children together and cohabitated until her death on October 6, 1999.', 'For approximately thirty-five years, from 1969 until Wilbur’s death in 2004, Constance and Wilbur cohabitated continuously in Rhode Island. They rented a home together in Cranston beginning in 1969, and, in 2000, they moved to Richmond. Constance’s five children lived with them in Cranston beginning in 1969, when they were between the ages of approximately two and twelve years old, until they each reached the age of majority. Constance’s grandson, Brandon, also lived with them from the time of his birth, in 1978, until the time of Wilbur’s death. Wilbur was employed as a Cranston firefighter for approximately twenty years until he retired on August 2, 1985, and Constance worked for the city as a crossing guard for approximately twenty-four years.', 'Wilbur died on October 25, 2004. At the time of his death, Wilbur was duly collecting a pension from the city for his service as a firefighter. Upon Wilbur’s death, Constance applied for a widow’s pension, but the city denied her application. On April 7, 2006, Constance filed an', '-2- action in Superior Court seeking a writ of mandamus and a mandatory injunction. She later filed a petition for declaratory relief, which the parties agreed to incorporate into her original complaint. Thereafter, the parties stipulated that Constance’s request for a writ of mandamus and a mandatory injunction would be dismissed and the case would proceed solely on her request for declaratory judgment.', 'On March 9, 2009, before the jury-waived trial began, the city filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude evidence concerning the relationship between Constance and Wilbur prior to the death of Lillian on October 6, 1999. The city argued that such evidence should be excluded on the ground of relevancy under Rule 402 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. The trial justice denied the motion, permitting Constance to present evidence at trial concerning her relationship with Wilbur before October 1999.', 'The trial took place on March 9 and 10, 2009. Constance was the first witness to testify at trial, and she testified at length about her relationship with Wilbur. She stated that she met Wilbur in the mid-1960s before her divorce from Donald and that she and Wilbur began cohabitating in 1969. She also testified that, around this time, Wilbur told her that he and Lillian were divorced.', 'Constance testified that during the thirty-five years she lived with Wilbur, neither of them dated other people; she also testified that they shared a bed and were intimate. She testified that they never lived separately for any length of time during those years. According to Constance, she and Wilbur also attended family functions, birthday parties, and weddings as a couple, and they went on vacations together at least once or twice a year.', 'Wilbur gave Constance two rings during their relationship, and Constance testified that one of the rings was given to her as an engagement ring around the time her youngest son was in', '-3- high school, approximately sixteen years after they began cohabitating. She testified that after receiving the engagement ring she and Wilbur discussed getting married “just for a ceremony.” Constance further testified that she and Wilbur “talked sometimes [about a formal marriage ceremony] and just one thing led to another, different things happened, [and they] just never [had a formal ceremony].”', 'Constance also testified about their finances.', 'She testified that she contributed to household expenses from the income she earned as a crossing guard and that, when they were living and working in Cranston, they pooled their income and shared the payment of utilities and rent.', 'She testified that after they both retired in 2000, they divided the payment of their bills— Wilbur paid for rent and utilities, and Constance paid for such things as food, her medical bills, incidentals, and gas. She was unable to recall whether she had a checking account in her own name between 1972 and 2000, but bank statements were introduced into evidence indicating that they had joint bank accounts in September 2001 and March 2004. They never filed joint tax returns because, as Constance testified, she had not known whether common-law-married couples were permitted to do so. Furthermore, Wilbur named Constance as the beneficiary of his life insurance policy and listed Constance as his emergency contact on a Medicare enrollment form.', 'At trial, a membership application for a Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island policy, signed by Wilbur and dated July 31, 2001, was admitted into evidence. The application indicated that Wilbur was married to Constance in 1988, although Constance testified that the date had no significance to her.', 'Constance testified that she never had her name legally changed, but that she signed her name “Constance Fravala Phillips” on “some things” and signed her name “Constance Fravala”', '-4- on other documents, for example, those pertaining to her children (who bore the last name Fravala). She testified at trial that a lease dated August 1, 2000 for their home in Richmond was signed “Wilbur Phillips” and “Constance Fravala Phillips,” but that she used the surname “Fravala” on her credit union account, the bill for Wilbur’s funeral expenses, and her driver’s license.', 'Over the city’s objection on the ground of hearsay, the trial justice permitted Constance to introduce photocopies of envelopes addressed to variations of “Mrs. Constance Phillips” and “Mr. and Mrs. Buddy Phillips.” Constance was also permitted, over the objection of the city, to admit an affidavit of Robert DelGiaguite, a retired firefighter for the city, whom Constance testified she knew for twenty or thirty years, but who was deceased at the time of trial. The affidavit attested that Wilbur and Constance “lived together as a married couple * * * until [Wilbur] passed away * * *.”', 'Constance testified that she provided the information to the newspaper for Wilbur’s obituary and that she paid for his funeral expenses. The obituary stated that Wilbur was the husband of “Constance ‘Connie’ (Davidson) Fravala and the late Lillian (Cantone) Phillips.” Wilbur’s death certificate, however, lists Lillian Cantone as his spouse. Constance testified that she was told that one of Wilbur’s daughters changed the designated spouse from Constance to Lillian.', 'Brandon Fravala, Constance’s grandson, also testified at trial. He testified that he lived most of his life with both Constance and Wilbur and that they had raised him. He said that Wilbur took him to work at the fire station, fishing, and to bowling tournaments. He testified that he called Wilbur “Pop,” “Gramps,” or “Dad,” that he introduced them to people as his', '-5- grandparents, and that Wilbur referred to him as his grandson. He also testified that Constance and Wilbur shared a bed.', 'Constance’s longtime friend, Cheryl Slavin, also testified at trial. She testified that Wilbur and Constance shared a bedroom and that their house had a “family atmosphere.” She testified that she introduced them as “Connie and Bud Phi[l]lips” or “Connie and Bud Fravala.” She also described Wilbur and Brandon as being “[v]ery, very close.”', 'Thomas Morrocco, a retired firefighter for the city, and his wife, Gale Morrocco, both testified at trial about their friendship with Wilbur and Constance. Mr. and Ms. Morrocco met Wilbur and Constance through the Cranston Fire Department in the late-1960s. Mr. Morrocco recalled that Wilbur and Constance had been a couple for the approximately thirty-four years he had known them and that they held themselves out as a couple. He also testified that he had no knowledge of Wilbur ever “being” with any other women. Ms. Morrocco indicated that they socialized as couples and that she considered Wilbur and Constance to be a family unit. They both testified that the four of them had gone on vacations together.', 'Edward Murray, a retired employee of the Cranston Fire Department, testified that he saw Wilbur and Constance at social events sponsored by the fire department and that he believed them to be married.', 'Another retired employee of the Cranston Fire Department, Robert Crossley, also testified at trial. He testified that he considered himself to be one of Wilbur’s close friends and that he had socialized with the couple for over twenty years. He testified that he knew that Constance and Wilbur lived together, and he characterized them as a “couple.” He further testified that he had not known Wilbur or Constance to “be” with other women or men, respectively, and that he did not know of their living apart from each other.', '-6-', 'Donald Palumbo, also a retired firefighter, testified that he knew Wilbur fairly well and that he knew Constance and Wilbur to be a couple for twenty-five or thirty years. Like the other retired firefighters, Mr. Palumbo testified that Wilbur treated Constance’s children as though they were his own children, that he did not have knowledge of Constance or Wilbur “being” with other men or women, respectively, nor did he know of their living separately from each other.', 'Mr. Palumbo also testified about the affidavit of Robert DelGiaguite, which had been introduced into evidence by Constance. He testified that he knew the affiant, Mr. DelGiaguite, and that he had notarized the affidavit. Mr. Palumbo said that Mr. DelGiaguite was asked to prepare the affidavit and that he thereafter died. He further testified that he recognized the affidavit, had knowledge of Mr. DelGiaguite preparing the affidavit, and had witnessed him sign it in the absence of coercion. The affidavit thereafter was introduced into evidence as a full exhibit over the city’s objection, and Mr. Palumbo read aloud a sentence of the affidavit stating Wilbur and Constance “lived together as a married couple until he passed away on October 25, 2004.”', 'Three of Constance’s children, Resa Cook, David Fravala, and Donald Fravala, testified. They each testified that Wilbur was a father figure during their childhood, bringing them on vacations and to the firehouse, attending parent-teacher conferences, and participating in Cub Scout activities. They each also testified that they referred to Wilbur as their father.', 'Resa Cook testified that she lived with Wilbur, Constance, and her siblings until 1985. She testified that Wilbur was more of a father figure than her biological father had been, stating that Wilbur walked her down the aisle when she got married. She also testified that Wilbur and Constance had shared a bedroom, that they never had separated, and that she was not aware of her mother dating other men. David Fravala testified that Wilbur’s children would visit and that', '-7- his family took trips to visit Wilbur’s children. Donald Fravala testified that he knew Lillian as Wilbur’s ex-wife.', 'The city then presented a single witness. Debra Santurri, an account clerk in the city’s finance office, testified that she was employed in that position in October 2004, when Wilbur died. She stated that one of her duties was to send bereavement letters and affidavits to the surviving spouses of city pension recipients. A surviving spouse was asked to provide a copy of the death certificate and marriage certificate if he or she wanted to apply for a survivor’s pension. On cross-examination, Ms. Santurri testified that if Constance was deemed eligible to collect Wilbur’s pension, she would be entitled to receive $2,486.29 per month as of February 2009 and a lump sum of $119,308.22 for benefits accrued from the time of Wilbur’s death through January 2009.', 'The trial justice rendered a decision from the bench on March 27, 2009. The trial justice recounted the facts adduced at trial and stated that she was “clearly convinced that [Constance] and Wilbur * * * intended to live together as husband and wife for over thirty-five years” and that Constance had “met her burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that a common- law marriage existed between the parties at the time of Wilbur[’s] death.” She then concluded that a common-law marriage existed between Constance and Wilbur at the time of Wilbur’s death and that this finding was supported by “clear and convincing evidence that the parties mutually share[d] the requisite mutual intent to enter the husband-wife relationship which was proven by the testimony of Constance * * * as to the nature of their thirty-five-year relationship and their cohabitation, conduct, declarations to others and reputation among friends and family.” The trial justice went on to declare that Constance was entitled to a widow’s pension from the city as of the date of Wilbur’s death in October 2004 through January 2009, and future monthly', '-8- benefits during her lifetime.', 'The trial justice denied Constance’s request for prejudgment interest.', 'An order was entered on April 2, 2009, that was consistent with the bench decision. Judgment was entered that same day, (1) declaring Constance the common-law wife of Wilbur at the time of his death; (2) granting her widow’s pension benefits of $119,308.22 from October 25, 2004 through January 31, 2009; (3) granting future monthly widow’s pension benefits of $2,486.29 during her lifetime for the months February 2009 through June 2009, and thereafter in an amount to be determined by the terms of the pension agreement; and (4) denying Constance’s request for prejudgment interest.', 'On April 28, 2009, a hearing was held on the city’s motion for an order staying enforcement of the judgment, and the motion was granted conditionally, provided the issuance of a supersedeas bond pursuant to Rule 62 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. Constance and the city filed timely cross-appeals.', 'II', 'Analysis', 'A', 'Evidentiary Rulings', '1. Motion in Limine', 'On appeal, the city argues that the trial justice erred in denying its motion in limine to exclude evidence of Constance and Wilbur’s relationship prior to Lillian’s death. It contends that the evidence should have been excluded because, as a matter of law, Constance and Wilbur could not have been married under the common law before Lillian’s death in 1999, and therefore, such evidence was not relevant to Constance’s claim.', '-9-', 'In denying the motion in limine, the trial justice stated that “evidence of the relationship between the parties, namely [Constance and Wilbur], both prior to and after that date of death, are relevant to the existence of a common-law relationship * * *.” She denied the motion without prejudice to the city, stating that it later could raise the argument that the evidence did not support a common-law marriage after Lillian’s death. Moreover, the trial justice withheld judgment on the issue of the weight she would afford the evidence.', 'At the end of the trial, in considering the weight to be attributed to this evidence, the trial justice stated that the legal impediment created by Wilbur’s marriage to Lillian “does not mean that [Constance] and Wilbur * * * did not intend to enter into a husband and wife relationship before [Lillian’s] death. [T]he nature of their intent prior to [Lillian’s] death in 1999 is certainly relevant to their intent thereafter[,]” because she found that “[n]othing [had] changed in terms of their intent or their relationship from the inception of their relationship in 1969 until [Wilbur’s] death in 2004.”', 'We review the grant or denial of a motion in limine for an abuse of discretion. Owens v. Silvia, 838 A.2d 881, 889 (R.I. 2003). In its motion in limine, the city moved for exclusion of the evidence on the ground of relevancy. Such a determination “is within the sound discretion of the trial justice and, absent a showing of abuse of this discretion, this Court will not disturb a ruling concerning the admissibility of evidence.” Perrotti v. Gonicberg, 877 A.2d 631, 642 (R.I. 2005) (quoting State v. Lynch, 854 A.2d 1022, 1035 (R.I. 2004)).', 'Given this deferential standard of review, we cannot say that the trial justice abused her discretion in ruling that evidence predating Lillian’s death was relevant to the intent of Wilbur and Constance to enter into a husband-wife relationship. Although Wilbur did not have the capacity to enter into a valid common-law marriage with Constance, it was not error to conclude', '- 10 - that the nature of his relationship with her during that time nevertheless was relevant. As the trial justice ultimately concluded, the evidence was relevant if Wilbur and Constance formed such intent prior to Lillian’s death and it continued uninterrupted after her death.', 'Rhode Island is one of the few states that continues to recognize common-law marriage. See Smith v. Smith, 966 A.2d 109, 114 (R.I. 2009); Charlotte K. Goldberg, The Schemes of Adventuresses: The Abolition and Revival of Common-Law Marriage, 13 Wm. & Mary J. Women & L. 483, 488 n.51 (2007) (noting that Rhode Island was one of only nine states recognizing common-law marriage at the time of the article’s publication). Such a marriage “can be established by clear and convincing evidence that the parties seriously intended to enter into the husband-wife relationship * * * and that their conduct was of such a character as to lead to a belief in the community that they were married * * *.” Sardonis v. Sardonis, 106 R.I. 469, 472, 261 A.2d 22, 24 (1970). The requisite intent and belief may be demonstrated by “inference from cohabitation, declarations, reputation among kindred and friends, and other competent circumstantial evidence.” Id. Because intent of the parties is crucial in determining whether a common-law marriage exists, the conduct of the parties, even at a time when an impediment precludes the lawful existence of a common-law marriage, could be probative of the parties’ intent after the impediment is removed. We cannot say, therefore, that the trial justice abused her discretion by admitting the challenged evidence in the case under review.', '2. The Admission of the Envelopes and the Affidavit of Robert DelGiaguite', 'The city also argues that the trial justice erred in allowing the introduction of five envelopes addressed to variations of “Mrs. Constance Phillips” and the affidavit of Robert DelGiaguite because they constituted inadmissible hearsay.', '- 11 -', 'It is well settled “that this Court applies a deferential standard when reviewing a trial justice’s determination of the admissibility of evidence.” Accetta v. Provencal, 962 A.2d 56, 60 (R.I. 2009). “We will uphold the trial justice’s ruling unless the trial justice clearly has abused his or her discretion and the evidence was ‘both prejudicial and irrelevant.’” Id. (quoting State v. Merida, 960 A.2d 228, 234 (R.I. 2008)).', 'Rule 801(c) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence defines hearsay as “a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.” The envelopes were offered, not to prove that Constance was in fact “Mrs. Phillips,” but rather to prove that some members of the community addressed her by that name. When a statement is offered solely to show that the statement was made, not to prove the truth of the statement, then it need not be excluded under Rule 801. Advisory Committee’s Note to Rule 801(c); see also Wells v. Uvex Winter Optical, Inc., 635 A.2d 1188, 1193 (R.I. 1994) (“Statements not offered to prove the truth of what they assert are not hearsay and as such do not require the assistance of an exception to the hearsay rule in order to be admissible.”) (quoting In re Jean Marie W., 559 A.2d 625, 629 (R.I. 1989)). The photocopies of the envelopes were admitted properly into evidence because they were relevant simply to demonstrate that there was a belief among some members of the community that the parties were married, see Smith, 966 A.2d at 116; and, as such, they did not constitute hearsay under Rule 801. Accordingly, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion in admitting photocopies of the five envelopes offered to prove the community’s perception of Wilbur and Constance’s relationship.', 'Likewise, the affidavit of Robert DelGiaguite was properly admitted into evidence because it did not constitute hearsay under Rule 801. The affidavit was not offered to prove the', '- 12 - truth of the matter asserted, namely, that Constance’s name was a variation of “Mrs. Constance Phillips.” Instead, the affidavit was offered to prove that members of their community viewed them as a married couple. We are satisfied, therefore, that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion in permitting the introduction of the affidavit.', 'B', 'The Weight of the Evidence', 'The city next argues on appeal that the trial justice misconstrued the evidence in concluding that a common-law marriage existed between Constance and Wilbur at the time of his death. Specifically, the city argues that: (1) the trial justice overlooked the evidentiary weaknesses in Constance’s case; (2) the trial justice found a “family relationship” when she should have made a finding of a “husband-wife relationship” and was inappropriately “moved by the length of cohabitation and Mr. Phillips’ relationship with Ms. Fravala’s children and grand- children”; (3) the trial justice erroneously stated in her bench decision that Constance testified that people referred to Wilbur and Constance as husband and wife; and (4) Wilbur’s 2001 insurance membership application suggests that Wilbur did not believe that he and Constance were in a common-law marriage because he “was very careful to identify a year for the marriage and a maiden name.”', 'On appeal, a trial justice’s “decision granting or denying declaratory relief is reviewed with great deference by this Court.” Houde v. State, 973 A.2d 493, 498 (R.I. 2009) (quoting Providence Lodge No. 3, Fraternal Order of Police v. Providence External Review Authority, 951 A.2d 497, 502 (R.I. 2008)). “It is well-established that ‘the findings of fact of a trial justice, sitting without a jury, will be given great weight and will not be disturbed absent a showing that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.’” Id. (quoting Fleet National Bank v. 175 Post Road, LLC, 851 A.2d 267, 273 (R.I. 2004)).', '- 13 - Moreover, “the ‘resolution of mixed questions of law and fact, as well as the inferences and conclusions drawn from the testimony and evidence, are entitled to the same deference.’” Id. (quoting Narragansett Electric Co. v. Carbone, 898 A.2d 87, 97 (R.I. 2006)). “A trial justice’s findings on questions of law, however, are reviewed de novo.” Fleet National Bank, 851 A.2d at 273.', 'We have reviewed the record carefully, and we conclude that the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive material evidence or otherwise commit clear error. In her bench decision, the trial justice gave a detailed account of the evidence presented at trial, made findings about the weight she assigned the evidence, and applied the applicable law to her findings. Much of the evidence supporting the existence of a common-law marriage between Constance and Wilbur came from the testimony of Constance herself, and the trial justice clearly gave it great weight. The trial justice noted that “[w]hen this Court considers the credible testimony and demeanor of Constance * * * and the manner [in] which she described her relationship with Wilbur * * *, it is clearly convinced that she and Wilbur * * * intended to live together as husband and wife for over thirty-five years.” She further stated that “while * * * there could be a risk that Constance * * * is perverting the facts to achieve a financial gain in the way of a pension, the defense never suggests that[,] and her story and demeanor and credibility as a witness suggest[] to this Court otherwise.”', 'The trial justice found that Wilbur and Constance mutually intended to be husband and wife, specifically crediting Constance’s testimony about the nature of their thirty-five-year cohabitation, conduct, declarations, and reputation in the community. The trial justice found credible Constance’s testimony that the common-law marriage began when Wilbur and Constance moved in together and found that the couple had “cohabitated continuously with one', '- 14 - another as a married couple for over thirty-five years.” Significantly, the trial justice specifically found that Constance and Wilbur seriously intended to enter a husband-wife relationship from the inception of their relationship in 1969 and that such intent continued unabated after Lillian’s death in 1999.', 'She further found that “throughout [Wilbur and Constance’s] thirty-five years of being together they were never separated and not once did either party move out without the other party, nor did they go out with others in any kind of romantic relationship.” The couple, according to the trial justice’s findings, also “slept together and were intimate with each other to the exclusion of all others throughout their entire relationship.” She further found that although “no marriage ceremony took place formally, the parties were as committed to one another for over thirty-five years as they would have been were they formally married[,]” noting that their relationship was arguably “a stronger relationship than many married couples today or over the course of time.”', 'As to the couple’s finances, the trial justice found that, before 2000, Constance and Wilbur “pooled their finances and paid the utilities, rent and other bills from this pool.” After 2000, “they each had their own individual bank accounts and Wilbur * * * would pay the utilities and rent and [Constance] would pay for food expenses.” The trial justice found, however, that Constance and Wilbur had not maintained entirely separate finances after 2000, that they owned joint shares in a credit union, and that they were joint borrowers on a loan.', 'The trial justice further relied on documentary evidence presented at trial in concluding that the couple intended to be in a husband-wife relationship. She noted that the lease for the home in which Constance and Wilbur had cohabitated was cosigned by the couple and had no specified term. Furthermore, the trial justice stated that Wilbur named Constance as “his primary', '- 15 - beneficiary on his life insurance policy which confirms his intent to care and provide for her forever, even after his death.” She also highlighted that Wilbur listed Constance as his spouse on an insurance membership application in 2001, that both parties listed each other on important documents as emergency contacts, and that they were co-borrowers on loan applications.', 'Additionally, the trial justice found that there was “overwhelming evidence supporting the fact that the community recognized the parties to be in a husband-wife relationship for over thirty-five years.” She stated that “[f]riends acknowledge[d] that they knew Constance * * * and Wilbur * * * much of their thirty-five years together and always recognized them to be a married couple even up until” Wilbur’s death. The trial justice further concluded that the envelopes introduced at trial addressed to variations of “Mrs. Constance Phillips” were evidence that the community perceived them as a married couple.', 'It should be noted that the trial justice explicitly addressed the weaknesses of Constance’s case, noting, “it is true that this Court lacks documentary evidence that the parties filed joint tax returns, listed themselves as married on other major legal documents, paid their bills jointly or co-mingled finances * * *.” Furthermore, she noted that there was no evidence of whether Constance and Wilbur referred to themselves as husband and wife, and she highlighted that Wilbur’s death certificate listed Lillian as his wife.', 'There can be no doubt that the trial justice gave some weight to the familial relationship that Wilbur shared with Constance’s children and grandchildren and the length of time Wilbur and Constance cohabitated. However, we disagree that the trial justice erred in doing so. The trial justice found that Constance, Wilbur, and Constance’s children “acted together as parents and children as a family unit, headed by a mother and father and husband and wife, with the only difference being the absence of a church wedding or formal marriage ceremony.” The trial', '- 16 - justice also recounted the testimony of Constance’s grandson, Brandon, that he referred to Wilbur as “pop” or “dad,” that he introduced Wilbur and Constance as his grandparents, and that Wilbur referred to Brandon as his grandson. The trial justice found this persuasive evidence that the community perceived Wilbur and Constance as a married couple. Ultimately, the trial justice stated that Constance and Wilbur “could be considered poster people for a traditional married couple, albeit without a marriage license.”', 'Although not dispositive in proving the intent of the parties or belief in the community, these facts may be deemed relevant by a trial justice as circumstantial evidence tending to prove the elements necessary to establish a common-law marriage. See Smith, 966 A.2d at 114 (noting that the intent of the parties and belief in the community are “demonstrated by ‘inference from cohabitation, declarations, reputation among kindred and friends, and other competent circumstantial evidence’”) (quoting Sardonis, 106 R.I. at 472, 261 A.2d at 24). The existence of a common-law marriage vel non is intrinsically a fact-intensive inquiry. Here, we conclude that, given the deference that this Court accords to the trial justice’s inferences and conclusions drawn from the evidence and the trial justice’s extensive findings of fact, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive material evidence or otherwise commit clear error. 3', 'C', 'Prejudgment Interest', 'Constance contends in her appeal to this Court that the city breached its contract with both Local 1363 of the International Association of Fire Fighters and herself, as a beneficiary of 3', 'After making the aforementioned conclusions of fact and law concerning the current dispute, the trial justice made the following comment sua sponte: “The outdated doctrine of common-law marriage should be abrogated judicially with the rule being given prospective application only * * *.” This issue has been neither briefed nor argued on appeal, however; accordingly, we decline to consider the continued vitality of the doctrine of common-law marriage in the context of this case. Moreover, the decision to abrogate such a long-established common-law doctrine vel non is more appropriately addressed by the General Assembly.', '- 17 - the contract. Constance further contends that this Court repeatedly has held that prejudgment interest should be awarded, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 9-21-10(a), 4 when a municipality acts in a proprietary or enterprise capacity. The city responds that the parties stipulated to the dismissal of count 1 and count 2 of Constance’s complaint, seeking a writ of mandamus and a mandatory injunction sounding in breach of contract, thus allowing Constance to proceed only on her declaratory-judgment claim. The city argues that, because no breach-of-contract claim was at issue, Constance is not entitled to prejudgment interest under § 9-21-10.', 'Section 9-21-10(a) provides, in part, for prejudgment interest, “[i]n any civil action in which a verdict is rendered or a decision made for pecuniary damages * * *.” Because a determination of benefits is not an award of damages, § 9-21-10 does not apply; and a plaintiff, therefore, will not be entitled to interest. See Connelly v. Retirement Board of Providence, 633 A.2d 1352, 1352 (R.I. 1993) (mem.) (concluding that the award of accidental-disability benefits to plaintiff “was not an award of damages to which [§ 9-21-10] would apply”). But see North Smithfield Teachers Association v. North Smithfield School Committee, 461 A.2d 930, 934 (R.I. 1983) (noting that a municipality is subject to an award of prejudgment interest pursuant to § 9-21-10 when the underlying action is for breach of contract).', 'In the present case, Constance’s underlying action requested relief in the form of a declaratory judgment.

1,"Rhode Island Managed Eye Care, Inc. : v. : Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. This appeal and cross-appeal arise out of a breach-of-contract claim by the plaintiff, Rhode Island Managed Eye Care, Inc. (RIMEC), against the defendant, Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island (Blue Cross). The parties executed a series of contracts in which RIMEC agreed to provide managed-eye-care services to some of Blue Cross’s members, and payment by Blue Cross was to be based on the number of active members enrolled in the program. In its complaint, RIMEC primarily alleged that it did not receive payment for all of the Blue Cross members for whom it provided services. Following a lengthy trial, a jury rendered a verdict in favor of RIMEC. In response to a motion by the defendant, the trial justice granted a new trial as to lost profits, finding the jury’s verdict in this regard to be against the weight of the evidence. The plaintiff appealed this decision, and the defendant cross-appealed, challenging the admittance of certain business records into evidence. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'Blue Cross is a not-for-profit corporation that contracts with physicians, hospitals and laboratories to provide prepaid healthcare plans, under which members receive medical services at specified rates and charges. RIMEC is a corporation that was formed by Peter A. Koch to be a third-party administrator of vision-care services for customers of health insurance providers such as Blue Cross. 1 In 1993, the parties entered into the first of three contracts in which RIMEC agreed to provide vision-care services to Blue Cross’s “Healthmate 2000” subscribers. The contracts provided that Blue Cross would pay RIMEC a predetermined, per-member fee for all services, referred to as a “capitation fee.”', 'In the beginning of the parties’ relationship, RIMEC developed original software called a “membership processing system.” This computer software accepted downloads from Blue Cross containing basic subscriber information, such as names, addresses, phone numbers, and dates of coverage.', 'Using that system, RIMEC generated so-called “membership data reports” that ostensibly recorded all active members of Healthmate 2000 during a given reporting period. Twenty of these “membership data reports” were admitted into evidence at trial, and their admission is at issue on appeal.', 'RIMEC’s third and final contract with Blue Cross was, by its terms, set to expire on January 31, 1998. Blue Cross terminated the contract, allegedly for cause, three months early on October 31, 1997. Blue Cross contends it was not satisfied with RIMEC’s performance of the contract. RIMEC counters that Blue Cross did not have cause and that, therefore, the termination constituted a breach of contract. 1', 'Although RIMEC is still in existence, Mr. Koch testified that it currently is inactive.', '-2-', 'The plaintiff filed a complaint on January 7, 1998, alleging breach of contract. The case was tried before a jury from July 23, 2007, to August 8, 2007. The trial justice declined to preclude, in limine, introduction of the disputed computer printouts into evidence. Thereafter at trial, following the testimony of Mr. Koch and another witness, the trial justice admitted the documents as full exhibits.', 'Mr. Koch testified about the relationship between plaintiff and defendant, as well as regarding RIMEC’s computer system. Mr. Koch conceded that he did not program computers, and he admitted generally that he was not a “computer guy.”', 'As a result, Mr. Koch acknowledged that he needed experts to help him manage the large amount of data required to run his business.', 'Mr. Koch described the creation and management of the company’s computer system as a “team effort.” Mr. Koch testified that Rosemary Ferreira was the administrator of RIMEC and ran the day-to-day operations, while Diane Field specifically managed the computer system. Further, he testified that he initially hired a full-time employee to develop the software, but the employee left after the software was “up and running[.]” According to Mr. Koch, for the next year and a half, the software was maintained by Lauren Knapp, another full-time employee. After that time, a part-time programmer was brought in on occasion, as needed.', 'Mr. Koch also testified that, at times over the course of their contractual relationship, RIMEC’s “computer people” met with Blue Cross’s “computer people.” Specifically, Mr. Koch stated that he and his “computer people” met with Blue Cross employees during the first few months of the parties’ business relationship, and that “all the computer people worked together to try to get [the companies’ systems] compatible.” Mr. Koch acknowledged that he did not personally test RIMEC’s software to make sure it was compatible with Blue Cross’s data files,', '-3- but he stated that he did have personal knowledge of the effort to make the systems compatible because he attended the relevant meetings.', 'Once the computer system was functional, Mr. Koch testified, the system was “beta tested.” He described beta-testing as making sure a computer system performs its tasks correctly by downloading sample data. Mr. Koch acknowledged that RIMEC did not use any data files from Blue Cross during the beta-testing process.', 'Mr. Koch stated that he had personal knowledge of how the membership data reports were generated and how they were used by RIMEC.', 'According to Mr. Koch, RIMEC’s computer system contained an accounting module that enabled RIMEC to count the number of Healthmate 2000 subscribers. Mr. Koch testified that the membership data reports generated by RIMEC recorded the number of active subscribers, as gleaned from the information downloaded from Blue Cross. Mr. Koch explained the contents of the membership data reports, line by line.', 'Mr. Koch also testified about how the software recognized Blue Cross members who were not Healthmate 2000 subscribers. Specifically, Mr. Koch stated that the beginning date and end date of coverage were recorded as the same day, and therefore the member would not be included in the active subscriber count.', 'Mr. Koch testified that, at times, RIMEC made adjustments to the membership data upon learning that an individual or group had been added or dropped from membership.', 'Mr. Koch explained that for the first six or seven months of the parties’ relationship, Blue Cross would give RIMEC “big reel[s] of data” containing information about their subscribers on a monthly basis. After these initial months, Blue Cross developed an “FTP” or “file transfer protocol” which, as Mr. Koch described it, involved Blue Cross depositing information in a', '-4- computer database that RIMEC could access and download remotely over telephone lines. Mr. Koch recounted that he personally observed some of Blue Cross’s downloads being received.', 'Mr. Koch testified that the reports were made in the regular course of business, and that the reports were generated on the “run-date” indicated on each report. He acknowledged, however, that RIMEC did not preserve all the records and data files that contained the member information received from Blue Cross, believing that the missing records and data files had been inadvertently lost or destroyed.', 'Additionally, Allan MacArthur, a former employee of Blue Cross who was trained in computer analysis and programming, also testified about RIMEC’s software.', 'In order to complete a report for Blue Cross, Mr. MacArthur analyzed the functioning of the software RIMEC used to produce the Healthmate 2000 membership counts.', 'The document Mr. MacArthur created was entitled “RIMEC Analysis” and was dated June 23, 1997.', 'Mr. MacArthur testified that in terms of the way the computer program was structured he “didn’t see any real problems.” Further, in this report, Mr. MacArthur described the process by which RIMEC downloaded member information from Blue Cross, and stated that he believed “RIMEC [was] calculating members accurately * * *.” Following Mr. MacArthur’s testimony, the trial justice admitted the documents as exhibits in full. 2', 'Kimberly Booth testified on behalf of RIMEC in regard to its claim for lost profits. Ms. Booth stated that RIMEC’s net income for 1997 was $68,981, as reported on its tax return for that year. This figure derived from its gross receipts in 1997 of $2,154,912, also as reported on its tax return. For purposes of her analysis, Ms. Booth added to the net profit two sums which, in 2', 'Two other former RIMEC employees, Ms. Field and Ms. Ferreira, also testified about RIMEC’s computer system and the disputed documents. We will not recount their testimony because both women testified after the trial justice ruled on the admissibility of the documents.', '-5- her opinion, reflected the amounts RIMEC was underpaid by Blue Cross in 1997: $21,316.65 and $44,483.92. This resulted in an adjusted net income for 1997 of $134,781.57. Because Blue Cross terminated the contract ten months into 1997, she divided this sum by ten to arrive at a monthly net profit of approximately $13,478.16. She multiplied this amount by three to reflect the three-month period by which the contract was shortened, and arrived at an estimated lost- profits calculation of $40,434.48.', 'The jury ultimately rendered a verdict in plaintiff’s favor for the sum of $152,100.42, which included the $40,434.48 lost-profit figure suggested by Ms. Booth. Final judgment for plaintiff was entered on August 28, 2007.', 'Subsequently, on January 29, 2008, the Superior Court considered motions filed by Blue Cross for judgment as a matter of law and a motion for a new trial. In its motion for a new trial, Blue Cross renewed its objection to the admission of the disputed printouts, and it challenged the jury’s verdict as being against the weight of the credible evidence put forth at trial. The trial justice denied that portion of Blue Cross’s motion that challenged the admission of evidence, but ordered a new trial on the issue of lost profits unless RIMEC accepted a remittitur in the amount of $40,434.48, concluding that the jury’s award, in this regard, was against the weight of the evidence. Cross-appeals ensued.', 'II', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Admission of Hearsay Business Records', 'RIMEC contends it was owed monthly “capitation payments” from Blue Cross. Monthly capitation payments were supposed to have been based on the number of Blue Cross members', '-6- eligible for RIMEC’s services. RIMEC’s primary evidence of the alleged payment discrepancy were twenty of its membership data reports. Blue Cross alleges that these documents were not business records subject to the business-records exception to the hearsay rule and that circumstantial evidence casts doubt on their authenticity.', 'Moreover, Blue Cross suggests, contrary to Mr. Koch’s testimony, that the missing data files and membership data reports may not have been inadvertently lost or destroyed.', 'Rule 803(6) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence is colloquially known as the “business-records exception” to the hearsay rule.', '“The business-records exception * * * is premised on the unusual reliability of records supplied by systematic checking and on a business’s reliance on the precision of records created through regular habits.” Fondedile, S.A. v. C.E. Maguire, Inc., 610 A.2d 87, 94 (R.I. 1992). Rule 803(6) provides that to be admissible a business record must be “made at or near the time [of the act, event, condition, opinion, or diagnosis at issue] by, or from information transmitted by, another person with knowledge * * *.” Further, the rule requires that the record have been “kept in the course of a regularly conducted business activity,” which must be “shown by the testimony of the custodian or other qualified witness.”', 'However, the rule also provides that a business record should not be admitted if “the source of information or the method or circumstances of preparation indicate lack of trustworthiness.” Id.', 'Over time, “[t]he scope of records included within the exception has grown, and in general the rule is interpreted expansively in favor of admitting hearsay records into evidence.” Fondedile S.A., 610 A.2d at 94. Thus, “[i]n most situations a trial justice should interpret foundation requirements in favor of admitting records and thereafter let the trier of fact determine the evidence’s probative value.” Id.', '-7-', 'We have enunciated a four-part test, based on the rule, for the admissibility of a hearsay business record:', '“First, the record must be regularly maintained in the course of a', 'regularly conducted business activity. Second, the source of the', 'information must be a person with knowledge. Third, the', 'information must be recorded contemporaneously with the event or', 'occurrence, and fourth, the party introducing the record must', 'provide adequate foundation testimony.” Fondedile S.A., 610 A.2d', 'at 93-94. In order “[t]o provide [an] adequate foundation a party must prove the first three requirements and authenticate the document or record.” Id. at 94.', 'Rule 901 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence addresses the authentication of evidence. “In making Rule 901 determinations, trial justices must decide whether there is enough support in the record to conclude that it is ‘reasonably probable’ that the evidence is what the offeror [pro]claims it to be.” State v. Oliveira, 774 A.2d 893, 926 (R.I. 2001) (quoting State v. Griffin, 691 A.2d 556, 558 (R.I. 1997)). “If so, then the evidence’s [per]suasive force is for the jury to decide.” Id.', 'Under Rule 901, a document’s authenticity may be established in any number of different ways. Rule 901(b)(1) provides “[b]y way of illustration only, and not by way of limitation,” that the rule will be satisfied if a witness with knowledge testifies that “a matter is what it is claimed to be.” In State v. Calenda, 787 A.2d 1195 (R.I. 2002), we addressed the authentication of a computer printout as a business record. In that case we explained that, “[e]ssentially, a person who is knowledgeable about the preparation of records and their use in the course of the business is capable of identifying them sufficiently to satisfy the prerequisite for their admission as business records.” Id. at 1200. Further, the party who authenticates the document need not be the', '-8- custodian of the records to lay an adequate foundation, and foundation testimony may be supplied by more than one witness. See id. 3', '1. Admissibility under Rule 803(6)', 'Blue Cross does not dispute that the documents reflect a record made at or near the time of the so-called “run date” or that RIMEC kept such records in the course of its regularly conducted business activities. Thus, Blue Cross’s argument that the printouts did not satisfy Rule 803(6) is based solely on its contention that the documents lacked circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness.', 'Blue Cross contends that no evidence was presented of RIMEC’s use of or reliance on the documents and that because it does not appear that the documents were disseminated widely, there could be no assumption that inaccuracies contained in them would have been detected and cured. Further, Blue Cross argues that no evidence was presented to suggest that RIMEC’s software ever was “calibrated or otherwise coordinated to assure that it was compatible with Blue Cross’s data files.” Additionally, Blue Cross points to the fact that these printouts comprise an incomplete record; Mr. Koch testified that one such report was created each month over the course of the parties’ five-year relationship, yet RIMEC produced only twenty of the more recent reports. Finally, Blue Cross draws attention to some mathematical errors in the documents themselves.', 'Rule 803(6) provides that a business record should not be admitted if “the source of information or the method or circumstances of preparation indicate lack of trustworthiness.” 3', 'For example, we determined in State v. Calenda, 787 A.2d 1195, 1200 (R.I. 2002), that the trial justice did not err in admitting computer printouts when a party testified that such records were created by one of his employees, that the printout was a record kept in the normal course of his business, and when, additionally, evidence was provided by another witness about the time when the document was created.', '-9- However, a determination of whether an out-of-court statement meets an exception to the hearsay rule is within the trial justice’s discretion. See Ferrell v. Wall, 889 A.2d 177, 188 (R.I. 2005). We will not overturn a trial justice’s decision in this regard unless it was an abuse of discretion. Id. In the case at bar, we are convinced that there was evidence from which the trial justice could have concluded that the documents carried circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness, and, thus, he did not abuse his discretion.', 'It should be noted that RIMEC necessarily relied on the accuracy of its computer system in performing the contract at issue. In order to determine who was eligible for the services RIMEC provided, employees of RIMEC regularly consulted the computer system that created the membership data reports, and there is no indication by Blue Cross that RIMEC made services available for individuals who were not Healthcare 2000 subscribers.', 'The business-records exception is partially “premised on the unusual reliability of records supplied by * * * a business’s reliance on the precision of records created through regular habits.” Fondedile S.A., 610 A.2d at 94.', 'Further, a party does not need to prove that business records are entirely accurate before they are admitted as evidence. See United States v. McGill, 953 F.2d 10, 15 (1st Cir. 1992). 4 “The mere fact that errors or deviations have occurred from time to time does not destroy the inference of underlying trustworthiness which a judge may choose to draw from proof of a general practice.” Id. If this were not so, “the rule would be swallowed up by an exception for less-than-perfect business practices.” United States v. Patterson, 644 F.2d 890, 901 (1st Cir. 1981). Thus, “[a]ny question as to the accuracy of the printouts, whether resulting from incorrect data entry or the operation of the computer program, as with inaccuracies in any other type of 4', 'Rule 803(6) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence is modeled after Rule 803(6) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, and the rules are substantially similar.', '- 10 - business record, would have affected only the weight of the printouts, not their admissibility.” U.S. v. Catabran, 836 F.2d 453, 458 (9th Cir. 1988). Blue Cross was permitted to question the accuracy of the printouts on cross-examination, and it did so. We also note that, in light of Mr. Koch’s testimony that some of the membership data reports were accidentally destroyed or lost, the jury was given an instruction concerning spoliation of evidence. The jury nonetheless rendered a verdict in favor of RIMEC, and the trial justice did not disagree with its verdict except in regard to the amount of lost profits awarded.', 'Additionally, contrary to Blue Cross’s contention, there was evidence that RIMEC’s software was “calibrated or otherwise coordinated to assure that it was compatible with Blue Cross’s data files.” In fact, testimony was provided that Blue Cross employees participated in the process of making RIMEC’s system compatible with Blue Cross’s data. Specifically, Mr. Koch testified that employees of both RIMEC and Blue Cross had meetings during the first few months of RIMEC’s operation to ensure that the companies’ systems were compatible. Finally, it should be emphasized that Blue Cross’s own former employee, Mr. MacArthur, determined that RIMEC’s member counts were being computed accurately. 5', 'Generally, under the rule, a trial justice should err on the side of admitting records and thereby allow the jury to assess the evidence’s probative value. Fondedile S.A., 610 A.2d at 94. We find no abuse of discretion in the trial justice’s ruling. Therefore, we affirm the trial justice’s decision to admit the printouts under Rule 803(6).', '2. Admissibility under Rule 901', 'Blue Cross also asserts that the printouts were not properly authenticated under Rule 901. As stated above, Rule 901(a) provides that the authentication requirement “is satisfied by 5', 'Blue Cross calls into question the validity of Mr. MacArthur’s analysis, but we find its arguments unconvincing given that Blue Cross commissioned him for that very purpose.', '- 11 - evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.” This may be shown by the testimony of a witness with knowledge, but it need not be; Rule 901(b) provides examples of authentication that conform with the rule “[b]y way of illustration only, and not by way of limitation.”', 'Blue Cross does not dispute that the documents are “membership data reports” as RIMEC (the proponent) claims, but rather it urges us to apply a heightened Rule 901 standard because the printouts were generated from proprietary software. Blue Cross cites Rule 901(b)(9) for the proposition that RIMEC was required to demonstrate that its computer program produced accurate results. Rule 901(b)(9), however, provides only that a document may be authenticated through “[e]vidence describing a process or system used to produce a result and showing that the process or system produces an accurate result.” Thus, under the plain language of the rule, the trial justice was under no obligation to require such a showing.', 'Blue Cross also cites other non-controlling authority suggesting that in some circumstances computer-related business records may require a heightened showing by the proponent to be properly authenticated. Blue Cross contends in its brief that “[t]he standard applicable to the ruling below is * * * whether RIMEC produced any evidence that the exhibits emanated from a process that reliably produced accurate results.” Further, Blue Cross argues that RIMEC did not submit any evidence “that relat[ed] to the manner in which its computer software operated, or suggest[ed] that its operation produced accurate results[,]” and that therefore Rule 901 was not satisfied. Blue Cross contends “there must be ‘testimony by a person with some degree of computer expertise, who has sufficient knowledge to be examined and cross-examined about the functioning of the computer.’” As such, Blue Cross maintains that the authentication requirement could have been satisfied only by the testimony of a qualified', '- 12 - computer programmer who was familiar with the RIMEC program and could attest, based on personal investigation, that it produced accurate results.', 'Even if we were to accept Blue Cross’s contention that a heightened standard for the authentication of documents such as those at issue in the instant case should apply, we are nevertheless satisfied that RIMEC did present evidence from which the trial justice could have concluded that the printouts satisfied their proposed Rule 901 standard. As discussed above, multiple witnesses testified about the manner in which the computer system operated, and there was evidence to suggest that the computer system generally was producing accurate results. Most notably, Blue Cross’s former employee, Mr. MacArthur, who was trained in computer analysis and programming, evaluated RIMEC’s computer system and concluded that it produced accurate results. Mr. MacArthur was available, as were other witnesses, to be examined and cross-examined about the functioning of the computer program. Thus, we find Blue Cross’s argument to be unavailing.', 'The trial justice did not abuse his discretion in admitting the documents into evidence at trial. 6', 'B', 'Blue Cross’s Motion for a New Trial Concerning Lost Profits', 'RIMEC maintains on appeal that the Superior Court erred in granting that portion of Blue Cross’s motion for a new trial based on the jury’s award of $40,434.48 for lost profits. The trial 6', 'Blue Cross also argues that the Superior Court erred by conflating the “trustworthiness” analysis under Rule 803(6) and the authenticity analysis under Rule 901 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, specifically citing the trial justice’s statement that “the [Rule] 901 requirement partakes to a very great extent the trustworthiness element found in [Rule] 803(6), and this Court is satisfied that at least the minimum requirements for admission of these records here has been established.” We are satisfied, however, that the trial justice adequately considered the requirements of each rule in ruling on the admissibility of the documents.', '- 13 - court ordered a new trial on that issue alone, unless RIMEC accepted a remittitur of the full amount awarded for lost profits.', 'As previously stated, RIMEC’s final contract with Blue Cross was set to expire on January 31, 1998. Because Blue Cross terminated the contract on October 31, 1997, RIMEC sought a damage award for the three-month period by which the contract term was shortened. Ms. Booth was the primary witness to testify about RIMEC’s claim for lost profits.', '“One of the best ways of establishing reasonably certain future lost profits * * * is to use the operational history of the enterprise * * * or a representative portion thereof * * *.” UST Corp. v. General Road Trucking Corp., 783 A.2d 931, 942 (R.I. 2001). Lost profits are a function of two variables: “(1) the dollar value of the contracts diverted” from the plaintiff, and (2) the plaintiff’s “profit margins if it had obtained or maintained” the relevant contract. Long v. Atlantic PBS, Inc., 681 A.2d 249, 252 (R.I. 1996). This is consistent with the basic precept of contract law that courts should award “such measures of damage as will serve to put the injured party as close as is reasonably possible to the position he would have been in had the contract been fully performed.” George v. George F. Berkander, Inc., 92 R.I. 426, 430, 169 A.2d 370, 372 (1961). All damages for lost profits must be established with reasonable certainty, although actual certainty is, logically, not required for recovery of future lost profits. Guzman v. Jan-Pro Cleaning Systems, Inc., 839 A.2d 504, 508 (R.I. 2003); Abbey Medical/Abbey Rents, Inc. v. Mignacca, 471 A.2d 189, 195 (R.I. 1984).', 'Ms. Booth’s lost-profit calculation was a fairly straightforward projection based on RIMEC’s 1997 federal tax return. Blue Cross does not seem to fault her general methodology. However, on cross-examination, Blue Cross exposed an error in Ms. Booth’s analysis.', '- 14 -', 'As explained previously, Ms. Booth’s analysis began with RIMEC’s net income for 1997 of $68,981. It was her assumption that this number was based exclusively on the net receipts from Blue Cross for January 1997 through October 1997. Ms. Booth acknowledged that if some income included in that amount was attributable to another period, it would render her projection inaccurate.', 'Mr. Koch testified that RIMEC’s gross revenue for 1997 included a reconciliation payment of $223,003, paid by Blue Cross in 1998, 7 for past underpayments of monthly capitation fees. 8 This reconciliation payment reflected amounts due for all five years Blue Cross and RIMEC did business together. Specifically, $51,127.99 was attributable to underpayment for services in 1993, $22,806.83 was attributable to 1994, $57,849.72 was attributable to 1995, and $27,189.02 was attributable to 1996. Only $64,029.38 was attributable to work RIMEC performed in 1997. Stated differently, $158,973.56 was unrelated to RIMEC’s operations in 1997. If RIMEC’s net profit had been adjusted to reflect this figure, RIMEC actually would have reported a net loss of $89,992.56 in 1997.', 'RIMEC’s argues that the jury was entitled to base its decision on Ms. Booth’s calculation of lost profits despite this error because mathematical certainty is not required when projecting future damages.', 'RIMEC points out that Ms. Booth’s estimate was a figure based on a representative portion of RIMEC’s operational history, which is a valid basis for predicting lost profits. Further, RIMEC contends assumptions were required and Ms. Booth’s opinion rested upon reasonable assumptions.', 'RIMEC also contends that because Blue Cross’s wrongful conduct rendered the ascertainment of the precise damages suffered by RIMEC difficult, Blue 7', 'Mr. Koch testified that RIMEC filed its income tax returns on an accrual basis. 8', 'The reconciliation payment corrected a problem unrelated to this litigation.', '- 15 - Cross should not be entitled to complain that RIMEC’s damages were not measured as precisely as they otherwise could have been.', '“[W]e accord great weight to a trial justice’s decision on a motion for a new trial.” Oliveira v.

The defendant, Gabriel Moreno, appeals from his conviction by a jury in the Providence County Superior Court of the following offenses: kidnapping, felony assault, two counts of simple assault, and interference with the use of a telephone in an emergency.', 'This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After examining the written and oral submissions of the parties, we are of the opinion that the appeal may be resolved without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court in all respects.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The allegations of the complaining witness, Danielle Brueske, formed the basis of the charges against defendant, and she served as one of the prosecution’s primary witnesses at defendant’s trial. We therefore begin by summarizing the most relevant portions of her trial testimony.', '-1-', 'A', 'The Relevant Occurrences Prior to July 26, 2006', 'Danielle Brueske testified that she had met defendant while she was attending Diman School of Practical Nursing, which is located in southeastern Massachusetts. (She attended that school from September of 2005 through June of 2006.) She testified that defendant was a coordinator of the nursing program at the school and that he was also her instructor in some of her courses.', 'Ms. Brueske further testified that, beginning on July 4, 2006, after she had completed nursing school, she and defendant began “seeing each other” and that their relationship quickly became sexual in nature.', 'Ms. Brueske testified that she had stayed at defendant’s home in East Providence during the week prior to her taking the nursing board exams (which took place on July 16, 2006). However, unbeknownst to defendant, immediately thereafter, on July 17, Ms. Brueske resumed living with her boyfriend, one Jarret Ferreira, who decided at that time to ask Ms. Brueske to marry him—a proposal which Ms. Brueske accepted. Ms. Brueske characterized her relationship with her fiancé prior to their engagement as having been “pretty rocky.” Moreover, she testified that she did not tell either her fiancé or defendant about the existence of the other.1 She did testify, however, that, in the days immediately following her engagement to Mr. Ferreira, she told defendant not to contact her.', 'On July 23, less than a week after they had become engaged, Ms. Brueske and her fiancé argued, and she again went to stay with defendant. She contended that, at this point in time, defendant confronted her, stating that he knew she was “lying.” It was her testimony, however, 1', 'Ms. Brueske admitted during her testimony at trial that she was engaged in a sexual relationship with both defendant and her fiancé during July of 2006.', '-2- that she still did not tell defendant that she was engaged to another man. Nevertheless, according to Ms. Brueske’s testimony, the July 23 confrontation between defendant and her escalated to the point that defendant became physical; she testified that he “pinned [her] up against the wall” and then “pinned [her] on the bed,” not letting her up.', 'Ms. Brueske testified that, on July 25, after she had argued with Lynn Saucier,2 a friend who had also been a classmate of hers at Diman School of Practical Nursing (and who also knew defendant through the nursing school), she went to defendant’s home. Ms. Brueske further testified that, when defendant came home later that day, he informed her that he knew that she was engaged to another man, and he stated that he had “spoken with Lynn.” Ms. Brueske testified that she then informed defendant that things between her and her fiancé “weren’t going well.”', 'Ms. Brueske testified that, on that same day (July 25), she told defendant that she was going to her grandmother’s house; she further testified, however, that in actuality she met up with a male friend, to whom she referred simply as “Doyle” in her testimony, and that she went to the movies with him. Ms. Brueske testified that she considered the outing with Doyle to have been a date. She went on to testify that, after going to the movies together, she and Doyle engaged in sexual relations in the back seat of his car.', 'Ms. Brueske testified that, after the late evening date with Doyle, she returned to defendant’s home at approximately 2:00 a.m. on July 26. She testified that, during her absence, defendant had called and sent text messages to her cell phone some twenty times. Ms. Brueske further testified that defendant was waiting for her when she arrived at his home; she stated that 2', 'In the course of the referenced argument, Lynn Saucier accused Danielle Brueske of telling people that Ms. Saucier’s husband was “hitting on” her (i.e., Ms. Brueske). Ms. Brueske testified that, as the argument came to a close, Ms. Saucier told her that their “friendship was over.”', '-3- he said that he knew that she had not gone to her grandmother’s house and that he asked her where in fact she had gone. Ms. Brueske testified that she told him that she had gone to a beach for the purpose of thinking; she added that she did not inform him that she had been out on a date with someone else that night. Ms. Brueske stated that, after that discussion, she and defendant went to bed.', 'B', 'The Events of July 26, 2006', 'Danielle Brueske testified that defendant left for work at approximately 8:30 a.m. on July 26 and that, after he left, she was unable to locate her cell phone. She further testified that, to her surprise, defendant returned home at 9:30 a.m. and that, upon his return, he told her that he had left work “because he couldn’t be without [her].” She stated that defendant told her that “he knew [she] was lying” about where she had been and that he had taken her cell phone to work. Ms. Brueske testified that their conversation began in the computer room of defendant’s home, but that defendant “started pushing [her] back towards his bedroom.” She testified that, once in the bedroom, he “pushed [her] back onto his bed.” She stated that at that moment she was clothed only in a towel due to the fact that she had just taken a shower.', 'Ms. Brueske testified that defendant “held [her] wrists down onto the mattress” and that he told her that she “was killing him.” She estimated that defendant held her on the bed for approximately fifteen minutes until he decided to leave the bedroom. Ms. Brueske testified that she next encountered defendant in the laundry room, where she had gone in order to retrieve her clothes; she said that she discovered defendant sitting on the floor of the laundry room holding a butcher knife to his wrist.', '-4-', 'Ms. Brueske testified that defendant followed her back into the bedroom and that she attempted to keep him out by shutting the door; however, defendant was able to force his way into the bedroom. She further testified that, at that point, defendant informed her that she “wouldn’t be leaving that day.” Ms. Bruseke testified that, as she tried to use defendant’s phone to call for assistance, he grabbed the phone out of her hands and removed the battery. She stated that she next attempted to “get to the window” and to scream for help but that defendant prevented her from doing so.3 She testified that she fled from the bedroom into the living room but that defendant proceeded to drag her from the living room into the hallway. Ms. Brueske then described the struggle with defendant that took place in the hallway; she said that defendant placed her in a chokehold, causing her to lose consciousness. She further testified that, while defendant was dragging her back to the bedroom and while she continued to resist him, he applied another chokehold, and she passed out for a second time.', 'Ms. Brueske testified that, when she regained consciousness, she found herself in the bedroom; she described defendant as being “very angry” at that point.', 'She testified that defendant told her that she was “dead inside and that he was going to take [her] physical life from [her].” Ms. Brueske described how defendant proceeded to use duct tape to bind her wrists and her ankles. She stated that defendant then used the duct tape to attach her hands to the bedpost and her feet to the footboard.', 'Ms. Brueske further testified that defendant held a pair of scissors to her chest and stated that he was going to “take [her] heart out because [she] didn’t know how to use it;” she testified that defendant then pushed the scissors down onto her chest, cutting her skin. She testified that defendant placed a piece of duct tape over her mouth and then, again using a chokehold, caused 3', 'Ms. Brueske testified that, at some point prior to her attempt to seek help at the window, defendant allowed her to put on her clothing.', '-5- her to pass out a third time. She further testified that, when she awoke, defendant told her that he had killed her and that she was “reborn.” Ms. Brueske stated that, using the same scissors with which he had cut her chest, defendant now cut the duct tape from her wrists—releasing her hands and injuring her wrists in the process. She stated that she herself then removed the duct tape from her ankles. She described how defendant then drank a soda, which he stated had “some medication in it;” she said that he told her that “he was going to drink it and lay [sic] down until he died.”', 'Ms. Brueske testified that, later that afternoon, defendant received a phone call from Lynn Saucier. Ms. Brueske stated that defendant kept his left arm extended across her neck while he was on the phone with Ms. Saucier; she added that, during that phone call, she “made a sound or [she] might have said something, and he looked at [her] and he pushed on [her] neck.”', 'Ms. Brueske stated that, after engaging in the above-referenced phone conversation with Lynn Saucier, defendant allowed her (i.e., Ms. Brueske) to use his phone to call her father. She testified that, after that phone call ended, she continued to talk to defendant and that she asked him to allow her to leave so that she could go to her godmother’s house; she added that defendant eventually allowed her to do so. Ms. Brueske testified that she left defendant’s home at approximately 4:00 p.m. and drove to the Dartmouth barracks of the Massachusetts State Police. (She testified that she went there because she did not know the location of any police station in Rhode Island.)', 'Ms. Brueske testified that she wrote out a statement at the police station in Dartmouth and that soon thereafter detectives from the East Providence Police Department arrived and took her to the East Providence police station. She testified that she identified defendant’s home for the East Providence police and that they took a statement from her and photographed her', '-6- injuries. The defendant was arrested by the East Providence police at approximately 9:00 p.m. on July 26, 2006.', 'The defendant was charged by criminal information with one count of kidnapping; one count of felony assault (choking with hands); one count of felony assault (the attack with the scissors); one count of simple assault; and one count of interference with the use of a telephone in an emergency.4', 'A jury trial was held in the Providence County Superior Court from September 12 through September 14 and from September 17 through September 18, 2007. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury found defendant guilty of one count of kidnapping, one count of felony assault, two counts of simple assault,5 and one count of interference with the use of a telephone in an emergency.', 'On September 28, 2007, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial. On November 20, 2007, defendant was sentenced to two concurrent sentences of twenty years imprisonment at the Adult Correctional Institutions, with four years to serve, sixteen years suspended, with sixteen years probation, on the kidnapping and felony assault convictions.

As a result, defendant was actually convicted of two counts of simple assault and one count of felony assault (viz., the attack with the scissors).', '-7- conviction for interference with the use of a telephone in an emergency. The defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'The defendant raises three issues on appeal, all of which center around the exclusion by the trial justice of certain testimony which defense witness Lynn Saucier was prepared to give.6 The defendant contends that the trial justice erred in excluding: (1) testimony by Ms. Saucier with respect to Danielle Brueske’s reputation for untruthfulness in the community; (2) testimony by Ms. Saucier that defendant contends would have impeached earlier testimony by Ms. Brueske, in which she denied having told Ms. Saucier that she was involved in “kinky sex” and also that her fiancé (Jarret Ferreira) “beat her;” and (3) testimony by Ms. Saucier concerning the relationship between Ms. Brueske and Doyle.', 'III', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court has frequently stated that “questions as to the admissibility vel non of evidence are confided to the sound discretion of the trial justice * * *.” State v.

She further testified that they both knew each other’s friends. Ms. Saucier testified that she used to see Ms. Brueske “at least daily;” however, she added that they had not spoken to one another since July 26, 2006.8', 'Ms. Saucier testified that she learned of Ms. Brueske’s reputation as to truthfulness through “[s]ituations that [she had] experienced personally with [Ms. Brueske] as well as conversations held with other classmates that may have gone to high school with [Ms. Brueske] or people that [Ms. Saucier has] worked with in the nursing field.” Ms. Saucier testified that Ms. Brueske’s reputation within that community is that “she is not truthful, that she basically lies about everything.”', 'After hearing Ms. Saucier’s voir dire testimony, the trial justice ruled that her testimony fell “far below the standard of the rule.”', 'The trial justice held that there was an insufficient showing of a proper foundation for Ms. Saucier to testify as to Ms. Brueske’s reputation for truthfulness within the community. The trial justice therefore excluded Ms. Saucier’s testimony as to “her or anybody else’s knowledge of the reputation of the complaining witness in this case.”', 'Rule 608(a) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence reads as follows:', '“The credibility of a witness may be attacked or supported by', 'evidence in the form of opinion or reputation, but subject to these', 'limitations: (1) the evidence may refer only to character for', 'truthfulness or untruthfulness, and (2) evidence of truthful', 'character is admissible only after the character of the witness for', 'truthfulness has been attacked by opinion or reputation evidence or', 'otherwise.” 8', 'Both Lynn Saucier and Danielle Brueske testified that they spoke to one another by telephone on the evening of July 26, 2006, after the alleged offenses had been committed.

Cote, 691 A.2d 537, 540 (R.I. 1997).

Oliver, 492 F.2d 943, 946 (8th Cir. 1974) (“[C]ourts have readily extended the concept of community to include the community in which one works, as well as where one lives.”); Dynes v.

And we have clarified the just-quoted principle as follows: “Testimony concerning a witness’s reputation for truthfulness as of any time before trial is admissible if the trial justice determines the evidence not too remote to be significant.” Cote, 691 A.2d at 541 (some emphasis added).', 'We have required the party seeking to admit reputational evidence “to establish a foundation for the admissibility of reputation evidence” either by means of an offer of proof or by requesting a voir dire examination. Cote, 691 A.2d at 541. We have also stated that the burden is on “the proponent of the evidence to satisfy the requirements of knowledge of the [witness’s] reputation in the community, the timeliness of that knowledge and its proximity to the time of trial.” Id. We note that a party seeking to admit evidence of a witness’s reputation within the community for untruthfulness need not elicit from the proffered witness specific instances of untruthfulness. See Oliver, 492 F.2d at 947 (stating that “[s]pecific incidents may only be inquired into on cross-examination of a witness testifying as to character for truthfulness” and holding that it was improper for counsel to inquire as to specific incidents when laying a foundation for reputation testimony during voir dire). Although the above- summarized criteria are somewhat demanding, we have nonetheless “acknowledged the competency of negative-reputation evidence when the character witness is sufficiently familiar with [the challenged witness’s] residence or circle of acquaintances.” See Cote, 691 A.2d at 541.', 'The defendant contends that the proposed testimony by Ms. Saucier was “well within the confines of Rule 608 and should have been allowed.” The defendant further contends that he was particularly prejudiced by the exclusion of such evidence because Ms. Brueske’s credibility was the “ultimate issue” in this case. The prosecution counters by stating that the trial justice did', '- 13 - not abuse his discretion in excluding this reputational testimony since, according to the prosecution, defendant “did not establish an adequate foundation” for such testimony.', 'However, we need not decide whether the trial justice abused his discretion in excluding Lynn Saucier’s proposed testimony with respect to Danielle Brueske’s character for untruthfulness in the community because we are of the opinion that any such error would have been harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in light of the voluminous evidence before the jury with respect to Ms. Brueske’s remarkable history of untruthfulness. While testifying in open court, Ms. Brueske admitted to having engaged in a pattern of mendacious and deceitful conduct vis-à-vis defendant and vis-à-vis the man who had recently become her fiancé. She explicitly admitted to having lied to each of them.', 'It is noteworthy that, during his closing argument, defense counsel quite appropriately employed a “false in one thing, false in all” theme and argued to the jury as follows with respect to the credibility of Ms. Brueske:', '“[S]he lied to any number of people that she knows.

In articulating his reasons for excluding the testimony that Ms. Brueske had told Ms. Saucier that her fiancé had “beat her,” the trial justice ruled that such testimony would have “nothing to do with the efficacy of the charges against [defendant].” Moreover, he characterized that proposed line of questioning as a “fishing expedition.” The trial justice further characterized the proposed testimony as “rank hearsay,” and he stated that he would not allow it. 11', 'While being cross-examined by defense counsel, Ms. Brueske denied having told Ms. Saucier while they were attending nursing school that her fiancé “physically abused” or “beat” her. Ms. Brueske further testified that, at some point during nursing school, she had informed Ms. Saucier that she and her fiancé had had an argument and that her eye had been bruised as they were “pushing each other.” She further testified that her fiancé had not hit her; however, she then rephrased her answer to state that he had not intentionally hit her. 12', 'Testimony was elicited during trial that defendant and Ms. Brueske had gone to an adult video store, where defendant purchased a “purple rope restraint.” However, Ms. Brueske denied that defendant had purchased the purple rope restraint for them to use together. She also denied that she was involved in “kinky” or sadomasochistic sexual activities.', 'The trial justice noted that there had not been “a shred of evidence” that the rope restraint seized from defendant’s home had ever been “used in connection with [the complaining witness].” He therefore opted to exclude testimony by Ms. Saucier with respect to Ms. Brueske being involved in “kinky sex” due to the fact that there was no showing of an evidentiary nexus.', '- 15 -', 'The defendant contends that the just-referenced proposed testimony about the alleged beating of the complaining witness and about her alleged involvement in “kinky sex” should have been admitted pursuant to Rule 801(d)(1)(A) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence in that it would constitute prior inconsistent statements of the complaining witness—and therefore would not fall within the definition of hearsay. The defendant contends that the purported impeachment testimony was important to his “theory of defense * * * that any marks upon [Ms. Brueske’s] body were the result of consensual sexual activities” engaged in with defendant or with Doyle—or that such injuries were caused by her fiancé, with whom she had had a violent argument.', 'Rule 801(d)(1)(A) provides that “[a] statement is not hearsay if * * * [t]he declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement, and the statement is * * * inconsistent with the declarant’s testimony.” This Court has further expressly stated that “prior inconsistent statements may be admitted as substantive evidence” and may also be used to “impeach a witness’s testimony at trial.” State v. Espinal, 943 A.2d 1052, 1059, 1060 (R.I. 2008); see also State v. Pusyka, 592 A.2d 850, 853 (R.I. 1991).', 'However, it is unnecessary to determine whether Ms. Saucier’s testimony could have been properly admitted as nonhearsay pursuant to Rule 801(d)(1)(A)—because the ruling of the trial justice in excluding the testimony on other grounds was an appropriate discretionary evidentiary ruling.', 'Pursuant to Rule 402 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, “[a]ll relevant evidence is admissible * * *.” Rule 401 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence defines “relevant evidence” as “evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the', '- 16 - evidence.” See State v.

There was no evidence in the record to suggest that Ms. Brueske had sustained the injuries at issue from an altercation with her fiancé; indeed, there was no evidence presented that Ms. Brueske and her fiancé were near or in the presence of one another on the day of or in the days immediately preceding the alleged kidnapping and assaults.', 'We further note that the trial justice appears to have been inclined to allow defendant to have elicited testimony from Ms. Saucier about “kinky sex” if defendant had proceeded to offer further evidence of the purple rope restraint having been used by defendant and Ms. Brueske in some consensual activity.', 'Upon defense counsel’s representation that there “would be” a connection drawn between the purple rope restraint, found in defendant’s home, and the complaining witness, the trial justice stated:', '“Well, I’d like to see that.

3,Efrain Otero : v. : State of Rhode Island. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The applicant, Efrain Otero, appeals from a Superior Court judgment denying his application for postconviction relief. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After examining the written and oral submissions of the parties, we conclude that this appeal may be resolved without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'The underlying facts of this case are set out in State v. Otero, 788 A.2d 469, 470 (R.I. 2002), in which this Court affirmed the convictions of applicant. On June 27, 1998, Mr. Otero shot and killed a man in a Providence bar. According to witness testimony, applicant entered the bar and shot the man five times. On August 12, 1999, a jury convicted him of first-degree murder and carrying a pistol without a license, for which he was sentenced to life imprisonment and a ten-year suspended sentence. On January 24, 2002, this Court affirmed the judgment of conviction and commitment. Id.', '-1-', 'On June 19, 2002, applicant filed a pro se application for postconviction relief in Superior Court on the grounds that the trial justice did not consider “all relevant, reliable, and probative evidence * * * before instructing the jury on self-defense” and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at his trial. Upon applicant’s subsequent motion, counsel was appointed to represent him.', 'The appointed counsel thereafter filed a motion to withdraw, stating that the application was wholly frivolous and without merit. To support his motion to withdraw, appointed counsel filed a “no-merit” memorandum in accordance with the requirements set forth by this Court in Shatney v. State, 755 A.2d 130 (R.I. 2000). Specifically, the memorandum stated that (1) the evidentiary issues raised in the postconviction-relief application already had been addressed at trial and on direct appeal; (2) applicant’s allegations of witness coercion would not have refuted the other substantial evidence presented; (3) appointed counsel was unable to confirm applicant’s assertion that another witness may have had new, exculpatory information; and (4) appointed counsel did not believe that the trial counsel’s failure to conduct a more rigorous cross- examination of certain witnesses constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.', 'On April 19, 2004, a hearing was held on appointed counsel’s motion to withdraw. 1 The applicant was aided by an interpreter at that hearing. The appointed counsel expressed his wish to withdraw, in accordance with Shatney, and requested that the hearing justice preserve Mr. Otero’s argument about newly discovered evidence. 2 The state suggested that it was appropriate 1', 'During the hearing on April 19, 2004, appointed counsel and the state referred to a previous hearing. It appears from the docket and statements made during the hearing on April 19, 2004 that this previous hearing most likely took place on April 5, 2004. The appointed counsel stated that he had addressed his “no-merit” memorandum in open court at the previous hearing. On appeal, this Court was not provided with the transcript of this first hearing. 2', 'The appointed counsel made the following statement:', '-2- for the hearing justice to deny the remainder of applicant’s claims, but it agreed to the preservation of the newly discovered evidence claim. The hearing justice then addressed Mr. Otero, noting that the latter had the assistance of an interpreter. The hearing justice inquired whether applicant had any questions about what appointed counsel had stated on his behalf or what the state had argued; applicant had no such questions.', 'The hearing justice did not rule on applicant’s newly discovered evidence claim and found his other claims “groundless,” thereupon dismissing them. At that point, the hearing justice asked applicant “Do you understand that, sir?”, and applicant responded “Yes. Yes, I understand.”', 'On August 16, 2004, applicant filed a second pro se application seeking postconviction relief. In his application, Mr. Otero asserted ineffective assistance of trial counsel because his counsel failed to object to Det. Robert Badessa’s testimony on the grounds that he was not qualified as an expert and that he failed to engage a medical expert on the issue of applicant’s diminished capacity.', 'The applicant also argued that the trial justice erred by improperly instructing the jury on the elements of second-degree murder.', '“[A]t this time, I would like to ask, on behalf of Mr. Otero, prior to', 'withdrawing as his counsel, the opportunity for Mr. Otero to', 'withdraw that portion of his petition for post-conviction relief that', 'deals with allegations of new evidence, more particularly, a new', 'witness in that Mr. Otero has not fully investigated those issues', 'relative to new evidence, and Mr. Otero has indicated to me, as', 'recently as of today, that he would like an additional several', 'months time to perhaps retain private counsel and/or an', 'investigator to assist him in gathering that information.”', 'There appears to have been some confusion surrounding this statement. It is clear to this Court that appointed counsel intended to withdraw the newly discovered evidence claim for purposes of preserving the claim and that appointed counsel did not withdraw any of applicant’s other claims.', '-3-', 'Thereafter, a private attorney filed an entry of appearance on behalf of applicant. On June 14, 2005, that attorney filed an application for postconviction relief and a memorandum in support thereof, which essentially mirrored Mr. Otero’s August 16, 2004 pro se application and reiterated the grounds previously set forth. That same day, a hearing was held on Mr. Otero’s applications for postconviction relief.', 'At the June 14, 2005 hearing, the state argued that applicant addressed a number of issues in his postconviction-relief memorandum that were barred by res judicata and that applicant had failed to present, or even allege, newly discovered evidence in his memorandum or at the hearing. In response, the hearing justice noted that most of the substantive issues raised in the petition for postconviction relief had been disposed of and that the case had been continued to allow applicant to investigate his claim of newly discovered evidence. The hearing justice concluded that Mr. Otero had failed to present any newly discovered evidence, and he denied the applications from the bench.', 'A premature notice of appeal was filed on July 11, 2005, 3 and judgment entered denying postconviction relief on June 23, 2008.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“[P]ost-conviction relief is available to a defendant convicted of a crime who contends that his original conviction or sentence violated rights that the state or federal constitutions secured to him.” Ballard v.

Wall, 821 A.2d 685, 688 (R.I. 2003)).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Procedural Claims', 'On appeal, Mr. Otero asserts that the hearings on April 19, 2004 and June 14, 2005 were defective on procedural grounds. Specifically, he argues that the hearing justice improperly allowed his appointed counsel to withdraw his original postconviction-relief claims as he concurrently sought to withdraw as counsel. He further contends that the hearing justice should have advised him at the hearing on April 19, 2004, in accordance with Shatney, that he could proceed pro se with his claims. With respect to the hearing on June 14, 2005, applicant avers that his counsel was not prepared and that the hearing justice should have intervened and sua sponte afforded him the opportunity to proceed pro se.', 'The applicant’s arguments are wholly unavailing. The applicant’s first argument is fatally flawed because his appointed counsel did not, in fact, withdraw his postconviction-relief claims. The only claim appointed counsel “withdrew” was the newly discovered evidence claim, and it was withdrawn for the purpose of preservation. Rather, at the hearing on April 19, 2004, applicant’s other postconviction-relief claims were dismissed by the hearing justice.', '-5-', 'Mr. Otero’s second argument, that the hearing justice should have advised him of his right to proceed pro se at the hearing on April 19, 2004, is similarly unavailing. In Shatney, this Court set forth the procedures a hearing justice must follow when an appointed counsel of an applicant for postconviction relief seeks to withdraw from representation. This Court stated:', '“[A]ppointed counsel must file with the court and serve upon the', 'applicant a motion to withdraw accompanied by a ‘no-merit’', 'memorandum that details the nature and extent of his or her review', 'of the case, lists each issue the applicant wished to raise, and', 'explains why in counsel’s professional opinion those issues and', 'any others that he or she may have investigated lacked merit. The', 'court then must conduct a hearing with the applicant present. If,', 'based upon its review of counsel’s assessment of the potential', 'grounds for seeking post-conviction relief and of any other issues', 'that the applicant wishes to raise, the court agrees that those', 'grounds appear to lack any arguable merit, then it shall permit', 'counsel to withdraw and advise the applicant that he or she shall be', 'required to proceed pro se, if he or she chooses to pursue the', 'application.” Shatney, 755 A.2d at 135.', 'With respect to advising applicants of their right to proceed pro se, we have said that the Shatney procedures must be “essentially followed,” emphasizing that the applicant must be given the opportunity to be heard. Thornton v. State, 948 A.2d 312, 316 (R.I. 2008) (quoting Brown v. State, 841 A.2d 1116, 1123 (R.I. 2004)).', 'The case before us is analogous to Thornton, 948 A.2d at 317, in which we held that the hearing justice had “essentially complied” with the requirements of Shatney, and therefore, that the Shatney procedures were satisfied. In Thornton, this Court stated that upon the hearing justice’s review of the memoranda of the applicant and his appointed counsel and having heard oral argument on the memoranda, it would be “an exercise in futility and an inefficient use of judicial resources” to allow the applicant to proceed pro se on his application. Id.', 'Similarly, in the case at bar, the hearing justice essentially satisfied the Shatney procedures. Before the hearing, applicant had submitted a pro se memorandum setting forth his', '-6- arguments in support of his application. Furthermore, at the hearing on April 19, 2004, although he did not expressly advise applicant that he could proceed pro se, the hearing justice addressed applicant regarding the dismissal of his claims. Most importantly, the hearing justice asked applicant whether he had any questions about what the state and his appointed attorney had said during the hearing, and applicant had a chance at this point in the proceedings to be heard on the claims that thereafter were dismissed. It is also clear to us that applicant understood he would be given the chance to pursue his newly discovered evidence claim at a later hearing. Thus, we are satisfied that applicant had the opportunity to be heard on his postconviction-relief application and that the Shatney procedures essentially were followed. 4', 'Mr. Otero’s third argument is similarly unavailing. We are not aware of, and applicant does not cite authority suggesting, an affirmative obligation on the part of a hearing justice to intervene in a postconviction-relief proceeding to advise an applicant of his or her right to proceed pro se when his or her attorney appears to be unprepared. We decline to adopt such an affirmative obligation under the facts of the instant case.', 'B', 'Substantive Claims', 'Mr. Otero also challenges the denial of his postconviction-relief application on substantive grounds. 5 He contends that he received ineffective assistance from his trial counsel 4', 'We also note the following comment by the prosecutor at the hearing on April 19, 2004: “The defendant, based on the last hearing and the Court having so found, is allowed to articulate whether or not he has any issues for which postconviction relief would be granted and then the Court can allow him to proceed pro se.” Again, no transcript of any prior hearing was provided to this Court. 5', 'The state asserts in its prebriefing statement that applicant abandoned his claims involving jury instructions and newly discovered evidence because he did not raise them in his prebriefing statement. Mr. Otero thereafter submitted a supplemental prebriefing statement addressing his improper jury instructions claim, and therefore, the claim was not waived. Mr. Otero’s newly discovered evidence claim, however, has been waived because it was not addressed on appeal.', '-7- because his counsel (1) failed to refute the testimony of Det. Robert Badessa or object to his testifying on the grounds that he had not been qualified as an expert in ballistics; and (2) failed to offer a medical expert to testify about applicant’s diminished capacity on the night of the murder.', 'We agree with the hearing justice that applicant’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, as set forth in his June 19, 2002 application, was groundless in that he failed to set forth specific claims of deficient representation or evidence suggesting he was prejudiced by such a deficiency, as required by Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984), which standard was adopted by this Court in Brown v. Moran, 534 A.2d 180, 182 (R.I. 1987). Furthermore, Mr. Otero’s allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel, as set forth in his subsequent postconviction- relief applications, are also unavailing because applicant failed to make any showing that he was prejudiced by the purported deficiency. In order to demonstrate prejudice an applicant “must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.” Brown v. State, 964 A.2d 516, 529 (R.I. 2009) (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694). In the case at bar, there was overwhelming evidence of applicant’s guilt. As we noted in Otero, 788 A.2d at 473-74, there was “ample circumstantial evidence” provided by three eyewitnesses at trial to support “the state’s account of the shooting.” Therefore, we affirm the hearing justice’s denial of applicant’s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.', 'The applicant also argues that the trial justice improperly instructed the jury on the elements of second-degree murder. This argument, however, is barred by the doctrine of res judicata, and, thus, is not properly before this Court. See Taylor, 821 A.2d at 688 (“Res judicata bars the relitigation of any issue that could have been litigated in a prior proceeding, including a', '-8- direct appeal, that resulted in a final judgment between the same parties, or those in privity with them.”). The applicant could have raised the issue of the alleged improper jury instructions on direct appeal.', 'Therefore, he was barred from raising the claim in his application for postconviction relief.', 'We accordingly affirm the denial of the applicant’s improper jury instructions claim.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

This case came before the Supreme Court on May 6, 2010, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. The defendant, Edward Peoples (defendant or Peoples), appeals from a conviction of one count of first-degree child molestation and two counts of second-degree child molestation.', 'Peoples was sentenced to thirty years at the Adult Correctional Institutions, ten years to serve and twenty years suspended, with probation on the first-degree sexual assault count and twenty years for each of the remaining counts, five years to serve and fifteen years suspended, with probation – all sentences to run concurrently. On appeal, defendant contends that the trial justice improperly limited cross-examination of a witness and that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial.', 'After reviewing the memoranda submitted by the parties and hearing counsel’s arguments, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and, thus, the appeal may be decided at this time. We affirm the judgment of conviction.', '-1-', 'Facts and Travel', 'The facts in this case arise from an incident that occurred in 2002. At that time, Kenneth, then eight years old, was visiting the home of his aunt, Theresa. 1 The assaults occurred when defendant, Theresa’s second cousin, sexually molested young Kenneth. He did not disclose the assaults until 2007. The defendant subsequently was arrested and indicted on the charges referred to above.', 'A jury trial was held in January 2008; Kenneth, who resides with his mother in Virginia, was the first witness called by the state. He testified that he visited his aunt in Rhode Island during summer vacation, from 2001 to 2004. Kenneth testified that he stayed with Theresa in 2001 and 2002, and that she lived in a third-floor apartment. When Kenneth stayed there, he slept on the couch in the living room or in the bedroom with his aunt.', 'Kenneth testified that one evening in 2002, defendant was watching movies in Theresa’s living room with Theresa and Kenneth. Eventually, Theresa went into her bedroom to go to sleep. Kenneth fell asleep while watching the movie but was awakened when defendant placed his hand over his mouth. The defendant pulled down Kenneth’s shorts and boxers, put his hand on Kenneth’s penis, and moved his hand up and down. After this, defendant proceeded to place his mouth on Kenneth’s penis for approximately ten seconds and then pulled out his own penis and began masturbating. Kenneth testified that defendant said to him, “Now do me” and placed Kenneth’s hand on defendant’s penis. The defendant then masturbated again and ejaculated on the couch. The entire 1', 'Because the victim was a minor when the molestations occurred, we shall use a pseudonym to protect his privacy. We also shall use pseudonyms for all family members involved in this case.', '-2- incident took around four minutes. After the incident, defendant told him that, if he said anything about it, “he would come for me.”', 'Shortly thereafter, defendant left the apartment. Although Kenneth was crying and frightened, he eventually went back to sleep.', 'Kenneth testified that although it was dark when defendant assaulted him the moonlight allowed him to see defendant’s face and there was some light from the street lights outside the apartment. Kenneth initially testified that he did not see defendant again after this incident, but later stated that he saw him once or twice thereafter and that defendant gave him a look he discerned as threatening. On cross-examination, Kenneth added that he did not recall anyone else staying overnight at Theresa’s apartment other than defendant. However, he was confronted with testimony from a prior hearing in which he recalled one other person staying over at Theresa’s house but could not recall a name. Kenneth testified that he did not remember making that statement.', 'Theresa also testified at trial; she stated that defendant is her second cousin and visited her two or three times per week during the summer of 2002, when the incident occurred. She specifically recalled the night of the incident; when she went to bed, defendant and Kenneth still were in the living room. At about 4:50 a.m., defendant woke Theresa up to tell her to lock the door because he was leaving; however, when she rose to lock the door, he was gone. She went back to sleep and woke up again around 7 a.m. and noticed that Kenneth was crying; he told her that he had a headache.', 'Defense counsel’s cross-examination of Theresa is relevant to the issues that confront us. A series of questions were posed to Theresa about the windows, locks, and blinds in her apartment. Theresa testified she had only one key to the apartment and that', '-3- there were five windows in the living room. However, she always kept her blinds closed. Next, counsel asked Theresa whether other men spent the night at her apartment. The prosecution immediately objected, and defense counsel explained at a side-bar conference that he was attempting to explore a third-party perpetrator defense. The trial justice informed defense counsel that to do so, he needed to make an offer of proof, with specificity, demonstrating that another person, not defendant, could have committed the crimes. Defense counsel stated that he would be unable to do so; as a result, the trial justice sustained the state’s objection to that question. Significantly, defendant made no offer of proof or further argument about this purported defense.', 'The final witness to testify for the state was Lucy, Kenneth’s mother and Theresa’s sister, who resides in Virginia. Lucy corroborated Kenneth’s visits to Rhode Island during summer vacation and testified that he made such a visit in the summer of 2002. She testified that on January 29, 2007, while she and Kenneth were watching a television show on child molestation, Kenneth told her that defendant had molested him. Lucy called her sister and asked to speak with defendant about the incident, to no avail. Lucy testified that she contacted law enforcement in Rhode Island to report the incident.', 'The defendant testified and denied committing the alleged sexual acts on Kenneth. Although he admitted to being in Theresa’s apartment on occasions when Kenneth was there, he did not recall being in Theresa’s apartment when Kenneth fell asleep, nor did he recall any animosity between them. The defendant stated how he stopped by Theresa’s apartment at lunchtime and after work, and he said that he visited sometimes as often as five times per week. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on all', '-4- counts. Subsequently, defendant filed a motion for a new trial, and a hearing was held on April 23, 2008.', 'At the hearing, defense counsel asserted that Kenneth’s identification of defendant was suspect because of the dearth of light in the apartment, such that the child would have had difficulty seeing anyone in the room. In response, the prosecution contended that Kenneth was a credible witness, that Theresa’s testimony confirmed that defendant and Kenneth were left alone, and that there was adequate light in the living room. The prosecution also argued that Kenneth was familiar with defendant’s voice based on defendant’s numerous visits to Theresa’s apartment and that defendant spoke to Kenneth during the incident.', 'In ruling on the motion for a new trial, and specifically referring to defense counsel’s attempt to argue a third-party perpetrator defense, the trial justice declared: “But [defense counsel’s] protestations that some phantom molester somehow gained access to that room and perpetrated these crimes on [Kenneth] is without any foundation and evidence or fact in this case.”', 'Further, the trial justice found that Kenneth’s, Theresa’s, and Lucy’s testimony was consistent and credible. The trial justice also noted that it was the function of the jury to make a judgment on whether there was enough light for Kenneth to see defendant. When referencing what evidence the jurors had before them, the trial justice noted that the jury had many facts upon which it could rest its verdict, including the fact that Kenneth knew defendant and was familiar with his voice.', 'Accordingly, the trial justice declared that he agreed with the jury’s verdict and denied defendant’s motion for a new trial; he was sentenced on September 19, 2008, and', '-5- filed a notice of appeal on September 23, 2008; final judgment of conviction was entered on October 1, 2008. 2', 'On appeal, defendant raises two issues; first, he contends that the trial justice erred in precluding cross-examination of Theresa concerning any male visitors when Kenneth was staying with her. Specifically, defendant asserts that “[w]hat was precluded here was quintessential cross-examination to probe all of the salient facts and afford the jury a true picture of life within [Theresa’s] apartment.” The state, on the other hand, contends that defense counsel did not make an offer of proof sufficient to satisfy the trial justice as to these salient facts and that, therefore, the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in precluding that part of the cross-examination. Next, defendant contends that the trial justice was clearly wrong when he denied the motion for a new trial because the jury verdict “was against the fair preponderance of the evidence and failed to do substantial justice.” The state responds that the trial justice properly applied the standard for passing on a motion for a new trial and, after doing so, found that he agreed with the jury’s verdict. 2', 'The notice of appeal was filed before the final judgment of conviction was entered; we note that this practice is permissible under Article I, Rule 4(b) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure:', '“Appeals in Criminal Cases.

Addressing the adequacy of the light where the assault occurred, the trial justice acknowledged that Theresa testified that the blinds in the apartment were closed, but he noted that defendant spoke to Kenneth and that the child was familiar with defendant’s voice.

The state of Rhode Island appeals from a Superior Court order granting the motion of the defendant, Wilder E. Flores (defendant or Flores), to suppress evidence that was seized from his automobile during a lawful traffic stop. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on November 4, 2009, pursuant to an order directing both parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised by this appeal should not summarily be decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we determined that cause had been shown and assigned this case to the regular calendar for full briefing and argument. We heard oral arguments on April 13, 2010. For the reasons set forth below, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On June 23, 2007, two Providence police officers, John C. Bento and Sean Comella, were on patrol in their marked cruiser.1 At approximately 9 p.m., the officers heard a loud screech consistent with the sound of a car’s peeling tires; they observed a large pickup truck approaching their cruiser at a high rate of speed. The officers immediately activated their cruiser’s lights and siren and stopped the vehicle. Officer Bento, the operator of the cruiser, approached the pickup truck’s driver’s side door, while Officer Comella moved toward the passenger side. Officer Bento aimed his flashlight into the vehicle, 2 and he observed an open bottle of beer that was wedged between the driver’s seat and the center console. Officer Bento then asked to see Flores’ license. Officer Comella testified that he observed that defendant’s hands were trembling, although he made no furtive movements. As defendant was retrieving his license from the center console, Officer Bento, in accordance with standard police procedure, kept defendant illuminated with his flashlight.', 'When Flores opened the center console, Officer Bento was able to see the inside of the compartment. Officer Bento testified that as defendant opened the center console, “there was a wallet and there [were] two large—pretty large clear plastic bags with a white substance[.]” Officer Bento testified that he had an unobstructed view—for about two seconds—of the inside of the center console and he “observed the clear plastic bags sitting right there underneath the 1', 'Officer Bento’s usual partner was on vacation; therefore, Officer Comella, who had approximately six months experience, was assigned as Officer Bento’s partner for the week. 2', 'The testimony established that, because this arrest occurred in late June, there was a significant amount of ambient light; presumably the flashlight was used to enhance Officer Bento’s view inside the vehicle.', '-2- wallet.” The officer testified that “when I observed the clear plastic bags, it raised a suspicion. I mean, I almost kind of knew it was cocaine, based on my experience.” (Emphases added.) Officer Bento testified that he took the license from the driver, “told him to step out of the vehicle * * * [and] placed him into custody” in the back of the police cruiser. He returned to the truck and “immediately went into the center console where I observed the clear plastic bags.” He seized them. Officer Bento testified that when he saw the plastic bags of white powder in the center console, based on his experience and training in how to identify cocaine, including how it commonly is packaged, he immediately placed defendant under arrest.', 'The record discloses that at the time of this arrest, Officer Bento had been a patrolman for approximately two and one-half years. He was trained at the police academy in narcotics recognition, particularly the manner in which cocaine is packaged for sale and transport. Officer Bento testified that although he believed that he could have arrested Flores for operating a motor vehicle with an open container of alcohol, 3 he arrested him for possession of cocaine. Officer Comella testified that, as Officer Bento escorted defendant to the police cruiser, he went into the vehicle to secure whatever the item was—weapon or contraband—that caused Officer Bento to arrest defendant. Officer Comella opened the compartment and saw the cocaine “right on top” but did not seize it. Subsequent testing by the Rhode Island Forensic Science Laboratory revealed that the two bags contained nearly seven ounces of powdered cocaine. Although Officer Bento had made approximately 250 to 300 narcotics arrests during the course of his 3', 'Possession of an unsealed alcoholic beverage container while operating a motor vehicle is a violation under G.L. 1956 § 31-22-21.1; G.L. 1956 § 11-1-2.', '-3- career, including drug distribution offenses, this was his first arrest involving such a large quantity of cocaine. 4', 'On July 22, 2008, Flores moved to suppress the evidence seized from his vehicle. After hearing testimony from both officers, the trial justice granted the motion. The trial justice acknowledged that the standard for determining whether there is probable cause “is whether a reasonably prudent * * * officer of [like] training and skill would, after looking at everything before him, conclude that there is a probability that criminal activity has occurred.” However, he found that in the context of this case, Officer Bento’s probable-cause determination was only “based upon that very brief view of these packages that were in the console[.]” 5 The trial justice found that Officer Bento’s brief view of what was later determined to be a large amount of cocaine was not enough to lead “a reasonably prudent person or officer of training and skill” to conclude that there was a “probability that criminal activity has occurred.”', 'The trial justice ruled that there was a distinction between the quantum of evidence necessary for probable cause to arrest and probable cause for a search, and he implied that the standard was greater for an arrest. Notwithstanding Officer Bento’s testimony that “when [he] observed the clear plastic bags, it raised a suspicion [and] * * * [he] almost kind of knew it was cocaine, based on [his] experience,” the trial justice found that “in the two or three seconds involved” in this case, the officer “made a rush to judgment.” The trial justice declared that the 4', 'A criminal information subsequently charged defendant with one count of possession of an enumerated quantity of cocaine—one ounce to one kilogram—in violation of G.L. 1956 § 21-28- 2.08 and one count of possession of cocaine with intent to deliver, in violation of § 21-28- 4.01(a)(4)(i). A search of Flores at the police station yielded approximately $1,400 in cash, mostly consisting of twenty, five, and one dollar bills. 5', 'The trial justice was particularly troubled when, in response to questions from the court, Officer Bento testified that he believed a police officer would have probable cause to make an arrest if the trial justice himself were driving home with a plastic bag containing flour that was similarly packaged.', '-4- officer “determined that, in fact, the defendant was in possession of cocaine and he arrested him.” Significantly, the trial justice found as follows:', '“He didn’t detain him. He didn’t question him. He didn’t ask for', 'his permission to check it out. He simply put the cuffs on him[,]', 'behind his back[,] and put him in the back seat and he said, ‘I', 'arrested him for possession of cocaine. I did not arrest him for the', 'open bottle or any traffic violation.’ And then, he went back to see', 'if his hunch was correct. And as it turns out, his hunch was', 'correct, but that’s after the fact.”', 'The trial justice concluded that based on all the circumstances, a reasonable person would have questioned whether there was probable cause to arrest defendant. “There would have been some significant uncertainty and there would not have been the level of probability or probable cause necessary to make that arrest at that point. * * * So, unfortunately, for the officer in this case who, I think, was probably well intended, he jumped the gun.” The trial justice determined that the officer should have taken Flores to the back of the vehicle, placed his hands on the vehicle, and detained him there while he conducted a plain-view seizure; he said that the officer should have touched and manipulated the item and “perhaps going beyond that in some way, even testing it, if necessary, * * * as [opposed] to cuffing [defendant], putting him in the back seat and saying he is under arrest[.]” Accordingly, the trial justice granted Flores’ motion to suppress. Judgment was entered on October 24, 2008, from which the state timely appealed.6', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'When reviewing a trial justice’s decision granting or denying a motion to suppress, “we defer to the factual findings of the trial justice, applying a ‘clearly erroneous’ standard.” State v. Barkmeyer, 949 A.2d 984, 995 (R.I. 2008) (quoting State v. Apalakis, 797 A.2d 440, 443 (R.I. 6', 'Although the state prematurely filed its notice of appeal on September 23, 2008, we long have treated such an appeal as timely. See State v. Ros, 973 A.2d 1148, 1159 n.14 (R.I. 2009).', '-5- 2002)). We conduct a de novo review, however, of “a trial justice’s determination of the existence or nonexistence of probable cause or reasonable suspicion.” State v. Foster, 842 A.2d 1047, 1050 (R.I. 2004) (quoting State v. Keohane, 814 A.2d 327, 329-30 (R.I. 2003)).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'We begin by noting that, although the trial justice suggested that Officer Bento should have detained defendant rather than arrest him, when the police detain a person, “even if briefly, the Fourth Amendment is implicated and the detention must be in conformance with the strictures of that amendment.”', 'State v. Bjerke, 697 A.2d 1069, 1071 (R.I. 1997) (citing Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648, 653 (1979)). “A police officer has ‘seized’ a person, within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, when he [or she] restrains that person’s freedom to walk away.” Foster, 842 A.2d at 1050. Such a seizure generally must be supported by probable cause, even if a formal arrest has not been made. Id. (citing Apalakis, 797 A.2d at 444).', 'The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, provides: “The right of the people to be secure in their persons * * * against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause * * *.” See Foster, 842 A.2d at 1050 n.3 (declaring that article 1, section 6, of the Rhode Island Constitution is “substantively the same” as the Fourth Amendment). “Although the interest protected by the Fourth Amendment injunction against unreasonable searches is quite different from that protected by its injunction against unreasonable seizures * * *, neither the one nor the other is of inferior worth or necessarily requires only lesser protection.” Arizona v. Hicks, 480 U.S. 321, 328 (1987). “It is generally assumed by the Supreme Court and the lower courts that the same quantum of evidence is required whether one', '-6- is concerned with probable cause to arrest or probable cause to search.” Wayne R. LaFave, Search and Seizure, ch. 3, § 3.1(b) at 8 (4th ed. 2004); see Hicks, 480 U.S. at 328 (“We have not elsewhere drawn a categorical distinction between [search and seizure] insofar as concerns the degree of justification needed to establish the reasonableness of police action, and we see no reason for a distinction * * *.”).', 'The Fourth Amendment requires that a police officer have probable cause to believe a suspect has committed a crime before he or she lawfully can arrest that person without a warrant. See Michigan v. DeFillippo, 443 U.S. 31, 36 (1979). The test for probable cause involves an objective assessment in which the examining court determines, under the totality of the circumstances, whether “‘the facts and circumstances within * * * [the officers’] knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information [are] sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that’ an offense has been or is being committed.” Maryland v. Pringle, 540 U.S. 366, 372 n.2 (2003) (quoting Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160, 175-76 (1949)); see State v. Girard, 799 A.2d 238, 249 (R.I. 2002) (“Probable cause to arrest exists when the facts and circumstances within the police officer’s knowledge and of which he has reasonably trustworthy information are sufficient to warrant a reasonable person’s belief that a crime has been committed and that the person to be arrested has committed the crime.”) (quoting State v. Kryla, 742 A.2d 1178, 1182 (R.I. 1999)). Probable cause “does not demand any showing that such a belief be correct or more likely true than false.” Texas v. Brown, 460 U.S. 730, 742 (1983); see United States v. Humphries, 372 F.3d 653, 656, 660 (4th Cir. 2004) (reversing lower court decision that “probable cause [means] ‘more likely than not’”). Mere suspicion, however, is insufficient and, if an arrest is unlawful at the time it was made, nothing the officer learns subsequently can remove that taint. See Rios v. United States, 364', '-7- U.S. 253, 261-62 (1960) (if probable cause absent at time of arrest, “then nothing that happened thereafter could make that arrest lawful, or justify a search as its incident); United States v. Myers, 308 F.3d 251, 263 (3d Cir. 2002) (weapon discovered after arrest may not be used to establish probable cause to support that arrest); United States v. Prandy-Binett, 995 F.2d 1069, 1070 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (probable cause lies somewhere beyond “bare suspicion”).', 'The Court must evaluate whether probable cause exists by a careful examination of the totality of the circumstances that confronted the officer on the scene, always mindful that “probable cause is a fluid concept—turning on the assessment of probabilities in particular factual contexts—not readily, or even usefully, reduced to a neat set of legal rules.” Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 230, 232 (1983); see Holmes v. State, 796 A.2d 90, 98 (Md. 2002) (“With the possible exception of ‘due process,’ there is probably no two-word term in American law that has produced as much confusing commentary as ‘probable cause,’ largely because it has such a roving context.”). Probable cause is determined by evaluating probabilities. State v. Ortiz, 824 A.2d 473, 481 (R.I. 2003). “These probabilities ‘are not technical; they are the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent [people], not legal technicians, act.’” Id. (quoting Brinegar, 338 U.S. at 175). “[T]he evidence thus collected must be seen and weighed not in terms of library analysis by scholars, but as understood by those versed in the field of law enforcement.” United States v. Cortez, 449 U.S. 411, 418 (1981). Thus, we focus our attention on whether, based on the totality of the circumstances, the arresting officer was in possession of sufficient and reliable information to warrant a prudent and experienced police officer to believe that the suspect has committed a crime. State v. Guzman, 752 A.2d 1, 4 (R.I. 2000).', '-8-', 'It is well established, that “[t]he experience and expertise of the officers involved in the investigation and arrest may be considered in determining probable cause.” United States v. Hoyos, 892 F.2d 1387, 1392 (9th Cir. 1989), overruled on other grounds by United States v. Ruiz, 257 F.3d 1030 (9th Cir. 2001). The quantum and quality of the information in the police officer’s knowledge is evaluated first on the basis of the objective observations of the officer “and consideration of the modes or patterns of operation of certain kinds of lawbreakers.” Cortez, 449 U.S. at 418. A critical component of this analysis is that unlike an untrained professional, an experienced police officer “draws inferences and makes deductions” from these facts based on his or her training and practice. Id.; see United States v. Ortiz, 422 U.S. 891, 897 (1975) (“officers are entitled to draw reasonable inferences from these facts in light of their knowledge of the area and their prior experience”).', 'An officer’s plain-view observations may constitute probable cause to arrest when (1) the officer legitimately is in a position to make his observation and (2) the incriminating character of the object in plain view is “immediately apparent.” Horton v. California, 496 U.S. 128, 136-37 (1990).', 'In the case at bar, defendant concedes that the initial traffic stop was lawful. Accordingly, because the officers lawfully were in a position to view the inside of Flores’ vehicle, including the open compartment, they properly could rely on their plain-view observations when deciding whether there was probable cause to arrest defendant. The issue before this Court is whether Officer Bento’s two-second observation of clear plastic bags containing white powder was sufficient to give rise to probable cause to arrest. Our careful de novo review of the record before us leads us to conclude that Officer Bento was afforded an adequate opportunity to see and immediately identify what he “almost kind of knew” was cocaine and, while not the only circumstance within the officer’s knowledge at the time, we are', '-9- of the opinion that this observation supplied a sufficient quantum of evidence of criminal activity to support the arrest in this case.', 'The United States Supreme Court has long recognized that a police officer’s training and experience may specially qualify him to identify narcotics from observations that would not necessarily be significant to a layperson. See Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S. 10, 13 (1948) (officer “qualified to know the odor” may identify opium). Many jurisdictions have considered a police officer’s experience when determining whether a plain-view observation of cocaine was sufficient to establish probable cause. See, e.g., United States v. Rosario, 638 F.2d 460, 462 (2d Cir. 1980) (officer with twelve years experience could identify white powdery substance as cocaine); Blackmon v. United States, 835 A.2d 1070, 1074 (D.C. 2003) (officer with eighteen years experience could identify white rock-like substance as cocaine); State v. Gordon, 646 So.2d 1005, 1010 n.6 (La. Ct. App. 1994) (officer’s three years of experience and several hundred narcotics arrests relevant to probable cause determination); People v. Coleman, 584 N.Y.S.2d 89, 90 (N.Y. App. Div. 1992) (eighteen year veteran could identify a plastic bag containing vials as cocaine). In this case, the trial justice heard undisputed testimony that Officer Bento was trained in narcotics identification, had been assigned to the same area of the city for two and one-half years, and had made 250 to 300 narcotics arrests. We are satisfied, therefore, that Officer Bento’s experience and training made him specially qualified to identify cocaine.', 'We recognize, however, that notwithstanding the officer’s undisputed experience, training and qualifications, the “incriminating character” of the object must be “immediately apparent” to justify arrest. See Horton, 496 U.S. at 136. 7 There is ample support for the state’s 7', 'The phrase “immediately apparent” is taken from Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 466 (1971). A plurality of the Court subsequently clarified in Texas v. Brown, 460 U.S. 730, 741 (1983), that “the use of the phrase ‘immediately apparent’ was very likely an unhappy choice of', '- 10 - contention that a police officer readily can identify cocaine by plain-view observation. 8 Moreover, the plain-view observation of a white powder that is packaged in a clear plastic bag, standing alone, has been found to be sufficient indicia of probable cause. See State v. Jackson, 778 So.2d 23, 28, 29 (La. Ct. App. 2000) (officer had probable cause to arrest when, during a lawful traffic stop, he observed a “zip-lock bag containing white powder in plain view on the floor of the car between the seat and the door”); Commonwealth v.

Murray, 598 A.2d 206, 207 (N.H. 1991) (immediately apparent to officers executing a search warrant for stolen property that “small clear plastic package, approximately one inch by one inch in size, containing white powder” was contraband); State v.

We are thus satisfied that Officer Bento was words, since it can be taken to imply that an unduly high degree of certainty as to the incriminatory character of evidence is necessary for an application of the ‘plain view’ doctrine.” See United States v. Hamie, 165 F.3d 80, 83 (1st Cir. 1999) (“immediately apparent” means “sufficient to constitute probable cause”). 8', 'See, e.g., United States v. Miller, 769 F.2d 554, 556, 557 (9th Cir. 1985) (“immediately apparent” that a clear plastic bag, partially wrapped in masking tape that fell out of a suitcase was contraband); Blackmon v.

App. 1994) (“immediately apparent” that cellophane baggie containing white powder within suspect’s purse was contraband). Although in each of these cases, additional incriminating circumstances were present and contributed to the courts’ determination of the existence of probable cause, these factors are not essential to the probable- cause determination and do not alter our conclusion. See, e.g., Miller, 769 F.2d at 557 (noting “the manner in which the plastic bag and suitcase were taped, and the presence of other similarly packaged bags in [suspect’s] suitcase”); Blackmon, 835 A.2d at 1074 (tip about suspicious activities inside the vehicle); Gordon, 646 So.2d at 1010 (officer smelled burned marijuana).', '- 11 - able to see the substance, identify its contents as almost certainly contraband, and that this information established the requisite probable cause for arrest.', 'Furthermore, our de novo conclusion of probable cause to arrest is buttressed by evidence of defendant’s demeanor and the location of the stop. The state points to the trial justice’s finding that Flores appeared nervous during the traffic stop. Our review of the transcript establishes that defendant’s hands were trembling, a characteristic of nervousness. Although standing alone a suspect’s nervousness does not establish probable cause, “a police officer may consider the suspect’s demeanor upon encountering the police, including any observed nervousness, as one factor within the officer’s probable-cause calculus.” Guzman, 752 A.2d at 4; see State v. Ramirez, 100 P.3d 94, 96-98 (Kan. 2004) (observation that suspect appeared “fidgety and nervous” was properly considered as part of probable cause determination).', 'Lastly, we turn to the area in which the arrest occurred. We recognize that there was no testimony that this traffic stop occurred in an area known for criminal activity. See United States v. Stanfield, 109 F.3d 976, 978, 979 (4th Cir. 1997) (noting traffic stop occurred in “a high crime area * * * known for its open narcotics trafficking” in reciting that officer had probable cause upon plain view of “a clear plastic bag of cocaine protruding from the mouth of a brown paper bag”). However, it is undisputed that during the course of his two and one-half years as a patrolman, Officer Bento had been assigned to the Olneyville section of Providence, in the area between Manton and Hartford Avenues, and had made hundreds of drug arrests, including arrest for the sale and distribution of narcotics in that area. We therefore are satisfied that although not', '- 12 - explicitly established through testimony, Officer Bento was patrolling in an area in which drug offenses regularly occurred. 9', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'In the case before us, the testimony established that Officer Bento was an experienced law enforcement officer, trained to identify cocaine and how it commonly is packaged for sale. Indeed, he testified that clear plastic bags are generally used to package cocaine for sale and transportation. Based on this experience, it was apparent to him that two large clear plastic bags filled with white powder, located inside the center console of an automobile, “spoke volumes as to [their] contents.” Brown, 460 U.S. at 743. Accordingly, based on our de novo review of the record, under the totality of the circumstances, we are of the opinion that this experienced police officer had the requisite probable cause to arrest defendant and seize the narcotics that he observed in plain view during a lawful automobile stop.', 'For the reasons set out above, the judgment of the Superior Court is reversed and the papers of the case are returned to the Superior Court.', 'Justice Indeglia took no part in the consideration or decision of this appeal. 9', 'We also note that criminal cases emanating from this area of Providence are not infrequent occurrences before this Court or the Superior Court.

This case came before the Supreme Court on March 10, 2010, as a statutory petition for certiorari filed by the petitioner, the Kent County Water Authority (KCWA or petitioner), pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 39-5-1. 1 The petitioner is seeking review of a decision by the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission (PUC) denying a rate increase to KCWA for several discrete expenses: a salary increase that was less than initially requested, full funding for its infrastructure- replacement program (IFR), and the PUC’s determination that KCWA employees should pay a portion of their health-insurance expenses.

The petitioner seeks review of the report and order that the PUC issued in docket No. 3942. After careful review of the record in this case, we affirm.', 'Regulatory Structure', 'We begin by noting the distinction between the Division of Public Utilities and Carriers (division) and the PUC. The division is legally and functionally separate from the PUC. As set forth in G.L. 1956 § 39-1-3, the General Assembly established the PUC and the division, designating the PUC as a quasi-judicial tribunal and the division, which exercises powers not specifically assigned to the PUC.', 'Specifically, those powers include implementing the policies of the state in regulating the public utilities to achieve the “ultimate policy goals of providing for adequate, efficient, and economical energy, communication, and transportation services and water supplies at just and reasonable rates.” Providence Gas Co. v. Burke, 419 A.2d 263, 269 (R.I. 1980). We further have elaborated on the distinction between the PUC and the division in Narragansett Electric Co. v. Harsch, 117 R.I. 395, 402, 368 A.2d 1194, 1199-1200 (1977):', '“[T]he General Assembly intended by its enactment to', 'segregate the judicial and administrative attributes of', 'ratemaking and utilities regulation and to vest them', 'separately and respectively in the [PUC] and the [division].', 'Other provisions in title 39 support this interpretation. For', 'instance, the [PUC] is clothed with the ‘powers of a court', 'of record’ in determining and adjudicating matters within', 'its jurisdiction * * *. It is further empowered to make', 'orders and render judgments and to enforce the same by', 'suitable process * * *.”', 'This Court has noted these differences in a number of subsequent cases. See, e.g., In re Island Hi-Speed Ferry, LLC, 746 A.2d 1240, 1244 n.6 (R.I. 2000) (“The [d]ivision, which is represented by the Department of the Attorney General in all administrative and', '-2- legal proceedings, is statutorily charged with representing the interests of the public, as its advocate, in rate proceedings before the [PUC].”); Town of New Shoreham v. Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission, 464 A.2d 730, 737 n.5 (R.I. 1983) (noting that although the administrator of the division had approved an agreement, the PUC has “exclusive jurisdiction to determine the rates of public utilities”).', 'Facts and Travel', 'On March 31, 2008, KCWA filed a rate application with the PUC seeking an overall rate increase of $5,464,556, or 35 percent; if approved, this would have resulted in a rate increase of 16.5 percent for private customers. Included in its rate application, were the following proposed items: a 4 percent wage increase for employees’ salaries; $6 million for the IFR plan; and a salary and benefit structure that continued to relieve their employees of any contribution toward their health-care premiums. It is the PUC’s determination of these items that is the subject of this appeal.', 'Before the public hearings, as is customary in rate cases, the parties submitted prefiled testimony. The division presented evidence from its utility rate consultant, Thomas Catlin (Catlin), who recommended a salary increase of 3.2 percent, as opposed to the requested 4 percent. 2', 'With regard to the health-insurance contribution, Catlin testified that 90 percent of the cost of health insurance should be paid through water rates and that employees should contribute 10 percent of the cost of their health-care premiums. Finally, Catlin indicated that the IFR plan should be funded at $5.4 million, 2', 'There was a data request from the PUC, which indicated that KCWA employees had received salary increases of approximately 23 percent over the past five years. Specifically, the salary increases were 5.7 percent in 2004; 4 percent in 2005; 3.7 percent in 2006; 6.4 percent in 2007; and 3.2 percent in 2008.', '-3- rather than the $6 million that had been requested. According to Catlin, the $5.4 million still would suffice to cover the KCWA’s IFR plans.', 'There was also prefiled testimony from Timothy Brown (Brown), the general manager of KCWA. With respect to the salary increase, Brown averred that KCWA was understaffed and that to retain the utility’s current employees, an adequate salary increase was necessary. Brown rejected the division’s suggestion that the KCWA employees pay for a portion of their health-insurance premiums because, he argued, doing so would hinder petitioner’s ability to attract and retain qualified employees. Finally, with respect to the IFR, Brown suggested that funding the IFR plan at a reduced amount of $5.4 million was irresponsible.', 'Additionally, Christopher Woodcock (Woodcock), a rate consultant for KCWA, also in prefiled testimony, addressed the IFR and declared that the safety of the water supply for its users, as well as infrastructure concerns, should outweigh the economic considerations that the division suggested.', 'The PUC conducted hearings on July 10, 2008, and September 24, 2008. Brown testified and expanded upon his prefiled testimony that the Department of Health (DOH) had approved the IFR plan and that KCWA anticipated a rate increase to pay for that plan. Brown testified that IFR plans are funded through a cash account, as opposed to capital programs, which are financed through bonds. He also explained that it was petitioner’s policy that KCWA will not undertake an IFR project until the full amount is available in the account. In response, Catlin, testifying for the division, stated that the KCWA funding for IFR projects was conservative and that other utilities in Rhode Island tend not to accrue that much cash for IFR projects. Catlin recommended that the IFR funding be increased to $5.4 million rather than the $6 million. He noted that even at', '-4- $5.4 million for IFR funding, KCWA would still have $18.1 million in IFR funds and $21 million in capital improvement funds for FY 2009 and FY 2010, which coincided with KCWA’s spending plan.', 'On October 17, 2008, the parties filed post-hearing memoranda.', 'When addressing the health-care costs, KCWA argued that it should not be penalized because its work force was not unionized. The petitioner contended that it would be unfair to require its employees to pay for health care at the same time the employee salary increase was limited to 3.2 percent.', 'On January 23, 2009, the PUC issued its report and order and allowed a revenue increase of $3,423,233 or 20.91 percent. The PUC granted a rate increase for IFR funding to a level of $5.4 million, as opposed to the $6 million level that the utility requested. Further, the PUC accepted the division’s recommendation that a 10 percent employee contribution toward health-care premiums should be instituted by KCWA. However, should KCWA elect to continue to fund 100 percent of its employee health care, the PUC ordered that the additional amount be derived from the operating-revenue- allowance account. The PUC also admonished petitioner that “reducing health care costs is becoming more prevalent throughout the public sector” and further, that the PUC’s “policy has been made clear [to KCWA] for almost four years and the time has come for all regulated utilities to implement the policy.” 3 3', 'The PUC also noted that the Providence Water Supply Board, the Pawtucket Water Supply Board, the Newport Water Division, and the Woonsocket Water Department all have a policy in place to require their employees to pay a portion of health care premiums and that the PUC’s expectation is that employees will co-share their health-care premiums.', '-5-', 'Respecting the proposed salary increase, a majority of the PUC limited rate funding to a 2 percent raise for KCWA employees; however, the PUC noted that its decision does not preclude KCWA from granting a higher salary increase. Although KCWA initially sought a 4 percent salary increase, it agreed to the 3.2 percent raise that the division recommended. The order provided that should KCWA provide a 3.2 percent increase, the money would come from petitioner’s operating-revenue-allowance account. In explaining its decision, the PUC referenced the current malaise in Rhode Island’s economy, including the state’s high unemployment. The PUC cited Harsch, 117 R.I. at 416, 368 A.2d at 1206-07, in which this Court declared that, in determining whether utility rates are just and reasonable, the PUC may consider local economic conditions.', 'PUC Chairman Elia Germani (Germani) dissented from the portion of the majority opinion just referred to on the ground that he considered the majority’s view to be a misreading of Harsch as it pertains to economic conditions. Mr. Germani also emphasized that KCWA is the only utility in Rhode Island that is not unionized; it was his opinion that this should be factored into the salary increase at issue in the rate filing. 4 4', 'Specifically, Germani stated:', '“The KCWA is the only utility in RI that does not have a union. The', '[PUC] should acknowledge that if a union becomes the bargaining agent', 'for KCWA’s employees, this decision would impair the flexibility', 'necessary for the efficient operations of the company. In my judgment,', 'the end result would be to deny the KCWA an important method for', 'achieving efficient operations of the company. It is well known that a', 'company which is unionized is less efficient, and therefore, it costs the', 'company more money to operate. Thus, the majority in my judgment, is', 'being ‘penny wise and dollar foolish’ if it fails to grant the utility the', 'flexibility it needs to be efficient.”', '-6-', 'Standard of Review', 'The General Assembly has established the standard of review for cases brought before us in accordance with title 39 of the General Laws, entitled “Public Utilities and Carriers.” Specifically, the Legislature declared:', '“The findings of the commission on questions of fact shall', 'be held to be prima facie true, and as found by the', 'commission and the [S]upreme [C]ourt, shall not exercise', 'its independent judgment nor weigh conflicting evidence.', 'An order or judgment of the commission made in the', 'exercise of administrative discretion shall not be reversed', 'unless the commission exceeded its authority or acted', 'illegally, arbitrarily, or unreasonably.” Section 39-5-3.', 'When assessing a decision of the PUC, our mission is to determine whether the PUC ruled in a “lawful and reasonable” manner and whether its findings of fact are “fairly and substantially supported by legal evidence.”', 'New England Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, 446 A.2d 1376, 1380 (R.I. 1982). Moreover, we accord great deference to the PUC’s factual findings, Roberts v. Narragansett Electric Co., 490 A.2d 506, 507 (R.I. 1985), and we will not disturb an order unless the PUC “clearly exceeds its statutory authority or acts illegally, arbitrarily, or unreasonably.” Narragansett Electric Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, 773 A.2d 237, 240 (R.I. 2001). In applying this standard to the issues before us, we recognize that in seeking to overturn a finding of the PUC, the petitioner has a difficult burden to bear. In re Providence Water Supply Board’s Application to Change Rate Schedules, 989 A.2d 110, 115 (R.I. 2010).', 'Analysis', 'Before us, KCWA assigns three errors in the PUC’s decision and order that it contends warrant reversal: the refusal to fully fund the IFR account; the reduced salary', '-7- increase for KCWA employees; and the requirement that employees contribute 10 percent for health-care premiums. We shall address each of these contentions in turn.', 'Infrastructure Replacement Funding', 'The petitioner asserts that it was error for the PUC to reject its request for full funding of the IFR as approved by the DOH based on petitioner’s Clean Water Infrastructure replacement program. The petitioner argues that in limiting its funding for this program to an increase of $5.4 million – as opposed to the requested $6 million – the PUC ignored the Comprehensive Clean Water Infrastructure Act of 1993 (CCWIA), as set forth in G.L. 1956 § 46-15.6-2. Essentially, petitioner contends that because the DOH previously had approved its IFR plan, it was incumbent upon the PUC to grant the rate increase necessary to execute the plan. In its brief, petitioner points to § 46-15.6-6(1), which provides:', '“cost of programs to implement infrastructure replacement', 'shall be paid by the water users at a rate directly', 'proportionate to the users’ water consumption. The charges', 'shall be limited to those necessary and reasonable to', 'undertake the actions required by this chapter.” 5 The PUC responds that the CCWIA does not limit its express mandate to “relieve ratepayers of funding requests that produce unjust and unreasonable rates” because, it contends, the CCWIA can be read harmoniously with the PUC’s responsibility to protect the public against “improper and unreasonable rates, tolls and charges[.]” Section 39-1- 1(c). We agree with the PUC and reject petitioner’s argument. 5', 'We note that as of November 12, 2009, the General Assembly changed G.L. 1956 § 46- 15.6-6(1), and removed the following language: “at a rate directly proportionate to the users’ water consumption.” This amendment does not the affect the outcome in this case. See P.L. 2009, ch. 288, § 9.', '-8-', 'It is clear to us that the PUC accepted Catlin’s testimony that the recommended amount was more than adequate to fund the IFR projects that were planned by KCWA. Before the PUC, Catlin testified that KCWA’s funding policy for its IFR plan was more conservative than most public utilities in the state because it required that its cash accounts be fully funded before undertaking an IFR project. In its order, the PUC concluded that, “it is highly improbable that the utility would expend the authorized funds within the rate year.”', 'The petitioner contends that the PUC should approve the requested rate for IFR projects that previously had been approved by the DOH, without examining the rate application. Essentially, KCWA is asking this Court to declare that § 46-15.6-6 has cabined the statutory authority of the PUC as set forth in § 39-1-1(c). 6', '“In matters of statutory interpretation our ultimate goal is to give effect to the purpose of the act as intended by the Legislature.” Webster v. Perrotta, 774 A.2d 68, 75 (R.I. 2001) (citing Matter of Falstaff Brewing Corp. Re: Narragansett Brewery Fire, 637 A.2d 1047, 1050 (R.I. 1994)). Additionally, “[i]t is well settled that when the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, this Court must interpret the statute literally and 6', 'General Laws 1956 § 39-1-1(c) provides:', '“To this end, there is hereby vested in the [PUC] and the [division]', 'the exclusive power and authority to supervise, regulate, and make orders', 'governing the conduct of companies offering to the public in intrastate', 'commerce energy, communication, and transportation services and water', 'supplies for the purpose of increasing and maintaining the efficiency of', 'the companies, according desirable safeguards and convenience to their', 'employees and to the public, and protecting them and the public against', 'improper and unreasonable rates, tolls and charges by providing full, fair,', 'and adequate administrative procedures and remedies, and by securing a', 'judicial review to any party aggrieved by such an administrative', 'proceeding or ruling.”', '-9- must give the words of the statute their plain and ordinary meanings.” Waterman v. Caprio, 983 A.2d 841, 844 (R.I. 2009) (quoting Iselin v. Retirement Board of the Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island, 943 A.2d 1045, 1049 (R.I. 2008)).', 'Section 46-15.6-6(1) provides that “[t]he charges shall be limited to those necessary and reasonable to undertake the actions required by this chapter.” (Emphasis added.) It is clear to us that the statute is unambiguous and that by providing that the costs of the program shall be derived from the ratepayers, but shall be limited to necessary and reasonable charges, the General Assembly did not intend to divest the PUC of its statutory authority to protect the public from “improper and unreasonable rates, tolls and charges[.]” Section 39-1-1(c). The language in these two statutes is not in conflict and, indeed, can be read harmoniously as consistent with the Legislature’s design that the PUC perform its statutory authority to review rate cases and protect the public from unreasonable charges. See Horn v. Southern Union Co., 927 A.2d 292, 295 (R.I. 2007) (“It is an especially well-settled principle of statutory construction that when, as here, ‘we are faced with statutory provisions that are in pari materia, we construe them in a manner that attempts to harmonize them and that is consistent with their general objective scope.’”) (quoting State v. Dearmas, 841 A.2d 659, 666 (R.I. 2004)); Providence & Worcester Railroad Co. v. Pine, 729 A.2d 202, 208 (R.I. 1999) (stating that statutes should be considered “as a whole; individual sections must be considered in the context of the entire statutory scheme, not as if each section were independent of all other sections”); State v. Timms, 505 A.2d 1132, 1135 (R.I. 1986) (“We assume the Legislature intended statutes relating to the same subject be construed together to be', '- 10 - consistent and to effectuate the policy of the law. * * * Statutes in pari materia are to be considered harmoniously by this [C]ourt.”).', 'Finally, KCWA argues that Providence Water Supply Board v. Public Utilities Commission, 708 A.2d 537 (R.I. 1998) controls the result in this case. In Providence Water Supply Board, this Court held that the PUC exceeded its authority by interfering with management functions concerning the selection of the technology employed by the water utility and that the PUC could not prohibit the utility from using IFR funds to purchase and install new water meters. Id. at 543, 547. Notably, this Court has declared:', '“This Court repeatedly has held that the broad', 'regulatory powers of the PUC ordinarily do not include the', 'authority to dictate managerial policy. See, e.g., Blackstone', 'Valley Electric Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, 543', 'A.2d 253, 255 (R.I. 1988) (‘It is the function of the PUC to', 'regulate a utility in order to determine that its rates are fair', 'and reasonable. It is not the function of the PUC to manage', 'the utility or to exercise the prerogatives of ownership’).”', 'Providence Water Supply Board, 708 A.2d at 543.', 'Before this Court, counsel for KCWA valiantly argued that the decision in this case is infected with the same errors the PUC committed in Providence Water Supply Board. We respectfully disagree. In that case, we concluded that the PUC attempted to dictate the type of technology the utility could purchase and utilize for its IFR plan and did so in light of its own determination that the new technology for meter reading was too expensive. 7 Providence Water Supply Board, 708 A.2d at 543. Here, the PUC, in a 7', 'Specifically, the Court in Providence Water Supply Board v. Public Utilities Commission, 708 A.2d 537, 540 (R.I. 1998) stated:', '“Opining that ‘the costs related to [the AMR system] of', 'consumption recording cannot be taken lightly,’ the PUC', 'concluded that AMR technology was too expensive. The', ""PUC's 1995 order did authorize the PWSB to collect"", '- 11 - carefully reasoned decision, determined the appropriate funding level for the IFR program and how much the ratepayers should bear on an annual basis. The PUC did not order how KCWA was to implement its IFR plan, nor did it dictate or prioritize the projects KCWA might elect to complete. The record before us does not support, in any way, the conclusion that the PUC intruded on the managerial prerogatives of the utility, and we decline to hold otherwise. Finally, we are satisfied that the $5.4 million award for IFR funding is supported by the substantial evidence in the record before this Court.', 'Salary Increases', 'The petitioner next asserts that the PUC erred when it denied its requested rate increase for employee raises. The KCWA contends that it initially requested a 4 percent raise and that the PUC’s 2 percent increase clearly was erroneous. Conversely, the PUC alleges that petitioner has misconstrued its order, in which it “permitted KCWA to grant its employees a full 3.2% salary increase,” but required that the money must come from its operating revenue allowance and labor expense account, but not from a rate increase. The order provided that: “[t]he impact of the [PUC’s] decision on KCWA’s final position (3.2 percent increase) is a reduction to rates of approximately $25,000, including the related adjustment to the O&M Reserve, or 0.13 percent of the total rate year cost.” In short, the PUC argues that it simply determined the manner in which the KCWA could', '$400,000 in additional revenues from its ratepayers in order', 'to service the debt incurred by issuing at least $4 million in', 'revenue bonds. The PUC further mandated that [the]', 'petitioner use the $4 million to begin its meter-system', 'upgrade using the ARB technology.”', '- 12 - fund the raises with approximately one-third of the increase to come from the operating revenue. The PUC contends that this decision falls within its discretion and was both fair and reasonable in light of the evidence presented. We agree with this contention and are guided by our well established standard of review.', 'This Court consistently has declared that “a party challenging a rate that the [PUC] approves must overcome the presumption that the [PUC’s] conclusions are reasonable unless shown otherwise by clear and convincing evidence.” Providence Water Supply Board v. Malachowski, 624 A.2d 305, 309 (R.I. 1993). Here, KCWA’s argument that it was denied full funding of a proposed salary increase is rejected because there is insufficient evidence in the record to support this contention. Rather, the salary increase as approved by the PUC is supported by substantial evidence. See New England Telephone & Telegraph Co., 446 A.2d at 1380. The petitioner has failed to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the PUC’s decision was unreasonable. 8 In sum, there is no suggestion in the record before us that the PUC “exceeded its authority or acted illegally, arbitrarily, or unreasonably.” Section 39-5-3.', 'Health-Insurance Premiums', 'The petitioner next asserts that the PUC erred in ordering KCWA employees to contribute 10 percent of their health-care premiums and that this decision was not supported by legally competent evidence. Specifically, KCWA asserts that G.L. 1956 § 39-16-5 bars the PUC from recouping from ratepayers only 90 percent of its 8', 'We also note that the division described two funding amounts for KCWA’s operating- revenue-allowance account – 1.5 percent of the rate or, alternatively, 3 percent funding. The PUC elected the alternate amount and attached the conditions recommended by the division. The conditions recommended by the division were designed to ensure that petitioner maintained sufficient funding in case the utility suffered a decline in revenue.', '- 13 - expenditures for health insurance. However, in its report and order, the PUC noted that petitioner could elect to relieve their employees from a 10 percent contribution toward their health insurance, but it must do so from the operating-revenue-allowance account. Before this Court, the PUC contends that § 39-16-5 does not preclude it from setting rates based on a formula that requires 10 percent of health-insurance expenses to be paid by employees.', 'Section 39-16-5, part of the enabling legislation creating KCWA, authorizes its board to appoint employees and to fix their compensation. Section 39-16-5 provides in relevant part:', '“The board may provide, in the fixing of compensation, for', 'a retirement program, commonly known as a pension plan,', 'funded by individual or group insurance or annuity', 'contracts or otherwise, for health and accident insurance,', 'for life insurance, for hospital service commonly known as', 'blue cross, and for physicians service for any one or more', 'or all of its employees; and the board is hereby authorized', 'to expend the moneys of the authority for such purposes', 'and programs as it may deem advisable. These programs', 'and purposes may be financed in full or in part by the', 'moneys of the authority.”', 'The petitioner contends that it solely is vested with the authority to set employee compensation, including health insurance. However, fixing compensation and setting utility rates are separate and distinct functions. We reject petitioner’s suggestion that the PUC is divested of the authority to determine what cost should be borne by the ratepayers. There is nothing in § 39-16-5 remotely suggesting that the PUC is without authority to determine what expenses are just and reasonable for the ratepayers to bear.', 'Additionally, the PUC asserts that KCWA has been on notice for some time that the PUC intended to implement this modest change in the allocation of health-care costs.', '- 14 - As early as 2005, the PUC issued order No. 18316, in which it stated that “KCWA should take heed of a recent [PUC] order * * * in which the [PUC] expressed its expectation that the utility ‘would require its employees to share in the expense of their health care premiums or implement other approaches that will clearly reduce the health care premiums paid’ by the utility.” The record discloses that the PUC advised KCWA to begin requiring its employees to contribute to a portion of their health-care premiums, similar to what is required at many public utilities in this state. The petitioner expressly ignored that directive.', 'There is nothing in the record before us demonstrating that the PUC was unreasonable or arbitrary; in fact, the PUC has applied its balancing analysis for KCWA’s health-care costs in the same manner as every other public water utility in the state. The PUC noted that the Providence Water Supply Board, the Pawtucket Water Supply Board, the Newport Water Division, and the Woonsocket Water Department all require their employees to pay a portion of health-care premiums. We see no valid reason why petitioner should not be required to act similarly. The PUC order stated: “The [PUC] notes that this stated [PUC] policy has been made clear for almost four years and the time has come for all regulated utilities to implement the policy.” The petitioner’s own witness, Mr. Brown, agreed that he was aware that employee co-sharing was becoming more prevalent. Additionally, when addressing whether a unionized workforce had an impact on its decision, the PUC found: “every other regulated water utility in Rhode Island, union and non-union, require an employee health care premium co-share to the point where a utility reopened negotiations with its union to obtain a co-share.”', '- 15 -', 'The PUC’s findings are “presumed reasonable ‘until shown to be clearly, palpably and grossly unreasonable by clear and convincing evidence.’” Providence Gas Co. v.

The PUC’s decision that the ratepayers should not shoulder 100 percent of employee health-insurance premiums is not unreasonable; indeed, it is prudent and responsible and represents the slow dawn of a new day in the public benefits arena. The decision also is supported by substantial evidence, including the fact that most, if not all, public water utilities require their employees to contribute toward their health insurance. We uphold the decision of the PUC.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated, we quash the writ and affirm the report and order of the Public Utilities Commission.

7,State : v. : Tonya Fuller-Balletta. :,criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. This case comes before the Supreme Court on appeal by Tonya Fuller-Balletta (Fuller-Balletta or acquittee) who was acquitted of murder by reason of insanity, from an order of the Superior Court committing her to the custody of the director of the Rhode Island Department of Mental Health, Retardation and Hospitals (director and MHRH respectively) 1 pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 40.1-5.3-4(e), for care and treatment at an inpatient facility. The acquittee argues on appeal that: (1) the evidence presented at the hearing legally was insufficient to meet the statutorily required showing of a likelihood of serious harm to support the trial justice’s finding that the acquittee is dangerous; (2) the trial justice erred when she failed to consider the precise circumstances of acquittee’s conduct―resulting in homicide―which gave rise to the insanity acquittal; and (3) the trial justice should have ordered acquittee into a community-based outpatient facility instead of inpatient treatment in a public institution. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Superior Court. 1', 'As of this publication, the Rhode Island General Assembly has voted to change the name of MHRH to “Department of Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities and Hospitals.”', '-1-', 'Facts and Travel', 'A. Background and October 29, 2004', 'We recount the tragic events of this case that culminated in the death of Fuller- Balletta’s twelve-year-old daughter. On the evening of October 29, 2004, a trooper with the Rhode Island State Police went to Fuller-Balletta’s home to execute an arrest warrant that had been outstanding for fourteen years. 2 Unbeknownst to the state trooper, Fuller-Balletta was mentally unstable and in the midst of continuing paranoid delusions, hallucinations, and extreme behavior resulting from a mental illness that had been progressing for the previous few years.', 'In 2002, during an unsuccessful run for governor, Fuller-Balletta was asked to leave a pre-election debate because she was singing. The acquittee’s relationship with her husband became strained; she would sit holding a baseball bat near him as he slept and sprayed him with mace. Eventually she forced her husband to leave their home. She was convinced that she was under surveillance; she believed that spies lived next door and that her telephones were bugged. She disconnected the home’s alarm system, doorbell, and smoke alarms. The acquittee detached her telephone wires from her home because she was convinced that she was receiving messages through her telephones and the home’s Internet service.', 'Fuller-Balletta insisted on home- schooling her two daughters, Marina (then, age thirteen) and Talia (then, age twelve) because she did not want them to leave the house. A few days before this tragedy, acquittee turned off the furnace in her basement and began heating the house with just the kitchen stove. Fuller-Balletta never sought psychiatric help or medical treatment for her increasingly deteriorating mental state. 2', 'According to the record, while on patrol earlier in the week, the state trooper ran plates of automobiles that drove past him. The acquittee’s plate correlated with an active warrant for her arrest for violation of banking laws.', '-2-', 'When the state trooper arrived at Fuller-Balletta’s home shortly before 9 p.m., he explained the purpose of his visit; and, although he did not have the actual warrant, he offered to show acquittee an electronic copy of the arrest warrant. Fuller-Balletta refused to go with him to his cruiser, began cursing at the officer, and started to kick and punch him. Talia and Marina also punched and kicked the officer and acquittee yelled to one of her daughters to grab a can of mace. The state trooper returned to his cruiser and called for assistance. Three additional state troopers and two Providence police officers responded to the scene; acquittee’s husband also arrived.', 'Meanwhile, Fuller-Balletta, believing that the state trooper and her husband were part of a conspiracy against her, armed herself and her daughters with sharp butcher knives. Fuller- Balletta then barricaded herself and her daughters in a rear bedroom and set fire to the bed. She later explained that she thought it was better for her and her daughters to die than be taken by the police; additionally, she thought that the fire would spark the attention of a neighbor who was a firefighter. The acquittee told Talia and Marina that the police were there to hurt them and that they should be prepared to commit suicide.', 'After a failed attempt to coax acquittee out of the house, the police forcibly entered the home; they almost immediately detected the smell of smoke. They removed the bedroom door―which had been barricaded―saw the burning mattress and found acquittee and her daughters huddled near a back wall. They threatened to kill the police officers with the knives if they entered the room. One of the children stated “Mommy, just tell, just tell me, I will cut my wrists.” The officers called the fire department and retrieved fire extinguishers from their vehicles.', '-3-', 'The acquittee, now holding a knife to her daughter’s throat, refused to vacate the home. Fuller-Balletta’s husband knocked the knife out of her hands, and a state trooper pulled her out of the smoke-filled room; the police then pulled Marina to safety through a window. Tragically, Talia was found near a closet, unresponsive; she was taken to Hasbro Children’s Hospital, where she died four weeks later from multi-system organ failure caused by severe smoke and soot inhalation and burns over 40 percent of her body. The manner of death was ruled homicide.', 'B. Superior Court Trial', 'The acquittee was charged with first-degree murder, first-degree arson, several counts of felony assault and resisting arrest. In November 2004, acquittee was deemed incompetent to stand trial as a result of her mental illness; she was confined to the Eleanor Slater Hospital for treatment. On June 2, 2006, a justice of the Superior Court determined that Fuller-Balletta was competent to stand trial.', 'A bench trial commenced on April 25, 2007. A state trooper and a firefighter testified. To establish her insanity defense, Fuller-Balletta relied on the expert testimony of Joseph Penn, M.D. (Dr. Penn), the director of the child and adolescent forensic psychiatry unit at Rhode Island Hospital. Doctor Penn conducted extensive interviews with acquittee and her family, examined medical records, and concluded that acquittee’s mental functioning had been diminishing for two to three years before the fire. Both Dr. Penn and the state’s expert witness, Barry Wall, M.D. (Dr. Wall), the director of Forensic Services at the Eleanor Slater Hospital, a state-run facility for the mentally ill, concluded that acquittee met the diagnostic criteria for bipolar disorder mixed episode with psychotic features. According to Dr. Penn, because of mental illness, Fuller- Belletta was “unable to appreciate the wrongfulness of her behavior and conform her behavior [to the] requirements of the law[.]” Doctor Wall agreed with Dr. Penn’s diagnosis. It was his', '-4- opinion that, due to her mental illness, Fuller-Balletta could not appreciate the wrongfulness of her conduct and lacked the ability to conform her actions to the requirements of the law. Based on these expert opinions, on May 25, 2007, the trial justice found Fuller-Balletta not guilty by reason of insanity. 3', 'C. Evidentiary Hearings', 'In accordance with § 40.1-5.3-4(b), 4 the trial justice committed acquittee to the custody of the MHRH, “for the purpose of observation and examination to determine whether [she] is dangerous.”', 'Section 40.1-5.3-4(c) required the director to submit a written report stating “whether by reason of mental disability the [acquittee’s] unsupervised presence in the community [would] create a likelihood of serious harm” as that term is defined by § 40.1-5.3- 4(a)(4). 5 The report, written by Dr. Wall, dated June 15, 2007, described Fuller-Balletta’s 3', 'See State v. Collazo, 967 A.2d 1106, 1111 (R.I. 2009) (recognizing that in 1979, this Court adopted the American Law Institute’s Model Penal Code test for legal insanity); see also State v. Johnson, 121 R.I. 254, 267, 399 A.2d 469, 476 (1979) (acknowledging test for legal insanity). In Johnson, we held that:', '“A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of', 'such conduct, as a result of mental disease or defect, his capacity', 'either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform', 'his conduct to the requirements of law is so substantially impaired', 'that he cannot justly be held responsible.” Id. 4', 'General Laws 1956 § 40.1-5.3-4(b) provides:', '“Examination of person found not guilty. If a person is', 'adjudged not guilty of a criminal offense because he or she was', 'insane at the time of its commission, the court shall commit him or', 'her to the custody of the director [of the state Department of', 'Mental Health, Retardation, and Hospitals] for the purpose of', 'observation and examination to determine whether the person is', 'dangerous.” 5', 'Section 40.1-5.3-4(c)(1) provides in pertinent part:', '-5- descent into psychosis; but it recognized that, since she began inpatient treatment at Eleanor Slater Hospital and with appropriate medication, her symptoms had stabilized and her illness had been asymptomatic for an extended period. According to Dr. Wall, at the time of this post- acquittal evaluation, Fuller-Balletta’s illness was in full remission and he opined that she “would be at low risk for harming others if she were to be supervised in the community.” (Emphasis added.) He recommended, however, that her “current status in the hospital be kept the same[.]”', 'Upon receipt of the report, and in accordance with § 40.1-5.3-4(d), 6 in September 2007, the trial justice held an evidentiary hearing (initial hearing) on the issue of acquittee’s dangerousness. Doctor Wall testified that patients such as Fuller-Balletta, who have been found', '“Not later than twenty (20) days from the date of the order of', 'commitment, the director shall prepare and file with the court a', 'report, in writing, in which he or she shall state his or her opinion', 'as to whether by reason of mental disability the person’s', 'unsupervised presence in the community will create a likelihood of', 'serious harm, together with the medical and other data upon which', 'his or her opinion is based.” Additionally, § 40.1-5.3-4(a)(4) defines “Likelihood of serious harm” as follows:', '“(i) A substantial risk of physical harm to the person', 'him[self] or herself as manifested by behavior evidencing serious', 'threats of or attempts at suicide or by behavior which will result in', 'serious bodily harm; or', '“(ii) A substantial risk of physical harm to other persons as', 'manifested by behavior or threats evidencing homicidal or other', 'violent behavior.” 6', 'Section 40.1-5.3-4(d) provides:', '“Hearing. Upon receipt of the report and appropriate notice', 'to the director, the attorney general and the person or his or her', 'counsel, the court shall hold a hearing at which the report shall be', 'introduced, other evidence bearing on the question of the mental', 'condition of the person may be introduced by the parties, and the', 'person may testify, confront witnesses, and present evidence.”', '-6- not guilty by reason of insanity, were typically more dangerous if they were discharged from the hospital completely unsupervised rather than with supervision that gradually is reduced over time. According to Dr. Wall, a person with bipolar disorder, mixed episode has both phases of bipolar disorder—the manic phase and the depressive stage—at the same time, and this circumstance increases the level of severity of the illness. He explained that, although her condition had improved markedly since her admission to the hospital, Fuller-Balletta remained at the early stages of the treatment process. Significantly, and correctly we conclude, Dr. Wall expressed concern that in the three-month interregnum from his written report to his in-court testimony, Fuller-Balletta began exhibiting signs of decompensation—she refused urine to be tested and refused to sign a treatment plan. According to Dr. Wall, these behaviors could be a “ramping up” of an active phase of her bipolar disorder.', 'Most importantly, for purposes of this appeal, Dr. Wall rendered an opinion about acquittee’s risk of dangerousness. He testified as follows:', '“The way I frame my opinion on page 5 [of the report], I think she', 'would be at low risk if she would be supervised in the community.', 'I recognize that [the report] does not directly address the statutory', 'language * * * even though I didn’t type it out in the report, [my', 'opinion] is that I think that her unsupervised presence in the', 'community would create a likelihood of serious harm. That', 'likelihood would be low, low/moderate, but to let her go', 'completely unsupervised is something, in my opinion, would pose', 'a risk. And it’s based on the fact that she has a very serious mental', 'illness.” (Emphasis added.) Doctor Wall was then asked if he could opine, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, as to whether acquittee’s unsupervised presence in the community would create the likelihood of serious harm. Again, he reiterated:', '“[i]n my opinion her unsupervised presence in the community', 'would create a likelihood of serious harm. That is relatively low,', '-7-', 'low/moderate, and she would pose a greater risk if she is', 'unsupervised.” (Emphasis added.)', 'On October 15, 2007, based on the evidence presented by Dr. Wall at the initial hearing and the record before her, the trial justice found, by clear and convincing evidence, that by reason of mental illness, Fuller-Balletta’s unsupervised presence in the community would create a likelihood of serious harm. Thus, the trial justice ordered that acquittee remain in the custody of the MHRH, subject to the statutorily required six-month review set forth in § 40.1-5.3-4(f). 7 It is from this order that Fuller-Balletta appeals.', 'We note that while this appeal has been pending, in accordance with § 40.1-5.3-4(h), 8 there have been two periodic reviews concerning Fuller-Balletta’s condition and whether a likelihood of serious harm would arise if she were granted unsupervised release. Unfortunately, two reports, submitted in July 2008 and again in March 2009, established that acquittee’s illness 7', 'Section 40.1-5.3-4(f) provides in pertinent part:', '“Periodic review. The director shall petition the court to', 'review the condition of a person committed * * * not later than six', '(6) months from the date of the order of commitment and every six', '(6) months thereafter, or when the director no longer believes that', 'the unsupervised presence of the person in the community will', 'create a likelihood of serious harm, whichever occurs first.” 8', 'Section 40.1-5.3-4(h) provides in pertinent part:', '“Hearing on petition. Upon receipt of a petition * * * the', 'court shall hold a hearing at which the parties may introduce', 'evidence bearing on the mental condition of the person, including', 'any reports of the director, and the person may testify, confront', 'witnesses, and present evidence. If the court finds by clear and', 'convincing evidence that by reason of mental disability the', 'presence of the person in the community will create a likelihood of', 'serious harm, it shall enter an order to that effect and he or she', 'shall remain in the custody of the director. If the court does not so', 'find, it shall enter an order discharging the person from the custody', 'of the director.”', '-8- had regressed and her mental condition substantially had deteriorated. She refused to speak with her doctors, refused medical testing and examinations, exhibited violence toward another patient, and became “intensely paranoid.” Based on the record before her, the trial justice determined that there was clear and convincing evidence that Fuller-Balletta’s unsupervised release into the community would create a likelihood of serious harm. After each of those hearings, the trial justice ordered that Fuller-Balletta remain in the custody of the MHRH until the next review.', 'Standard of Review', '“A mixed question of law and fact is one in which ‘the rule of law is undisputed, and the issue is whether the facts satisfy the statutory standard.’” Johnston v. Poulin, 844 A.2d 707, 714 (R.I. 2004) (quoting Direct Action for Rights and Equality v. Gannon, 819 A.2d 651, 662 (R.I. 2003)). This jurisdiction grants an extremely deferential standard of review to the findings of fact of a trial justice sitting without a jury. Cerilli v. Newport Offshore, Ltd., 612 A.2d 35, 39 (R.I. 1992). “We shall not disturb the findings of the trial justice unless it is established that he or she misconceived or overlooked relevant and material evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.” Id.', '“Additionally, this Court reviews issues of statutory interpretation de novo.” International Brotherhood of Police Officers v. City of East Providence, 989 A.2d 106, 108 (R.I. 2010); Waterman v.

Mootness', 'We begin by addressing the issue of mootness that the state raised on appeal. The record discloses that since the inception of this appeal, the director, in accordance with § 40.1-5.3-4(f), twice has petitioned the Superior Court for a periodic review of Fuller-Balletta’s condition, and the trial justice has conducted two hearings. As noted, both reports submitted in connection with the hearings indicated that acquittee’s illness no longer was in remission and that she was experiencing a recurrence of psychotic symptoms. Based on these reports, the trial justice found by clear and convincing evidence that Fuller-Balletta’s unsupervised presence in the community would create a likelihood of serious harm. The state argues that these subsequent orders by the trial justice render acquittee’s appeal from the initial commitment order moot. Additionally, the state argues that because Fuller-Balletta currently is experiencing active psychosis, she may not be discharged from MHRH custody and thus, there is no cognizable relief available to her.', '“This Court has consistently held that a case is moot if the original complaint raised a justiciable controversy, but events occurring after the filing have deprived the litigant of a continuing stake in the controversy.” Credit Union Central Falls v. Groff, 871 A.2d 364, 368 (R.I. 2005) (quoting Associated Builders & Contractors of Rhode Island, Inc. v. City of Providence, 754 A.2d 89, 90 (R.I. 2000)); see also In re New England Gas Co., 842 A.2d 545, 553 (R.I. 2004).', 'Although the present posture of this case raises a question about its justiciability, we are hard-pressed to say that acquittee does not have a continuing stake in the outcome. We equally are cognizant that if an acquittee failed to appeal from the trial justice’s initial finding of dangerousness and commitment based on § 40.1-5.3-4(e), an issue of mootness also would arise. Notably, once found to be dangerous and committed to the custody of the', '- 10 - director upon a finding of not guilty by reason of insanity, the acquittee may “not be paroled, furloughed, placed on outpatient status, or released from a locked facility or otherwise released from the institution where he or she is being treated except upon petition to the court by the director” for a court order. Section 40.1-5.3-4(e). If the evidence before the hearing justice does not warrant a finding that the acquittee remains dangerous, the court “shall order that he or she be discharged at once.” Id. Accordingly, we are of the opinion that the initial finding of dangerousness and the commitment order are relevant considerations for purposes of this appeal. See Lynch v. Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management, 994 A.2d 64, 71 (R.I. 2010) (recognizing an initial license, although “a dead letter for all purposes[,]” may still be challenged since it survives in the form of two subsequent licenses). Although we recognize that this case differs from Lynch in the important respect that Fuller-Balletta’s present mental state is of paramount concern, and is judicially reviewed on a biannual basis, we reject the contention that this case is moot.', 'However, we are also mindful that the issues in this case are viewed through the lens of two subsequent reports of the MHRH, which, unfortunately, indicate that Fuller-Balletta’s condition has worsened, as Dr. Wall had predicted. Although we acknowledge Fuller-Balletta’s contention before this Court and the Superior Court, that if the initial order of commitment was void ab initio, then she should be released, and possibly recommitted pursuant to this jurisdiction’s civil commitment statute, G.L. 1956 § 40.1-5-8 (entitled “Civil court certification”), we disagree with her contention. Essentially counsel is asking this Court, two and a half years later, to declare the initial order invalid and to issue its own order, a result that is not in accordance with the state’s forensic scheme. We decline to do so.', '- 11 -', 'B. The Burden of Proof', 'Before the trial justice, the parties agreed that the state bore the burden to prove acquittee’s dangerousness and further agreed that the burden of proof on the issue of dangerousness was by clear and convincing evidence. Thus, for purposes of this appeal, we deem that to be the controlling burden of proof and shall review the decision under a clear and convincing evidentiary standard. However, we reserve for another day the question of whether this is the appropriate standard of proof for the initial hearing on the question of dangerousness.9 In Jones v. United States, 463 U.S. 354, 363 (1983), the United States Supreme Court recognized that two facts arise from a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity: that the acquitted person has committed an act that constitutes a criminal offense and did so because the person suffers from a mental disability. Id. The Court recognized that Congress has declared that, standing alone, those findings were an adequate basis “for hospitalizing the acquittee as a dangerous and mentally ill person.” Id. at 364. The Court declined to declare that this determination was unreasonable or unconstitutional.', 'Id.', 'Significantly, in Jones, the Court ruled that the Constitution does not require the same standard of proof to support commitment of an insanity acquittee as the clear and convincing standard that is mandated for civil commitments. Id. at 366-67. The Court recognized that the lesser standard of preponderance of the evidence satisfies the Due Process Clause. Id. at 366-68 (recognizing that the fundamental differences between insanity acquittees and persons facing civil commitments negate the necessity for adopting the same standard of proof); see also Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418, 431-33 (1979) (adopting clear and convincing evidence as proper burden of proof for civil commitments). Based on the 9', 'We note that the states are not uniform in the burden of proof on the question of dangerousness, nor, significantly, on which party bears the burden, the state or the acquittee.', '- 12 - agreement of the parties, we do not reach this issue; however, we shall revisit it when it is presented in an appropriate procedural and substantive context.', 'C. The Sufficiency of the Evidence', 'The standard of proof by clear and convincing evidence means:', '“more than a mere exercise in semantics. It is a degree of proof', 'different from a satisfaction by a ‘preponderance of the evidence’', 'which is the recognized burden in civil actions and from proof', '‘beyond a reasonable doubt’ which is the required burden in', 'criminal suits.', '“To verbalize the distinction between the differing degrees', 'more precisely * * * proof by ‘clear and convincing evidence’', 'means that [the trial justice] must believe that the truth of the facts', 'asserted by the proponent is highly probable.” Parker v. Parker,', '103 R.I. 435, 442, 238 A.2d 57, 60-61 (1968).', 'It is well established that after entry of a judgment of not guilty by reason of insanity in a criminal case, the question of future dangerousness of the insanity acquittee is a judicial determination and not a medical conclusion. See Genereux v. Pelosi, 96 R.I. 452, 456-57, 192 A.2d 630, 632 (1963) (discussing G.L. 1956 § 26-4-4, which has been codified into § 40.1-5.3- 4). “Unquestionably the security of the community must be the paramount interest.” State v. Johnson, 121 R.I. 254, 271, 399 A.2d 469, 478 (1979). As a matter of law, penal sanctions against those individuals who are found to lack criminal responsibility are withheld, and the person is acquitted by reason of that mental disease or defect. Id. Likewise, “[i]t would be an intolerable situation if those suffering from a mental disease or defect of such a nature as to relieve them from criminal responsibility were to be released to continue to pose a threat to life and property.” Id. It is therefore the responsibility of the courts to assess whether the acquittee is dangerous, bearing in mind his or her protected liberty interest, as well as the public safety implications the acquittee’s unsupervised release into the community might pose.', '- 13 -', 'We are of the opinion that the trial justice carefully considered the entire record before her and evaluated these factors, aided but not controlled by the opinion of the state’s medical expert—the only witness to provide expert testimony—at the initial commitment hearing. Based on the entire record before her, the trial justice ordered that Fuller-Balletta remain at Eleanor Slater Hospital. We affirm that decision.', 'After a person is adjudged not guilty by reason of insanity, § 40.1-5.3-4(c) sets forth the responsibilities of the director of MHRH, and requires that the director prepare and file a report detailing “his or her opinion as to whether by reason of mental disability the [acquittee’s] unsupervised presence in the community will create a likelihood of serious harm[.]” The phrase “likelihood of serious harm” is defined as:', '“(i) A substantial risk of physical harm to the person', 'him[self] or herself as manifested by behavior evidencing serious', 'threats of or attempts at suicide or by behavior which will result in', 'serious bodily harm; or', '“(ii) A substantial risk of physical harm to other persons as', 'manifested by behavior or threats evidencing homicidal or other', 'violent behavior.” Section 40.1-5.3-4(a)(4).', 'Thus, by engrafting onto the definition of “likelihood of serious harm” a “substantial risk of physical harm” to the person herself or others, the statute required Dr. Wall to state whether, by reason of her mental disability, Fuller-Balletta’s “unsupervised presence in the community will create [a substantial risk of physical harm to the person * * * as manifested by behavior evidencing serious threats of or attempts at suicide or by behavior which will result in serious bodily harm; or * * * [a] substantial risk of physical harm to other persons as manifested by behavior or threats evidencing homicidal or other violent behavior].” Section 40.1-5.3-4(c); 40.1-5.3-4(a)(4).', '- 14 -', 'As noted, in his written report, Dr. Wall stated that at the time of her evaluation in June 2007, Fuller-Balletta was in full remission and “would be at low risk for harming others if she were to be supervised in the community.”', 'However, during the initial hearing, Dr. Wall explained his reasoning and expanded upon Fuller-Balletta’s risk of dangerousness:', '“The way I frame[d] my opinion on page 5, I think she would be at', 'low risk if she would be supervised in the community. I recognize', 'that that does not directly address the statutory language * * * even', 'though I didn’t type it out in the report, is that I think that her', 'unsupervised presence in the community would create a likelihood', 'of serious harm. That likelihood would be low, low/moderate, but', 'to let her go completely unsupervised is something, in my opinion,', 'would pose a risk.” (Emphasis added.) He then repeated his opinion as to a reasonable degree of medical certainty:', '“[i]n my opinion her unsupervised presence in the community', 'would create a likelihood of serious harm. That is relatively low,', 'low/moderate, and she would pose a greater risk if she is', 'unsupervised.” (Emphasis added.)', 'Before this Court, Fuller-Balletta argues that Dr. Wall’s reference to a “low, low/moderate likelihood of serious harm” is a lower level of risk than the “substantial risk of physical harm” that § 40.1-5.3-4(a)(4) mandates. However, he was not required to estimate the level of risk associated with his opinion that her unsupervised presence would create a likelihood of serious harm. The acquittee contends that the trial justice erred when she committed Fuller- Balletta to inpatient treatment based on Dr. Wall’s testimony about a “low, low/moderate risk.” This somewhat semantical argument overlooks the duty of the trial justice, after a finding of not guilty by reason of insanity, to view the entire record— including the report and expert testimony—and decide whether the acquittee is dangerous. This is a legal finding, not a medical determination.', '- 15 -', 'We note that the statute does not require an assessment of the level of risk for a “likelihood of serious harm.” It is § 40.1-5.3-4(a)(4) which defines “likelihood of serious harm” and references a substantial risk of serious physical harm. It is not the function of the Court to add language to an otherwise clear and unambiguous enactment. See McGuirl, 713 A.2d at 197. Section 40.1-5.3-4(c) requires that the director state his or her opinion of whether Fuller- Balletta’s unsupervised presence in the community would create a likelihood of serious harm and does not assign any specific level of risk associated with that likelihood. The term “likelihood” is defined as “[t]he state of being probable; probability.” The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 1042 (3d. ed. 1996). This is a meaning that is commonly understood.', 'The trial justice examined the evidence compiled during the initial hearing as well as the record as a whole, including the report of the director, the horrific crime of which Fuller-Balletta was acquitted based on her mental illness, and significantly, her deteriorated mental state from the time of the acquittal to the commitment hearing. She set forth her statutory obligations, acknowledged the agreed-upon burden of proof, and reviewed the facts in this case. The trial justice recognized that at the time Dr. Wall prepared his report, Fuller-Balletta was asymptomatic; she concluded that this improved condition was based on three years of supervised care and treatment at the hospital. She noted Dr. Wall’s real concern that acquittee should not be released into the community unsupervised, but rather gradually, over time as her treatment warranted. The trial justice found that there were factors that made Fuller-Balletta’s risk for harming others increase or decrease; but she added that it was difficult to accurately predict the level of risk associated with a person who suffers from this illness. The trial justice concluded that Fuller-Balletta’s condition was regressing, notwithstanding her continued hospitalization in a controlled environment. Significantly, the trial justice stated:', '- 16 -', '“[Dr. Wall’s] general position was that [Fuller-Balletta] should', 'stay at the hospital at this point in time and go back to a more', 'restrictive commitment. * * * His main concern was for her and', 'her well-being, from his testimony and certainly his obligations to', 'the State and well being of others, but there’s no question I think at', 'this point in time of Dr. Wall’s opinion that she not be placed in', 'the community unsupervised and there’s been no contradiction to', 'that testimony. The testimony as indicated was given in a full', 'report, written report, and under extensive questioning by both', 'attorneys in the court. * * * [Fuller-Balletta] was not able or', 'should not be released without supervision, [in] that she would', 'present a risk of serious harm to others. There is no other evidence', 'before the Court.” (Emphasis added.)', 'It is our opinion that the trial justice did not err when she found that Fuller-Balletta’s condition met the test of dangerousness and ordered her committed to inpatient treatment in a public institution. The state met the agreed-upon burden of proof of clear and convincing evidence, and acquittee presented no evidence in rebuttal.', 'D. Remaining Issues on Appeal', 'The acquittee’s second argument on appeal is that the trial justice erred (1) when she overlooked the circumstances that led to the homicide in this case and (2) further erred when she failed to take into consideration Fuller-Balletta’s “lack of intentionality and malice.” Fuller- Balletta argues on appeal that “but for the fact that [the state trooper] showed up at [acquittee’s] house at night * * * [acquittee] would not have posed a threat of harm and would not have harmed anyone.” This argument is without merit.', 'The events that precipitated Fuller-Balletta’s delusions are not relevant at this stage of the proceedings. This incident began when a state trooper rang Fuller-Balletta’s doorbell. Given her extreme psychosis, any number of events could have been the catalyst for a similar delusion and psychotic response. Additionally, it matters not that acquittee thought that she was protecting her daughters from a police conspiracy. As the state argues, the motivation behind acquittee’s', '- 17 - bizarre and dangerous behavior has no bearing on this case. The fact remains that acquittee, who was suffering from paranoid psychosis as a result of severe mental illness, was so delusional that her actions killed her daughter. The underlying event that triggered this particular episode of psychosis has no bearing on the question of dangerousness.', 'Fuller-Balletta’s third argument on appeal is that the trial justice erred by not ordering the MHRH to place her in a community-based outpatient setting. We reject this contention because § 40.1-5.3-4 does not, in any way, grant the trial justice the authority to order such a placement.', 'In addressing the question of an acquittee’s dangerousness, the trial justice is constrained by the terms of § 40.1-5.3-4(e). Section 40.1-5.3-4(e) provides:', '“Commitment of person. If the court finds that the person', 'is not dangerous it shall order that he or she be discharged at once.', 'If the court finds that the person is dangerous it shall commit him', 'or her to the custody of the director for care and treatment as an', 'inpatient in a public institution. A person committed under this', 'subsection shall not be paroled, furloughed, placed on outpatient', 'status, or released from a locked facility or otherwise released from', 'the institution where he or she is being treated except upon petition', 'to the court by the director, on notice to the attorney general and', 'the person or his or her counsel, and entry of an order by a judge of', 'the court authorizing the release.” (Emphasis added.)', 'Thus, at the conclusion of the initial hearing, the trial justice has two options—discharge or commitment. If the trial justice determines that the insanity acquittee is not dangerous, then the acquittee must be released forthwith. If the trial justice finds that the person is dangerous, then the acquittee must be committed to inpatient care in a public institution. Section 40.1-5.3- 4(e).', 'As discussed above, the trial justice in this case found that Fuller-Balletta was dangerous; thus, the statute required inpatient treatment. “It is well settled that when the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, this Court must interpret the statute literally and must give the', '- 18 - words of the statute their plain and ordinary meanings.” Waterman, 983 A.2d at 844 (quoting Iselin v.

The statute does not allow for the trial justice to make a determination that an acquittee is dangerous, but then assess the level of risk and sua sponte order the acquittee into a less restrictive program than the statute requires.

8,State : v. : Jose A. Rodriguez. :,criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. The defendant, Jose A. Rodriguez (Rodriguez or defendant), appeals from a Superior Court judgment of conviction for possession of heroin with intent to deliver, possession of cocaine with intent to deliver, and possession of a knife while committing a crime of violence. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on March 3, 2010, pursuant to an order directing both parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised by this appeal should not summarily be decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that the issues raised by this appeal should be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On July 13, 2006, Michael Sama (Sama), intending to buy heroin, called his supplier, Rodriguez. In the briefest of conversations, Sama asked defendant to meet him. The two', '-1- arranged a meeting in a Cadillac in the parking lot of the West River Stop & Shop located on Branch Avenue. Providence Police Officer Richard Piccirillo (Officer Piccirillo) testified that he routinely patrolled that parking lot because it was a well-known drug-trafficking location. On this evening, he observed the two men in the Cadillac seemingly exchange money. Further investigation revealed that the vehicle was unregistered.', 'Officer Piccirillo approached the vehicle and, amid the several discarded needles and syringe caps that littered the front passenger area, observed the occupants engaged in furtive movements, a time-honored investigative tip-off. Officer Piccirillo first ordered Sama out of the vehicle, who complied. He then ordered defendant out of the vehicle, who did not comply. Rodriguez became belligerent and then retrieved a bag of heroin from his sock and ingested it. Officer Piccirillo tried, unsuccessfully, to prevent defendant from swallowing the contraband, and as recompense for his efforts Rodriguez slashed at him with a knife. Officer Piccirillo attempted to subdue Rodriguez and, during the ensuing fracas, defendant hurled a bag of marijuana in Sama’s direction and invited Sama to join him in consuming the merchandise. Sama demurred. It took several more officers and a can of pepper spray to subdue and arrest defendant.', 'During a strip-search in connection with the arrest, the police discovered on defendant’s person several bags containing what later was determined to be cocaine and heroin.', 'The defendant was charged with:', '(1) possession of heroin with intent to deliver; (2) possession of cocaine with intent to deliver; (3) possession of a knife with a blade in excess of three inches while committing a crime of violence; (4) assault with a dangerous weapon; (5) assaulting a police officer while engaged in his duties; and (6) possession of marijuana with intent to deliver. The state presented as witnesses Officer Piccirillo, Officer Richard Esposito, who assisted Officer Piccirillo, Detective Andre Perez, who sent the narcotics to the state', '-2- toxicology laboratory, and Sama, who struck an immunity deal with the prosecution. Sama largely corroborated Officer Piccirillo’s testimony, although he denied exchanging money or narcotics with Rodriguez in the Cadillac. Significantly, Sama disclosed that he had purchased both heroin and cocaine from Rodriguez on two prior occasions. The defendant objected to this testimony, and the trial justice issued the following cautionary instruction:', '“There is no charge before the court as to any transaction', 'other than an alleged transaction or alleged possession, we’ll call', 'it, on July 13th. In other words, the testimony this gentleman is', 'giving about a prior occasion is not offered to form the basis of a', 'criminal charge. You will be limited to the charges in question.', 'All of the changes relate to July 13th, okay?” The defendant did not object to this instruction.', 'After the state presented its evidence, Rodriguez moved for a judgment of acquittal on all counts. 1 The trial justice entered a judgment of acquittal for possession of marijuana with intent to deliver, but denied the motion with respect to the remaining counts. On February 4, 2008, a jury found Rodriguez guilty of possession of heroin with intent to deliver, possession of cocaine with intent to deliver, and possession of a knife with a blade in excess of three inches while committing a crime of violence, to wit: possession of cocaine with intent to deliver, but found him not guilty of assaulting a police officer while engaged in his duties. On February 11, 2008, Rodriguez’s motion for a new trial was denied. A judgment of conviction was entered on March 31, 2008, from which Rodriguez timely appeals.2', 'The defendant advances three arguments on appeal. First, he contends that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal on both counts charging him with 1', 'The state previously had dismissed Rodriguez’s charge of assault with a dangerous weapon in accordance with Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. 2', 'Although Rodriquez filed his notice of appeal before the judgment was entered, we treat a prematurely filed notice of appeal as timely. State v. Ros, 973 A.2d 1148, 1159 n.14 (R.I. 2009).', '-3- possession of cocaine and heroin with intent to deliver, as well as possession of a knife while committing a crime of violence. Second, defendant renews his argument that Sama should not have been permitted to disclose their previous drug transactions. Finally, Rodriguez argues his motion for a new trial erroneously was denied.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“Whenever this Court reviews the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal, we apply the same standard as that applied by the trial justice; namely, we ‘must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, * * * giving full credibility to the state’s witnesses, and draw therefrom all reasonable inferences consistent with guilt.’” State v. Ros, 973 A.2d 1148, 1159 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. Caba, 887 A.2d 370, 372 (R.I. 2005)). “This Court must evaluate just the evidence ‘that the prosecution claims is capable of supporting proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.’” State v. Reyes, 984 A.2d 606, 616 (R.I. 2009) (quoting Ros, 973 A.2d at 1159). “This Court must uphold the denial of the motion for judgment of acquittal if the record shows sufficient evidence to merit a jury verdict of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” Reyes, 984 A.2d at 616.', 'Our review of a trial justice’s decision on a motion for a new trial similarly is deferential. “Provided that the trial justice has ‘articulated an adequate rationale for denying a motion,’ * * * a trial justice’s ruling on a new trial motion is entitled to great weight.” State v. Bergevine, 942 A.2d 974, 981 (R.I. 2008) (quoting State v. Hesford, 900 A.2d 1194, 1199 (R.I. 2006)). “Accordingly, ‘[a] trial justice’s ruling on a new-trial motion will not be overturned unless the trial justice was clearly wrong or unless he or she overlooked or misconceived material and', '-4- relevant evidence that related to a critical issue in the case.’” Id. (quoting State v. Lynch, 854 A.2d 1022, 1046 (R.I. 2004)).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'The defendant advances two arguments why his motion for judgment of acquittal erroneously was denied. The defendant first argues that there is insufficient evidence to support the jury’s convictions. Although it is undisputed that police officers found cocaine and heroin on his person, Rodriguez contends that there is no evidence he intended to distribute it. He further argues that failure to prove that he possessed either heroin or cocaine with an intent to deliver would necessarily require acquittal on the charge of possession of a knife while committing a crime of violence. 3', 'The defendant’s insufficiency of the evidence argument in favor of acquittal focuses mainly on the cocaine charge. 4 He directs this Court to Sama’s testimony that although he set out to buy heroin from defendant, Sama did not state that was looking to buy cocaine. This distinction, however, relies on a crucial misunderstanding of the intent element of the charge. It is not Sama’s intent that is germane; rather, the only relevant inquiry is what did Rodriguez 3', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-47-2(2) defines possession of cocaine with intent to deliver as a crime of violence. 4', 'Although Rodriguez states that there is insufficient evidence that he possessed heroin with intent to deliver, he does not provide any support for that contention within his brief. As we have stated before, “a mere passing reference to an argument is insufficient to merit appellate review.” Tondreault v. Tondreault, 966 A.2d 654, 664 (R.I. 2009) (quoting DeAngelis v. DeAngelis, 923 A.2d 1274, 1282 n.11 (R.I. 2007)).', '-5- intend when he made his way to the Stop & Shop to meet his customer, to whom he previously had delivered both cocaine and heroin. Intent, of course, can be established by inference. 5', 'Although a relatively small amount of cocaine was found on Rodriguez, the state presented evidence that the cocaine was individually packaged and that Sama and defendant had an existing buyer-seller relationship that included the delivery of cocaine. Furthermore, the brief telephone call, followed by a rendezvous at a well known drug-trafficking location, provided a more than adequate basis for a jury to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant arrived at the Stop & Shop intending to sell narcotics; both heroin and individually packaged cocaine. Accordingly, we are satisfied that the trial justice properly denied defendant’s motion for acquittal on the charge of possession of cocaine with intent to deliver. Moreover, our decision upholding the judgment of conviction for this count conclusively dispatches defendant’s related argument that acquittal for possession of cocaine with intent to deliver would require acquittal on the charge of possession of a knife with a blade exceeding three inches in length while committing a crime of violence. 6', 'The defendant next argues that the trial justice erred when he allowed Sama to testify that he had purchased narcotics from defendant on two previous occasions. He avers that this testimony is prohibited by Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. “This Court has 5', 'Rodriguez also appears to attack Sama’s credibility by noting that he testified at trial “within minutes of receiving a hand-written immunity agreement from the prosecutor.” Of course, when reviewing a denial of a motion for acquittal, we must afford full credibility to the state’s witnesses. See Ros, 973 A.2d at 1159. 6', 'The defendant also argues that, because the criminal information referred only to possession of cocaine for the “crime of violence” element of this charge and not possession of heroin, the trial justice erred by instructing the jury that a guilty verdict for either narcotics possession charge would satisfy the “crime of violence” element of the knife charge. Because we affirm the conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to deliver, we need not address the consequence, if any, of the trial justice’s jury instruction.', '-6- stated that ‘[t]he admissibility of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial justice, and this Court will not interfere with the trial justice’s decision unless a clear abuse of discretion is apparent.’” State v. Gautier, 950 A.2d 400, 411 (R.I. 2008) (quoting State v. Brown, 900 A.2d 1155, 1159 (R.I. 2006)). Moreover, we often have stated that “[t]he line between Rule 404(b) evidence presented for the impermissible purpose of demonstrating propensity and Rule 404(b) evidence presented for one of the specific non-propensity exceptions is ‘both a fine one to draw and an even more difficult one for judges and juries to follow.’” Brown, 900 A.2d at 1160 (quoting State v. Garcia, 743 A.2d 1038, 1052 (R.I. 2000)).', 'Rule 404(b) prohibits the use of evidence of past crimes, wrongs, or acts “to show the defendant’s propensity to commit the crime with which he is currently charged.” 7 State v. John, 881 A.2d 920, 926 (R.I. 2005). We have characterized this prohibition of evidence to “prove the character of a person in order to show that the person acted in conformity therewith” as the “general exclusionary” language within Rule 404(b). See, e.g., State v. Gaspar, 982 A.2d 140, 148 (R.I. 2009); State v. Merida, 960 A.2d 228, 232 (R.I. 2008); Garcia, 743 A.2d at 1050. However, the second sentence of Rule 404(b) makes equally plain that such evidence may be “admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake or accident * * *.” Moreover, we have treated the list contained within the second sentence of Rule 404(b) as examples, rather than a complete 7', 'Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence provides:', '“Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not', 'admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that', 'the person acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be', 'admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive,', 'opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence', 'of mistake or accident, or to prove that defendant feared imminent', 'bodily harm and that the fear was reasonable.”', '-7- enumeration, of permitted purposes. See State v. Lemon, 497 A.2d 713, 720 (R.I. 1985) (“This list of exceptions was certainly not designed to be exhaustive or all-inclusive.”); State v. Pona, 948 A.2d 941, 950 (R.I. 2008) (evidence also admissible when prior acts “are interwoven or in instances when introduction is necessary for ‘a trier of fact to hear a complete and, it is to be hoped, coherent story so as to make an accurate determination of guilt or innocence.’”) (quoting State v. Gomes, 690 A.2d 310, 316 (R.I. 1997)).', 'Although we have described the non- exhaustive list in Rule 404(b) as “exceptions,” they are not instances of true exceptions in which propensity reasoning is permitted. 8', 'Rather, the second sentence in Rule 404(b) is more accurately described as a simple reiteration of the broad admissibility principles that undergird our rules of evidence. See Advisory Committee’s Note to Rule 401 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence (low relevancy threshold reflects the “evidentiary maxim, ‘[a] brick is not a wall’”) (quoting McCormick on Evidence § 185 (2d ed. 1972)). “Although Rule 404(b) mandates that evidence of other crimes or bad acts is not admissible to prove the propensity of a defendant to 8', 'David P. Leonard, The New Wigmore: A Treatise on Evidence, ch. 4, § 4.4 at 230 (2009), provides a thorough explanation of this seemingly semantic distinction:', '“[T]o say that evidence under [Rule 404(b)] comes in under an', '‘exception’ ignores both the meaning of that word and the way in', 'which evidence is offered at trial. When a party’s presentation of', 'any item of evidence meets an objection, it is the proponent’s', 'obligation to state the purpose for which it is being offered.

If the proponent’s argument', 'makes clear that the evidence is being offered to prove a character-', 'based propensity to commit the charged misconduct, the court', 'must refuse to admit it because it is subject to the broad rule of', 'exclusion (unless it fits into one of the true exceptions, such as the', 'rule permitting a criminal defendant to present evidence of her [or', 'his] character to prove innocence).

Parkhurst, 706 A.2d 412, 424 (R.I. 1998); see Lemon, 497 A.2d at 721 (“evidence of a separate crime may be admissible if it has independent relevance in respect to the proof of an element material to ‘the chain of proof of the crime in issue’”) (quoting State v. Acquisto, 463 A.2d 122, 128 (R.I. 1983)); see also David P. Leonard, The New Wigmore: A Treatise on Evidence, ch. 4, § 4.3.2 at 227 (2009) (“Federal courts in all circuits have characterized the codified rule as inclusionary, and almost all states follow the same view.”). Thus, it is only when evidence of prior crimes, wrongs, or acts is offered to prove that the accused has a criminal disposition and, therefore, is more likely to have committed the crime for which he stands accused, that Rule 404(b) requires its exclusion. See State v. Graham, 941 A.2d 848, 861 (R.I. 2008).', 'However, a mere showing by the proponent that the evidence is offered for a proper purpose does not necessarily end the inquiry. In Huddleston v. United States, 485 U.S. 681, 689 (1988), the United States Supreme Court identified three additional protections against the admission of unfairly prejudicial evidence of prior crimes, wrongs, or acts. 9 First, a trial justice may exclude evidence of a prior act under Rule 104(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence if she concludes that the jury could not reasonably find by a preponderance of the evidence that the prior act occurred. 10 Huddleston, 485 U.S. at 690. Second, a trial justice may exclude evidence 9', 'Although we are not bound by the United States Supreme Court’s interpretation of its rules of evidence, because our rules closely hew to their Federal counterpart, we find the Court’s analysis exceedingly persuasive. See State v. Gaspar, 982 A.2d 140, 148 (R.I. 2009) (Rhode Island Rules of Evidence are “substantially analogous” to Federal rules). 10', 'Rule 104(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence provides:', '-9- under Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence if she finds that its probative value is substantially outweighed by the potential for unfair prejudice. Huddleston, 485 U.S. at 691; see Gaspar, 982 A.2d at 148 (“Rule 403 cuts across the rules of evidence and is always a consideration in a trial justice’s ruling on the admissibility of Rule 404(b) evidence.”); see also Graham, 941 A.2d at 862 (“We have said that ‘[u]nless evidence is of limited or marginal relevance and enormously prejudicial, the trial justice should not act to exclude it.’”) (quoting Wells v. Uvex Winter Optical, Inc., 635 A.2d 1188, 1193 (R.I. 1994)). Lastly, a trial justice must, upon the request of counsel, issue a cautionary instruction to the jury reminding it not to consider the evidence for propensity purposes. Huddleston, 485 U.S. at 691; see Brown, 900 A.2d at 1160 (when requested, “the trial justice should issue specific instructions to the jury explaining ‘the limited purpose [or purposes] for which the jury may consider it’”) (quoting Garcia, 743 A.2d at 1052).', 'The defendant contends that any evidence of prior criminal activity is presumed inadmissible under Rule 404(b) as inherently prejudicial. Such a view does not comport with our longstanding interpretation of the rule. So long as the evidence is used for a purpose other than suggesting that defendant acted in conformity with a criminal disposition, Rule 404(b) does not require its exclusion. This decision is committed to the trial justice’s discretion. The trial justice found that evidence of prior drug transactions was probative of Rodriguez’s intent when the two men spoke on July 13, 2006.

Reis, 815 A.2d 57, 62 (R.I. 2003), we held that evidence that the defendant previously had engaged in drug transactions by having the same person deliver a Federal Express package to him was “interwoven and represent[ed] a common scheme or plan” because it clarified the defendant’s intent when police caught him engaging in the nearly identical transaction. We are of the opinion that the present case is analogous. Evidence that defendant and Sama knew each other only in connection with the purchase and sale of narcotics illuminates defendant’s intent when he drove to the Stop & Shop parking lot with both cocaine and heroin. Moreover, the trial justice, sua sponte, issued a cautionary instruction to guard against any potential unfair prejudice. Accordingly, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion in permitting this testimony.', 'In his final argument seeking reversal, the defendant challenges the trial justice’s denial of his new-trial motion and simply refers this Court to the arguments he made in favor of acquittal. Although we review a denial of a motion for new trial under a different standard, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive material evidence nor was her ruling clearly wrong.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set out above, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed and the papers of the case are returned to the Superior Court.', '- 11 -', 'Robinson, J., concurring. I readily concur in the result reached by the Court in this case. I also concur in the Court’s analysis and discussion concerning the denial of the motion for judgment of acquittal and concerning the denial of defendant’s motion for a new trial. However, while I agree with the Court that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion under Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence 11 when she allowed testimony about prior drug transactions between defendant and Sama, I feel compelled to disassociate myself, with all due respect, from the Court’s lengthy discussion and extended exegesis of that important and much- debated 12 evidentiary rule. To my mind, that discussion contains unnecessary dicta, and I respectfully disagree with its characterization of this Court’s Rule 404(b) jurisprudence.', 'In my view, there is absolutely no reason for the Court to go on at length with respect to Rule 404(b) in this case. All members of the Court agree unequivocally that the evidence at issue was admissible under the “intent” exception that is expressly provided for in Rule 404(b). I fail to see why it does not suffice to simply hold that the evidence about previous purchases of narcotics by Sama was admissible to show defendant’s felonious intent and therefore is not barred by Rule 404(b). That is all that need be said, and I would end the Rule 404(b) discussion at that point. See, e.g., Grady v. Narragansett Electric Co., 962 A.2d 34, 42 n.4 (R.I. 2009) (referring to “our usual policy of not opining with respect to issues about which we need not opine”); see also United States v.

While I acknowledge that the federal appellate courts and many state courts have characterized Rule 404(b) as a rule of inclusion, I have yet to locate an opinion from this Court which characterizes the rule in that manner—whereas several opinions of this Court clearly indicate that Rule 404(b) should be viewed as a rule of exclusion.

The plaintiffs brought this action pursuant to the Access to Public Records Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 2 of title 38 (APRA), and the Government Oversight and Fiscal Accountability Review Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 2.3 of title 37, as enacted by P.L. 2006, chs. 172, 646 (GOFARA), under which the plaintiffs sought records relating to state-agency-privatization contracts. The defendants contend that the Superior Court justice erred in ruling that the plaintiffs were not required to exhaust administrative remedies prior to instituting this suit. The defendants also assert that the Superior Court justice erred in deciding that, under the GOFARA, the state was required to determine whether services now performed by private contractors were formerly performed by agency personnel at any time in the past. Finally, the defendants contend that the Superior Court justice erred in awarding attorneys’ fees to the plaintiffs.', '-1-', 'We heard argument pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After examining the written and oral submissions of the parties, we are of the opinion that further briefing or argument is unnecessary. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'In June 2006, the General Assembly enacted the Government Oversight and Fiscal Accountability Review Act, overriding a prior gubernatorial veto.

The addendum also must “contain a summary of contracted private contractor employees for each contract, reflected as full-time equivalent positions, their hourly wage rate, and the number of private contractor employees and consultants for the current and previous fiscal year.” Id. The section finally provides: “The addendums [sic] shall be open records.” Id.', 'In February 2007, former Executive Director of Rhode Island Council 94 Dennis R. Grilli sent a letter to the Governor requesting “[e]ach State Agency addendum to their submitted budget requests listing all privatization contracts with the required information.” On March 6,', '-2- 2007, the Governor’s executive counsel responded that the Office of the Governor did not maintain in its possession the public records requested and referred Mr. Grilli to the State Budget Office within the Rhode Island Department of Administration (DOA), or alternatively to the individual state agencies.', 'The next day, Mr. Grilli sent a letter to then-DOA Director Beverley E. Najarian requesting the same records. On March 26, 2007, a DOA attorney responded that “the [DOA] does not have any of the documents set forth in your request.” In their brief to this Court, defendants assert that the DOA did not possess the budget addenda requested by plaintiffs because “the GOFARA statute passed June 23, 2006 and the budget submissions were due in September 2006. As the agency [interpreted the GOFARA as operating only] on a prospective basis * * * there were no such privatization contracts during this limited time period.”', 'On May 17, 2007, plaintiffs filed the instant action in the Superior Court naming the Governor and the directors of twelve state agencies as defendants. The complaint requested (1) a writ of mandamus directing defendants to create, maintain, and provide the privatization addenda; (2) mandatory injunctive relief with regard to the creation and production of the privatization records; and (3) a declaratory judgment to the effect that defendants were obligated to compile and/or produce the records requested pursuant to the GOFARA. The plaintiffs further sought any other relief the Superior Court deemed appropriate, including attorneys’ fees and costs.', 'In response, defendants maintained that plaintiffs’ lawsuit was premature because plaintiffs had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies under the APRA. Moreover, they argued that plaintiffs lacked standing to bring suit because they failed to allege any harm.', '-3- Finally, defendants challenged plaintiffs’ proposed interpretation of the GOFARA as unreasonable and overbroad.', 'The Superior Court justice based her decision upon the memoranda filed by the parties; there were no oral arguments or evidentiary hearings in the matter. She issued a written decision in the case on November 5, 2008. In that decision, she concluded that state agencies were required to provide information about privatization contracts valued at $100,000 or more so long as the contracts concerned services that previously were provided by public employees. She specifically noted that the statute “does not place any time restrictions upon how far back in the past one should look to determine whether the services once were provided by agency employees.”', 'On the issue of exhaustion of administrative remedies, the Superior Court justice interpreted § 38-2-8 of the APRA as permitting a party to pursue administrative remedies but not requiring that they be pursued. She emphasized that the section provides that a person “may” petition the chief administrative officer to review a denial of access to records and then “may” file a complaint with the Attorney General if the chief administrative officer determines that the record is not subject to disclosure. The statute also specifically states that “[n]othing within [the] section shall prohibit any individual from retaining private counsel for the purpose of instituting proceedings for injunctive or declaratory relief in the [S]uperior [C]ourt * * *.” Section 38-2- 8(b). The Superior Court justice therefore deemed such legal proceedings to be an alternate remedy. In addition, she ruled that it would have been futile to require plaintiffs to exhaust administrative remedies because both the Governor’s office and the DOA denied that they possessed the documents sought by plaintiffs, and futility is a recognized exception to the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies.', '-4-', 'On the issue of standing under the APRA, the Superior Court justice concluded that plaintiffs had standing to bring the instant action. Section 38-2-3(a) provides that “every person or entity shall have the right to inspect and/or copy [public] records * * *.” Because the denial of access to a public record could itself constitute harm, the Superior Court justice found that plaintiffs had standing under the APRA.', 'The Superior Court justice next concluded that § 37-2.3-3(5) of the GOFARA was unambiguous and that its plain and ordinary meaning therefore must be given effect. She noted that under § 37-2.3-3(5) (2006 enactment) a privatization contract is defined as “an agreement” between “a non-governmental person or entity” and an agency “to provide services, valued at one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) or more, which are substantially similar to and in lieu of, services heretofore provided, in whole or in part, by regular employees of an agency.” Upon consideration of various dictionary definitions, the Superior Court justice concluded that the term “heretofore,” as used in the statute, generally means “in the past, or formerly.” She therefore ruled that the GOFARA reporting and disclosure requirements encompassed privatization contracts concerning services that were provided by agency employees at any time in the past. The Superior Court justice further ruled that, by its plain language, the GOFARA applied retroactively to the year before it was enacted.', 'The Superior Court justice granted plaintiffs declaratory relief and ruled in their favor on the APRA claim. She ordered defendants to compile and the Governor’s office and/or the DOA to release privatization contract addenda for each budget request submitted since June 23, 2006. In light of this declaratory relief, she stated that plaintiffs had an adequate remedy at law and declined to grant their requests for injunctive relief and a writ of mandamus. Although the Superior Court justice recognized that there was no evidence that defendants had willfully or', '-5- knowingly violated the requirements of the APRA, she nevertheless awarded attorneys’ fees to plaintiffs.', 'On November 25, 2008, a hearing was held before the Superior Court justice to clarify any ambiguities in her decision. The Superior Court justice ruled that defendants must respond to requests made by plaintiffs with regard to the privatization records and must release those addenda within sixty days. 1 A final judgment in the matter was entered on January 2, 2009.', 'Thereafter, on January 6, 2009, 2 the Superior Court justice issued an order in accordance with her decision, stating, in pertinent part, that (1) plaintiffs were not required to exhaust administrative remedies before filing an action for declaratory judgment in the Superior Court; (2) the GOFARA governs any privatization contract concerning services that were performed by agency employees, in whole or in part, at any time in the past; and (3) plaintiffs were entitled to legal fees, subject to a hearing on the reasonableness of the fees and the amount sought.', 'Another hearing was held before the Superior Court justice on January 8, 2009. At this hearing the Superior Court justice granted a motion for entry of partial final judgment 3 pursuant to Rule 54(b). 4 She also noted that it would be necessary for a corrected judgment to be entered 1', 'The Superior Court justice also clarified the portion of her written decision in which she denied plaintiffs’ request for a writ of mandamus. She noted that, in accordance with her declaratory judgment in favor of plaintiffs, defendants were ordered to respond to the public-record requests previously submitted by plaintiffs and to release all pertinent records. In light of that order, a writ of mandamus to the same effect would be redundant and moot. 2', 'An initial order entered in error on November 18, 2008, later was vacated by the Superior Court justice, and was replaced by a corrected order on January 6, 2009. 3', 'Judgment was partial because the issue of the reasonableness of plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees was still outstanding. 4', 'We were unable to locate defendants’ motion for partial final judgment in the record; however, the Superior Court justice referred to it during the hearing on January 8, 2009.', '-6- and denied the state’s motion to stay judgment pending appeal.', 'A corrected partial final judgment was entered on January 27, 2009, from which defendants appeal. 5', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“A Superior Court decision granting or denying declaratory relief is reviewed with great deference by this Court.” Providence Lodge No. 3, Fraternal Order of Police v.

Specifically, defendants argue that the Superior Court justice’s decision that the statute applies to any services performed by agency employees at any time in the past creates an absurd result contrary to the intentions of the General Assembly. The defendants instead suggest that the statute’s focus is prospective and that it requires the reporting of privatization contracts concerning services performed by public employees as of the date of the statute’s enactment.', 'Finally, defendants argue that an award of attorneys’ fees to plaintiffs was not appropriate. The defendants contend that the Superior Court justice should have applied the standard for awarding attorneys’ fees in a declaratory-judgment action, not under the APRA. Further, defendants suggest that, because the Superior Court justice found that there was no evidence of a knowing and willful violation of the APRA, an award of attorneys’ fees was unwarranted.', 'A', 'Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies', 'The defendants contend that under § 38-2-8 of the APRA plaintiffs were required to exhaust administrative remedies before filing the instant action in the Superior Court. They suggest that the issue of whether plaintiffs had a right to inspect the records first should have been decided by the director of the DOA and then appealed to the Attorney General. The plaintiffs respond that the APRA specifically permits suits for injunctive and declaratory relief', '-8- and that exhaustion of administrative remedies is not a requirement in a declaratory-judgment action. Moreover, plaintiffs argue that the administrative remedies set forth in § 38-2-8 are not mandatory.

This is because “exhaustion of administrative remedies (1) ‘aids judicial review by allowing the parties and the agency to develop the facts of the case, and (2) it promotes judicial economy by avoiding needless repetition of administrative and judicial factfinding, perhaps avoiding the necessity of any judicial involvement.’” Doe v. East Greenwich School Department, 899 A.2d 1258, 1266 (R.I. 2006) (quoting Almeida, 722 A.2d at 259). Such a requirement will not be imposed, however, in contravention of the plain language and manifest intent of a statute. See State v. Germane, 971 A.2d 555, 592 (R.I. 2009) (“We will not construe a statute so as to frustrate the clearly expressed intent of the General Assembly.”).', 'Turning to the language of § 38-2-8, it is clear that the section sets forth various administrative remedies without requiring that they be pursued prior to bringing an action in the Superior Court, as evidenced by the repeated use of the word “may” in the section. It is an axiomatic principle of statutory construction that the use of the term “may” denotes a permissive, rather than an imperative, condition. See Quality Court Condominium Association v. Quality Hill Development Corp., 641 A.2d 746, 751 (R.I. 1994) (“[T]he use of the word ‘may’ rather than the word ‘shall’ indicates a discretionary rather than a mandatory provision.”) (citing Carlson v. McLyman, 77 R.I. 177, 182, 74 A.2d 853, 855 (1950) (noting that “the ordinary meaning of the word ‘may’ is permissive and not compulsive”)).', '- 10 -', 'Moreover, the final sentence of § 38-2-8(b) explicitly provides that “[n]othing within this section shall prohibit any individual or entity from retaining private counsel for the purpose of instituting proceedings for injunctive or declaratory relief in the [S]uperior [C]ourt * * *.” It is clear from the foregoing that the General Assembly manifestly intended that those seeking access to public records have recourse to the Superior Court, even without prior exhaustion of alternative, administrative remedies. 6', 'This interpretation is consistent with our well-settled understanding of the General Assembly’s intent in adopting the APRA. “[T]his Court has ‘long recognized that the underlying policy of the APRA favors the free flow and disclosure of information to the public.’” In re New England Gas Co., 842 A.2d 545, 551 (R.I. 2004) (quoting Providence Journal Co. v. Sundlun, 616 A.2d 1131, 1134 (R.I. 1992)). Allowing requestors to apply to the courts for equitable relief without first pursuing alternate avenues of administrative appeal promotes the public’s timely access to government records and is not inconsistent with the General Assembly’s intent.', 'B', 'Statutory Construction', 'The defendants also challenge the Superior Court justice’s conclusions regarding the scope of the privatization contract reporting requirements under the GOFARA. Section 37-2.3- 3(5), as enacted by P.L. 2006, chs. 172, 646, § 1, of the GOFARA defines a privatization contract as', '“an agreement or combination or series of agreements by which a', 'nongovernmental person or entity agrees with an agency to provide 6', 'This conclusion is not inconsistent with this Court’s previous characterization of G.L. 1956 § 38-2-8.

In Rhode Island Federation of Teachers, this Court merely enumerated the various options available to individuals or entities that had been denied access to public records and did not endorse mandatory exhaustion of administrative remedies. Id.', '- 11 -', 'services, valued at one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) or', 'more, which are substantially similar to and in lieu of, services', 'heretofore provided, in whole or in part, by regular employees of', 'an agency.” 7 (Emphasis added.)', 'The Superior Court justice found that this definition did not place any time restrictions on how far into the past one should look to determine whether the services previously were provided by agency employees.', 'The defendants maintain that by including the phrase “heretofore provided,” the General Assembly instead intended that the GOFARA apply only to new privatization contracts entered into after passage of the act. The defendants contend that the state’s obligations under the statute as interpreted by the Superior Court justice would be absurd and unduly burdensome because the unlimited historical scope would render the state’s review costly and impossible to complete.', 'We concur with the Superior Court justice’s conclusion that the language of § 37-2.3- 3(5), as the statute was then constituted, was not ambiguous. The term “heretofore” means “[u]p to now; before this time[.]” Black’s Law Dictionary 745 (8th ed. 2004). We are satisfied, therefore, that by the plain and ordinary meaning of its terms, the phrase “services heretofore provided” encompasses all services performed at any time in the past by regular employees of a state agency. 7', 'This definition has since been amended by the General Assembly. See P.L. 2008, ch. 121, § 3 (revising the definition of “Privatization or privatization contract” to mean “an agreement or combination or series of agreements by which a non-governmental person or entity agrees with an agency to provide services expected to result in a fiscal year expenditure of at least one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000) (as of July 1 of each year, the amount shall increase to reflect increases in the consumer price index calculated by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics for all urban consumers nationally during the most recent twelve (12) month period for which data are available or more), which would contract services which are substantially similar to and in replacement of work normally performed by an employee of an agency as of June 30, 2007”).', '- 12 -', 'We recognize that defendants have advanced an alternative interpretation of § 37-2.3-3(5) that is both reasonable and seemingly consistent with the overall transparency objectives of the GOFARA. We conclude, however, as did the Superior Court justice, that the General Assembly spoke in clear and unambiguous language. We also share defendants’ concern that the statute’s lack of time limitations may render “compliance expensive and well-nigh impossible.” We therefore construe the statutory language “heretofore provided” as containing an element of reasonableness. Cf. Raso v. Wall, 884 A.2d 391, 395 (R.I. 2005) (“[I]t would be absurd to read ‘at any time’ as constituting a limitless ‘Open Sesame’ in which an applicant could file an application for postconviction relief at literally any time without weight being given to the possible prejudice to the state wrought by the passage of time. Accordingly, we construe the statutory term as meaning at any reasonable time.”). Since the General Assembly has amended this provision to place specific time restrictions on this definition, however, we decline to opine as to what would constitute a reasonable limitation of § 37-2.3-3(5) under its previous terms.', 'C', 'Attorneys’ Fees', 'Finally, defendants argue that the Superior Court justice should not have awarded attorneys’ fees to plaintiffs. They contend that attorneys’ fees are not available in an action for declaratory judgment and that the Superior Court justice incorrectly applied the APRA standard for attorneys’ fees and costs. The plaintiffs respond that they filed the instant action under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 30 of title 9, the GOFARA, and the APRA, and that the APRA does not require a showing of a willful and knowing violation by defendants for plaintiffs to be entitled to attorneys’ fees.', '- 13 -', '“This Court adheres to the ‘American rule’ that litigants generally are responsible for their own attorneys’ fees and costs.” Napier v.

Following a jury trial, the defendant, Justin Prout, was convicted of unlawful breaking and entering of a dwelling house, assault with a dangerous weapon, and simple assault. The defendant appeals these convictions, arguing that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial. The defendant contends that the trial justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence pertaining to (1) the trial witnesses’ credibility; and (2) the defendant’s alleged diminished capacity.', 'This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts 1 and Procedural History', 'This case stems from a violent altercation that occurred in Providence on April 1, 2004, and ultimately led to defendant’s arrest. Juliana Martins Lorenzana, one of three complaining witnesses, testified that she was at the home she shared with her two children and her brother, Michael Martins, on the night of the incident. Ms. Lorenzana’s friend, Juan Pena, and Mr. Martins’s friend, Felix Ortega, also were at the house that evening. Sometime before 10 p.m., Mr. Pena left to purchase food. At approximately 10 p.m., Ms. Lorenzana was upstairs watching television with her children when she heard a rattling noise at the door of the house. She testified that she went downstairs and opened the door, expecting it to be Mr. Pena returning with the food. Instead, she was surprised to discover that it was defendant—a man with whom she was acquainted, but whom she neither trusted nor liked. At once, Ms. Lorenzana attempted to close the door to bar defendant’s entrance into the house.', 'Despite her efforts, however, defendant pushed it open. The defendant allegedly used enough force to cause her to fall backwards onto the stairs and to leave a hole where the door struck the wall.', 'Ms. Lorenzana testified that, after defendant gained entry into her home, he walked into the living room, where Mr. Ortega was playing video games. She then saw defendant swing a knife at Mr. Ortega, as the latter tried to defend himself. Ms. Lorenzana ran upstairs and called 911.', 'When she came back downstairs, she saw Mr. Ortega run into the kitchen and obtain a knife. Ms. Lorenzana also testified that Mr. Martins, who had been upstairs taking a shower, came downstairs and became involved in the fracas. At one point in the incident, Ms. Lorenzana witnessed defendant forcefully holding Mr. Martins down, and she saw a lot of blood. Ms. 1', 'These facts were adduced from the testimony of the trial witnesses. It should be noted that defendant disputes several of their statements.', '-2- Lorenzana further stated that, in the course of the altercation, defendant and Mr. Ortega both dropped their knives. She picked up the knives and brought them upstairs, away from the mêlée. Ms. Lorenzana additionally testified that she gave the knives to the police after they arrived at her home.', 'Mr. Ortega also testified about the altercation, and his account largely paralleled that of Ms. Lorenzana. Mr. Ortega stated that defendant was wielding a knife when he entered the house and that defendant “tried to kill [him]” with it. Mr. Ortega candidly admitted that he reacted by retrieving a “bigger” knife from the kitchen and using it against defendant.', 'Mr. Ortega also indicated that defendant did not have permission to enter the house that night.', 'In fact, he testified that Mr. Martins warned defendant to leave on three separate occasions and then “just kicked him.” According to Mr. Ortega, during the brawl that followed, defendant dropped his knife and grabbed a dumbbell, prompting Mr. Ortega to drop his knife and wrest the dumbbell from defendant. Mr. Ortega struck defendant with the dumbbell when defendant began attacking and biting Mr. Martins. Mr. Ortega insisted that he was attempting to defend himself when he wielded the knife and dumbbell against defendant.', 'Mr. Martins also testified for the state about the events of April 1, 2004, and his testimony was consistent with both Mr. Ortega’s and Ms. Lorenzana’s accounts. Mr. Martins indicated that he did not give defendant permission to enter the house that evening and, in fact, asked defendant to leave the house several times. Mr. Martins admitted that he then kicked defendant, causing him to drop his knife. He further testified that defendant jumped on top of him and began biting him. In response, Mr. Ortega hit defendant with a dumbbell. Shortly thereafter, the police arrived.', '-3-', 'Three Providence police officers testified for the state about the incident. The first to testify was Officer Kevin Costa. Officer Costa testified that when he arrived, Ms. Lorenzana was outside screaming “[h]e’s got a knife. He’s got a knife. He’s going to kill him.” Upon entering the home, Officer Costa observed defendant on top of Mr. Ortega 2 “pounding on” him. Officer Costa drew his weapon and ordered the two men to stop fighting. When the men complied, Officer Costa observed that defendant was bleeding from his head. Subsequently, the police arrested defendant and took him to the hospital for treatment of his injuries.3', 'Officer Timothy Pickering also testified about the incident. He stated that Ms. Lorenzana gave him only one knife and that she informed him that it was the knife defendant used during the altercation.', 'The final witness for the state was Det. James Clift. Detective Clift testified that when he arrived on the scene that evening, he noticed that the house was “quite a mess * * *.” Specifically, he mentioned that the furniture was in disarray, there was glass and blood on the floor, a hole in the wall behind the door, and plaster on the floor below the hole. He also indicated that he received one knife from Officer Pickering, but that he did not find any blood or fingerprints on the knife.', 'Leo Kobayashi, M.D., the emergency-room physician who treated defendant on the night of the incident, testified for the defense about defendant’s condition. He stated that defendant was intoxicated when he was admitted to the Rhode Island Hospital emergency room at 11 p.m.; his blood-alcohol level was measured at 0.175. Moreover, defendant was uncooperative and 2', 'According to the complaining witnesses, defendant actually was attacking Mr. Martins. 3', 'The defendant suffered a 1.5-centimeter laceration on the parietal side of his scalp, requiring six staples; a 3.5-centimeter laceration on his right palm, requiring twelve sutures; and an abrasion to his back. It is undisputed that defendant suffered the most severe injuries.', '-4- verbally abusive; as a result, the hospital staff placed him in restraints and administered antipsychotic medication in an effort to calm him.', 'On June 14, 2004, defendant was indicted by a grand jury for burglary, assault with a dangerous weapon, and simple assault. A jury trial began on February 8, 2006, and lasted three days. The trial justice instructed the jury on burglary, the lesser-included offense of breaking and entering, assault with a dangerous weapon, and simple assault. The trial justice also sua sponte included an instruction regarding defendant’s alleged diminished capacity. The jury acquitted defendant of burglary, but it convicted him of breaking and entering, assault with a dangerous weapon, and simple assault.', 'The defendant made a motion for a new trial on February 14, 2006. At a hearing on the motion on February 21, 2006, defendant argued that the state’s witnesses lacked credibility and, therefore, the jury should have rejected their testimony. The trial justice denied defendant’s motion, finding the witnesses credible and the evidence sufficient to sustain the convictions. The trial justice noted that the testimony given by the state’s witnesses consistently indicated that defendant forced his way into the house and that he was the initial aggressor. Moreover, the trial justice stated that the physical evidence—the hole in the wall and the plaster on the floor— corroborated the complaining witnesses’ testimony. The trial justice also mentioned that the testimony consistently indicated that Mr. Ortega acted reasonably in defending himself. Finally, the trial justice concluded that the jury’s decision to acquit defendant of burglary, and instead convict on the lesser-included offense of breaking and entering, demonstrated that the jury understood its instruction and took into account defendant’s diminished capacity. The defendant', '-5- filed a notice of appeal on April 28, 2006. 4 A judgment of conviction was entered on May 2, 2006.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'When deciding a motion for a new trial, “the trial justice acts as a thirteenth juror and exercises independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.” State v.

Gomez, 848 A.2d 221, 234 (R.I. 2004)). “[T]he trial justice must (1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently asses the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” State v.

The defendant contends that the testimony of the three complaining witnesses—Ms. Lorenzana, Mr. Ortega, and Mr. Martins— was wholly lacking in credibility and, therefore, could not be credited by any reasonable fact- finder. Specifically, defendant asserts that Ms. Lorenzana’s testimony is not credible because she testified that she gave both knives to the police, but Officer Pickering testified that he received only one knife. The defendant suggests that Ms. Loranzana’s version of events was intended to exculpate Mr. Ortega from any criminal responsibility for defendant’s injuries. Moreover, defendant insists that Mr. Ortega’s testimony was designed to shield himself from criminal charges arising from his actions during the fight and is, therefore, wholly not credible.', 'After a careful review of the trial justice’s ruling, we are satisfied that he performed the correct analysis in deciding defendant’s motion for a new trial. The trial justice adequately articulated his reasons for denying defendant’s motion. He thoroughly summarized the evidence presented at trial and found that there was “no question that the three principals presented by the [s]tate were credible witnesses.”', 'Moreover, the trial justice found that the state produced sufficient evidence to sustain all three convictions. 5 The trial justice concluded that had he been a member of the jury, he “would have voted in the same fashion, that is, to convict the defendant 5', 'The trial justice discussed the fact that the second knife was missing, but deemed that fact irrelevant. He explained that nobody denied the existence of a second knife; in fact, all three complaining witnesses openly testified that both defendant and Mr. Ortega had knives.

We discern no error in this determination.', '-7- of these charges.” The trial justice’s findings concerning credibility and sufficiency of the evidence are entitled to great weight and are not clearly erroneous.', 'The defendant further argues that he suffered from a diminished capacity on the night of the incident because of his intoxication and mental illness and, therefore, he could not form the intent required to commit the crimes of which he stands convicted. The doctrine of diminished capacity is a defense that', '“recognizes that although an accused was not suffering from a', 'mental disease or defect when the offense was committed', 'sufficient to exonerate him of all criminal responsibility, his mental', 'capacity may have been diminished by intoxication, trauma, or', 'mental disease so that he did not possess the specific mental state', 'or intent essential to the particular offense charged.” State v.', 'Correra, 430 A.2d 1251, 1253 (R.I. 1981). The defendant argues that while considering the motion for a new trial, the trial justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence concerning defendant’s diminished capacity.', 'In Rhode Island, the defense of diminished capacity is available only for specific-intent crimes. See generally State v. Doyon, 416 A.2d 130 (R.I. 1980). A specific-intent crime is one that', '“most commonly involve[s] the designation of ‘a special mental', 'element which is required above and beyond any mental state', 'required with respect to the actus reus of the crime.’ * * * Thus,', 'when a statute defines an offense only by describing the unlawful', 'act, without further referencing an intent to do an additional act or', 'to achieve a further consequence, the proscribed offense is a', 'general-intent crime.” State v.

The defendant’s contention regarding diminished capacity is irrelevant to his convictions of simple assault and assault with a dangerous weapon because they are so-called “general-intent” crimes. The defendant was charged with burglary, which is a specific-intent crime, but he was acquitted on that count. With respect to the conviction of the lesser-included offense of breaking and entering, the trial justice explicitly referred to the defendant’s diminished capacity and agreed with the jury’s decision to convict the defendant of the lesser-included offense. 6 The trial justice’s findings are entitled to great weight, and we discern no error in his decision.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

The plaintiff’s complaint alleged unlawful discrimination by the defendants, his former employers, on the basis of a disability. The plaintiff contends that an unresolved issue of material fact precluded summary judgment, and that the hearing justice failed to draw all reasonable inferences in his favor in deciding the motion. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After reviewing the record and considering the parties’ submissions, we are satisfied that the appeal may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'The defendant Custom Craft is a family-owned business that manufactures cushions, umbrellas, and related products for patio specialty stores and furniture manufacturers. The', '-1- business employs approximately twenty-five people and is located in West Warwick, Rhode Island. Mr. Auclair, also a named defendant, is the president of Custom Craft. The plaintiff was employed at Custom Craft from 1983 until 2004, most recently as plant manager. As plant manager, plaintiff was the company’s second-in-command after Mr. Auclair.', 'Mr. Poulin testified at a deposition that since at least 1998 he has suffered from anxiety and depression, for which he sought medical treatment. He did not recall anyone employed at Custom Craft telling him that he could not attend medical appointments for his anxiety and depression during the first several years he received such treatment.', 'On March 12, 2002, Mr. Poulin suffered what the parties term a “nervous breakdown” at work and subsequently was out of work for two weeks.', 'After this episode, he attended appointments with Paul Hoffman, a social worker, once or twice a week, and occasionally with a psychiatrist. On June 4, 2002, however, plaintiff had a second “nervous breakdown” in Mr. Hoffman’s office. As a result, he was admitted to Butler Hospital for several days and was out of work for two weeks.', 'Thereafter, Mr. Poulin continued to attend therapy appointments for his anxiety and depression. According to plaintiff, around this time, Mr. Auclair questioned him on three or four occasions as to why he was absent from work to attend medical appointments so frequently, and as to the length and the scheduled times of his appointments. Mr. Auclair told him, however, to take whatever time he needed. Mr. Poulin also acknowledged that Mr. Auclair did not question him further about such appointments between July 2002 and July 2004. Mr. Poulin testified that, notwithstanding his need to attend these appointments, he was able to perform his job and that he did not request any special accommodations.', '-2-', 'The plaintiff alleges that, beginning in 2002, Mr. Auclair reprimanded him on numerous occasions for his job performance and changed his job duties “for the sole purpose of harassing and discriminating against” him. Further, in October 2002, plaintiff received a discretionary bonus that was substantially less than bonuses given to two other employees. 1', 'The defendants maintain that Mr. Poulin’s job performance had deteriorated and that he had engaged in “acts of insubordination.” The defendants claim Mr. Auclair needed to have weekly or biweekly conversations with plaintiff concerning his job performance. The plaintiff admits to having had such conversations, but suggests such meetings were rare and “either were very short and insignificant” or did not involve important issues.', 'The defendants specifically assert that plaintiff delegated work poorly.', 'Further, defendants contend that plaintiff let supplies run low, did not do a good job of organizing the “filling” department, and secretly checked the payroll for executive bonus information when he did not have authorization to do so.', 'Additionally, defendants allege that plaintiff instigated “verbal altercations” on numerous occasions with several coworkers. While plaintiff admitted to contentious conversations with at least two coworkers, plaintiff claims he did not instigate these disputes. Mr. Auclair additionally indicated that plaintiff complained about him to several employees and that he also had heard that plaintiff told several employees that he (plaintiff) “didn’t care anymore.”', 'Mr. Auclair testified that in May 2004 he met with plaintiff to specifically address plaintiff’s attitude and performance problems. A few months later, on July 27, 2004, Mr. Auclair received a faxed note from Dr. Michael Martin. The letterhead of the note indicated that Dr. 1', 'The defendants claim, however, that plaintiff received approximately the same amount of money over his base salary as the other two individuals when his participation in Custom Craft’s profit-sharing program is taken into consideration.', '-3- Martin was a doctor of osteopathic medicine who was board certified in internal medicine. The note simply stated that plaintiff would not be able to return to work until August 9, 2004; it did not provide any reason necessitating the absence. It is undisputed, however, that the condition diagnosed by Dr. Martin was high blood pressure.', 'A short time after receiving the faxed note, and while Mr. Poulin still was out of work, Mr. Auclair ran into Mr. Poulin at a comedy show on a Friday night. Mr. Auclair told plaintiff to come see him at work the next morning and, when plaintiff complied, he terminated plaintiff’s employment. Mr. Auclair stated that he could no longer tolerate plaintiff’s lack of respect for him as his employer. He explained that plaintiff showed his lack of respect in the following ways:', '“By faxing in his doctor’s papers, saying he was going to be out', 'for two weeks.

The plaintiff then filed the instant action in Superior Court on October 7, 2005.', '-4-', 'Mr. Poulin alleged that he is disabled because he has been diagnosed with anxiety and depression.

The defendants asserted that plaintiff’s claims of discrimination could not succeed because he was not, in fact, disabled under the law. The defendants also maintained that plaintiff failed to establish a nexus between his alleged disability and his termination.', 'A hearing on defendants’ motion for summary judgment was held on August 5, 2008. In her bench decision, the hearing justice did not decide whether plaintiff was disabled within the meanings of FEPA and RICRA. 3 Instead, the hearing justice ruled that, even assuming plaintiff was disabled, there was no evidence supporting his claim that defendants took adverse employment action against him because he suffered from anxiety and depression.', 'The hearing justice noted “[t]here were definitely issues as to [Mr. Auclair’s] job satisfaction with [plaintiff] unrelated to the * * * doctor appointments.” Ultimately, however, the hearing justice determined plaintiff was terminated because of the faxed note and because Mr. Auclair saw him at a comedy show during the two-week period he was on medical leave in July 2004.

The plaintiff argues that the hearing justice did not draw all reasonable inferences in his favor as the nonmoving party. 5', 'Specifically, plaintiff argues the hearing justice erred in determining that the medical note from Dr. Martin had no apparent connection to plaintiff’s anxiety or depression. The plaintiff also argues that, even if the note had no apparent connection to plaintiff’s condition, the hearing justice erred in ruling there were no material facts in dispute to support plaintiff’s assertion that he was terminated because of his anxiety or depression. The plaintiff argues the statement by Mr. Auclair in his deposition that the faxed medical note was “the straw that broke the camel’s back” created a material issue of fact in this regard. The plaintiff suggests that this statement indicates Mr. Auclair had, over time, grown tired of plaintiff missing work for medical appointments. If this were the case, plaintiff contends, his termination was the result of his anxiety or depression.', 'A prima facie case of disability discrimination requires a showing that (1) the employee was disabled within the meaning of the relevant statutes, (2) the employee was able to perform the essential functions of his or her job (with or without reasonable accommodation), and (3) the employer discharged the employee in whole or in part because of the disability. DeCamp v. 5', 'The plaintiff also asserts that the medical note was not properly before the Superior Court, because defendants did not provide the note to the court with their motion for summary judgment. At the hearing on defendants’ motion for summary judgment, however, plaintiff did not object when the hearing justice asked to see the medical note, or even when she read the medical note into the record.

The evidence presented does not suggest that plaintiff was terminated because of his anxiety and depression. Rather, the evidence suggests that Mr. Auclair terminated plaintiff because of plaintiff’s failure either to explain his two-week absence from work in July 2004 or to attempt to mitigate the hardship it created for defendants, coupled with his presence at a Friday night comedy show during that period. Further, the record offered no evidence that Mr. Auclair had reason to believe that plaintiff’s absence in July 2004 was related to his anxiety and depression, or that Mr. Auclair terminated plaintiff because he did not approve of him leaving work to attend medical appointments.', 'The only notice defendants received of plaintiff’s two-week absence did not indicate that the absence was related to plaintiff’s anxiety and depression: Dr. Martin was board certified in internal medicine, and his letterhead so indicated. Doctor Martin was treating plaintiff for high blood pressure, which plaintiff claims was related to his anxiety. The note, however, simply excused plaintiff from work without providing further explanation. There are many reasons a doctor of internal medicine might excuse a patient from work. We fail to see any evidence in the record from which an inference reasonably can be drawn connecting the note from a doctor of internal medicine to plaintiff’s anxiety and depression.', '-8-', 'Further, plaintiff failed to present evidence connecting Mr. Auclair’s “straw that broke the camel’s back” comment to Mr. Poulin’s anxiety and depression. Rather, the evidence indicates that plaintiff’s on-the-job conduct led Mr. Auclair to characterize the July 2004 events as the proverbial “last straw.” Mr. Auclair stated that he had reason to believe plaintiff did not respect him and that plaintiff was not sufficiently dedicated to his job. Additionally, plaintiff’s medical leaves of absence after his “nervous breakdowns” occurred two years prior to his termination, and plaintiff admitted that Mr. Auclair did not speak with him about his medical appointments during that two-year period. We agree with the hearing justice that this timing “dictates against concluding that his anxiety and his depression caused the termination.”', 'The initial burden was on the plaintiff to establish a prima facie case of employment discrimination.

13,: v. : Marsha N. Byrne et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. This case arises from the unsuccessful sale of two adjacent pieces of property in North Kingstown, Rhode Island. The plaintiffs, Clare A. Parker and Constance A. Emry, appeal from the Superior Court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants, Marsha N. Byrne and Robin B. Corsi. The plaintiffs contend that summary judgment was improperly granted in favor of the defendants because genuine issues of material fact are in dispute. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'The plaintiffs, two sisters, owned two parcels of land in North Kingstown, Rhode Island. The plaintiffs owned 44 Church Lane (lot No. 68), which was improved with a single-family home, as tenants in common for approximately two decades. One of the sisters, Ms. Parker, also held title in her name alone to a lot on Fowler Street (lot No. 275). Lot No. 275 abutted lot No. 68 and was landlocked and unimproved.', '-1-', 'On June 25, 2005, plaintiffs entered into two purchase-and-sales agreements (the agreements) with defendants for lot Nos. 68 and 275 (collectively the properties). 1', 'The agreement for the sale of lot No. 68 was between plaintiffs, Ms. Parker and Ms. Emry, and defendant Ms. Byrne. The agreement for the sale of lot No. 275 was between plaintiff Ms. Parker and defendants, Ms. Byrne and Ms. Corsi. The agreements were contingent upon each other and contained provisions requiring plaintiffs to deliver “good, clear, insurable, and marketable title * * * except easements, restrictions of record and municipal regulations, if any.” Both agreements also stated that “all notices * * * shall be in writing.” The closing was scheduled for August 23, 2005 at 10 a.m.; and, upon the execution of the agreements, defendants remitted a total deposit of $28,740 to plaintiffs.', 'Ms. Byrne testified in her deposition that at some point, around the beginning of July 2005, she asked Linda Butcher, plaintiffs’ real estate agent, whether another person who had bid on the properties would be interested in being assigned defendants’ rights under the agreements. She explained that she was apprehensive about moving to a new place and was having some difficulty adjusting to a recent loss of eyesight. According to Ms. Byrne, Ms. Butcher informed her that the assignment would not be possible because the other bidder had several different contingencies in his or her contract.', 'Ms. Butcher provided a similar account of these conversations in her affidavit and deposition. Ms. Butcher further testified that, after Ms. Byrne asked her to contact the other bidder, Ms. Byrne expressed concern that it would be difficult for her to purchase the properties because she had encountered construction problems with a house she owned in Jamestown. 1', 'The agreement for lot No. 275 was signed and dated by Ms. Byrne, Ms. Corsi, and Ms. Parker on June 25, 2005. The agreement for lot No. 68 was signed and dated by Ms. Byrne and Ms. Emry on June 25, 2005, and signed and dated by Ms. Parker on June 26, 2005. The parties, however, assert that both agreements were executed on June 25, 2005.', '-2-', 'John McCloskey, defendants’ title attorney, requested and received a zoning certificate from the Town of North Kingstown (the town) dated August 5, 2005. The zoning certificate stated that lot Nos. 68 and 275 were “considered combined and [could not] be sold separately.” It further stated that the certificate was being supplied in accordance with G.L. 1956 § 45-24-54, but that “zoning is a matter of interpretation,” and it expressly disclaimed any “guarantee or warrant [of] the accuracy of the information contained” in it.', 'At some point after receiving the certificate, Mr. McCloskey called Ms. Butcher, made her aware of the certificate, and informed her that it might not be correct but that he would investigate the situation. According to his deposition testimony, the zoning certificate surprised him because it was his understanding that merger generally is based on the common ownership of properties, and these properties were not commonly owned. He stated that he then contacted KarenLu LaPolice, an employee of the town’s planning department. Mr. McCloskey reported that Ms. LaPolice informed him that lot No. 275 was the subject of an illegal subdivision in the 1950s or the 1960s, the properties had merged, and the lots could not be sold separately.', 'Mr. McCloskey, according to his deposition, then spoke to the town solicitor. He stated that the solicitor intimated that the town would require the unmerging of the lots and warned that the town could undertake enforcement. According to Mr. McCloskey, the solicitor essentially said that pursuing the issue further would be opening a “can of worms.” He also recounted that, at that time, the solicitor was unwilling to acknowledge that Ms. LaPolice may have been wrong.', 'After speaking to the solicitor, Mr. McCloskey told Ms. Butcher that defendants did not wish to close on the properties because the town solicitor had taken the position that the properties were merged. Mr. McCloskey told her that he could not resolve the matter himself.', '-3- According to Ms. Butcher, this communication occurred sometime between August 17 and August 22, 2005.', 'Mr. McCloskey testified at his deposition that defendants had been willing and anxious to purchase the property once it could be purchased according to the agreements and that defendants had called him repeatedly to ask about rescheduling the closing date. He further stated that he had decided not to schedule a closing in light of the town’s position that the lots could not be sold separately, because to do so would have exposed the buyers to the risk of fines and additional expense. “At the very least,” he said, “it would have put [Ms. Byrne in] a position to * * * contend with the town as to whether or not there was a violation.”', 'According to Mr. McCloskey, neither plaintiffs nor their real estate agent were provided written notice of the outstanding zoning issues. Ms. Parker, however, acknowledged at her deposition that, prior to the scheduled closing date, she had been made aware of the zoning- certificate issue.', 'The closing did not occur as scheduled on August 23, 2005. Shortly thereafter, on September 13, 2005, lot No. 68 was sold at a foreclosure auction. Because of the contingent nature of the agreements, Ms. Parker was thus precluded from conveying lot No. 275. All parties now agree that the zoning certificate erroneously represented that the two lots had merged.', 'On November 14, 2005, plaintiffs filed a complaint against defendants alleging breach of contract, fraud, and tortious interference with contractual and prospective contractual relations. The defendants filed an answer and counterclaimed on January 6, 2006, alleging breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, and intentional misrepresentation/fraud. The defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on April 18, 2006, which a hearing justice denied on June 20, 2006.', '-4-', 'On June 14, 2007, defendants filed a second motion for summary judgment and an alternate motion for partial summary judgment, and, in response, plaintiffs filed a motion in opposition and a cross-motion for summary judgment. On November 28, 2007, an order was entered granting defendants’ motion for summary judgment and denying plaintiffs’ cross-motion for summary judgment. Subsequently, plaintiffs and defendants agreed to a consent judgment granting summary judgment in favor of defendants on all counts. 2 The plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal.', 'The plaintiffs contend on appeal that the hearing justice erred in granting summary judgment in favor of defendants because issues of material fact remain as to who breached the agreements and whether defendants misrepresented their reason for not performing under the agreements. Further, plaintiffs assert that the hearing justice erred by holding as a matter of law that the properties’ titles were unmarketable to a “reasonable buyer.” The plaintiffs also argue that an issue of fact exists as to whether the zoning certificate rendered the title unmarketable. Furthermore, plaintiffs contend that, because the zoning certificate did not render the title unmarketable, the determination of who breached the contract is a material issue of fact.', 'The defendants maintain that the hearing justice did not err in granting summary judgment in their favor. The defendants assert that they did not perform under the agreements 2', 'On November 28, 2007, final judgment was entered in favor of defendants on all claims raised in plaintiffs’ complaint. However, it appears from the record that plaintiffs filed, and later withdrew, a motion for relief from final judgment. In the consent order, the hearing justice vacated the final judgment, and judgment was entered, under Rule 54(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, in favor of defendants on all of plaintiffs’ claims. Counts 2 and 3 of defendants’ counterclaim, relating to negligent misrepresentation and intentional misrepresentation, were not subject to these initial motions for summary judgment. The plaintiffs do not appeal the denial of their motion for summary judgment concerning their third count, relating to tortious interference with contractual relations. Therefore, plaintiffs’ breach- of-contract and fraud claims and defendants’ breach-of-contract claim are the only issues remaining on appeal.', '-5- because first, the zoning certificate led them to believe there was a defect in the titles and then second, the properties became unavailable once lot No. 68 was lost to foreclosure.', 'The defendants specifically assert that plaintiffs had an obligation to deliver good and marketable title and that no reasonable buyer would have closed on the properties, given the circumstances. Furthermore, defendants argue that, because there was no “time-is-of-the-essence” clause in the agreements, the matters could have been resolved, and a new closing could have been arranged within a reasonable time, had the properties not fallen into foreclosure. According to defendants, plaintiffs thus failed to show that they were ready, willing, and able to perform within a reasonable time after the scheduled closing date.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'It is well settled that this Court reviews a hearing justice’s grant of summary judgment de novo.

The particular sequence of events in the case at bar admits of only one reasonable disposition, and thus we proceed to resolve the breach-of-contract question as a matter of law.', 'The unchallenged facts derived from the affidavits, depositions, and supporting documentation in the record establish that plaintiffs breached the agreements. After entering into agreements for the purchase of the two properties, defendants received a zoning certificate from the town, later determined to be erroneous, stating that the two properties had merged and could not be sold separately. The defendants’ agent provided oral notice, but not written notice, to plaintiffs’ agent about the purported merger of the properties, and this information subsequently was relayed to plaintiffs. The defendants demonstrated concern over the certificate and sought an explanation and resolution from the town planning department and the town solicitor. At some time thereafter, but before the scheduled closing date, defendants’ agent informed plaintiffs’ agent that he had reached an impasse, that he could not resolve the matter himself, and that defendants did not wish to close until the question of whether the two lots could be sold separately was resolved. The plaintiffs, however, did not take any action to resolve the matter. The closing date came and went, and approximately three weeks after the scheduled closing, one', '-7- of the lots was sold at a foreclosure auction, thereby making performance of both agreements impossible.', 'It is undisputed that, under the two mutually contingent agreements, plaintiffs had a contractual duty to convey two marketable titles to defendants. We are of the opinion that plaintiffs breached the agreements by failing to present two marketable titles to defendants within a reasonable time after the scheduled closing date, thereby excusing defendants from performance under the agreements. See Women’s Development Corp., 764 A.2d at 158 (“A party’s material breach of contract justifies the nonbreaching party’s subsequent nonperformance of its contractual obligations.”).', 'The zoning certificate was issued pursuant to § 45-24-54, which provides that, “[i]n order to provide guidance or clarification, the zoning enforcement officer or agency shall, upon written request, issue a zoning certificate or provide information to the requesting party as to the determination by the official or agency within fifteen (15) days of the written request.” As the statute and common experience suggest, it is customary practice for buyers to obtain such zoning certificates to gain clarification and guidance concerning the properties they wish to purchase. We recognize that a zoning certificate is not legally binding. In the case at bar, however, we are satisfied that the certificate, albeit erroneous, stating that the lots could not be sold separately, coupled with the town solicitor’s warning that the town could take enforcement action, raised sufficient concerns to warrant a postponement of the closing for a reasonable period to enable plaintiffs to provide defendants with reasonable assurances that the properties were, in fact, two distinct parcels.', 'Within a mere three weeks after the scheduled closing date, however, one of the lots was sold at a foreclosure sale; and, as a result, plaintiffs could no longer perform under the', '-8- agreements. Thus, as defendants aptly noted, the unchallenged facts reflect that the two titles purportedly were unavailable prior to the foreclosure sale and, once the foreclosure sale took place, plaintiffs could no longer convey the properties. Therefore, defendants never had the opportunity to close on the two properties for which they originally had bargained.', 'Significantly, neither of the agreements contained a time-is-of-the-essence clause. It is well settled that generally, “contract provisions relating to time do not by their mere presence in an agreement make time of the essence thereof so that a breach of the time element will excuse nonperformance.” Lajayi v. Fafiyebi, 860 A.2d 680, 688 (R.I. 2004) (quoting Jakober v. E.M. Loew’s Capitol Theatre, Inc., 107 R.I. 104, 114, 265 A.2d 429, 435 (1970)). Therefore, parties to a contract for the sale of property have a reasonable amount of time after the scheduled closing date within which to complete the closing. 1800 Smith Street Associates, LP v. Gencarelli, 888 A.2d 46, 53 (R.I. 2005). In the case at bar, it is clear that, but for the foreclosure, plaintiffs and defendants could have resolved the zoning certificate issue within a reasonable time after the scheduled closing date.', 'The plaintiffs did not take the opportunity to resolve the matter, but instead allowed lot No. 68 to fall into foreclosure. Specifically, there is no suggestion in the record that they took any affirmative action to resolve the confusion stemming from the zoning certificate, to delay the foreclosure sale, or to inform plaintiffs’ own agent or defendants that the properties were at risk of foreclosure.', 'Moreover, we are satisfied that providing the sellers with oral notice rather than written notice was not a material breach. Both plaintiffs’ agent, Ms. Butcher, and one of the plaintiffs herself were aware of defendants’ concern over the zoning certificate. The plaintiffs were not prejudiced by defendants’ failure to provide written notice because oral notice was sufficient to', '-9- enable them to pursue resolution of the zoning certificate issue. See 17A Am.

This argument is wholly unavailing.', 'To establish a prima facie fraud claim, “the plaintiff must prove that the defendant made a false representation intending thereby to induce plaintiff to rely thereon and that the plaintiff justifiably relied thereon to his or her damage.” Bitting v.

As he placed the telephone call, he looked out a window and observed a man running to the house next door. The man came back, however, and rushed at Mr. Keo’s front door, kicking in the door about an inch. As Mr. Keo struggled to keep the door', '-1- closed, he heard several gunshots. Mr. Keo’s son, who was eleven years old at the time of the incident, testified at trial that he observed a second man appear and shoot the would-be intruder twice in the head. The shooter then fled.', 'When the police arrived shortly thereafter, they discovered the body of a young man on the front steps of the Keo home, lying in a pool of blood. One of the man’s legs protruded into the broken door frame and his hands were handcuffed behind his back. The police were able to identify the victim as William Sanchez from an identification card on his body. A neighbor directed the police to the Veazie Street School field across the street, where they found a large pool of blood, footprints, and a .40-caliber shell casing. 1', 'On February 23, 2000, defendant was charged with murder, murder while in the perpetration of a kidnapping, 2 kidnapping with intent to extort, conspiracy to commit kidnapping, and commission of a crime of violence with a firearm. Before trial began, defendant submitted a motion in limine seeking to preclude two witnesses from testifying “that [d]efendant was observed in possession of a handgun” prior to the day on which Sanchez was slain. The defendant argued that such testimony constituted evidence of prior bad acts that was inadmissible under Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. The hearing justice denied the motion and proceeded to empanel a jury.', 'At trial, Danny Jimenez, who was separately convicted of kidnapping with intent to extort and conspiracy to commit kidnapping after pleading nolo contendere with respect to his 1', 'The murder weapon was never found. However, the shell casing found in the Veazie Street School field matched the casings found outside the Keo residence. 2', 'This charge eventually was dismissed pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.', '-2- conduct on the night of Sanchez’s murder, testified for the state. 3 Jimenez testified that he met defendant between six and eight months before the murder. Of particular import to this appeal, he described defendant as frequently carrying a handgun. 4', 'Mr. Jimenez testified that on February 16, 2000, defendant drove to Jimenez’s house with another man, Sergio Salazar.', 'Jimenez said that he entered the back seat of defendant’s automobile and the three men drove around for at least forty-five minutes, smoking marijuana and drinking alcohol. They then drove to a residence identified as “Alex’s house.” 5 The defendant and Salazar went inside and shortly thereafter emerged with Sanchez. Salazar opened the left back-seat door for Sanchez, and the group drove to the Veazie Street School field, at which point defendant told everyone to get out of the car. Jimenez noticed that a coat was draped over Sanchez, concealing his hands.', 'According to Jimenez, throughout the drive defendant had been berating Sanchez about an outstanding debt. Sanchez pleaded for more time to come up with the money. Jimenez testified that he initially believed defendant was simply trying to frighten Sanchez, but he grew apprehensive when he observed defendant point a gun at Sanchez. Jimenez testified that he unsuccessfully tried to dissuade defendant from further violence and attempted to leave when defendant turned the gun on Jimenez and ordered him to stay. Moments later defendant shot Sanchez. Jimenez, Salazar, and defendant initially ran to their car and fled the scene, but after several minutes they returned to the area. Jimenez testified that as he stood in the field, he watched defendant run up to Sanchez, who at the time was kicking at the door of a white house. He then observed defendant shoot Sanchez twice. 3', 'Jimenez received no special treatment from the state in exchange for his testimony; indeed, he declined its offer of a lesser sentence in exchange for his cooperation as a witness for the state. 4', 'Immediately following this testimony, the trial justice issued a limiting instruction to the jury, reminding it to consider the evidence only “[t]o the extent it bears on the defendant’s intentions, his knowledge, or identity, and his plan.” 5', 'Alex was identified only as a friend of defendant.', '-3-', 'Kristen Lemoine, who described herself as a motherly figure in Sanchez’s life, also testified at trial and offered a motive for the killing. She indicated that Sanchez had agreed to pay a debt owed to defendant by Sanchez’s uncle. 6 She also said that, several months earlier, she had been present when defendant and Sanchez had gotten into a heated argument over payment of that debt, during which defendant brandished a gun. Lemoine testified that when she asked defendant to put away his gun out of concern for her daughter, he responded that he “[didn’t] give a s**t about me, my daughter, or anybody, and he’s not afraid of anybody.” After Sanchez said something to him, however, he put the gun away. At the conclusion of Lemoine’s testimony, the trial justice issued a cautionary instruction related to her account of that incident. 7', 'On January 27, 2006, the jury convicted defendant on all charges. The defendant moved for a new trial on February 2, 2006, which motion the trial justice denied. The judgment of conviction was entered on March 31, 2006, from which defendant timely appeals. 8', 'The defendant renews his contention on appeal that the trial justice erred in permitting Jimenez and Lemoine to testify that they each had observed defendant in possession of a handgun prior to the murder. He argues that such evidence is inadmissible under Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. 6', 'Sanchez’s reasons for agreeing to pay his uncle’s debts never were explained at trial. 7', 'The trial justice instructed the jury,', '“You heard this last witness describe a prior occasion the', 'defendant allegedly displayed a firearm that she spoke of in', 'connection with speaking with [Sanchez] regarding some debt,', 'allegedly. Bear in mind that the defendant is not charged with any', 'crime, or criminal transgression as to that day with respect to any', 'firearm, or alleged misconduct on that day. Any such evidence, to', 'the extent that it has been admitted, is provided to you for the very', 'limited purpose, and that is, as it may, in your minds, relate to the', 'defendant’s motive, or his intent, or his plan, or his identity with', 'respect to charges for which he is presently on trial.” 8', 'Although defendant prematurely filed his appeal, because his judgment of conviction later was entered, we will treat his appeal as timely. State v. Ros, 973 A.2d 1148, 1159 n.14 (R.I. 2009).', '-4-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“This Court has stated that ‘[t]he admissibility of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial justice, and this Court will not interfere with the trial justice’s decision unless a clear abuse of discretion is apparent.’” State v. Gautier, 950 A.2d 400, 411 (R.I. 2008) (quoting State v. Brown, 900 A.2d 1155, 1159 (R.I. 2006)). Moreover, we recognize that “[t]he line between Rule 404(b) evidence presented for the impermissible purpose of demonstrating propensity and Rule 404(b) evidence presented for one of the specific non-propensity exceptions is ‘both a fine one to draw and an even more difficult one for judges and juries to follow.’” Brown, 900 A.2d at 1160 (quoting State v. Garcia, 743 A.2d 1038, 1052 (R.I. 2000)).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'Rule 404(b) prohibits the use of evidence of past crimes, wrongs, or acts “to show the defendant’s propensity to commit the crime with which he is currently charged.” 9 State v. John, 881 A.2d 920, 926 (R.I. 2005). Such evidence may, however, be used for any proper purpose, including proof of motive, opportunity, or identity. See State v. Parkhurst, 706 A.2d 412, 424 (R.I. 1998) (“Although Rule 404(b) mandates that evidence of other crimes or bad acts is not admissible to prove the propensity of a defendant to commit crime, such evidence is admissible 9', 'Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence provides:', '“Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not', 'admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that', 'the person acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be', 'admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive,', 'opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence', 'of mistake or accident, or to prove that defendant feared imminent', 'bodily harm and that the fear was reasonable.”', '-5- to show a fact that tends to prove that the defendant is guilty of the crime charged.”). It is only when evidence of prior acts is offered to prove that the accused has a criminal disposition and, therefore, is more likely to have committed the crime of which he stands accused, that Rule 404(b) requires its exclusion. See Brown, 900 A.2d at 1160. Moreover, “Rule 403 [of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence] cuts across the rules of evidence and is always a consideration in a trial justice’s ruling on the admissibility of Rule 404(b) evidence.” State v. Gaspar, 982 A.2d 140, 148 (R.I. 2009). The defendant contends that the trial justice erred in permitting testimony about his possession of a handgun prior to the murder, which, he avers, should have been excluded under Rule 404(b). We disagree.', 'In ruling on defendant’s motion in limine, the trial justice engaged in a two-step analysis, first evaluating whether the testimony was relevant under Rule 404(b) and, if so, whether it should have been excluded under Rule 403 as unfairly prejudicial or confusing. The trial justice concluded that “the evidence that the state has suggested can be produced, very much fits squarely within the [Rule] 404(b) rubric as evidence, for example, of this defendant’s opportunity, his intent, and, as well, [his] identity as the shooter.” Moreover, the trial justice determined that the evidence was not unfairly prejudicial. We will address the testimony of Ms. Lemoine and Mr. Jimenez separately.', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice should have prohibited Lemoine from testifying about defendant’s possession of a gun several months before the murder.', 'The testimony arose as Lemoine sought to explain defendant’s motive for the murder. She described how defendant had visited Sanchez one afternoon and began speaking with him in a “stern” tone and demanding payment of his uncle’s debt. As the argument became more heated, Lemoine', '-6- testified that defendant “pulled a gun from the side of his jacket and just was basically showing” the weapon.', 'Clearly, defendant’s previous threatening behavior towards Sanchez because of an outstanding debt was highly probative of his motive. See State v. Torres, 787 A.2d 1214, 1221 (R.I. 2002); State v. Pule, 453 A.2d 1095, 1098 (R.I. 1982) (“Evidence of a prior threat made by a defendant is relevant to the question of whether the defendant ‘acted with malice or premeditation, or whether he had a motive to commit the crime.’”) (quoting 1 Wharton, Criminal Evidence § 201 at 414-15 (13th ed. 1972)). Indeed, Jimenez testified that defendant stated that he had given Sanchez a “long enough time to pay” immediately before shooting him in the Veazie Street School field. Thus, because the evidence was admissible for purposes other than proof of propensity, Rule 404(b) does not require its exclusion.', 'Similarly, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in finding that Jimenez’s testimony that defendant frequently carried a handgun was relevant both to identify him as the murderer and to establish that he had the opportunity to commit the crime. 10 Although defendant cites our opinion in State v. Brash, 512 A.2d 1375 (R.I. 1986), as supportive authority, that case is clearly distinguishable from the facts of the case at bar. In Brash, the trial justice permitted the state to spend an inordinate amount of time and energy admitting and explaining a wide variety of firearms that bore no relation to the charged offense. Id. at 1381-82. Here, the state did not seek to admit any firearms allegedly belonging to defendant; rather, it sought to elicit testimony indicating that defendant had access to a handgun. See United States v. Woods, 613 F.2d 629, 636 (6th Cir. 1980) (“possession of the firearms and ammunition [may be] admissible under [Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence] on the independent ground that 10', 'Jimenez testified on direct examination that defendant “always had a gun on him,” but during cross-examination he stated that defendant “sometimes” carried a gun.', '-7- it tended to show [the defendant] had the ‘opportunity’ to commit the bank robbery, since he had access to weapons similar to those used to commit it”); see also David P. Leonard, The New Wigmore: A Treatise on Evidence, ch. 11, § 11.7.1 at 677 (2009) (possession of a weapon may be used to “establish that a person had the means by which to commit a crime”).', 'This evidence was relevant despite Jimenez’s inability to say definitively that the handgun he had seen defendant carry was the same as the “chromed-colored” firearm he described as the murder weapon. See People v. Hawley, 317 N.W.2d 564, 567 (Mich. Ct. App. 1982), rev’d on other grounds, 332 N.W.2d 398 (Mich. 1983) (evidence of prior handgun ownership held relevant even when it is not established that the weapon described by a witness was the same used to commit the charged crime because identity was at issue and it showed that the defendant owned a handgun capable of firing). Evidence that defendant frequently carried a handgun, if true, was relevant to demonstrate that he had access to a weapon and had the opportunity to murder Sanchez.', 'Finally, we consider whether the trial justice erred by not excluding the challenged testimony of Lemoine or Jimenez under Rule 403 as unfairly prejudicial or confusing. Rule 403 provides that relevant evidence “may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury * * *.” The application of Rule 403 is committed to the sound discretion of the trial justice. Gaspar, 982 A.2d at 148.', 'In the case before us, we agree with the trial justice that the proffered testimony was “extraordinarily relevant” and “clearly probative.” Thus, the bar is set rather high for defendant to attempt to show that the contested evidence is unduly prejudicial. As the trial justice noted in ruling on defendant’s motion in limine, “[u]nless evidence is of limited or marginal relevance', '-8- and enormously prejudicial, the trial justice should not act to exclude it.” State v. Pratt, 641 A.2d 732, 741 (R.I. 1994) (quoting Wells v. Uvex Winter Optical, Inc., 635 A.2d 1188, 1193 (R.I. 1994)). It is our opinion that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion by allowing the testimony into evidence. Moreover, the trial justice gave proper limiting instructions after both Lemoine’s and Jimenez’s testimony, thereby abating the risk of confusion in the minds of the jurors as to the permissible uses of such evidence; defendant did not object to either instruction.', 'It is abundantly clear to us that the trial justice engaged in the appropriate analysis of the testimony offered by both Jimenez and Lemoine by first evaluating the relevance of the proffered testimony under Rule 404(b) and then carefully weighing the probative value of the testimony against the danger of unfair prejudice under Rule 403. Accordingly, we discern no grounds for reversing his well-reasoned ruling.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed and the papers of the case shall be returned to that court.

15,State : v. : Rudy Sifuentes. :,criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson for the Court. The petitioner, Rudy Sifuentes, having previously been convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, has petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari. Citing the provisions of G.L. 1956 § 12-19.2-5, Mr. Sifuentes requests that this Court (1) undertake a review of his sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole and (2) modify his sentence so as to allow for the possibility of parole.', 'Although this Court is of the view that Mr. Sifuentes has waived his right to have this Court engage in such a statutorily authorized review due to the fact that he did not seek review under § 12-19.2-5 in either of his two earlier appeals to this Court or in his more recent application for postconviction relief, we have nonetheless opted to undertake a review of his sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we have concluded that petitioner’s sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole was entirely appropriate and should be ratified by us.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'A', 'The Factual Background', 'The factual background of this case has been described at length in two previous decisions of this Court—viz., State v. Sifuentes, 649 A.2d 500 (R.I. 1994) (Sifuentes I) and State v. Sifuentes, 667 A.2d 791 (R.I. 1995) (Sifuentes II). For the sake of brevity, in this opinion we shall summarize only the facts relevant to the instant case.', 'On May 23, 1990, the Providence police discovered the body of Kevin Greenhalgh, which was described as having been “brutally slashed.” Sifuentes I, 649 A.2d at 501. The medical examiner found that Mr. Greenhalgh’s death was the result of “loss of blood that was due primarily to a wound in the neck.” Id. In July of 1990, Mr. Sifuentes and one Donald Brown were both charged with the murder of Mr. Greenhalgh. Id. Testimony elicited at trial revealed that Mr. Sifuentes and Mr. Brown had come to believe that the victim had “snitched” on Mr. Brown in prison. Id. The testimony reflects that their belief was the motive for the murder. See id. From March 31 through April 3, 1992, Mr. Sifuentes was tried by a jury in the Providence County Superior Court. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury expressly found Mr. Sifuentes “guilty of first-degree murder in a manner involving torture and aggravated battery.” Id. On June 26, 1992, the trial justice sentenced Mr. Sifuentes to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Id.', '-2-', 'B', 'The Direct Appeal', 'Mr. Sifuentes appealed his conviction of first-degree murder to this Court. Sifuentes I, 649 A.2d at 501. In that direct appeal, Mr. Sifuentes raised two issues. Id. at 502-03. His first contention on appeal was that the trial justice erred in refusing to permit defense counsel to inquire, during his cross-examination of a prosecution witness, as to whether the witness was aware of the penalty associated with first-degree child molestation (a crime with which that witness was charged at that time). Id. at 502. His second contention on appeal was that the trial justice erred in permitting Mr. Brown (who had previously pled guilty to first-degree murder with respect to the killing of Mr. Greenhalgh) to be called as a witness. Id. at 503. When called to testify, Mr. Brown refused to answer the question posed to him. Id. In its decision, this Court held that Mr. Sifuentes’ first argument had “no merit;” the Court stated that Mr. Sifuentes was “afforded an adequate opportunity to cross-examine” the witness. Id. As to Mr. Sifuentes’ second contention (concerning the testimony of Mr. Brown), the Court held that the issue had not been properly preserved; the Court added that, even if it had been properly preserved, Mr. Sifuentes’ argument in that regard was “meritless.” Id. The Court accordingly denied Mr. Sifuentes’ appeal and affirmed the judgment of conviction of first-degree murder. Id.', 'C', 'The Appeal from the Denial of Petitioner’s Rule 35 Motion', 'In 1995, Mr. Sifuentes again sought relief from this Court, this time appealing from the Superior Court’s order denying his Rule 351 motion to reduce his sentence. Sifuentes II, 667 A.2d at 792. On appeal, he contended that the trial justice erred in declining to grant his motion 1', 'Rule 35 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.', '-3- to reduce his sentence to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole. Id. He contended that his sentence was “grossly disproportionate” to the sentence meted out to Mr. Brown, who had pled guilty to the same murder. Id.2 Addressing these contentions, this Court stated that it was clear that “the trial justice was mindful of the barbaric, gruesome nature of the crime and was equally mindful that the defendant had failed to accept responsibility and [had failed] to express remorse for that crime.” Id. The Court then held that Mr. Sifuentes had “failed to establish that the trial justice abused his discretion in denying the defendant’s motion to reduce his sentence.” Id. The Court accordingly affirmed the order denying the Rule 35 motion and denied and dismissed Mr. Sifuentes’ appeal. Id.', 'D', 'The Denial of Petitioner’s Postconviction Relief Application', 'Subsequent to this Court’s decision with respect to his appeal from the denial of his Rule 35 motion, Mr. Sifuentes filed a pro se application for postconviction relief in the Superior Court pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-1.3 In that application, he alleged that his trial counsel 2', 'Mr. Brown had been sentenced to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole.

In his petition, Mr. Sifuentes has requested that this Court undertake a review of his sentence of life without the possibility of parole pursuant to § 12-19.2-5. In granting the petition for a writ of certiorari (over the objection of the state), this Court indicated that its review would be limited to two questions: (1) whether Mr. Sifuentes, “in light of his failure to raise the issue in prior appellate proceedings in this case, should be deemed to have waived his § 12-19.2-5 right to this Court’s review of * * * his life-without-parole sentence;” and (2) “whether, if such right is deemed not to have been waived, the sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole was appropriate in the circumstances of this case.”', 'II', 'Analysis', 'A', 'Procedural Bar and Waiver', 'Section 12-19.2-5 provides a mechanism whereby a person sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole may have his or her sentence reviewed by this Court.

However, it is noteworthy that, in virtually all6 of the previous cases decided by this Court in which a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole was challenged, the defendants have raised in their direct appeal their right to § 12-19.2-5 review by this Court.7', 'The clear language of § 12-19.2-5 leads us ineluctably to the conclusion that, although one who has been sentenced to life without the possibility of parole has the right to a review by this Court of that sentence in the manner set forth in the statute, such review by no means occurs automatically; rather, the right to such review must be invoked by the defendant “in accordance with the applicable rules of [the Supreme Court].” Section 12-19.2-5.', 'Article I, Rule 16(a) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure reads, in pertinent part, as follows: “Errors not claimed, questions not raised and points not made ordinarily will be treated as waived and not be considered by the Court.” See Stebbins v.

This Court’s Review of the Sentence', 'In State v.

The testimony with respect to the severity and barbarity of the injuries sustained by the victim in this case is as disturbing as it is explicit. The medical examiner who performed the autopsy on Mr. Greenhalgh testified at trial that she found numerous bruises and abrasions at various places on his head. She also found cuts to the ear, stab wounds below the ear, and another cut over the cheek and jaw; she described the cut over his cheek and jaw as having been “caused by the tip of the knife dragging along the surface of the skin.” The medical examiner described the front part of Mr. Greenhalgh’s neck as having a “gaping * * * wide, open inside wound * * * which measured twelve inches from side to side, ripped across both sides of the neck and front of the neck.” The muscles of the neck were exposed in a manner which the 13', 'See also Tassone, 749 A.2d at 1119 (stating that this Court is obliged to “examine the record, the findings of the trial justice, and the personal character, record, and propensities of the defendant” when determining the appropriateness of the sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole).', '- 12 - medical examiner described as being in a “very ragged fashion, as if a saw had been cut across the front muscles of the neck.” The medical examiner also testified that both the larynx and trachea had been cut and that the jugular veins had also been partially cut—while the spine remained intact. The medical examiner stated that, in her opinion, the wounds to the neck were the result of several motions of the knife. She also found stab wounds, of varying degrees of severity, on the victim’s chest, abdomen, legs, thighs, back, and buttocks.', 'The medical examiner further described the injuries to Mr. Greenhalgh’s head as being indicative of blunt force trauma—“consistent with him having been struck with a fist or foot while he was alive.” She further testified that, based on certain injuries to the neck area, it was likely that the victim had been subjected to “some sort of neck hold.” The medical examiner additionally testified that she would describe various wounds on the victim as “teaser wounds,” which she defined as being wounds which would not be “expected to inflict lethal injury * * * [but were] to inflict psychological injury.” She stated that the victim’s wounds were also consistent with his having been bound during the course of the assault because there were very few defensive injuries. The medical examiner ultimately concluded that Mr. Greenhalgh’s death was caused by “a loss of blood, mainly [from] the jugular veins that were cut from the neck wound.” She further estimated that, based on the time it takes for fatal blood loss to occur, the victim “lived for at least ten minutes” after receiving the wound to the neck; she added that this was further indicated by the fact that both blood and dirt were found in the victim’s lungs. Given this evidence, it is entirely clear to us that the aggravating circumstances of torture and aggravated battery were present in this case.', 'Additionally, our review of Mr. Sifuentes’ “character, record, and propensity for criminal activity” has further led us to conclude that it is unlikely that he will be rehabilitated.', '- 13 - See Graham, 941 A.2d at 867. In view of that conclusion, we are of the opinion that Mr. Sifuentes presents a continuing danger to the community. The presentence report which was conducted with respect to Mr. Sifuentes reveals that, prior to his being charged with the murder of Mr. Greenhalgh, Mr. Sifuentes had pled nolo contendre to no fewer than ten criminal charges—for which he was twice incarcerated at the Adult Correctional Institutions and for which he has served periods of probation (during which periods he twice has been found to have been a probation violator).', 'We note once more, as we did in our 1995 decision with respect to his appeal from the denial of his Rule 35 motion, that at the time of sentencing Mr. Sifuentes had “failed to accept responsibility and to express remorse for [the] crime.” Sifuentes II, 667 A.2d at 792.14 We are in agreement with the trial justice that the evidence presented by petitioner at the time of sentencing did not serve to mitigate the true heinousness of the crime that he committed. The brutality and cold-heartedness that must be present for one to carry out a murder in such a cruel manner are almost unfathomable.', 'For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the imposition of the sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole was entirely appropriate. 14', 'See Graham, 941 A.2d at 867 (considering the defendant’s remorse when reviewing the appropriateness of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole); see also State v.

Michelle testified that, shortly after meeting the two men, she began to work as a prostitute in Boston (traveling from Providence to do so). In speaking of her activities as a prostitute, Michelle referred to Mr. Figgs as her “pimp.” She stated that she would give Mr. Figgs most of the money which she earned as a prostitute and that Mr. Figgs would in turn provide her with clothes and food; in addition, he permitted her to stay at his Erastus Street apartment. She testified that, while she was working as a prostitute, she initially left Marquel in the care of two of her sisters, who also resided in Providence; she went on to state that, after approximately three to four weeks of leaving Marquel in the care of her sisters, she began instead to leave Marquel with defendant and Mr. Figgs.

She testified that she returned to the apartment at approximately 11:00 p.m. and that she observed Marquel lying face down on the bed next to defendant. She further testified that, although she gave the child a kiss on the cheek, she did not try to awaken him. Michelle testified that, at that point in time, there did not appear to be anything wrong with Marquel. She stated that she then left the Erastus Street apartment and that later, at approximately 2:00 a.m., when she attempted to return to the apartment, she was unable to gain entry. She said that she therefore proceeded to her sisters’ home instead. Michelle testified that, at approximately 9:00 a.m. on the morning of August 1, she went to Mr. Figgs’s apartment in order to pick up Marquel; at that point, she was informed by the police at the scene that her son had died. She further testified that, two weeks prior to his death, Marquel had been to see a doctor for a checkup and was found to be healthy.', 'Tanishia, a neighbor of Mr. Figgs who lived downstairs in the building, testified that, on the morning of August 1, 2005, she answered her door at the behest of defendant and Mr. Figgs, both of whom she knew to be living in the third floor apartment. She testified that defendant told her that “the baby was choking;” she further testified that she knew that the baby to whom they were referring was “Michelle’s son.”', 'Tanishia testified that, when she went upstairs and found Marquel, she noticed that “he wasn’t breathing, that he was cold;” she stated that she then dialed 911.

She further testified that, while she was on the phone with the 911 operator, Mr. Figgs and defendant were behind her, and she recalled saying to them: “He’s gone” or “The baby’s gone.” Tanishia testified that, at some point after that, while she was still on the phone with the 911 operator, she looked up and realized that the two men were no longer there.

Her examination also revealed a midline shift and swelling of the brain. The medical examiner testified that a number of the bruises found on Marquel went beyond the fat tissue into the skeletal muscle—which, she stated, is indicative of “greater force” having been applied to that area; she further stated that there had been “several points of impact.”', 'The medical examiner testified that the symptoms associated with the injuries which she found in the child’s brain “can vary * * * from [the person] being groggy, drowsy, losing consciousness, possibly having seizures or being very rapidly unresponsive.”', 'She further testified that the head injuries that she found “would be consistent within this case of Marquel Davis [being] tossed from one person to the next” and would “be consistent with the child being struck with an object and then propelled either backward or forward.” She stated that she also found evidence of vomit, which she said resembled the child’s stomach contents; she further stated that “subarachnoid hemorrhage and injury of the brain are known to produce, in addition', '-4- to pain, also nausea and vomiting.” The medical examiner testified that the subdural hemorrhage that she found was acute and that, therefore, the injuries had occurred at a point in time just “several hours prior to the time of death.” The medical examiner stated that, in her opinion, the death of Marquel Davis was caused by “acute subdural hemorrhage and brain injury due to blunt force trauma.” She further found the manner of death to have been “homicide.” She additionally testified that the toxicology reports did not indicate the presence of either alcohol or “street drugs” in the child.', 'Detective Robert Fitzpatrick of the Providence Police Department testified that, on August 1, 2005, he and several other detectives responded to the Erastus Street apartment, where the deceased child had been found. Detective Fitzpatrick testified that, during the course of the investigation, defendant and Mr. Figgs were identified as the last persons to have been with the child prior to his death; he added, however, that neither Mr. Figgs nor defendant was present at the scene when the police arrived.', 'Detective Fitzpatrick testified that, later on August 1 (at approximately 4:00 p.m.) after he had returned to the police station, he was informed that both defendant and Mr. Figgs had arrived at the station.

Detective Fitzpatrick testified that he, along with other detectives, proceeded to conduct six interviews with defendant—the first five of which were conducted on August 1, while the sixth was conducted on August 2.

He stated that, when they arrived back at the apartment, the child was asleep in his bed. The defendant further described how Marquel was often left at the apartment sleeping; he stated that often no one watched the child. The defendant denied seeing anyone hitting or “getting physical with” the child; he also stated that he did not observe any bruises on the child.', 'In the third interview, defendant admitted that the last time he had seen Michelle was at the Erastus Street apartment in Providence at 10:00 p.m. on the previous night (July 31), when she had left her child with Mr. Figgs. (By contrast, in his first two interviews, defendant had stated that he had been in Boston on that night.) The defendant described how on that weekend there was “something * * * not right” with the child. He further stated that “the night before[,] the baby was drinking” (which the context indicates was a reference to alcoholic beverages); he added that they did not pay any attention to the child because they thought he was drunk.4 The defendant told the police that he thought the child had “died from drinking.”', 'In the fourth interview, defendant further related how things had not been completely right with Marquel in the days before his death.

He admitted to having been verbally abusive to the child and having told the child to go to sleep, which he contended was a good thing because Marquel “was always getting his ass whopped anyway.” The defendant further stated that, if Mr. Figgs had caused the death of the child, he had done so accidentally.', 'Later in the fifth interview, defendant stated that, if Marquel “banged his head on something, it wasn’t hard because [he] wasn’t using that much force with the child.” The defendant admitted to pillow fighting with the child during the weekend; he stated that he and Mr. Figgs and Twinkie were all throwing pillows at Marquel. He stated that, on some occasions, 5', 'Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).', '-7- they would hit Marquel too hard and he would fall over; he added, however, that there was “a lot of stuff” around Marquel when such a fall happened (implying that the “stuff” would have broken the child’s fall). The defendant said that there had been times when they were throwing the pillows “too hard”—“because there [had] been times when [Marquel] banged his head against the wall but he was okay afterwards.” Later in the same interview, defendant stated again that “we was all getting rough with him.” He added that, at a certain point in time, the child looked “lazy eyed * * * like he was about to pass out;” defendant stated that he then gave the child “a swallow” of beer. The defendant stated that the child thereafter “started getting tensed up” while sleeping.', 'Still later in that fifth interview, defendant reiterated that he had seen Twinkie throwing the child like a football to Mr. Figgs; he said that that activity reached the point where the child “didn’t wanna get up” and instead would lie down. The defendant also stated that at times Mr. Figgs would push Marquel’s head “back down into the wall.” In describing playing football with Marquel, defendant this time admitted that, ten to fifteen seconds after playing football with the child, he noticed that the child was “lazy-eyed” and “exhausted.” He stated that the child “went to sleep right then and there;” he added that, when they tried to wake Marquel up, he would not get up. The defendant also described how, in the middle of the night, he noticed that the child had thrown up, and he said that he turned the child’s head away from the vomit. The defendant contended that, when Michelle returned to the apartment, Mr. Figgs told her that they had caused Marquel to become drunk. The defendant again stated that he would “throw the pillow at [Marquel] real hard” and that he would “flick him” to discipline him; he further stated that', '-8- Marquel was “getting hit with [Troy Figgs’s] pillow all day * * * [b]y all of [them].”6 The defendant then retreated from his earlier statement regarding his own participation in “the game” of catch (wherein the child was tossed back and forth by the participants)—claiming instead that he was playing videogames while that other “game” took place.7', 'In the sixth interview, which took place at approximately 1:30 p.m. on August 2, defendant described how they would “play-fight” with Marquel and would “box around with him;” however, he stated that, on the day at issue (Sunday, July 31), they “didn’t know how rough [they were] being with him.” The defendant then stated that he “didn’t even know it was * * * the play-fighting that, that might’ve killed him;” he again stated that he had thought that it was the consumption of beer that had killed the child.', 'During that sixth interview, defendant also stated that he was sorry, and he said that they had been “rough with the baby accidentally.” The defendant then admitted once again that there had been a game of catch with Marquel being tossed back and forth by Troy Figgs and Twinkie and himself. He stated that, after “the game,” they gave Marquel beer, after which the child was “stumbling”—which, according to defendant, they thought was funny since they believed that he was drunk. However, defendant then stated that he thought “the baby was stumbling because he got hit in the back of his head, and * * * Troy [Figgs] told him to get up so quick.” The defendant stated that “the only thing that could’ve brong [sic] those bruises on his head[] was that game of catch.” 6', 'The defendant stated to the detective that the “pillow with a bunch of feathers all over the place” (which we presume to mean that the pillow had broken open) was “Troy’s pillow.” 7', 'It will be recalled that defendant was arrested at the end of the fifth interview.

Although the motion originally sought suppression of the “statements and/or admissions” obtained by the Providence police “on or about August 1, 2005” (thereby including all six interviews at the police station), defense counsel ultimately limited his suppression motion to the sixth interview.10', 'At the hearing on the motion to suppress, defendant contended that the statements made during his sixth interview should be suppressed due to what he argued was a violation of Rule 8', 'The jury found defendant not guilty of the more serious charge of first-degree murder. 9', 'On March 5, 2007, Mr. Figgs pleaded guilty to the second-degree murder of Marquel Davis and to the charge of pandering. He received the same sentence as defendant with respect to the murder—as well as an additional five years on the pandering charge (see footnote 3, supra). Both sentences are to be served concurrently. 10', 'The defendant’s trial counsel conceded that the first five interviews were properly conducted. Counsel further stated that he was not contending that any of those five statements was involuntary or was the result of “inducement by some promise.”', '- 10 - 5(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure; it was his contention that the sixth interview was the result of an unnecessary delay in presentment and that therefore his statements in that interview should be suppressed.11 At the suppression hearing, the hearing justice heard testimony about the interviews at the police station from Providence Police Detectives Robert Fitzpatrick and William Mattera12 as well as from defendant.', 'Detective Fitzpatrick testified at the suppression hearing that, during the first five interviews, which were conducted on August 1, defendant was “eager and cooperative.” The detective further described defendant as having been desirous of “discuss[ing] the situation with [them];” he said that defendant appeared to want to “make sure [that the detectives] got all the facts.” The detective further described defendant as having been “agreeable” with respect to answering the detectives’ questions throughout the interviews on that day. Detective Fitzpatrick also testified extensively as to how Detective McGann and he had apprised defendant of his Miranda rights at the beginning of the fifth interview; he added that, after defendant had been apprised of his rights, he continued to answer the detectives’ questions. Detective Fitzpatrick further testified that, after the conclusion of the fifth interview, defendant was “taken into custody and placed in [the] cell block area.” 11', 'The hearing justice also conducted an analysis with respect to the voluntariness of defendant’s statements at the police station and with respect to his waiver of his Miranda rights; he ruled that the statements had been made voluntarily and that defendant had waived his Miranda rights. However, because no appellate argument has been made with respect to the hearing justice’s rulings as to those issues, we shall confine our analysis and discussion to the testimony and arguments made at the suppression hearing concerning Rule 5(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. 12', 'Detective Timothy McGann also testified at the hearing on the motion to suppress. However, his testimony did not pertain to the sixth interview or to the presentment issue. He testified only with respect to the five interviews conducted on August 1 and with respect to defendant’s having been apprised of his Miranda rights and his waiver of same.', '- 11 -', 'It is undisputed that, at 1:29 p.m. on August 2 (the day following defendant’s late-night arrest at the end of the fifth interview), the detectives began to interview defendant for a sixth and final time before bringing him to the District Court for arraignment. Detective Fitzpatrick testified at the suppression hearing that, at the beginning of the sixth interview, he removed defendant from his cell block and informed him that he “wanted to clear up some more inconsistencies * * * [i]f [defendant] wished to talk to [the detectives] about it again.” Detective Fitzpatrick stated that defendant did agree to speak with the detectives again. The detective further testified that defendant was then reminded of his Miranda rights, of which he had been apprised the night before. Detective Fitzpatrick stated that, at the time of the sixth interview, defendant “was still eager to speak to us,” although the detective acknowledged that defendant’s tone had changed. The detective described defendant as having “had a mission to tell us his side of the story at [that] point.” Detective Fitzpatrick stated that defendant never sought to terminate the sixth interview and never asked for counsel.', 'He stated that, after that interview was concluded (i.e., at approximately 2:10 or 2:20 p.m.),13 defendant was taken to the District Court.14', 'Detective Mattera testified at the suppression hearing that he was the officer responsible for this case and that he was present at the police station when defendant was brought to the cell block at approximately 1:00 a.m. on August 2. The detective stated that between 9:00 a.m. (when he came back to the police station) and approximately 1:30 p.m. (when the sixth interview was conducted) on August 2, he was “[p]utting together paper work, putting together statements, 13', 'Detective Fitzpatrick testified at the suppression hearing that the sixth interview lasted for approximately “forty to fifty minutes.” 14', 'According to the testimony of Detective Mattera, Mr. Figgs was also brought to the District Court at some point in time after 2:00 p.m. on August 2.', '- 12 - preparing for the arraignment.” He acknowledged that the Sixth Division District Court was less than five minutes away from the police station. Detective Mattera testified that it would take only approximately five minutes to physically fill out a complaint form. However, the detective further testified that he did not arrange for defendant’s arraignment immediately upon his arrival at the station at 9:00 a.m. because, at that point in time, he needed to compile paper work and “facts needed to be collected.” The detective stated that the investigating officers had “about five hours of taped statements [that they] needed to go through and get the facts straight before [they] did the complaint form.” Detective Mattera explained that he knew the crime with which he was going to charge defendant, but that he needed to review defendant’s statements from the five interviews on August 1; he described those statements as containing “a lot of inconsistencies.” Detective Mattera further stated that, although it was not done at his direction, he had knowledge of and gave his approval to the sixth interview.', 'With respect to the circumstances surrounding the sixth interview, defendant testified that he was placed in a cell before midnight on August 1. He further testified that he remained in the cell and was not brought to District Court on the morning of August 2. He added that he was allowed out of the cell block in the early afternoon of August 2, when he met with Detective Fitzpatrick, who asked him additional questions—which questions defendant testified he answered.', 'Based on the just-summarized testimony, the hearing justice held that defendant’s presentment before the district court “was not unnecessarily delayed.” The hearing justice stated that the presentment was “reasonably prompt.” The hearing justice further commented that “prompt presentation does not mean immediate.”', '- 13 -', 'The hearing justice further stated that, not only did he find there to have been no unnecessary delay, but he also found that the statements which defendant made early in the afternoon of August 2 were made “voluntarily” and were “consistent with his earlier statements.” The hearing justice stated that he “credit[ed] the officers’ testimony that the defendant was still willing and eager to offer statements to the police.” The hearing justice additionally credited Detective Fitzpatrick’s statement that defendant was “on a mission to tell his side of the story, which by [that] time had become multi-faceted.” The hearing justice therefore found, “by clear and convincing evidence” and based upon his appraisal of the “totality of the circumstances,” that defendant’s statements were given “freely and voluntarily * * * [and] without compulsion or overreaching” on the part of the officers. The hearing justice therefore denied defendant’s motion to suppress the statements that he made in the sixth interview.15', 'On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court erred in denying the motion to suppress his statements to the Providence police detectives during the sixth interview. He contends that the delay in presentment before a judge of the District Court was unnecessary and was “causative” of the sixth interview—which he contends necessitates the suppression of the statements that he made during the sixth interview that took place during the period of delay.', 'II', 'Analysis', 'Rule 5(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure reads in pertinent part as follows: 15', 'The hearing justice also explicitly found that defendant had been “apprised of his Miranda rights” and that he had understood those rights when he “thereafter freely and voluntarily decided to speak to the officers * * *.”', '- 14 -', '“Unless otherwise provided by statute, an officer making an arrest', 'under a warrant issued upon a complaint shall take the arrested', 'person without unnecessary delay before a judge of the District', 'Court as commanded in the warrant.”16', 'Although defendant has alluded to various federal cases and a federal statute, we have stated, in characterizing our own Rule 5(a), that the rule is “not a constitutional command to be found within the text of our Federal or State Constitutions, and its breach does not necessarily create any constitutional violation.” State v. Nardolillo, 698 A.2d 195, 199 (R.I. 1997). Instead, this Court has viewed “the rule as a prophylactic measure designed to prevent other constitutional infirmities.” Id. For this reason, we consider this Court’s opinions interpreting our Rule 5(a) to be controlling, and we shall confine ourselves to a review of same.17', 'In interpreting Rule 5(a), this Court has held that delay in presentment, without more, does not warrant automatic suppression of a statement made during the period of delay. Rather, we have squarely held that “delay, if it is to render a confession inadmissible, must have been operative in inducing the confession.” State v. Lionberg, 533 A.2d 1172, 1178 (R.I. 1987) (emphasis added); see also Nardolillo, 698 A.2d at 199.', 'We have likewise stated that a “[hearing] justice must consider whether the time preceding a suspect’s statement had any causative effect upon his [or her] * * * decision to confess.” Lionberg, 533 A.2d at 1178 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Nardolillo, 698 A.2d at 199; State v.

Accordingly, we consider defendant’s reliance on such federal cases as Corley v.

Cobb, 494 A.2d 1182, 1185 (R.I. 1985). Therefore, “the elapsed time between the defendant’s arrest and his confession is the critical period we must examine and scrutinize in order to determine if it had been operative in inducing the defendant’s admissions.” Nardolillo, 698 A.2d at 199 (emphasis added); see also State v. Brown, 898 A.2d 69, 78 (R.I. 2006); State v. Johnson, 119 R.I. 749, 756, 383 A.2d 1012, 1017 (1978).', 'We therefore reiterate that, pursuant to our well-settled case law with respect to Rule 5(a), a defendant who seeks to have his or her statement excluded must demonstrate both: (1) that the delay in presentment was unnecessary and (2) that such delay was “causative” with respect to his or her confession.', 'Our careful review of the record in this case (including the testimony with respect to the circumstances surrounding the sixth interview and the transcript of that interview itself) has led us to conclude that there was no causal nexus18 between the delay in presentment (whether necessary or unnecessary) and defendant’s consent to participation in the sixth interview. In other words, the record is devoid of any indication that the delay in presentment on August 2 had any “causative effect” with respect to defendant’s cooperation in the sixth interview. See Lionberg, 553 A.2d at 1178. Thus, without passing upon the hearing justice’s ruling that the delay in presentment before the District Court was not “unnecessary,” it is clear to us from the record that the delay in defendant’s presentment before the District Court was not in any way “operative in inducing” defendant to make such further statements. See Nardolillo, 698 A.2d at 18', 'It is important to distinguish between the occasion for an occurrence and the cause for an occurrence. The mere fact that an event (e.g., an incriminating confession) occurs within a period of delay does not mean that the delay necessarily caused that confession to have taken place.', '- 16 - 199. Rather, the record reveals that defendant was eager to talk with the detectives from the very first interview, and that eagerness continued throughout the sixth interview—which was further indicated by Detective Fitzpatrick’s description of defendant during the sixth interview as having been on “a mission to tell * * * his side of the story.”', 'It is clear and undisputed that, by the time defendant gave his sixth statement, he had already willingly agreed to participate in five other interviews with the detectives, in which interviews he made statements that were increasingly inculpatory. Like the hearing justice, we perceive in the record no evidence to suggest that the inculpatory statements made by defendant in the sixth interview were in any way made “because of or as a result of the delay in his being presented before a judge of the District Court.” See Nardolillo, 698 A.2d at 199. We are further unconvinced that the inculpatory statements made by defendant in the sixth interview were “in any way prompted” by the delay in his presentment. See Ferola, 518 A.2d at 1344. Instead, the record is clear that, during that sixth interview, defendant was “still eager to speak to [the detectives]” and that he continued to willingly and voluntarily relate to the police his version of what had transpired during the hours leading up to the death of Marquel Davis.', 'We are further unable to view the circumstances of the sixth interview as demonstrating a “police tactic of delay designed to produce an involuntary or unwitting confession”—Rule 5(a) having been enacted in order to militate against the employment of such tactics. See Nardolillo, 698 A.2d at 200; see also State v. Robinson, 658 A.2d 518, 521 (R.I. 1995). We instead view defendant’s further inculpatory statements during the sixth interview as representing merely another attempt by defendant to persuade the police as to the veracity of his version of the events, while simultaneously attempting to shift blame away from himself. We are therefore convinced “that not one shred of evidence exists that the * * * delay in bringing the defendant', '- 17 - before a judicial officer in any way prompted him to give the police his version of what occurred” in the Erastus Street apartment at the end of July 2005. See Cobb, 494 A.2d at 1185.', 'Therefore, without deciding whether or not the delay was “unnecessary,” we agree with the trial justice that the delay in the presentment of the defendant was not “operative in inducing” him to make his sixth and final statement. See Nardolillo, 698 A.2d at 199.', 'III', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

17,Joan Prout : v. : City of Providence et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. This case came before the Supreme Court on April 6, 2010, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. The plaintiff, Joan Prout (Prout or plaintiff), appealed from the Superior Court’s entry of summary judgment in favor of the defendant, the City of Providence (city). After reviewing the memoranda submitted by the parties and the arguments of counsel, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown. Accordingly, we shall decide this case without further briefing or argument. We affirm.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On July 11, 2005, Prout filed a notice of claim with the Providence City Council for injuries that occurred on May 18, 2005, when she stepped onto what she alleged was a “negligently maintained sewer grid and/or cover having a defect, namely a missing rail and/or rod[.]” The plaintiff thereafter filed a complaint in the Superior Court alleging that the sewer grid was improperly maintained; she sought damages for personal injuries', '-1- and medical expenses. Both the notice of claim that Prout filed with the city and her complaint to the Superior Court described the location of the injury as “at or near Glenham Street” in Providence.', 'The city answered the complaint and moved for summary judgment, contending that the notice of the place of injury was insufficient as a matter of law. In turn, plaintiff filed a motion seeking to amend her complaint to modify the location of the injury to “at or near Glenham Street, corner of Taylor Street.”', 'A hearing was held in Superior Court on November 21, 2006, at which time the trial justice ordered the parties to submit supplemental memoranda concerning Glenham Street and its surrounding area so that he might determine whether the location of the injury as set forth in the notice was sufficient. On January 30, 2007, at a second hearing before a different trial justice, the city’s motion for summary judgment was granted. The trial justice found that Prout’s notice of claim failed to comply with the requirements of G.L. 1956 § 45-15-9, which states in relevant part:', '“(a) A person so injured or damaged shall, within sixty (60)', 'days, give to the town by law obliged to keep the highway,', 'causeway, or bridge in repair, notice of the time, place, and', 'cause of the injury or damage; and if the town does not', 'make just and due satisfaction, within the time prescribed', 'by § 45-15-5, the person shall, within three (3) years after', 'the date of the injury or damage, commence his or her', 'action against the town treasurer for the recovery of', 'damages, and not thereafter.”', 'Likewise, Prout’s motion to amend her complaint was denied; the trial justice concluded that the proposed amendment would not cure the fatal defect in this case because the sixty-day period for the notice of appeal as specified by § 45-15-9 had expired.', '-2-', 'The plaintiff timely appealed to this Court, and argues that the grant of summary judgment was erroneous because her complaint set forth adequate notice of the specific facts necessary to satisfy the requirements of § 45-15-9. Specifically, plaintiff contends that the complaint identified the street and location of the sewer grid that caused her injuries and therefore met the statutory prerequisites.', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court reviews a trial justice’s decision to grant summary judgment on a de novo basis. United Lending Corp. v. City of Providence, 827 A.2d 626, 631 (R.I. 2003). We will affirm such a decision only if “after reviewing the admissible evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, we conclude that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Lucier v. Impact Recreation, Ltd., 864 A.2d 635, 638 (R.I. 2005) (quoting DiBattista v.

(quoting D’Allesandro v. Tarro, 842 A.2d 1063, 1065 (R.I. 2004)).', 'Analysis', 'Because the cause of action arises from the city’s statutory duty to maintain its highways, the issue in this case stems from the requirements provided by G.L. 1956 § 24- 5-1. 1 The General Assembly has provided that an injured person may recover for injury 1', 'General Laws 1956 § 24-5-1 states:', '-3- or damages arising from a municipality’s failure to keep its highways in a safe condition. In cases in which an injury could have been prevented by reasonable care, § 45-15-82 sets forth a mechanism through which injured citizens may recover for their losses. However, they may do so only in accordance with a strict statutory scheme that requires sufficient notice of the place of the injury, and an adequate description of the alleged defect that gave rise to the injury; further, the statute requires that the notice of claim must be filed within sixty days of the incident. Section 45-15-9.', '“(a) All highways, causeways, and bridges, except', 'as provided by this chapter, lying and being within the', 'bounds of any town, shall be kept in repair and amended,', 'from time to time, so that the highways, causeways, and', 'bridges may be safe and convenient for travelers with their', 'teams, carts, and carriages at all seasons of the year, at the', 'proper charge and expense of the town, under the care and', 'direction of the town council of the town, provided that the', 'state shall be responsible for the annual cleaning of all', 'sidewalks on all state highways, causeways, and bridges.', '“(b) In addition, the surfaces of all highways and', 'causeways shall be maintained in such a state of repair as to', 'make them safe for bicycles.” 2', 'General Laws 1956 § 45-15-8 provides:', '“If any person receives or suffers bodily injury or damage', 'to that person’s property by reason of defect, want of', 'repair, or insufficient railing, in or upon a public highway,', 'causeway, or bridge, in any town which is by law obliged', 'to repair and keep the same in a condition safe and', 'convenient for travelers with their vehicles, which injury or', 'damage might have been prevented by reasonable care and', 'diligence on the part of the town, the person may recover,', 'in the manner provided in this chapter, from the town, the', 'amount of damages, sustained by the aggrieved person, if', 'the town had reasonable notice of the defect, or might have', 'had notice of the defect by the exercise of proper care and', 'diligence on its part.”', '-4-', 'It is well settled that compliance with these statutory requirements is a condition precedent that must be satisfied for a plaintiff to maintain a suit against the municipality. See Marshall v. City of Providence, 633 A.2d 1360, 1361 (R.I. 1993) (mem.) (determining that providing a municipality with an adequate notice of claim is a condition precedent to filing a civil action and holding that said condition may not be waived); Barroso v. Pepin, 106 R.I. 502, 506, 261 A.2d 277, 279 (1970) (discussing the fundamental principle that the General Assembly may, as a condition precedent to access to the courts, require that a written notice of claim for injuries be presented to the municipal authorities within some specified period after the injuries were sustained); Maloney v.

As such, failure to provide proper notice is fatal to a suit brought under § 45-15-9.', 'Although, the notice need not fix the exact location of the defect, it must describe the locale in a reasonably sufficient manner. See Lahaye v. City of Providence, 640 A.2d 978, 980 (R.I. 1994) (determining that the notice of claim, which excluded the actual area where the accident occurred, was inadequate as a matter of law) (citing Malo v. McAloon, 65 R.I. 26, 31, 13 A.2d 245, 247 (1940)); see also Mushnick v. City of Providence, 692 A.2d 700, 700 (R.I. 1997) (mem.)

Finlay, 768 A.2d 1256, 1257 (R.I. 2001) (reasoning that the purpose of the notice requirement in § 45-15-9 is “to give the municipality an opportunity to investigate claims and, if appropriate, to settle them without litigation”) (citing Tessier v. Ann & Hope Factory Outlet, Inc., 114 R.I. 315, 318, 332 A.2d 781, 782 (1975)). Indeed, providing a municipality with prompt and adequate notice of a claim is intended to apprise the city of the allegation of negligence and afford it an opportunity to investigate the claim “while the facts are fresh and witnesses are available and before the conditions have materially changed, and to decide intelligently whether it is advisable to settle the claim and, if necessary, to prepare for trial.” Tessier, 114 R.I. at 318, 332 A.2d at 782 (quoting Lane v. Cray, 50 R.I. 486, 488, 149 A. 593, 594 (1930)).', 'Accordingly, when a notice of claim fails to provide substantial certainty about the time and place of the injury and the character and nature of the defect that caused it, a suit for failure to maintain the property cannot be preserved. See Tessier, 114 R.I. at 318, 332 A.2d at 782. The requirements of § 45-15-9 must be strictly obeyed, and the notice requirement is a condition precedent to a plaintiff’s right of action.', 'Moseley v. Fitzgerald, 773 A.2d 254, 258-59 (R.I. 2001).', 'In the case before us, plaintiff’s notice failed to disclose the location where she sustained the injuries. The notice merely recited that she “was at or near Glenham Street” when she stepped out from the sidewalk onto the street. The phrase “at or near,” is vague and imprecise and does not describe the location of the injury in any meaningful way. According to the record, Glenham Street is 1,249 feet long and has eighteen sewer grids.', '-6- Because the General Assembly has made it clear that there must be specificity in the notice of claim, the notice in the case at bar must be deemed insufficient. See § 45-15-9; Maloney, 21 R.I. at 472, 44 A. at 692.', 'We agree with the trial justice that the plaintiff’s notice that the injury occurred “at or near Glenham Street” is insufficient as a matter of law; plaintiff’s complaint failed to meet the statutory requirements necessary to maintain the action. See § 45-15-9.', 'Lastly, Prout’s motion to amend her complaint to state “at or near Glenham Street, corner of Taylor Street” properly was dismissed by the Superior Court because the amended complaint would not cure the defect. Section 45-15-9 provides for a sixty day period in which an injured party may file or amend the notice of claim to the city, and that statutory time limit long had expired.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm the grant of summary judgment and direct that the papers in this case be remanded to the Superior Court.', 'Justice Indeglia took no part in the consideration or decision of this appeal.', '-7-', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'Joan Prout v.

This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on May 11, 2010, pursuant to an order directing both parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised by this appeal should not summarily be decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that the issues raised by this appeal should be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth below, we vacate the decree of the Family Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On December 4, 2008, the Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) filed a petition in the Family Court seeking to terminate Jason Tench’s parental rights.

However, that hearing justice allowed him the opportunity to refile the motion upon completion of a drug-treatment program.

After explaining the meaning of the termination proceeding to Mr. Tench, his attorney asked him to explain to the Family Court justice “why, in spite of the fact that you’ve only been out of jail for 100 days of Angelina’s life, why he shouldn’t terminate your parental rights.” Mr. Tench responded that Angelina’s birth had changed his life and that he had been working hard to better himself and to be a good father. His attorney then submitted evidence reiterating that Mr. Tench had made repeated efforts to reinstate his visitation. Finally, he offered a letter from Mr. Tench’s therapist at the ACI, Kathryn Manning, supporting reunification and noting that he had not received any disciplinary sanctions since October 2007.', 'After hearing that sparse evidence, the Family Court justice concluded that “certainly he has abandoned the child because he’s been in the ACI for a period,” and “[h]e hasn’t supported the child.” He then terminated Mr. Tench’s parental rights. After counsel for DCYF sought clarification, the justice indicated that he was making a finding of unfitness on both grounds set forth in the petition. The termination decree was entered on March 6, 2009, and Mr. Tench timely appealed. On appeal, Mr. Tench argues that the trial justice did not make the necessary findings to support termination of his parental rights. Additionally, Mr. Tench contends that the record before the Family Court justice did not support by clear and convincing evidence either the justice’s finding of abandonment or his finding of conduct or conditions seriously detrimental to the child.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“Natural parents have a fundamental liberty interest in the care, custody, and management of their child that does not evaporate if they are not model parents or have lost', '-3- temporary custody of their child.” In re Natalya C., 946 A.2d 198, 202 (R.I. 2008) (quoting In re Antonio G., 657 A.2d 1052, 1057 (R.I. 1995)).

For this reason alone, the Family Court’s finding of “conduct or conditions seriously detrimental to the child” is unsupportable.', ""We also are troubled by the scant record upon which the justice came to the conclusion of unfitness. The sole witness in this proceeding was the parent whose rights DCYF sought to terminate. There was not any testimony from a DCYF case worker, nor any testimony of a case plan or the best interests of the child. Although “parental rights should not be terminated solely because of conviction of a crime and the parent’s subsequent incarceration, a parent's imprisonment may be considered along with other factors,” which includes “the probable duration of his incarceration.” In re Micaela C., 769 A.2d 600, 604 (R.I. 2001) (father sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole). But here there was uncontradicted testimony that Mr. Tench was to complete his current sentence at the ACI in September 2009, a mere six months after the hearing date, with a possible early release in a matter of weeks, in April 2009. 2 Accordingly, DCYF failed to offer sufficient evidence to meet its burden of proof on this ground for termination.

It is not the mere fact of incarceration that constitutes abandonment, but proof that a parent has not “actively engage[d] in efforts to contact that child, despite having opportunities to do so.” In re Unique T., 822 A.2d 182, 184 (R.I. 2003) (quoting In re De Karri P., 787 A.2d 1170, 1172 (R.I. 2001)). DCYF argued that at the time of the hearing Mr. Tench had not seen Angelina for over two years, and it asserts before us that “there was no evidence presented that [Mr. Tench] had ever made any attempts to maintain a relationship with his daughter.” There is evidence in the record, however, that Mr. Tench was denied joint custody and visitation by orders entered on June 26, 2006, and June 12, 2007. He was nevertheless allowed to refile a motion for visitation after he had successfully completed a drug-treatment program.', 'The record also contains evidence indicating that Mr. Tench completed a drug- treatment program, but was again denied visitation subject to his completion of a parent-child evaluation upon his release from the ACI.', 'We are satisfied that the trial justice overlooked this evidence and failed to make any findings as to whether Mr. Tench’s efforts to seek visitation were in fact a good faith attempt to establish a relationship with the child sufficient to overcome the evidence of abandonment or desertion.

19,: v. : Carol Ann Silva. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson for the Court. This case arises out of a real property dispute in the town of Tiverton. The defendant, Carol Ann Silva, appeals from a Superior Court judgment declaring that she did not benefit from an easement over her neighbors’ property and enjoining her from trespassing on that property. On appeal, the defendant contends that the trial justice erred in two primary respects: (1) in declining to rule upon the defendant’s adverse possession claim; and (2) in granting injunctive relief to the plaintiffs. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The real property controversy in this case relates to a particular alleged right-of-way (referred to by the parties as “the Factory Privilege”) over a parcel of land in Tiverton owned by plaintiffs. The plaintiffs initiated this lawsuit when defendant allegedly trespassed on their land and brought in excavation equipment in an attempt to transform the Factory Privilege into a more permanent roadway. Ms. Silva testified that she planned to upgrade the Factory Privilege so that', '-1- she could more easily gain access to a parcel of land termed the “Meadow Lot,” of which she claimed ownership.', 'In their complaint, plaintiffs requested (1) an injunction preventing Ms. Silva from trespassing on their land; (2) a declaratory judgment indicating that Ms. Silva has no easement over their land; and (3) compensation for damages resulting from Ms. Silva’s intentional trespass onto their property.', 'These properties were also the subject of a prior lawsuit, entitled Carol Ann Manchester and Leonard W. Manchester v. Samuel Cory, NC 84-320 (the Cory case).1 In her complaint in the Cory case, Ms. Silva alleged that she and her then-husband owned the Meadow Lot and that the only access to such lot was through the property of Mr. Cory (the predecessor in interest to the instant plaintiffs). Ms. Silva and her then-husband sought a declaratory judgment to the effect that they had an easement over the Factory Privilege. They further sought injunctive relief in order to enjoin Mr. Cory from interfering with their use of the Factory Privilege.', 'In due course, the Cory case proceeded to a nonjury trial in the Newport County Superior Court, at the conclusion of which the trial justice issued a written decision denying the claim of the present defendant (Ms. Silva) and her then-husband. Final judgment was entered in favor of Mr. Cory on December 19, 1990. In his decision in the Cory case, the trial justice stated that, since Ms. Silva alleged that she had an easement appurtenant2 over the Factory Privilege, she would be required to first demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that she and her then- 1', 'The defendant in the case at bar, Carol Ann Silva, was previously known as Carol Ann Manchester. 2', 'Black’s Law Dictionary defines the term “easement appurtenant” as “[a]n easement created to benefit another tract of land, the use of [the] easement being incident to the ownership of that other tract.” Black’s Law Dictionary 586 (9th ed. 2009); see also McAusland v. Carrier, 880 A.2d 861, 863 (R.I. 2005).', '-2- husband owned the Meadow Lot—the parcel which adjoined and would be accessed by the purported right-of-way. The trial justice then found that Ms. Silva had not demonstrated that she and her then-husband owned the Meadow Lot. The trial justice stated that he found to be credible a surveyor’s testimony that Ms. Silva and her then-husband had never been deeded the Meadow Lot. The trial justice in the Cory case stated in conclusion that, “[s]ince the Plaintiffs [Ms. Silva and her then-husband] failed to demonstrate that they own the Meadow lot[,] this [c]ourt need not address the issue of whether [they have] an easement in [t]he Factory Privilege.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) In addition, the trial justice in the Cory case explicitly stated that he was not addressing the issue of whether Ms. Silva and her then-husband might have obtained title to the Meadow Lot through adverse possession, since that issue had not been raised at trial.', 'In the instant case, plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment, arguing that the issues before the court in this case had already been raised and decided in the Cory litigation. Having reviewed the motion, the memoranda submitted in support thereof, and the evidence in the record, a motion justice in the Newport County Superior Court concluded that “the confused and incomplete record makes it impossible to consider granting the motion.” Accordingly, the motion justice denied plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment.', 'Thereafter, a different justice in the Newport County Superior Court (sitting without a jury) conducted a trial and heard testimony with respect to this case on several dates from August through October of 2007.', 'On August 1, 2007, the trial justice heard the expert testimony of James Amarantes, a retired land surveyor who had also testified in the Cory case. Mr. Amarantes testified (as he had previously testified in the Cory case) that, after having completed an exhaustive analysis of the', '-3- chain of title, he had found no evidence that Ms. Silva owned the Meadow Lot. On September 6, 2007, the trial justice allowed plaintiffs to renew their motion for partial summary judgment, in which motion plaintiffs argued that, in view of the prior decision in the Cory case, the doctrine of res judicata barred the instant litigation. The trial justice reserved ruling on that motion and opted to hear the testimony of the following witnesses: Manuel Furtado (one of the plaintiffs); Donald J. Medeiros (a land surveyor called by defendant); and Ms. Silva. On September 20, 2007, the trial justice, over plaintiffs’ objection, permitted Ms. Silva to amend her answer to include a claim of adverse possession with respect to the Meadow Lot. And on October 24, 2007, the trial justice heard further testimony from Ms. Silva.', 'On July 5, 2008, the trial justice issued a written decision. In her decision, the trial justice set forth her finding that “[t]he credible evidence overwhelmingly establishes that the Defendant is not and cannot be the record title owner of the Meadow Lot.” (Footnote omitted.) As did the trial justice in the Cory case, the trial justice in the case at bar declared that “no easement burdening the Plaintiffs’ land has been established or proven.” The trial justice also granted plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief, stating that, “after evaluating all of the relevant, credible evidence, [it was her conclusion] that the Plaintiffs are entitled to the injunctive relief they seek, i.e., restraining the Defendant from trespassing upon their land.” (Footnote omitted.) The trial justice, having found that “[t]here is no evidence whatsoever contained in the record that the Defendant, Carol Ann Silva, acted at any time with malice or with a deliberate intent to trespass,” declined to grant plaintiffs compensatory damages for Ms. Silva’s alleged intentional trespass.', 'The trial justice further ruled that Ms. Silva’s claim of adverse possession was “futile,” because “none of the requirements per G.L. [1956] § 34-16-1 et seq. regarding notice and', '-4- procedure have been satisfied; nor have the rightful owners of Meadow Lot been advised of the Defendant’s claim to the land.” However, the trial justice declined to rule that Ms. Silva would be “forever barred by res judicata [from] pursuing her adverse possession claim.”', 'Judgment was entered in favor of plaintiffs on August 5, 2008.3 The defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court gives great weight to the factual findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury in a civil matter, and we will not disturb such findings unless they are “clearly erroneous or unless the trial justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence or unless the decision fails to do substantial justice between the parties.” Harris v.

However, because defendant did not raise this issue before the trial justice, we deem her argument with respect to standing to have been waived. See Direct Action for Rights and Equality v. Gannon, 713 A.2d 218, 222 (R.I. 1998) (stating that “standing is a separate and distinct legal concept from subject-matter jurisdiction” and indicating that standing can be waived by a party’s failure to raise the issue before the trial justice).', '-6-', 'A', 'Adverse Possession', 'In her written decision, the trial justice ruled that Ms. Silva’s adverse possession claim was “futile” because defendant did not comply with the requirements of G.L. 1956 chapter 16 of title 34 and did not notify the record owners of the Meadow Lot of her claim.5 Ms. Silva contends that “[i]t was clear [error] of law for the trial judge to refuse to rule on [her] clearly established adverse possession claim.”', 'Ms. Silva, citing Sleboda v. Heirs at Law of Harris, 508 A.2d 652 (R.I. 1986), contends that notice is not required in an adverse possession case. In essence, Sleboda held that a party’s right of redemption may be extinguished by adverse possession, reasoning that the General Assembly has provided a statutory scheme for quieting title. Id. at 656. The defendant asserts that she has met the statutory requirements of adverse possession that are set forth in § 34-16-7 and that were specifically alluded to in Sleboda. See Sleboda, 508 A.2d at 656.', 'It is true that § 34-16-7 creates a “rebuttable presumption” of adverse possession where there has been “[o]pen, adverse, exclusive, and uninterrupted possession and enjoyment by the plaintiff, or by his or her predecessors in title or both the plaintiff and predecessors together of the real estate or his, her, or their interest therein described in the complaint, for a period of at least ten (10) years * * *.” See Sleboda, 508 A.2d at 656. However, Sleboda also stands for the proposition that, in order to reap the benefits of adverse possession pursuant to § 34-16-7, a party must first satisfy the procedural requirements of chapter 16 of title 34. Sleboda, 508 A.2d at 656-57. 5', 'The record reflects that the record owners of the Meadow Lot are the heirs of one Joshua C.

The statute provides a method whereby interested parties must be given notice and joined as necessary parties to such an action. Section 34-16-2. The statute also provides the procedure for service of process upon known resident and nonresident defendants and upon unknown defendants or those with unknown addresses. Sections 34-16-10, 34-16-11, and 34-16-12. Before hearing a claim of adverse possession, a trial justice must be satisfied that there has been full compliance with the statutory requirements as to service of process. Section 34-16-13. This Court has further held that compliance with these statutory provisions is required before a party may properly assert a claim of adverse possession. See Conti v. Hines, 659 A.2d 117, 118 (R.I. 1995) (affirming the dismissal of an action to quiet title due to the plaintiff’s failure to comply with § 34-16-2); Day v.

The trial justice based her decision largely on the “credible and comprehensive testimony of Mr. Amarantes * * *.” In her written decision, the trial justice summarized the “relevant conveyances” which Mr. Amarantes had recounted in “painstaking detail.” It is our judgment that, in granting injunctive relief in favor of the plaintiffs, the trial justice did not misapply the law, misconceive or overlook material evidence, or make factual findings that were clearly wrong.

Joseph Medeiros (Medeiros or defendant) appeals from a judgment of conviction on two counts of second-degree child molestation, one count of first- degree sexual assault, and one count of second-degree sexual assault. On appeal, he argues that the trial justice erred when she permitted the state to present the witness statement of a prior molestation victim of the defendant under Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. Additionally, the defendant argues that the trial justice abused her discretion when she adjudicated him guilty and when she denied his motion for a new trial. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Until July 2004, Medeiros lived in Tiverton with his girlfriend and their two young sons. His girlfriend’s daughter from a previous relationship, Jennifer Richards, 1 also lived in the couple’s home until she moved to Westport, Massachusetts, in 2002 at the age of thirteen to live with her father. Medeiros’s relationship with Jennifer’s mother had begun when Jennifer was three or four years old. When the couple moved to Tiverton in 1998, Jennifer was nine years old. According to Jennifer, at that time she and Medeiros had a “normal relationship” similar to that usually found between a stepfather and stepdaughter.', 'However, Jennifer recalled that their relationship soon changed. She said that Medeiros began making inappropriate comments to her about her appearance. According to Jennifer, he later began to touch her inappropriately. She said that when she was still nine years old, Medeiros stood behind her to help her open the door to their home’s garage and he touched her vagina, buttocks, and chest over her clothes. She did not tell anyone about this incident after it happened because she “didn’t really understand what was going on at that point” and “was just really confused and not sure what to do about it.”', 'According to Jennifer, Medeiros inappropriately touched her again a couple of months after the first incident. This time, she and her youngest brother, then a toddler, were in the garage preparing to ride a dirt bike together. As she put her helmet on and assisted her brother with his, Medeiros sat on the dirt bike behind her and touched her between her legs over her clothing with both hands. Jennifer managed to get her brother on the bike, and she rode away. 1', 'We have used a pseudonym to protect the identity of the complaining witness.', '-2- Jennifer said that as she did so Medeiros pushed her head forward, told her “to shut up,” and called her a “bitch.”', 'Jennifer said that another incident involving her and Medeiros occurred when she was fourteen, after she had moved out of the Tiverton home to live with her father. She was visiting her family in Tiverton during her summer vacation and spent the evening in her bedroom alone before socializing with friends. Her mother was not home, and her younger brothers were elsewhere in the house playing. As she sat on her bed, Medeiros angrily came into her room. Jennifer said that she thought that he was aggravated because she had not completed some chore. According to Jennifer, he “pulled [her] to the edge of the bed and pulled [her] pants off.” She said that he then “took [her] round [hair] brush and proceeded to shove it inside of [her].” He did this “a couple of times” while she attempted “to push him off” and “tell[] him to stop.” Jennifer said that Medeiros then called her a “bitch” and told her “to shut up.” She recalled that she didn’t tell anyone about the incident because she “was scared.” According to Jennifer, Medeiros told her that her brothers would be taken away and her mother wouldn’t love her anymore if she told anyone what had happened.', 'Jennifer said that the next incident occurred when she was fifteen years old. She awoke in her bed to find that her pajama bottoms had been removed and that Medeiros was attempting to have sexual intercourse with her. 2 Jennifer said that she pushed him off her, and he told her “to shut up” again. She said that this was the last such incident that occurred between her and Medeiros. 2', 'Jennifer also said that at the time of this incident she had been taking sleeping medication for about a year.', '-3-', 'Approximately a month and a half later, Jennifer learned that Medeiros also had been accused of sexually assaulting her best friend, Tanya. 3 He was arrested in early July 2004. Thereafter, the Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) questioned Jennifer as part of an investigation that was precipitated by Medeiros’s arrest. However, she acknowledged that she maintained to investigators that Medeiros had never touched her inappropriately. Jennifer said that she didn’t tell DCYF about the incidents because she “was scared” and feared that her brothers would be taken away if she came forward. Ultimately, Medeiros entered a plea of nolo contendere on two counts of third-degree sexual assault against Tanya.', 'Jennifer wrote a favorable letter about Medeiros entitled “Why We Need Joe” for his sentencing hearing in that case. She said that she wrote the letter because she “was still scared” and because her mother and brothers “were going through so much that [she] didn’t want to make it worse.” 4', 'Eventually, Jennifer told her friends that she had been “sexually abused” and that she “didn’t know what to do about it.”', 'She reported her allegations to the Tiverton Police Department on August 27, 2004. 5 On November 17, 2006, a grand jury returned an indictment 3', 'Tanya, also a pseudonym, described Medeiros as a “good family friend” who worked with her father. She had known him for her entire life. According to Tanya, when she was approximately eleven years old her relationship with Medeiros changed; he started to kiss her and touch her inappropriately. Eventually, when she was not yet twelve years old, she said that they began to have sexual intercourse. This behavior persisted for about a year, but Tanya did not tell Jennifer about what was happening between her and defendant because she was “scared” and “didn’t want to hurt [Jennifer’s] family.” According to Jennifer, she and a friend began to suspect that Medeiros and Tanya were spending time together in the woods and reported the suspicions to her friend’s mother who, in turn, informed Tanya’s mother.

That statement had served as the basis for a charge of second-degree child molestation against Medeiros in 1991, to which he had pleaded nolo contendere. 6', 'In her statement, dated June 14, 1990, the victim, who was the then eight-year-old female cousin of defendant, said that three days earlier she had been watching television on the couch in her mother’s living room with defendant when he “started to touch [her] on [her] private parts” over her clothes. She also said in the statement that Medeiros had touched her inappropriately in the past and “told [her] not to tell [her] mother or father.” The statement also contained a description of an incident that had occurred two weeks earlier when defendant exposed himself to her by pulling down his pants while she was watching television. The victim also indicated in the statement that defendant then pulled his pants up and sat next to her on the couch while he touched her vaginal area over her clothes. At the time of this incident, Medeiros lived in another apartment in the same building in which the victim resided and he would babysit the victim occasionally.', 'The state offered the witness statement “to show that Mr. Medeiros’s sexual behavior towards [Jennifer Richards] was part of a common scheme or plan of sexual misconduct that Mr. Medeiros carried out against children of a similar age, and at a time when they * * * were under Mr. Medeiros’s control to a certain extent.” The record indicates that there was “extensive discussion regarding the evidentiary relevance of this statement in chambers” as well as two years was to be able to talk in front of others about what she alleged had occurred between herself and Medeiros. 6', 'Medeiros received a nine-year suspended sentence and nine years of probation.', '-5- defendant’s objection to the admission of the statement. Nonetheless, the trial justice ruled that the statement was admissible.', 'The defendant waived his right to a jury trial, and a trial was held before a justice of the Superior Court on December 9, 10, 11, 12, and 16, 2008. Jennifer, the Tiverton police officers who received Jennifer’s complaint in 2004, Tanya, Tanya’s mother, and defendant’s mother testified at trial. Medeiros was convicted on all counts. On March 4, 2009, the trial justice heard and denied defendant’s motion for a new trial. On that day he was sentenced to a term of fifty years, with thirty years to serve and twenty years suspended, with twenty years of probation for first-degree sexual assault, two concurrent terms of fifteen years, with ten years to serve and five years suspended, with a period of five years probation for two counts of second-degree child molestation, and a concurrent term of twenty-five years, with fifteen years to serve and ten years suspended, with ten years of probation for second-degree sexual assault.', 'Medeiros timely appealed to this Court.', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'Medeiros raises two arguments on appeal. First, he argues that the trial justice abused her discretion when she admitted into evidence the witness statement of a prior molestation victim of defendant under Rule 404(b). 7 Second, defendant contends that the trial justice abused her discretion when she found him guilty of the charges and when she denied his motion for a new 7', 'Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence provides in relevant part:', '“Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to', 'prove the character of a person in order to show that the person', 'acted in conformity therewith.

The discussions between the trial justice and the parties about the admissibility of this evidence occurred in chambers without the presence of a stenographer and, therefore, were not on the record. The defendant faults the trial justice for failure “to place on the record the reasons behind her ruling on admissibility.” However, it is the responsibility of the party claiming the error to provide a complete record so that this Court may weigh the merits. See Shorrock v. Scott, 944 A.2d 861, 864 (R.I. 2008) (“It was [the] defendant’s responsibility to provide those portions of the trial transcript that are necessary for this Court to perform a meaningful review.”); State v. Pineda, 712 A.2d 858, 861 (R.I. 1998) (declining “to overlook the glaring defects in [the] record” furnished by the petitioner). In our opinion, defendant had a responsibility to request that the trial justice place the rationale for her reasoning on the record. He does not contend that she refused to do so. Therefore, “[i]n the absence of the transcript or other adequate record of the proceedings in the court below, we are unable to consider the issues raised by [the] defendant’s appeal.” State v. Jennings, 117 R.I. 291, 294, 366 A.2d 543, 545 (1976).', 'Although it is our opinion that this issue has not been properly preserved, we recognize that the state has conceded in its brief that the record is sufficient to demonstrate that the witness', '-7- statement was properly admitted. Therefore, we shall address the issue briefly. Based upon the record before us, we conclude that defendant’s argument lacks merit.', 'The essential facts of Medeiros’s previous sexual misconduct with his cousin, as set forth in her witness statement are not in dispute; they also bear many similarities to Jennifer’s testimony, which the trial justice found to be credible. The incident involving Medeiros’s cousin occurred in 1990 when she was eight years old. The first incident with Jennifer occurred when she was nine years old. In both cases, Medeiros was an older adult relative who lived in the same household with each girl at the time of the sexual misconduct. In addition, the nature of the offensive touchings began in a strikingly similar fashion. In her witness statement, Medeiros’s cousin said he touched her private parts over her clothes, whereas Jennifer testified that Medeiros first touched her vagina, buttocks, and chest over her clothes. In light of the evidence that is in the record, we cannot say that the trial justice abused her discretion in admitting the 1990 witness statement of Medeiros’s cousin. We conclude, rather, that the prior incident was similar to the charged offense, nonremote, and tended to show a common scheme or plan to sexually assault young girls in his family.', 'Moreover, given that this evidence was admitted in the context of a jury-waived trial, any risk of unfair prejudice was substantially diminished. See State v. Edwards, 810 A.2d 226, 242 (R.I. 2002) (noting that in nonjury trials, “the risk of undue prejudice under [R.I. R. Evid.] Rule 403 * * * [is] minimal”). Because this was a jury-waived trial, and because of the deference we afford to the trial justice’s evidentiary rulings, we cannot say that the probative value of this relevant evidence was “substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.” Rule 403. Therefore, even if this issue was properly before this Court, we would not be able to say that the', '-8- trial justice abused her discretion when she ruled that the witness statement was admissible evidence.', 'B', 'Adjudication of Defendant as Guilty and Denial of the Motion for a New Trial', 'Before she found defendant guilty of all charges, the trial justice made a number of factual findings. She described the incidents that Jennifer testified about and how Jennifer eventually came forward with the allegations against defendant. She found it “clear beyond any doubt” that Jennifer’s testimony was “believable” and “completely truthful.” Accordingly, the trial justice found that “the defendant has been proven guilty based on [Jennifer’s] testimony and all of the other evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.”', 'During the hearing on the motion for a new trial, defense counsel urged that the trial justice erred when she found defendant guilty because “it appeared that [the trial justice] really did not digest or pay attention to any defense witnesses or any defense exhibits” and rather based her decision on Jennifer’s testimony, which she found to be credible. He also argued that the trial justice improperly considered documents that were not in evidence. When she ruled on defendant’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice incorporated her findings “concerning the adjudication of guilt and the assessment of credibility of witnesses.” She acknowledged that the documents that defendant objected to were not included as evidence and conceded that she had reviewed them, but she explained that she did not rely on the documents “in any fashion.” Additionally, the trial justice discussed the testimony of defendant’s mother and concluded that her testimony did not impact the trial justice’s assessment of Jennifer’s credibility. Finally, she assured defendant’s counsel that she had indeed read the DCYF records and Jennifer’s hand- written letters in which she claimed that defendant had never harmed her “in the context of the', '-9- trial, and in no way do they undermine this Court’s eventual and final assessment of [Jennifer’s] testimony, which I stand by.” She then denied defendant’s motion for a new trial and proceeded to sentence him.', '1', 'Standard of Review', '“In a jury-waived criminal proceeding, this Court gives deference to a trial justice’s finding[s] of facts.” State v. Adewumi, 966 A.2d 1217, 1221-22 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. Forand, 958 A.2d 134, 138 (R.I. 2008)). When we review these “determinations of credibility and findings of fact by a trial justice sitting without a jury, this Court will not disturb the trial justice’s findings unless they are clearly wrong or the trial justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence on a controlling issue.” Id. (quoting State v. LaCroix, 911 A.2d 674, 679 (R.I. 2006)).', '“It is well-established that we ‘accord a great deal of respect to the factual determinations and credibility assessments made by the judicial officer who has actually observed the human drama that is part and parcel of every trial and who has had an opportunity to appraise witness demeanor and to take into account other realities that cannot be grasped from a reading of a cold record.’” State v. Erminelli, 991 A.2d 1064, 1069 (R.I. 2010) (quoting State v.

DiPetrillo, 922 A.2d 124, 131 (R.I.', '- 10 - 2007)). Therefore, “[s]uch determinations are entitled to great weight and will not be disturbed unless the trial justice has overlooked or misconceived relevant and material evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.” Id.', '2', 'Discussion', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice overlooked and misconceived the material evidence, both when she adjudicated defendant guilty and in her decision on the motion for a new trial. He contends that she did not acknowledge evidence such as Jennifer’s letter in favor of defendant and other inconsistencies in Jennifer’s testimony. Medeiros also maintains that the trial justice overlooked the fact that Jennifer did not come forward with her allegations against him even after he was incarcerated following his July 2004 arrest, which he concludes weakened Jennifer’s rationale that she delayed coming forward because she was afraid of him. He further faults the trial justice for not even referring to Jennifer’s testimony that defendant sexually assaulted her on July 10, 2004, which clearly was incorrect because defendant was incarcerated on that date. The defendant finally contends that the trial justice’s reference to documents that were not in evidence “alone requires the granting of a new trial,” despite her statement that she did not rely on them. Finally, he argues that “deference is not due” to the trial justice’s decisions because she “overlooked virtually the entire defense.”', 'After carefully reviewing the record and viewing the trial justice’s findings of fact and credibility determinations through a prism of deference, as we must, we are of the opinion that the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive the material evidence as defendant contends. We further are satisfied that she appropriately excised from the decision-making process any reference she made to documents that were not in evidence. As a result, we hold that the trial', '- 11 - justice did not err when she adjudicated defendant guilty and when she denied his motion for a new trial.', 'After hearing the testimony of the witnesses and receiving other evidence, the trial justice found Jennifer’s testimony to be truthful. She said that she could not perceive any reason “why [Jennifer] would ever manufacture under these circumstances a story about Joseph Medeiros.” She found that Jennifer “was absolutely, absolutely devoted to [her two younger brothers], and that remained a moving force in her concealment of the activities.” Although defendant offers several reasons why Jennifer might have fabricated her testimony, from anger over his “relationship” with her best friend or jealousy over the attention her young friend received, the trial justice made credibility determinations and found that such purported motivations did not sway her. Under our deferential standard of review, we decline to disturb those findings on appeal. See State v. Woods, 936 A.2d 195, 198 (R.I. 2007) (“We will not interfere with the hearing justice’s conclusions with respect to the credibility of the complaining child-witness. We do not have the same vantage point as the presiding judge, and we are unable to assess the witness’ demeanor, tone of voice, and body language.”).', 'We do not agree with defendant’s argument that the trial justice overlooked documentary evidence and “did not digest or pay attention to any defense witnesses or any defense exhibits.” Indeed, the trial justice reviewed the testimony of defendant’s mother, which she reiterated did not affect her evaluation of Jennifer and Tanya’s credibility. Defense counsel acknowledged that he was “sure [the trial justice] looked at all the exhibits,” but he objected to her failure to specifically refer to them in her decision. Nonetheless, the trial justice assured him that she had not overlooked any exhibits and said unequivocally that she had read the DCYF reports and Jennifer’s letters “many, many times before trial” and “again before making [her] decision.”', '- 12 -', 'We reiterate that the trial justice’s findings of fact and credibility determinations are entitled to great weight when we review the denial of a Rule 33 motion in the context of a jury- waived trial. See Adewumi, 966 A.2d at 1223. The defendant’s motion for a new trial in this jury-waived criminal trial was not accompanied by an offer of newly discovered evidence, and he must overcome a high hurdle in demonstrating that the trial justice abused her discretion when she denied his motion. See Erminelli, 991 A.2d at 1070. In our opinion, he did not do so. Therefore, in light of the trial justice’s specific assurances that she reviewed all the evidence, and in consideration of her finding that Jennifer’s testimony was credible, we cannot say that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived the material evidence or that she otherwise was clearly wrong when she adjudicated the defendant guilty and when she denied his motion for a new trial.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of conviction.

This consolidated appeal involves two cases concerning the estate of the late Kathleen T. Connor (Kathleen). The first case is a declaratory- judgment action in which the plaintiffs, Leo Connor and Eugene Connor (the Connors or plaintiffs), (1) challenged a deed (2001 deed) executed by Kathleen, 1 their sister and aunt, respectively, and a power of attorney she executed in 2002 in favor of Virginia Schlemmer- Lavoie (Virginia); and (2) requested the imposition of a constructive trust on Kathleen’s former home.

A jury returned a verdict finding that Kathleen lacked sufficient mind and memory necessary to execute the will. Judgment was then entered in favor of the Connors, declaring the 2002 will null and void and 1', 'We refer to the people involved in this case by their first names for the sake of clarity because many share the same surname.

Shortly thereafter, however, the trial justice granted the motion of the Estate of Kathleen Connor (the estate) for a new trial in an order entered on December 18, 2007.', 'The Connors timely filed notices of appeal in both cases. The cases were consolidated for the purposes of this appeal. For the reasons discussed in this opinion, we affirm both the judgment and the order of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts 2 and Procedural History', 'A', 'Background', 'Kathleen T. Connor was born in January 1909, one of four children. In 1913, Kathleen’s family moved to a farm on Mann School Road in Smithfield, where she would reside almost continuously until her death in 2006. Kathleen’s cousin, Mary Donahue (later Schlemmer), also resided on the family farm and regarded Kathleen as “[her] big sister.” Kathleen remained close to Mary throughout her life. 3', 'She also enjoyed close relationships with Mary’s children, especially her daughter Virginia. At trial, Virginia testified that she loved Kathleen “like a mother.” According to Mary, Kathleen often referred to Virginia as “the daughter I never had.”', 'Around 1960, Kathleen’s two brothers, John, Jr. (Jack) and Leo, moved to New Hampshire and Vermont, respectively.', 'By 1977, Kathleen was the sole occupant of the Smithfield farmhouse. In 1988, a developer bought the land surrounding the farmhouse, but Kathleen’s nephews and brother Leo secured a deed for a rental property adjacent to the 2', 'The facts narrated in the following pages were adduced from the testimony of the multiple witnesses who testified at trial. 3', 'Elaine Ford, a relative of the Connors by marriage who attended the same church as Kathleen and who was called as a witness at trial by the Connors, referred to Mary as Kathleen’s “sister.”', '-2- farmhouse and two-and-one-half acres of land for Kathleen. Although the brothers and their families lived in another state, they tried to visit Kathleen in Rhode Island regularly, and they celebrated holidays and family occasions with her. For many years, Kathleen also wintered with Jack and his family in Florida.', 'In 1976, Kathleen executed a will leaving the farmhouse to her brothers, Jack and Leo, and her residuary estate to her sisters-in-law, with various other specific bequests going to her extended family.', 'Her nephew, Eugene Connor, testified that he specifically recalled one occasion on which Kathleen stated that she did not include Mary in her estate plan because she was “not a blood relative.” 4 In 1985, Kathleen executed a second will that largely retained the same estate plan as the 1976 will. She requested a copy of her 1985 will from the drafting attorney’s office in 1991, but apparently did not make any changes to her estate plan at that time.', 'By the late 1990s, Kathleen had begun exhibiting some signs of mental deterioration and confusion. At trial, Kathleen’s nephew Leo Connor, Jr. (Jerry), testified that around that time he “noticed * * * that she was always asking [him] the same questions and she would get [her brother Leo] mixed up with [her brother Jack] and things of that nature.” One of Kathleen’s nieces, Caroline Connor Martone, testified that, in April 2001, she and her family visited Kathleen unannounced and that Kathleen would not let them into her house and seemed “unlike” herself. 5', 'In May 2001, Kathleen was operating an automobile and accidentally struck a telephone pole in Smithfield, causing significant damage. 4', 'Kathleen’s nephew, Leo Connor, Jr., also testified that Kathleen mentioned “on a regular basis” that Mary Schlemmer “wasn’t a blood relative, meaning that she wasn’t a brother or sister.” Another nephew, Michael Connor, testified similarly. 5', 'At trial, Mary explained that Kathleen, who was ninety-two at the time of the incident, stated that she was startled by the unexpected visit and “didn’t feel up” to hosting Caroline’s eight children in her home.', '-3-', 'Mary and her children, who took Kathleen to most of her medical appointments, informed Kathleen’s primary-care physician, Stephen A. Fanning, III, D.O., that she was becoming “increasingly forgetful.” According to a medical report prepared by Dr. Fanning on July 19, 2001, his “initial impression” of his patient was that she was suffering from dementia. He recommended that she “should not drive [her] car” and suggested a living will and a power of attorney.', 'Soon thereafter, Mary’s financial advisor prepared a power of attorney for Kathleen to sign. When Kathleen appeared reluctant to execute the power of attorney, her brother Leo and his son Michael came to Rhode Island at Mary’s request 6 and persuaded her to do so on August 1, 2001. According to Michael, his father “thought Kathleen’s care would best be given to Mary Schlemmer[,] and so he had no reservation about giving her the power of attorney.” Virginia’s name was added to the power of attorney form shortly thereafter. 7 At trial, Michael and Mary agreed that Kathleen seemed competent to sign the power-of-attorney form.', 'On August 17, 2001, Mary’s daughter, Alice Schlemmer, told Dr. Fanning that Kathleen was not eating, displayed increased memory loss, refused to let visitors enter her home, and was reluctant to visit her doctor. Doctor Fanning recommended placing Kathleen in an assisted- living facility, fearing that otherwise she “may wind up in [the] hospital.” In September of that same year, Mary took Kathleen to see Jon Stoukides, M.D., director of geriatrics at Roger Williams Hospital, who made a “presumptive diagnosis” of Alzheimer’s disease following some 6', 'According to Michael Connor, at that time (summer 2001), Mary informed him and his father that Kathleen “was losing the rent money that was paid to her[,] * * * [and] would be delinquent on telephone or power bills * * *.” At trial, Mary confirmed that she told Leo and Michael that Kathleen was “becoming forgetful” and at times forgot to mail in payment of her bills. 7', 'According to Virginia’s trial testimony, she was not informed that she had power of attorney for Kathleen until sometime after it was executed. She also stated that, at that time, she did not believe that her name actually had been added. An additional power of attorney was executed in February 2002, naming only Virginia. Virginia never exercised the power of attorney.', '-4- “cursory mental status testing to assess * * * memory and cognitive function * * *.” At trial, Dr. Stoukides had “absolutely no recollection of” having treated Kathleen. Upon reviewing his office notes, however, Dr. Stoukides testified that Kathleen “scored 19 out of 30” on the Folstein Mini-Mental State Exam. This score indicated that Kathleen was operating at a “medium level” indicating “some degree of [mental] impairment * * *.” In his opinion, “her judgment seemed fair in spite of her illness * * * and * * * her mood and affect seemed appropriate.” After a second appointment on October 23, 2001, Dr. Stoukides reaffirmed his impression that Kathleen was experiencing “memory loss consistent with Alzheimer’s * * *.”', 'In September 2001, Mary met with Kathleen Biddle, a registered nurse at the Dora C. Howard Centre (Centre). According to Ms. Biddle’s trial testimony, Kathleen spent one day (approximately four hours) at the Centre in October 2001. During that time, Ms. Biddle prepared various application materials and intake surveys with information supplied by Mary. According to these documents and Ms. Biddle’s testimony, Mary described Kathleen’s short-term memory loss as “severe” and her long-term memory loss as mild to moderate. Mary also informed her that Kathleen was not able to make financial and healthcare decisions independently. Ms. Biddle testified on cross-examination, however, that Kathleen was able to make decisions about personal relationships; she knew her family members and could relate to them. Ms. Biddle found Kathleen “very sociable,” articulate, and appropriately behaved while at the Centre.', 'In November 2001, Kathleen moved into North Bay Manor, an assisted-living facility in Smithfield. Mary visited her there “almost every day” and often took her out for church, errands, and family holidays. According to Mary, her five daughters visited with Kathleen on a daily basis, especially Virginia, whom Kathleen dubbed “Ginny on-the-spot.” Virginia often took Kathleen to “spend the day” at the farmhouse during this period. At trial, Raymond Maxwell,', '-5- the executive director of North Bay Manor, testified that Kathleen appeared to be of sound mind when she moved into the assisted-living facility and that she remained in that condition for “quite a bit of time.” Mr. Maxwell also stated that Mary, Virginia, and other members of the Schlemmer family were regular visitors, although he saw Kathleen’s Connor relatives visiting on only one occasion. Rose Marie Paul, a licensed practical nurse at North Bay Manor during Kathleen’s residence there, testified similarly to Mr. Maxwell. Additionally, Ms. Paul testified that Kathleen’s low score on a March 2002 Folstein Mini-Mental State Exam probably was due to the fact that Kathleen was suffering from a urinary-tract infection at the time because “knowing her, there had to have been something going on [to explain the low score].”', 'According to Mary, Kathleen “had told [her] over the years that she had intentions * * * [of putting Virginia’s] name on [the deed of] her house because [Virginia] had always been so good to her.” At trial, Virginia testified that Kathleen had mentioned a similar plan to her over the course of several years and expressed a definite intention to add Virginia’s name to the deed shortly after moving into North Bay Manor. 8', 'In December 2001, Kathleen conveyed the family residence to herself and Virginia as joint tenants by way of a quitclaim deed. Kathleen’s attorney, Frank Mastrati, Jr., was referred to her by the Schlemmers’ financial advisor upon inquiry by Virginia. Virginia paid some or all of Mr. Mastrati’s fee.', 'Attorney Mastrati concentrates his practice in elder law. He initially met with Kathleen at North Bay Manor in November or early December 2001, and Virginia joined them for the introductions. Attorney Mastrati then spoke with Kathleen privately for approximately one hour. 8', 'On the contrary, in their brief, plaintiffs contend that Virginia “resolved to take action” to prevent Kathleen’s house from being sold to pay for her living expenses. Thus, they suggest that Virginia was the impetus and the driving force behind the execution of the new deed.', '-6- After some “general conversation” (in which Kathleen impressed him as a “very lovely lady”), Kathleen informed him that “she wanted a deed done and she wanted to place Virginia Schlemmer’s name on the deed with her.” At trial, attorney Mastrati recalled that Kathleen “talked about Ginny with * * * a fondness of a mother talking about a daughter.” He also recounted how he “went over the pros and cons of the deed and * * * explained to her the disadvantages of adding Virginia’s name to the deed * * *.” He testified that he was convinced that Kathleen understood the various potential disadvantages he described and was of sound mind to execute the deed at the time.', 'Attorney Mastrati prepared the deed and then returned to North Bay Manor in December 2001 for a second, also private, meeting with Kathleen. At that second meeting, he testified, he “reiterated all the positive[s] and negatives of placing Virginia on the deed so [Kathleen] fully understood what she [was doing].” He reaffirmed at trial that he believed she understood him and was of sound mind at that time. At a third meeting, also in December 2001, the deed conveying the property to Kathleen and Virginia was executed. Neither Virginia nor Kathleen ever mentioned the new deed to their family members, including Mary.', 'Attorney Mastrati also was retained to draft a new will for Kathleen. Attorney Mastrati testified that, when meeting with Kathleen to discuss the particulars of the will, he asked her whether she already had a will, and she replied that she did not. Kathleen provided him with some notes concerning her wishes, and he also took notes during their discussion of the will. During the meeting, Mr. Mastrati recalled, she mentioned that although she had no children, she did have some family in Vermont or New Hampshire. She also referred to Mary as her sister (not her cousin).', '-7-', 'According to attorney Mastrati, Kathleen expressed a desire to leave her house to Virginia in her will. At trial, Mr. Mastrati stated that he explained that such a gift would be redundant, since she already had deeded the property in joint tenancy to Virginia. Although he believed that Kathleen understood this, like many of his elderly clients, she wanted to include the gift in her will even though she already had executed the deed.', 'Kathleen executed her new will on February 25, 2002, after reviewing it for ten to fifteen minutes and correcting some spelling errors. 9 Attorney Mastrati signed as a witness, and he testified at trial that he was satisfied that Kathleen was of sound mind and competent to make a will on the basis of his several meetings and discussions with her. Thereafter, Kathleen also executed general and healthcare powers of attorney naming Virginia.', 'On March 5, 2002, Mary Lou DuClos, a social worker at North Bay Manor, administered a Folstein Mini-Mental State Exam to Kathleen. Kathleen scored ten out of thirty possible points on the exam, indicating “comprehensive deficits.”', 'According to trial testimony, the plaintiffs eventually learned of the 2001 deed during the summer of 2004. Eugene, Leo, and Michael were in Rhode Island to visit Kathleen and stopped by the farmhouse to see how it was being maintained. They discovered that “a lot of work had been done * * * inside the house and that the attic had been cleaned out * * *.” They also discovered that “the barn had been demolished, and [they] began to wonder what was going on * * * and who was paying for all of the work * * *.” Suspicions aroused, the Connors visited the Smithfield registry of deeds, where they learned that the property was now jointly held by both Kathleen and Virginia. 9', 'The will referred to Kathleen as “Kathleen J. Connor” instead of “Kathleen T. Connor.” She made no correction to her name in the body of the will, but signed as “Kathleen T. Connor.”', '-8-', 'In early 2005, plaintiffs filed a petition in the Smithfield Probate Court seeking the appointment of a guardian ad litem to manage Kathleen’s finances. The Probate Court appointed Paula Cuculo, a North Providence probate judge, as a guardian ad litem for Kathleen. In February 2005, Ms. Cuculo met with Kathleen at North Bay Manor. Mr. Mastrati was present at this meeting, but did not speak or participate in the discussion, per Ms. Cuculo’s request. According to Ms. Cuculo’s trial testimony, Kathleen was familiar with the estate plan that attorney Mastrati prepared in 2001. Kathleen also knew that she had given powers of attorney to Mary and Virginia. Ms. Cuculo testified that she was “impressed” that, at the age of ninety-six, Kathleen was “as cognizant and articulate as she was,” and Ms. Cuculo noted that “you could tell she took good care of herself.” In sum, she found Kathleen to be “forgetful but * * * cognizant. She was aware, she was easy to talk to. She * * * knew whatever you asked her, she could answer a question.” Ms. Cuculo conceded that Kathleen was unable to remember where her brother Leo lived, could not recall that her brother Jack was deceased, and displayed other signs of confusion.', 'Ms. Cuculo also spoke with Michael, Eugene, Mary, Virginia, Dr. Fanning, and attorney Mastrati.', 'In her report, she concluded that the previously executed powers of attorney constituted a “less restrictive relationship” than the requested guardianship, that Kathleen’s personal and financial needs were being met by the donees of the powers of attorney, and that nothing Ms. Cuculo uncovered during the course of her investigation indicated that “[the power- of-attorney] documents had been improperly prepared or that [Kathleen] didn’t have the capacity to * * * prepare and execute them.” She therefore advised that a guardianship was not necessary in Kathleen’s case.', '-9-', 'In December 2005, the Connors brought this action for declaratory judgment seeking to invalidate the deed on grounds of lack of capacity and/or undue influence and requesting a constructive trust.', 'Unfortunately, Kathleen fell in the dining area at North Bay Manor in January 2006, suffering fractures in her hip and leg. She underwent surgery and remained hospitalized for several days. Upon discharge, Kathleen returned to North Bay Manor for a couple of months.', 'According to Virginia, she had promised Kathleen that when the time came she would help to fulfill Kathleen’s wish to die in her own home. In March, Kathleen was removed from North Bay Manor and moved to the home of one of Mary’s daughters, where she received end- of-life care. She died in June 2006.', 'B', 'Trial', 'A seven-day trial on the consolidated cases was held before a jury, between October 30 and November 7, 2007. The jury served as the trier of fact in the Probate Court appeal, but only rendered an advisory verdict in the declaratory-judgment action because that case implicated the Superior Court’s equity jurisdiction.', 'The Connors presented eight witnesses, several of whom were Kathleen’s family members or close relations, including Caroline Connor Martone, Leo Connor, Jr., Michael Connor, and Elaine Ford.', 'The Connors also presented the testimony of several medical professionals who evaluated Kathleen—Ms. DuClos, Dr. Stoukides, and Ms. Biddle.', 'The defendants presented fourteen witnesses: Mary Schlemmer; her daughters Virginia, Ann Marie Leach, and Theresa Garlacy; Kathleen’s friends Patricia Jaswell and Sonya Muscatelli; 10 10', 'Both friends testified to the effect that Kathleen was of sound mind during the period when the will and deed were drafted and executed.', '- 10 - Raymond Maxwell; Rose Marie Paul; Dr. Fanning; attorney Mastrati; attorney Cuculo; and attorney Robert D.

The defendants also presented the testimony of Mary Elizabeth Ouellette (a florist), 11 and Eugene to impeach his testimony.', 'Additionally, defendants presented several video clips showing Kathleen on her birthday in 1999, and on other occasions in October 2001, December 2001, December 2002, and January 2005.', 'The jury returned a verdict in favor of the Connors in both cases, finding that Kathleen lacked sufficient mind and memory to execute both the will and the deed. The jury’s decision that Kathleen did not possess sufficient mind and memory necessary to execute a deed, however, was strictly advisory. 12 Addressing himself to the question of the deed, the trial justice strongly disagreed with the jury’s advisory finding, stating that those findings “shock[ed] the conscience of the Court * * *.” The trial justice observed that the case had “amazing analogies” to Pollard v. Hastings, 862 A.2d 770 (R.I. 2004), which affirmed a decision granting a new trial after the jury found the testator was not competent. Ultimately, the trial justice did not believe the Connors had presented clear and convincing evidence that Kathleen did not have capacity to execute the deed.', 'Specifically, the trial justice found Dr. Fanning “extremely persuasive” when he testified that Kathleen was “pleasantly confused” but had the “testamentary capacity” to understand her own affairs. In contrast, he noted that Dr. Stoukides could not “remember[] even interacting” with Kathleen and that the Folstein Mini-Mental State Exams relied on by the Connors were 11', 'Ms. Ouellette’s testimony was presented to impeach Eugene’s assertion that he and his family were not informed that Kathleen had been moved to Ann’s house before her death. 12', 'By mutual consent of counsel, the jurors were not informed that their findings in the declaratory-judgment action would only be “take[n] under advisement” by the trial justice.', '- 11 - merely “screening tests, not diagnostic” ones, and in addition there was evidence that Kathleen’s low scores could have been influenced by other factors.', 'The trial justice was also impressed with Ms. Cuculo—a witness who was well known to the court as “a woman of extremely high integrity”—and credited her testimony concerning Kathleen’s mental capacity.', 'He provided an overview of the testimony of the other trial witnesses, concluding that the weight of the credible evidence supported the proponents of the deed. After commenting on trial testimony and discussing the jury’s conclusion, the trial justice noted that the video clips that the proponents of the deed presented were “[t]he most telling evidence” that Kathleen was “an articulate, intelligent, well put-together woman,” and served to powerfully “bolster” the witness’ testimony.', 'Ultimately, the trial justice found that, although Kathleen probably missed her family from out of state, she did not feel abandoned by them and was well aware that Ms. Schlemmer was not her biological sibling. The evidence demonstrated, he found, that Mary and Virginia were “the constant in [Kathleen’s] life for some 15 or 16 years[.]” Although he believed that Mary and Virginia naturally exerted “influence” over Kathleen, he did not find such influence to be “undue.” Rather, he found that it was “an influence gained by love, compassion, meeting the needs of a woman getting older, [and] taking her into the bosom of their family.” In his opinion, the jury did not follow his instructions or “fully apprehend[] the burden of clear and convincing evidence * * *.” Judgment was entered in favor of the proponents of the deed in the declaratory- judgment action, and in favor of the challengers of Kathleen’s 2002 will in the Probate Court appeal (consistent with the jury’s verdict).', '- 12 -', 'C', 'Motion for Reconsideration and Motions for New Trial', 'The Connors filed a motion for reconsideration in the declaratory-judgment action on November 14, 2007. A hearing on the motion was held before the trial justice on November 19, 2007. At the conclusion of argument, the trial justice denied the motion from the bench. He noted that plaintiffs raised “for the first time * * * an allegation of fraud and deceit perpetrated by Virginia * * * and Mary * * * and Mr. Mastrati acting in concert which this Court completely discounts and gives absolutely no credence to.” He stated that he “did not think [a] constructive trust had been established just because there is a relation of confidence and trust * * *.” He specifically found “no undue influence in [the] case.”', 'The trial justice also discussed Mr. Masrati’s testimony at some length. He noted that, although Mr. Mastrati did seem somewhat unclear about the precise legal definition of “the natural objects of one’s bounty,” the trial justice could find “nothing wrong with the manner in which he conducted the will proceedings.” Indeed, he opined that “a workaday lawyer” would not normally ask elderly clients “who the natural objects of their bounty are, and if they appear to be competent on their face, [such lawyers] don’t ask about the family history.” While he conceded that Mr. Mastrati “[c]ould [possibly] have done a better job in interrogating [Kathleen],” he had ample opportunity, over the course of several meetings, to evaluate Kathleen’s competence.', 'He also specifically discussed the Connors’ arguments with respect to certain congruencies between Kathleen’s allegedly-undisclosed 1985 will and the 2002 will. Ultimately, he concluded that the similarities prove the “absence of fraud * * *.”', 'The trial justice also explained that, in rendering his decision in the declaratory-judgment action, he “didn’t rely on the video [from] 2005 or 2006 [recorded] just months before', '- 13 - [Kathleen’s] death.” Rather, he mentioned the videos “parenthetically and indicated that [they] did not weigh on [his] decision * * *.” In conclusion, the trial justice found that plaintiffs had failed to carry their burden of proof, while defendants demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that Kathleen was of sound mind at the time she executed the deed, was not the subject of undue influence, and was not defrauded or deceived.', 'On December 7, 2007, the estate moved for a new trial in the Probate Court appeal. The Connors moved for a new trial in the declaratory-judgment action on December 10, 2007. The trial justice heard argument on both motions on December 18, 2007. He granted defendants’ motion in the Probate Court appeal and denied plaintiffs’ motion in the declaratory-judgment action that same day. Thereafter, the Connors timely appealed to this Court.', 'D', 'Arguments on Appeal', 'The Connors raise several issues on appeal. First, they argue that the trial justice did not apply correct legal standard to their constructive trust claim. This misunderstanding of the law was compounded, they suggest, by the trial justice’s misapprehension and misapplication of material facts. The Connors further argue that the trial justice inadequately analyzed attorney Mastrati’s testimony and afforded too much weight to Ms. Cuculo’s testimony. They also contend that the trial justice made several erroneous evidentiary rulings and erred in not allowing them to present rebuttal testimony concerning the 2004 funeral of Kathleen’s brother, Jack. Finally, the Connors argue that the trial justice incorrectly decided their motion for a new trial in the declaratory-judgment action and defendants’ motion for a new trial in the Probate Court appeal.', 'For their part, defendants respond that the trial justice made no errors in admitting or excluding evidence and that plaintiffs misstate the evidence upon which the trial justice relied.', '- 14 - Moreover, they contend that the trial justice undertook the correct legal analysis in the declaratory-judgment action and correctly ruled on both motions for new trial.', 'II', 'Analysis', 'A', 'Constructive Trust', '1. Standard of Review', 'Rule 52(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure requires a trial justice in a nonjury or advisory jury case “to make specific findings of fact upon which he [or she] bases his [or her] decision.” Nardone v. Ritacco, 936 A.2d 200, 206 (R.I. 2007) (quoting White v. LeClerc, 468 A.2d 289, 290 (R.I. 1983)). Rule 52(a) further requires a trial justice to “find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law thereon * * *.” “It is important to note that ‘[t]he trial justice need not engage in extensive analysis to comply with this requirement.’” Nardone, 936 A.2d at 206 (quoting White, 468 A.2d at 290). If these requirements are not satisfied, this Court may reverse or remand the case “unless the record will yield a full understanding and resolution of the controlling and essential factual and legal issues.” Id. (quoting Town of Charlestown v. Beattie, 422 A.2d 1250, 1251 (R.I. 1980)).', '2. Alleged Failure to Address Constructive-Trust Claim', 'The Connors contend that the trial justice failed to address their theory of constructive trust in the declaratory-judgment action. This Court previously has held that “[t]he underlying principle of a constructive trust is the equitable prevention of unjust enrichment of one party at the expense of another in situations in which legal title to property was obtained by fraud or in violation of a fiduciary or confidential relationship.” Dellagrotta v. Dellagrotta, 873 A.2d 101, 111 (R.I. 2005) (quoting Renaud v. Ewart, 712 A.2d 884, 885 (R.I. 1998) (mem.)).', 'To', '- 15 - demonstrate that the imposition of a constructive trust is appropriate, “a plaintiff is required to show by clear and convincing evidence (1) that a fiduciary duty existed between the parties and (2) that either a breach of a promise or an act involving fraud occurred as a result of that relationship.” Manchester v. Pereira, 926 A.2d 1005, 1013 (R.I. 2007).', 'The trial justice summarized the law of constructive trusts and the allocation of the burden of proof as he understood it in his instructions to the advisory jury. The trial justice’s jury instruction on the issue of constructive trust reads, in pertinent part, as follows:', '“One who seeks to prove that a constructive trust has been', 'established between Kathleen Connor and Mary Schlemmer and', 'Virginia Schlemmer-Lavoie must establish with respect to real', 'property, that is the farmhouse that is transferred, that there must', 'be some element of fraudulent conduct by Mary Schlemmer and by', 'Virginia Schlemmer-Lavoie in their procuring of the conveyance', 'of the property from Kathleen Connor to Kathleen Connor and Ms.', 'Lavoie in order for a constructive trust to arise.', '“* * *', '“If you believe that the opponents of the deed have proved', 'that Mary Schlemmer and Virginia Schlemmer-Lavoie perpetrated', 'fraud or breached a fiduciary or confidential duty to Kathleen', 'Connor and have proved [that] to you by clear and convincing', 'evidence * * * then you must find that a constructive trust has been', 'established between these parties.', '“If you find that the opponents had failed to prove that', 'Mary Schlemmer and Virginia Schlemmer-Lavoie perpetrated', 'fraud or breach of fiduciary or confidential duty to you by clear', 'and convincing evidence, then no constructive trust has been', 'established.”', 'Turning to the first element for the imposition of a constructive trust, there was no dispute at trial that Kathleen and Mary and Kathleen and Virginia shared close, loving, and confidential relationships. Moreover, it was undisputed that Mary and Virginia owed fiduciary duties to Kathleen after she executed powers of attorney in their favor. Thus, the threshold', '- 16 - question of material fact on the constructive-trust issue was whether Mary or Virginia perpetrated fraud or breached a fiduciary or confidential duty to Kathleen.', 'In his decision on the motion for reconsideration, the trial justice thoroughly reviewed the evidence and said he “was astounded by [the] jury verdict.” There was no equivocation in the ruling of the trial justice, who commented that the verdict of the advisory jury shocked the conscience of the court. The Connors argue, however, that the trial justice committed reversible error by failing to apply the correct legal standard for constructive trusts. They assert that once the opponents of a gift establish a gratuitous transfer to a person in a relationship of confidence and trust, the burden of proof shifts to the donee to demonstrate the existence of adequate capacity on the part of the donor, the absence of any undue influence, and the consequences of the gift.', 'Even assuming without deciding that the Connors have articulated the correct legal standard, their argument is dispelled by a careful review of the trial justice’s decision. In his decision setting aside the jury verdict, he found Dr. Fanning to be an “extremely persuasive” witness who expressed a professional opinion that Kathleen had “testamentary capacity to understand and deal with her own affairs.” He commented on the testimony of Kathleen’s friends, all of whom reported that “she was intelligent, she was engaging, [and] she knew exactly what she was doing.” The trial justice also noted the testimony of the executive director of North Bay Manor, the attorney who prepared her will in 1985, a nurse, and defendants. He concluded his decision by stating that “[t]he standard of proof of clear and convincing evidence has not been reached by the opponents and clearly has been met in this case by the proponents with regard to the deed.” Moreover, in denying the Connors’ motion for reconsideration, the trial justice summarized:', '- 17 -', '“this Court finds that the proponents of this deed have', 'proven by clear and convincing evidence that Kathleen', 'Connor at the time she entered that deed knew exactly what', 'she was doing, knew who the objects of her bounty were,', 'was not under the undue influence of anybody, that this', 'was not a constructive trust formed by these people in the', 'meaning of that legal phraseology and that there was', 'absolutely no scintilla of evidence of fraud or deceit', 'perpetrated upon Kathleen Connor by either Mr. Mastrati in', 'conjunction or in league with [Mary] Schlemmer or', 'Virginia Schlemmer-Lavoie and had that been pled and', 'argued, the result would have been the same.”', 'Upon review of the trial justice’s decision in the declaratory-judgment action and on the motion for reconsideration, we are satisfied that the trial justice adequately set forth the facts of the case and separately recited the conclusions of law drawn therefrom. Moreover, the record itself is more than sufficient to “yield a full understanding and resolution of the controlling and essential factual and legal issues.” Nardone, 936 A.2d at 206 (quoting Town of Charlestown, 422 A.2d at 1251). The trial justice clearly found that defendants had neither committed fraud nor breached a fiduciary duty and that defendants had in fact proved Kathleen’s competence and lack of undue influence by clear and convincing evidence. In light of this, we discern no basis for reversing the trial justice’s decision in the declaratory-judgment action.', 'B', 'The Trial Justice’s Analysis of the Evidence', 'The plaintiffs suggest that the trial justice overlooked and misconceived certain evidence presented at trial concerning Kathleen’s competence to execute the 2001 deed. Specifically, they contend that the trial justice failed to discuss Mr. Mastrati’s testimony in his bench decision and did not adequately consider the alleged shortcomings and inconsistencies in that witness’s testimony. Conversely, plaintiffs contend that the trial justice assigned improper weight to the testimony of Paula Cuculo.', '- 18 -', 'The Connors advance the argument that, when ruling in a case tried before an advisory jury, the trial justice should give significant deference to the jury’s verdict. In support of this argument, they cite the following language from this Court’s decision in Filippi v. Filippi, 818 A.2d 608, 630 (R.I. 2003): “the advisory jury verdict should receive a great degree of deference in factual determination * * *.”', 'Here, the only factual determination made by the advisory jury was that Kathleen had not “possessed sufficient mind and memory necessary to execute a deed to her real property.” The trial justice rejected the advisory jury’s determination, stating that it shocked the conscience of the court. He thereupon, consistent with Rule 52(a), made specific findings of fact upon which he based his conclusion that “the jury got it wrong.” We have carefully reviewed the trial justice’s findings as they relate to the issues before us on appeal, and we perceive no clear error with respect to any finding of material fact.', 'The trial justice did not specifically evaluate Mr. Mastrati’s testimony in his decision in the declaratory-judgment action, but referred to him in passing during discussion of a separate issue. 13 The Connors thereafter filed a motion for reconsideration. The trial justice denied the motion, but offered a lengthy elaboration on his initial ruling, including a thorough discussion of the weight he afforded Mr. Mastrati’s testimony. Most importantly, the trial justice found that attorney Mastrati’s credible testimony supported a finding that Kathleen was competent at the time she executed the deed, that she “was not under the undue influence of anybody,” and that there was no evidence of fraud or deceit perpetrated by Virginia, Mary, or Mr. Mastrati. We 13', 'The omission of an extended discussion of Mr. Mastrati’s testimony in the trial justice’s initial decision in the declaratory-judgment action may be explained, at least in part, by the fact that most of the Connors’ arguments concerning his testimony (both at trial and on appeal) bear primarily on the validity of the 2002 will.', '- 19 - reject the argument that these findings were not amply supported by the material evidence offered at trial. 14', 'The plaintiffs’ arguments with regard to Ms. Cuculo’s testimony are similarly unavailing. First, they suggest that “Ms. Cuculo’s conclusion concerning Kathleen’s competence was limited to the issue of Kathleen’s execution of the power of attorney in 2001, and did not extend to [Kathleen’s competence to execute] the Deed and the Will.”', 'Kathleen executed powers of attorney in favor of Mary in August 2001 and in favor of Virginia shortly thereafter. She executed the new deed in December 2001. In his decision on plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration, the trial justice noted that it was Ms. Cuculo’s “opinion that * * * [Kathleen] probably knew exactly what she was doing back in that [late 2001] time period * * *.” Although it is clear that Ms. Cuculo could not (and did not) testify to Kathleen’s competence at the time she executed the 2001 deed and the 2002 will, the trial justice was entitled to draw reasonable inferences from her testimony. The trial justice did not consider Ms. Cuculo’s testimony as direct evidence of Kathleen’s competency when she executed the new deed in December 2001, although he reasonably may have considered that Ms. Cuculo deemed Kathleen competent to execute the powers of attorney mere months earlier.', 'The Connors further argue that Ms. Cuculo’s 2005 observations of Kathleen were inaccurate because “Kathleen successfully applied her intelligence and social skills to project a false appearance of competence at a time when Dr. Fanning[, using a decision-making- assessment tool,] had conclusively determined * * * that Kathleen had lost it.” As discussed at 14', 'This Court will not address plaintiffs’ arguments concerning Mr. Mastrati’s alleged unethical performance of legal services, incompetence, perjury, or fraud. We agree with the trial justice that these arguments were not adequately advanced at trial and, moreover, are wholly without merit.', '- 20 - greater length below, however, Dr. Fanning’s assessment was not admitted as evidence at trial and, therefore, cannot be treated as grounds for assailing Ms. Cuculo’s testimony.', 'C', 'The Trial Justice’s Evidentiary Rulings', '1.

The trial justice noted that the “information provided by [Dr. Fanning] in ’05 on [Kathleen’s] ability to address financial matters [was] not relevant to her ability to do so in 2001 and 2002, which this physician has already stated that he felt she was capable of doing * * *.” As a result, the trial justice barred admission of the 2005 document on grounds of relevance. We discern no abuse of discretion in the trial justice’s ruling.', 'On November 2, 2007, plaintiffs’ counsel questioned attorney Mastrati concerning any conversations he may have had with Kathleen about the effect of changes to her estate plan in 2001 and 2002. The trial justice sustained numerous objections to various questions during this portion of Mr. Mastrati’s examination.', 'On appeal, plaintiffs challenge the trial justice’s exclusion of certain questions allegedly going to Kathleen’s knowledge and understanding of the', '- 21 - changes being made to her estate plan. 15 It is clear, however, that none of the trial justice’s evidentiary rulings during this portion of the trial were an abuse of discretion.', 'Finally, plaintiffs allege that the trial justice erred in refusing to allow them to present a “rebuttal case” in response to a portion of Mary’s trial testimony. At trial, Mary testified that she did not attend Jack’s funeral or wake. According to their brief, plaintiffs attempted to present Eugene as a rebuttal witness “to testify that Mary told him, at Jack’s wake, of Kathleen’s determination to attend her brother’s funeral, indicating that she would walk to New Hampshire if [Mary] did not drive her there.” The trial justice did not allow such testimony on grounds that it was not “true rebuttal.”', 'As this Court previously has explained, “‘the proper function and purpose of rebuttal testimony is to explain’ or to discredit the evidence of an adverse party.” Ruffel v.

The admission of evidence, including rebuttal evidence, is a matter confided to the sound discretion of the trial justice. See Ruffel, 900 A.2d at 1190. In the instant case, we discern no abuse of discretion.', '3. Alleged Failure to Exclude Irrelevant and Inadmissible Evidence', 'The Connors also contend that the trial justice improperly allowed the introduction into evidence of a 2005 video clip of Kathleen interacting with family members. 16 They argue that the trial justice incorrectly relied on this evidence in rendering his decision. 15', 'The Connors cite to the record, but we are unable to locate the offending question. The cited page concerns attorney Mastrati’s understanding of inheritance laws, not Kathleen’s state of mind. 16', 'The Connors refer to this clip as a “2006 video of Kathleen noting her appreciation of poetry from Wordsworth and Yeats.” It appears from the record that this video actually dates from January 2005.', '- 22 -', 'In his decision, the trial justice referred to the video clips, including the 2005 clip, as the “most telling evidence” that Kathleen was competent at the time she signed the 2001 deed and 2002 will. He explicitly noted, however, that the videos were not direct evidence of her mental state in late 2001/early 2002, but rather served to persuasively “bolster” the testimony of the witnesses presented by the proponents of the deed and will. Indeed, at the time he allowed the introduction of the 2005 video, the trial justice reminded the jury that “the operative time that we’re really concerned with is the time when the deed was executed and the will was executed in 2001, 2002. So because we’ve had other evidence from * * * late[r] dates through testimony and still pictures, I’m going to allow [the 2005 video] as well. But keep in mind that this is well after the time period in controversy.” He reiterated this assertion more forcefully in his decision of the motion for reconsideration, wherein he stressed that he “didn’t rely on the video [from] 2005 or 2006 * * *.” He also indicated that the videos “did not weigh on [his] decision * * *.” We have no reason to doubt the veracity of the trial justice’s statements. Moreover, the trial justice enunciated more than adequate bases for his decision aside from the video evidence. Accordingly, we discern no abuse of discretion.', 'D', 'Motions for New Trial', '1. Motion for New Trial in the Declaratory-Judgment Action', 'After judgment entered on the declaratory-judgment action, the Connors moved for a new trial under Rule 59(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.

Contrary to the Connors’ contentions, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not commit a manifest error of law in his judgment by failing to apply the proper legal standard with respect to plaintiffs’ claims based on constructive trust and undue influence. Likewise, the Connors did not identify any newly discovered evidence that was not available at trial which was of sufficient importance to warrant a new trial. 18 We conclude, therefore, that the trial justice did not err in denying plaintiffs’ motion for new trial in the declaratory-judgment action.', '2.

22,: Committee et al. v. : Steven A. Sette et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The defendants, who are the four members of the Glocester Town Council1 (town council) who voted to remove the plaintiff Gregory Laramie from his position on the Foster-Glocester Regional School Building Committee (RBC) by declaring his seat on the RBC vacant, appeal from a Superior Court judgment granting declaratory and injunctive relief in favor of the plaintiffs, the RBC, and its eight individual members.2 The defendants contend that the Glocester Town Charter expressly empowers the town council to remove those members of the RBC whom the town council has appointed or to fill vacancies on the RBC when they arise. Alternatively, the defendants argue that if this Court holds that the town charter does not expressly grant the town council the authority to remove 1', 'The Glocester Town Council is composed of five members. The four members who voted to remove Gregory Laramie are Steven A. Sette, William E. Reichert, Charles M. Poirier, and Kevin P. Walsh. The fifth member voted against Mr. Laramie’s removal. 2', 'The eight individual members of the Foster-Glocester Regional School Building Committee are Chairman Gregory Laramie, Raymond Fogarty, George Jacques, Kelly Hunter, William Abt, Dennis Chretian, Warren Ducharme, and Julie Capobianco.', '-1- members of the RBC, the town council nonetheless possesses this authority by implication, because the authority to appoint a member to the RBC necessarily implies the authority to remove him or her. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In 1958, the General Assembly enacted Public Laws 1958, ch. 109 (the act), which authorized the formation of a regional school district encompassing the Towns of Foster and Glocester. The act also provided for the formation of a “regional district school building committee which shall consist of eight members, four of whom shall be from each member town.” P.L. 1958, ch. 109, § 4. The act sets forth a method for determining the composition of the RBC as follows:', '“The representation from each member town shall consist of one', 'member from the respective local school committee and elected or', 'appointed by said local school committee; and three members', 'selected by the town council of such town, at least one of whom', 'shall be from the regional school planning board of such town.', '“At such time as a regional district school building', 'committee shall be deemed necessary, the chairman of the regional', 'district school committee shall call upon the respective officials of', 'the member towns for the appointment or election of the necessary', 'representatives.” Id. Under the act, the RBC’s primary responsibility is to oversee the construction of new schools or the improvement of existing schools within the regional school district. Id. The act further provides that “[t]he term of the regional district school building committee shall be until such time as the authorized building or buildings have been constructed and accepted by the architects engaged by the committee and for one year thereafter, whereupon the term of office of said committee shall terminate.” Id.', '-2-', 'In 2004, pursuant to the act, the Foster-Glocester Regional School District Committee voted to create the RBC to oversee (1) the construction of a new middle school and (2) the renovation of the existing middle school for the purpose of annexing it as a new wing of the high school. In January 2005, in accordance with the act, the Glocester Town Council appointed three members to the RBC; one of those three appointees was plaintiff Gregory Laramie, who assumed the role of chairman of the RBC. It is undisputed that at some point in time thereafter, and after an intervening election, a majority of the members of the Glocester Town Council expressed dissatisfaction with Laramie. On November 1, 2007, the town council voted to remove him from his position by declaring his seat on the RBC vacant. Thereafter, on November 13, 2007, plaintiffs filed the instant action in the Superior Court, in which they sought declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent Laramie’s removal from the RBC.', 'In their complaint, plaintiffs requested a declaration from the Superior Court that the defendant members of the town council lacked the authority to remove Laramie from his position as a member of the RBC. In the alternative, plaintiffs sought a declaration that, even if the town council members did have this authority, such a removal could occur only for cause and only after Laramie had been afforded due process—including the right to notice and a hearing. The plaintiffs also asked the Superior Court to enjoin defendants from taking further action to remove Laramie or from “otherwise interfering with the duties of the Building Committee, until a hearing on the merits in this case.”', 'On November 15, 2007, a justice of the Superior Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order. The order specified that Laramie was “reinstated to the position of Chairman of the Foster Glocester Regional School Building Committee, until further order of', '-3- this Court.” The order also provided that defendants were “restrained from further attempts to remove Plaintiff Laramie from his position.”', 'Subsequently, another hearing justice conducted a hearing on the request for preliminary injunction, and on January 16, 2008, the second hearing justice issued a written decision concerning plaintiffs’ request. Before beginning his analysis, the hearing justice noted that, “[a]lthough the current issue before this Court is Plaintiffs’ request for preliminary injunction, the question of a likelihood of success on the merits requires this Court to analyze the same dispositive question of law that it ultimately would have to answer in its declaratory ruling.” Accordingly, the hearing justice concluded that it would be appropriate for him to rule simultaneously on the request for a declaratory judgment pursuant to the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (G.L. 1956 § 9-30-1) and on the request for an injunction pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 8-2-13.', 'In his decision, the hearing justice concluded that, like school committees, the RBC is “an agent of the State.” Accordingly, the hearing justice ruled that, “in order for the Council to have removal authority over [the members of the RBC], there must be explicit legislation to that effect.” The hearing justice observed that “[t]here are no provisions in the Act, or [in] any other legislative acts, which specifically grant removal authority to the Council.” He thus declared that “the Council was without authority to remove Laramie from the RBC.” The hearing justice also ordered that Laramie be reinstated as a member of the RBC, and he enjoined the town council from further attempts to remove him.', 'An order implementing the Superior Court’s decision was entered on January 25, 2008; final judgment was entered that same day. The defendants filed a timely notice of appeal.', '-4-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“A decision to grant or deny declaratory or injunctive relief is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial justice and will not be disturbed on appeal unless the record demonstrates a clear abuse of discretion or the trial justice committed an error of law.” Hagenberg v.

The defendants assert that Article XIV, § C 14-2 of the Glocester Town Charter explicitly provides that the term of members of the RBC extends only until the next town council is elected, at which time the RBC members’ offices are deemed to be vacant and the new town council is free to appoint new members.3 Alternatively, defendants argue that if this Court rejects their interpretation of § 14-2, common sense and Rhode Island case law recognize an implied power in the town council to remove members of committees that it has appointed.4 The defendants further argue that, if this 3', 'Article XIV, § C 14-2 of the Glocester Town Charter reads in relevant part as follows:', '“The term of office of all Offices, members of Boards,', 'Commissions or Committees appointed with the approval of the', 'Council, or appointed or elected by the Council, shall be', 'concurrent with the term of the Council, unless otherwise provided', 'in the Charter or by State Law. Every elected or appointed officer', 'of the Town who is elected or appointed for a specific term shall', 'continue to hold such office until a successor is elected or', 'appointed and qualified. Any appointed Officer of a Board or', 'Commission may be removed from the office by the Town Council', 'for due cause following a public hearing.” 4', 'To support this position, defendants principally rely on Platt v. Prince, 53 R.I. 492, 167 A. 540 (1933), and to a lesser extent on Cullen v. Adler, 107 R.I. 749, 271 A.2d 466 (1970), and Lewis v. Porter, 78 R.I. 358, 82 A.2d 399 (1951). In our judgment, these opinions are factually distinguishable from this case and, therefore, the holdings from these cases are inapplicable. Each of these cases, Cullen, 107 R.I. at 750, 751, 271 A.2d at 467, Lewis, 78 R.I. at 362-63, 82 A.2d at 401, Platt, 53 R.I. at 496, 167 A. at 542, involved whether governmental bodies could remove their own employees in the absence of statutory provisions that either conferred or denied this authority. Here, Laramie, in his capacity as a member of the RBC, is not an', '-6- Court should conclude that they are correct and that they indeed are clothed with the power to remove members of the RBC, they also are free to do so without providing Laramie with notice or a hearing. The plaintiffs counter that the hearing justice correctly ruled that the charter does not, either expressly or implicitly, provide removal authority to the town council and that, even if the charter could be interpreted to include such authority, plaintiff Laramie would nonetheless be entitled to notice and a hearing before he could be removed because the charter requires that “[a]ny appointed Officer of a Board or Commission may be removed from the office by the Town Council for due cause following a public hearing.” Section 14-2.', 'In general, our state constitution provides that it is the responsibility of the General Assembly “to promote public schools * * * and to adopt all means which it may deem necessary and proper to secure to the people the advantages and opportunities of education * * *.” R.I. Const. art. 12, sec. 1. On the other hand, and based on the Home Rule Amendment that is set forth in article 13 of the Rhode Island Constitution, a municipality may adopt charter provisions that affect education, as long as such charter provisions are ratified by an explicit legislative act. See Town of Johnston v. Santilli, 892 A.2d 123, 128 (R.I. 2006); Royal v. Barry, 91 R.I. 24, 30, 160 A.2d 572, 575 (1960) (“[N]o provision affecting education contained within a home rule charter, so called, can effectively regulate the conduct of school committees as agents of the state unless expressly validated by an act of the general assembly.”).', 'The General Assembly ratified the Glocester Town Charter on June 19, 1991, in the 1991 R.I. Acts & Resolves 47. Consequently, the provisions of this legislatively ratified charter take precedence over inconsistent provisions of general state law. See Santilli, 892 A.2d at 129 (stating that, when there has been legislative ratification of the charter provision that conflicts employee of the Town of Glocester, and we do not consider the holdings of Cullen, Lewis, and Platt to apply here.', '-7- with a general law of statewide application, “we view the conflicting charter provision as ‘a special act [that] takes precedence over any inconsistent provisions of the general laws’”) (quoting Local No. 799, International Association of Firefighters AFL-CIO v. Napolitano, 516 A.2d 1347, 1349 (R.I. 1986)). However, the act is not a provision of general state law. Id. The act is limited to regional school issues in the Towns of Foster and Glocester, and it cannot be fairly characterized as a general state law. Therefore, in the event of a conflict, we do not consider the Glocester Town Charter’s provisions to take precedence over a more specific provision of the act.', 'Our initial consideration is to determine whether there are any provisions in the charter that would empower the town council to remove members of the RBC. “[W]hen we interpret the meaning of a charter provision, we apply the same de novo standard of review that we use when faced with questions of statutory construction.” Santilli, 892 A.2d at 127. This Court construes the provisions of a municipal charter in accordance with the customary rules of statutory construction. Felkner v. Chariho Regional School Committee, 968 A.2d 865, 870 (R.I. 2009) (citing Santilli, 892 A.2d at 127).', '“[W]hen the language of the [charter] is clear and unambiguous, the court must interpret it literally, giving the words of the [charter] their plain and ordinary meanings.” Stewart v. Sheppard, 885 A.2d 715, 720 (R.I. 2005) (quoting Labor Ready Northeast, Inc. v. McConaghy, 849 A.2d 340, 345 (R.I. 2004)).', '“However, when a statute is susceptible of more than one meaning, we employ our well- established maxims of statutory construction in an effort to glean the intent of the Legislature.” Town of Burrillville v. Pascoag Apartment Associates, LLC, 950 A.2d 435, 445 (R.I. 2008) (quoting Unistrut Corp. v. State Department of Labor and Training, 922 A.2d 93, 98-99 (R.I. 2007)). We construe municipal charters “so as to give, so far as possible, reasonable meaning', '-8- and effect to all parts of the section in question.” Stewart, 885 A.2d at 720 (quoting Carter v. City of Pawtucket, 115 R.I. 134, 138, 341 A.2d 53, 56 (1975)). Finally, this Court also adheres to the rule of statutory construction that when faced with “competing statutory provisions that cannot be harmonized, we adhere to the principle that ‘the specific governs the general * * *.’” Felkner, 968 A.2d at 870 (quoting Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U.S. 374, 384 (1992)).', 'The defendants assert that § 14-2 of the charter authorizes the town council to purge members of the RBC that were appointed by that body. Alternatively, defendants argue that the town council did not remove Laramie from the RBC but merely filled a vacancy on the RBC that was created by operation of law when the newly elected town council took office in 2007. To support their argument, defendants maintain that § 14-2’s language that “[t]he term of office of all * * * members of * * * Committees appointed with the approval of the Council * * * shall be concurrent with the term of the Council, unless otherwise provided in the Charter or by State Law” necessarily implies that Laramie’s appointment, which began in 2005, expired in 2007 when the term of the town council that appointed him came to an end. Consequently, defendants advance that when the town council voted to vacate Laramie’s membership on the RBC in 2007, it was well within the authority that the Glocester Town Charter granted to it.', 'In conducting our analysis, we first consider the plain meaning of the charter. See Stewart, 885 A.2d at 720. Section 14-2 of the charter bestows upon the town council broad authority to appoint members of boards, commissions, committees, and offices of the Town of Glocester for the term of the council. This same section also provides the town council with the power to remove such officers for due cause after a public hearing. The charter does not define the terms boards, commissions, committees, or offices. However, an examination of Article XIV', '-9- of the charter in its entirety reveals that it describes positions that are unquestionably town offices and that perform functions that are unquestionably municipal in nature. In our opinion, the RBC is not a town office, and even though state law cloaks the town council with the authority to appoint members to the RBC, neither the charter nor state law empower the town council to remove a member of the RBC once he or she has been appointed. Moreover, in our opinion, the terms for members of the RBC that are appointed by the town council are not concurrent with the term of the town council because the RBC is not an “office” within the Town of Glocester and, therefore, § 14-2’s provision that all appointments made by the town council “shall be concurrent with the term of the Council” is inapplicable to the RBC.', 'The Glocester Town Charter was ratified more than thirty years after the passage of the act that authorized the creation of the Foster-Glocester Regional District School. Yet, the charter’s plain language does not impart to the town council the authority to remove the members of the RBC. We will not assume that the town council possesses the authority to remove a member of a regional school body, such as the RBC, in the absence of legislation that expressly grants that authority.', 'See Santilli, 892 A.2d at 128 (reiterating that educational provisions in home rule charters cannot “regulate the conduct of school committees * * * unless expressly validated by an act of the general assembly”). In our opinion, the charter does not bestow upon the town council the authority to remove members of the RBC. Further, we interpret the phrase “members of Boards, Commissions or Committees appointed with the approval of the Council” in the charter to refer only to those “Boards, Commissions or Committees” of the Town of Glocester. The RBC is not a committee of the Town of Glocester and its members are not subject to the same removal authority as those members of “Boards,', '- 10 - Commissions or Committees” of the Town of Glocester who perform functions in the municipal government.', 'Having determined that the municipal charter does not authorize the town council to remove members of the RBC, we next turn our attention to state law. As we set forth earlier in our analysis of the Glocester Town Charter, this Court considers the act’s language to determine whether it is clear and unambiguous. Stewart, 885 A.2d at 720. If it is, we must interpret the act literally and confer the act’s words “their plain and ordinary meanings.” Id. (quoting Labor Ready Northeast, Inc., 849 A.2d at 345).', 'The relevant provisions of the act that address the role of the Glocester Town Council with respect to the replacement of the RBC members it appoints are contained in P.L. 1958, ch. 109, § 4. That section provides that the Glocester Town Council has the prerogative and responsibility to appoint three members to the RBC. It further provides that in the event of a vacancy in any of those three positions, the Glocester Town Council may appoint a new member to fill the vacancy. However, the act is silent as to whether any member of the RBC can be removed from office. Also, the statute sets a term for the life of the RBC but does not provide a specific term for its members.5', 'In our opinion, and giving the act’s words “their plain and ordinary meanings,” nothing in the act authorizes the Glocester Town Council to remove RBC members whom they have appointed. Stewart, 885 A.2d at 720 (quoting Labor Ready Northeast, Inc., 849 A.2d at 345). Our interpretation of the act is buttressed by the fact that the General Assembly did not provide any authority to the Glocester Town Council to remove members from the RBC, but merely to 5', 'Public Laws 1958, ch. 109, § 4 provides, in relevant part, that “[t]he term of the regional district school building committee shall be until such time as the authorized building or buildings have been constructed and accepted by the architects engaged by the committee and for one year thereafter, whereupon the term of office of said committee shall terminate.”', '- 11 - appoint members and replace members in the event of a vacancy. In our opinion, the language of the act is clear and unambiguous and it contains no provision that would be interpreted as providing removal power. See Stewart, 885 A.2d at 720. It was certainly within the province of the General Assembly to grant that power had it chosen to do so.', 'Consequently, we hold that plaintiff Laramie’s seat on the RBC was not vacated when the new Glocester Town Council took office in 2007 and that the Glocester Town Council lacks the authority to remove Laramie from the RBC.', 'B', 'Injunctive Relief', 'As we have said above, our review of a hearing justice’s granting of a preliminary injunction is deferential. New England Stone, LLC, 962 A.2d at 32. Here, the hearing justice entered an order and a judgment on January 25, 2008, in which the court granted plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction and held that the “Glocester Town Council is hereby enjoined and restrained from any further attempts to remove Laramie from the RBC.”', 'The defendants contend that the hearing justice should not have ordered that Laramie be reinstated as a member (and indeed as chairman) of the RBC and should not have enjoined the Glocester Town Council from further attempts to remove him from his position. In so ordering, the hearing justice based his decision on his conclusion that the town council did not have the authority to remove Laramie from the RBC. As we explained above, we agree with the hearing justice and hold that the town council was without authority to remove Laramie from the RBC.', 'Further, we are persuaded that the hearing justice did not abuse his discretion when he granted a preliminary injunction that enjoined the defendants from engaging in further attempts to remove Laramie from the RBC. At the preliminary injunction stage, the plaintiffs established', '- 12 - a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits and demonstrated that they would suffer irreparable harm without the requested injunctive relief, that the balance of equities weighed in their favor, and that the issuance of a preliminary injunction served to preserve the status quo. See Iggy’s Doughboys, Inc., 729 A.2d at 705. At the same time, having declared that the Glocester Town Council has no authority to remove members of the RBC, it is our opinion that the need for injunctive relief no longer exists, and, solely on that basis, we vacate the injunction.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the previously articulated reasons, we affirm the Superior Court’s declaration that the Glocester Town Council was not empowered to remove the plaintiff Laramie from the Foster- Glocester Regional School Building Committee.

For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we grant the petitions for certiorari and quash the judgment of the Superior Court.1 1', 'We wish to thank the amici curiae for the helpful briefs which they submitted to this Court in connection with the significant issues implicated by this case.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The underlying facts that are implicated by this case are largely undisputed. The Auto Body Association of Rhode Island (Auto Body) is an organization with a membership of approximately one hundred independent auto body shops located throughout Rhode Island. Auto Body asserts that, for many years, the prevailing labor rate according to which insurers made payments to auto body shops for work performed on vehicles covered by those insurers was “woefully inadequate.” In 2006, the General Assembly enacted § 27-29-4.4; that statute, in pertinent part, provides that “[e]ach insurer must conduct an auto body labor rate survey, in writing, annually to determine a prevailing auto body labor rate for fully licensed auto body repair facilities.” Section 27-29-4.4(a)(2).', 'In order to implement the provisions of § 27-29-4.4, in October of 2006, DBR promulgated Insurance Regulation 108. (02-030-108 R.I. Code R. § 2.) Insurance Regulation 108, § 3 provides, in pertinent part, as follows:', '“Each insurer that writes more than one percent (1%) of the total', 'premium volume of Motor Vehicle Liability Insurance during the', 'immediately preceding calendar year shall conduct an auto body', 'labor rate survey in accordance with R.I.G.L. §§ 27-29-4.4 and this', 'Regulation.” In addition, Insurance Regulation 108, § 7(2) requires insurers to file with DBR an annual report regarding the just-referenced labor rate survey.', 'Section 7(3) of Insurance Regulation 108 provides that “[t]he Report of Labor Rate Survey must include [inter alia] the following:', '“***', '“d.', 'Results of the questionnaires considered by the insurer.', '“***', '“f.', 'A description of the formula or manner in which the insurer', 'has calculated or determined the prevailing labor rate which it pays', 'to auto body repair facilities.', '-2-', '“g.', 'The prevailing labor rate established by the insurer.', '“h.', 'If the calculation or formula indicated in subsection f above', 'is not based on the results of the questionnaires identified in', 'subsection d above, a complete explanation as to why it is not so', 'based.”', 'Pursuant to Insurance Regulation 108, § 7(1), insurers were required to file their first annual report with DBR by June 1, 2007. Auto Body contends that, upon reviewing those initial reports, it “learned that many insurers refused to set a prevailing labor rate, claiming that they ‘negotiate’ with each shop directly (while paying all the same rate), or set a prevailing labor rate basing it upon information such as insurer historical data, subrogation rates, and rates paid in other states.”', 'On July 23, 2007, acting pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 42-35-8, Auto Body filed a petition for a declaratory ruling with DBR. In its petition, Auto Body sought a declaration “that the [labor rate] survey results be used to determine a prevailing labor rate as required by the statute [§ 27- 29-4.4], which does not allow for any other mechanism to determine and set such rate.” Auto Body’s petition for a declaratory ruling also made reference to the responses of numerous insurers, which (according to Auto Body) stated that “they do not base their prevailing labor rate on the survey, that they do not set a rate and negotiate directly with each shop, or that they are awaiting ruling by the Department.”', 'After having provided interested parties with notice and an opportunity to respond to Auto Body’s petition for a declaratory ruling, DBR issued a written decision on November 21, 2007. In that decision, DBR stated that § 27-29-4.4 does not clearly require that insurers must set their labor rate solely on the basis of the labor rate survey.2 It was further DBR’s position 2', 'DBR also reiterated in its decision that, having utilized “the rules of statutory construction,” it had determined (in promulgating Insurance Regulation 108) that G.L. 1956', '-3- that “the information received from the survey must be taken into consideration by the insurer as one element in its decision making process.” (Emphasis added.)', 'In its decision, DBR stated that it had determined that the statute was ambiguous and that, therefore, it had conducted an analysis of the legislative intent behind the statute in order to determine its meaning. DBR stated that “the clear legislative intent” underlying § 27-29-4.4 was that insurers be required “to consider information submitted by auto body shops on labor rates and to provide public information on how the labor rates are set.” In its decision, DBR indicated (1) that the statute merely sought “to provide additional transparency” with respect to the process of setting labor rates; and (2) that the labor rate survey was intended to be just one factor to be taken into account in the setting of labor rates. Accordingly, DBR denied Auto Body’s request “that the Department find that * * * § 27-29-4.4 requires that the result of the labor rate survey be the only mechanism which an insurer can use to determine and set such labor rates for fully licensed auto body shops * * *.” (Emphasis added.)', 'On December 5, 2007, Auto Body, relying upon the Administrative Procedures Act,3 appealed DBR’s decision to the Superior Court. Thereafter, PCI was permitted to intervene, and the legal issues were briefed by all parties. On August 13, 2008, a justice in the Providence County Superior Court issued a written decision, which reversed DBR’s declaratory ruling. In her written decision, the hearing justice concluded that § 27-29-4.4 is not ambiguous. In so concluding, she held that “every insurer governed by § 27-29-4.4 must conduct a labor rate survey as provided in the statute and use that survey as the sole determinant of the prevailing auto body labor rate.” (Emphasis added.) § 27-29-4.4 only applied to “insurers writing more than 1% of the Rhode Island market in private passenger automobile insurance lines.” 3', 'General Laws 1956 § 42-35-15.', '-4-', 'Although neither Auto Body nor DBR had raised the issue in the context of Auto Body’s administrative appeal to the Superior Court, the hearing justice nevertheless chose to make a further ruling to the effect that “§ 27-29-4.4 applies to every insurance carrier authorized to sell motor vehicle liability insurance in Rhode Island.”', '(Emphasis added.)', 'The latter ruling effectively overruled the provision within Insurance Regulation 108 whereby the requirements of § 27-29-4.4 are deemed to apply only to insurers writing more than one percent of private passenger automobile lines of insurance.', 'PCI filed a motion for clarification of the Superior Court’s decision, and the hearing justice heard oral argument on that motion on August 28 and 29, 2008. The hearing justice denied the motion to clarify. DBR and PCI then filed separate motions to stay the effect of the hearing justice’s decision. After a hearing was held on September 15, 2008 with respect to the motions to stay, the hearing justice denied PCI’s motion to stay and partially granted DBR’s motion.4', 'DBR and PCI each filed petitions for a writ of certiorari, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 42-35- 16.

For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we conclude that the hearing justice erred in both respects.', '-7-', 'A', 'Should the labor rate survey be used as the sole determinant', 'of the prevailing auto body labor rate?', 'DBR and PCI first contend that it was error for the hearing justice to choose not to defer to DBR’s interpretation of § 27-29-4.4—viz., that the labor rate survey is only one factor for insurers to consider in setting the prevailing labor rate. It is their contention that the hearing justice should have deferred to DBR’s decision as being a reasonable interpretation that was supported by legally competent evidence. We are in essential agreement with that contention.', 'In rendering its decision, DBR stated that it was “readily apparent * * * that [§ 27-29-4.4] is not ‘unambiguous’” and that a “great deal of statutory construction was required in order for the Department to properly implement the statute under Insurance Regulation 108.” DBR proceeded to state the reasons that had prompted it to conclude that the statute was ambiguous. Those reasons were (1) the fact that, “in Rhode Island there is no line of insurance called ‘motor vehicle liability insurance;’” and (2) the fact that the statute used the terms “survey” and “questionnaire” to refer to the same document.5 DBR then engaged in a lengthy analysis, employing the rules of statutory construction, in order to ascertain the intent and purpose of the General Assembly when it enacted § 27-29-4.4. See Cummings v. Shorey, 761 A.2d 680, 684 (R.I. 2000) (“If statutory provisions appear unclear or ambiguous, * * * we shall examine the entire statute to ascertain the intent and purpose of the Legislature.”). 5', 'DBR further stated that “hundreds of insurers are ‘licensed’ in Rhode Island but do not actually write any insurance and, therefore, do not pay any automobile damage claims.” DBR accordingly explained that, in promulgating Insurance Regulation 108, it “applied [§ 27-29-4.4] to all insurers writing more than 1% of the Rhode Island market in private passenger automobile insurance lines.” As discussed supra, the hearing justice disagreed with DBR’s view as to the reach of § 27-29-4.4.', '-8-', 'In conducting its statutory analysis, DBR carefully parsed the language of the statute in an attempt to give meaning to every provision within the statute. See State v. Bryant, 670 A.2d 776, 779 (R.I. 1996) (“It is also a canon of statutory construction that the Legislature is presumed to have intended each word or provision of a statute to express a significant meaning, and the court will give effect to every word, clause, or sentence, whenever possible.”); see also Retirement Board of Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island v. DiPrete, 845 A.2d 270, 279 (R.I. 2004) (“We presume that the General Assembly intended to attach significance to every word, sentence and provision of a statute.”). DBR also considered “a number of other practical concerns” that resulted from the fact that only approximately one-third of auto body shops had responded to the insurers’ surveys. Having completed its analysis, DBR concluded that the General Assembly had intended that the labor rate survey was to serve as only one factor in determining the prevailing labor rate. DBR further stated that “an interpretation that the insurer must pay whatever is reported by the shops is not supported by the statutory language.” It is our view that DBR’s conclusion was reasonable.', 'We note that, in rendering her decision, the hearing justice stated that she was “not bound by decisions of law reached by an administrative agency, such as DBR.” The hearing justice noted her disagreement with DBR’s determination that the statute was ambiguous, and she then focused much of her written decision on three specific words or phrases,6 which DBR believed resulted in statutory ambiguity. The hearing justice concluded that, since (in her view) those specific phrases were not ambiguous, the statute as a whole was not ambiguous; she further stated that the statute’s words should be given what she characterized as their “plain and obvious meaning.” The hearing justice thus concluded that “every insurer governed by § 27-29-4.4 must 6', 'The hearing justice focused her analysis on the following phrases in § 27-29-4.4: “[e]very insurance carrier;” “motor vehicle liability insurance;” and “survey.”', '-9- conduct a labor rate survey as provided in the statute and use that survey as the sole determinant of the prevailing auto body labor rate.” (Emphasis added.)', 'It is our opinion that, in rendering her decision, the hearing justice failed to recognize the “well-recognized doctrine of administrative law that deference will be accorded to an administrative agency when it interprets a statute whose administration and enforcement have been entrusted to the agency * * * even when the agency’s interpretation is not the only permissible interpretation that could be applied.”', 'Pawtucket Power Associates Limited Partnership v. City of Pawtucket, 622 A.2d 452, 456-57 (R.I. 1993); see Unistrut Corp. v. State Department of Labor and Training, 922 A.2d 93, 99 (R.I. 2007) (“[W]hen the administration of a statute has been entrusted to a governmental agency, deference is due to that agency’s interpretation of an ambiguous statute unless such interpretation is clearly erroneous or unauthorized.”); Gallison v. Bristol School Committee, 493 A.2d 164, 166 (R.I. 1985) (“[W]here the provisions of a statute are unclear or subject to more than one reasonable interpretation, the construction given by the agency charged with its enforcement is entitled to weight and deference as long as that construction is not clearly erroneous or unauthorized.”); see also Labor Ready Northeast, Inc. v. McConaghy, 849 A.2d 340, 344-45 (R.I. 2004); In re Lallo, 768 A.2d 921, 926 (R.I. 2001).', 'The hearing justice’s review of DBR’s interpretation of § 27-29-4.4 should have been limited to determining whether such interpretation was “clearly erroneous or unauthorized.” See Gallison, 493 A.2d at 166; see also Labor Ready Northeast, Inc., 849 A.2d at 344-45; In re Lallo, 768 A.2d at 926. In our opinion, it was quite reasonable for DBR to have concluded that the statute is ambiguous—since it is clear to us (as it was to the agency) that the language of the statute is susceptible of more than one meaning. We further conclude that the interpretation of', '- 10 - § 27-29-4.4 reached by DBR (after a complex analysis in which it applied pertinent canons of statutory construction) was neither clearly erroneous nor unauthorized, and we agree with DBR that the labor rate survey should not be the sole determinant in the setting of the prevailing labor rate. In other words, it is our opinion that the hearing justice erred in failing to defer to DBR’s reasonable interpretation of § 27-29-4.4, even if she would have resolved the statutory issue differently had the interpretive role been solely hers in a nisi prius context.7 See Pawtucket Power Associates, 622 A.2d at 456-57; see generally North Providence School Committee v.

Again, we agree with petitioners’ contention.', 'This Court has held that it is impermissible for a hearing justice to raise or to pass upon an issue that was not properly raised by the parties.

24,Harold Curtis : v. : State of Rhode Island. :,criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. This case presents the issue: Is a prisoner released on parole entitled to receive credit toward his or her full sentence of imprisonment for time served while on community confinement? The state appeals from a Superior Court judgment granting a motion to correct the sentence 1 of the defendant, Harold Curtis, which awarded him credit toward the completion of his full sentence for time served as a parolee on community confinement. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After examining the written and oral submissions of the parties, we conclude that this appeal may be resolved without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'Mr. Curtis filed an application for postconviction relief pro se, but the hearing justice found it more appropriate to treat the application as a motion for a corrected sentence under Rule 35 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.', '--1--', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On July 30, 2003, Mr. Curtis pled nolo contendere to breaking and entering a dwelling with felonious intent and was sentenced to ten years imprisonment, with five years to serve and five years suspended, with probation. His sentence was made retroactive to December 10, 2002. The defendant was released on parole in March 2006, a special condition of which was that he cooperate with the electronic monitoring program (EMP) for a minimum of ninety days.2 Before being released from the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI) on parole, Mr. Curtis signed a document setting forth the terms and conditions of his parole. One of the terms provided:', '“I agree that when this permit has been revoked as herein provided,', 'or there is probable cause for such revocation, the Parole Board', 'may issue an order authorizing my arrest an[d] my return to the', 'place of confinement pending a hearing, and that I shall be', 'detained therein according to the terms of my original sentence;', 'and in computing the period of my confinement, the time between', 'my release upon said permit and my return to the place of my', 'original confinement shall not be considered as any part of the', 'term of my original sentence.” (Emphasis added.)

First, the state contends that the hearing justice was incorrect in her interpretation of the relevant statutes. The state argues that, according to their plain meanings, §§ 13-8-9 4 and 13-8-19(b) 5 contemplate parole as inclusive of all attendant terms and conditions. As a result, the state 4', 'General Laws 1956 § 13-8-9 states:', '“The parole board, in the case of any prisoner whose sentence is', 'subject to its control, unless that prisoner is sentenced to', 'imprisonment for life, and unless that prisoner is confined as a', 'habitual criminal under the provisions of § 12-19-21, may, by an', 'affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the board, issue to', 'that prisoner a permit to be at liberty upon parole, whenever that', 'prisoner has served not less than one-third (1/3) of the term for', 'which he or she was sentenced. The permit shall entitle the', 'prisoner to whom it is issued to be at liberty during the remainder', 'of his or her term of sentence upon any terms and conditions that', 'the board may prescribe.” 5', 'Section 13-8-19(b) states: “The time between the release of the prisoner under the [parole] permit and the prisoner’s return to the [ACI] * * * under order of the board shall not be considered as any part of the prisoner’s original sentence.”', '--4-- reasons, the meaning of the term “liberty” should not be considered in its absolute sense, but rather within the parole context as indicated by the modifying phrase “upon parole,” as set forth in § 13-8-9. The state also highlights that Mr. Curtis signed an agreement setting forth the terms and conditions of his parole; that agreement specifically excluded time spent on parole from being credited toward his full sentence. Furthermore, the state avers that the General Assembly views community confinement and time spent in the ACI as qualitatively different, highlighting the divergent statutory treatment of credit for time served while awaiting trial in the ACI as opposed to on community confinement.', 'Mr. Curtis counters that the hearing justice correctly interpreted this Court’s precedent as establishing that community confinement is a form of imprisonment and that, by definition, defendant could not have been “at liberty” while he was imprisoned. The defendant further contends that his parole agreement, which purportedly waived his right to receive credit for any time served on community confinement, is null and void as a contract of adhesion. He also argues that such a waiver of his liberty would constitute a usurpation of legislative power by the parole board.', 'In her bench decision, the hearing justice considered the plain and ordinary meanings of the phrase “at liberty” and the word “confinement” and found them to be fundamentally contradictory. Because, in her view, the two words are at odds with one another, the hearing justice reasoned that a parolee on community confinement could not be considered at liberty upon parole, as required by § 13-8-16. 6 The hearing justice noted that, given this contradiction, 6', 'Section 13-8-16(a) states:', '“Every permit issued by the parole board under this chapter shall', 'entitle the prisoner to whom it is issued to be at liberty upon parole', 'during the remainder of the term which he or she is under sentence', 'to serve, upon any terms and conditions that the board may see fit', 'in its discretion to prescribe, and the acceptance of the permit by', '--5-- it would be incumbent upon the General Assembly to clarify § 13-18-19(b) to expressly preclude parolees from receiving credit for time spent on community confinement toward the completion of their full sentence. Therefore, the hearing justice concluded that the time Mr. Curtis had spent on community confinement should be credited toward his full sentence.', 'The issue presented on appeal concerns the interplay of three statutes, viz., §§ 13-8-16(a), 13-8-19(b), and 13-8-9. Section 13-8-19(b) generally precludes a prisoner from receiving credit toward his or her full sentence for time spent on parole. Section 13-8-9 grants the parole board the authority to issue a permit to a qualified prisoner “to be at liberty upon parole” that “entitle[s] the prisoner * * * to be at liberty during the remainder of his or her term of sentence upon any terms and conditions that the board may prescribe.” Section 13-8-16(a) has similar language, stating that a parole permit entitles a parolee “to be at liberty upon parole during the remainder of the term which he or she is under sentence to serve, upon any terms and conditions that the board may see fit in its discretion to prescribe * * *.”', 'We focus our analysis on the “permit” that the parole board is authorized to grant within the statutory framework. Under § 13-8-9, the parole board may issue to a qualified prisoner “a permit to be at liberty upon parole,” which “permit shall entitle the prisoner to whom it is issued to be at liberty during the remainder of his or her term of sentence upon any terms and conditions that the board may prescribe.” The conditional nature of the parole permit is reemphasized in § 13-8-16(a). The statutory language not only repeats the board’s authority to prescribe “any terms and conditions” that it “may see fit in its discretion,” but also it provides that “the acceptance of the permit by the prisoner shall constitute an agreement on the part of the prisoner to abide by and conform to those terms and conditions.” Section 13-8-16(a). Thus, it is clear that', 'the prisoner shall constitute an agreement on the part of the', 'prisoner to abide by and conform to those terms and conditions.”', '--6-- a permit “to be at liberty on parole” is subject to whatever reasonable conditions the parole board may prescribe. See Rondoni v. Langlois, 89 R.I. 373, 376, 153 A.2d 163, 164-65 (1959) (holding that the defendant was bound by the conditions of his parole agreement). This is also consistent with our previous cases concerning parole, in which we have characterized parole as a privilege to which the parolee assents. See Bishop v. State, 667 A.2d 275, 278 (R.I. 1995) (“[T]here is no ‘constitutional or inherent right’ to parole * * *.”) (quoting Greenholtz v. Nebraska Penal Inmates, 442 U.S. 1, 7 (1979)).', 'We next consider § 13-8-19(b), which states: “The time between the release of the prisoner under the [parole] permit and the prisoner’s return to the [ACI] under order of the board shall not be considered as any part of the prisoner’s original sentence.” In the case at bar, cooperation with the EMP for a minimum of three months was manifestly a special condition of Mr. Curtis’s parole permit. A second condition of his permit was that in the event his parole should be revoked “the time between [his] release upon said permit and [his] return to the place of [his] original confinement shall not be considered as any part of [his] original sentence.” It is clear to us under the plain meaning of the statutory language, as well as by Mr. Curtis’s assent to the terms of his permit, that the ninety days he spent on community confinement may not be credited against his original sentence.', 'Thus, we need not examine contemporary notions of liberty and contrast them with the realities of community confinement. Clearly, the meaning of liberty within the parole context cannot be construed as an absolute liberty or an absolute freedom. Rather, liberty within the parole context is qualified by such terms and conditions as the parole board sees fit.', 'Mr. Curtis argues that time spent in community confinement on the electronic monitoring program is imprisonment, citing State v. Quattrocchi, 687 A.2d 78, 79 (R.I. 1996) (“We are', '--7-- persuaded that home confinement is a form of imprisonment during which an employee’s liberty is significantly restrained.”) and State v. Desjarlais, 731 A.2d 716, 718 (R.I. 1999) (stating that “sentencing a person to [community] confinement as opposed to incarceration in a correctional facility is merely a ‘change in the place where he or she is confined’”) (quoting State v. Mariano, 648 A.2d 803, 804 (R.I. 1994)). Neither of these cases, however, concerns a prisoner who is released from incarceration pursuant to a permit to be at liberty upon parole, nor do they alter the plain meaning of § 13-8-19(b), which precludes a prisoner from receiving credit for any time served on parole under a permit. Therefore, we hold that defendant was “at liberty upon parole” within the meaning of §§ 13-8-16(a) and 13-8-9, notwithstanding the condition that he cooperate with the EMP, and thus, under § 13-8-19(b), defendant is not entitled to receive credit for time spent on community confinement toward the completion of his full sentence.', 'We note that this conclusion is further supported by this Court’s reluctance to grant credit for time served when such credit has not been explicitly provided for by statute, as is the case here. See State v. Murphy, 692 A.2d 335, 336 (R.I. 1997) (mem.) (“The absence of [legal authority mandating or permitting credit toward the completion of a sentence] is dispositive of the defendant’s appeal, especially since there are no equities present in this case that would serve to support the development of new legal precedent.”).', 'Additionally, defendant was put on notice when he signed his parole agreement, which explicitly stated that he would not receive credit for the time he was on parole. This condition generally referred to the time between “release upon said permit” and his return to the ACI. We, however, need not reach the issue of whether this parole agreement was a contract of adhesion because, as we have previously noted, parole is a privilege and not a right of the prisoner. See Bishop, 667 A.2d at 278.', '--8--', 'Finally, the defendant’s argument that the waiver of credit for time spent on community confinement would constitute a usurpation of legislative power by the parole board is without merit. Section 13-8-9 explicitly authorizes the parole board to issue parole permits to qualified prisoners “upon any terms and conditions that the board may prescribe.” Therefore, we are satisfied that the parole board was not acting beyond the parameters of the General Assembly’s authorization.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment granting the defendant’s motion to correct sentence. The papers in the case shall be returned to the Superior Court.', 'Justice Indeglia took no part in the consideration or decision of this appeal.', '--9--', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'Harold Curtis v.

After leading her into the living room, Guerrero sat in his desk chair while Katherine sat on the adjacent couch. Guerrero then directed Katherine to masturbate him, and she did. 6', 'The family moved again, this time to Douglas Avenue in Providence.

When she complied, Guerrero pulled down her pants and inserted his fingers into her vagina. On another occasion, again in the living room, Katherine testified that Guerrero pulled her pants down.

On cross-examination, defendant suggested that Katherine merely was trying to get back at him for his disciplining her, for forcing Katherine’s brother to leave the house, and for the fallout between Guerrero and Katherine’s mother. Although Katherine admitted that Guerrero did discipline her and her sister, she said she did not come forward with the allegations for any reason other than that he had sexually assaulted her.', 'At the close of the prosecution’s case, Guerrero made a motion for a judgment of acquittal on two counts pursuant to Rule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.

On count 3, first-degree child molestation sexual assault, the trial justice sentenced defendant to thirty years, with twenty years to serve and ten years suspended with ten years of probation, to run concurrently with all other counts.', 'The defendant timely appealed to this Court. The sole argument on appeal is that the trial justice erred when she denied defendant’s motion for a new trial. Specifically, defendant argues that the trial justice abused her discretion because “the verdict was against the fair preponderance of the evidence and failed to do substantial justice between the parties.”', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'We repeatedly have held that when a trial justice considers a motion for a new trial after a jury trial, “the trial justice acts as a thirteenth juror.” State v. Reyes, 984 A.2d 606, 618 (R.I.', '-5- 2009) (quoting State v. Texieira, 944 A.2d 132, 140 (R.I. 2008)). Under these circumstances “the trial justice must (1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” Id. “If the trial justice agrees with the verdict, the inquiry is at an end.” State v. Stansell, 909 A.2d 505, 511 (R.I. 2006) (citing State v. Banach, 648 A.2d 1363, 1367 (R.I. 1994)). “In cases in which the trial justice disagrees with the verdict, he or she must then determine whether the evidence is such that reasonable minds could differ.” Id. (citing Banach, 648 A.2d at 1367 n.1). If the trial justice communicates a sufficient justification for denying a defendant’s motion for a new trial, the decision is entitled to significant deference. State v. Barry, 982 A.2d 1050, 1051 (R.I. 2009) (mem.).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, defendant argues, as he did in his motion for a new trial, that Katherine’s testimony was not credible to such an extent that the jury’s finding of guilt should be set aside and a new trial should be granted. The defendant contends that Katherine was “evasive” in her testimony. He also maintains that Katherine’s testimony was not credible because she was unable to recall details at trial that she had testified to at his bail hearing and, conversely, she testified at trial to facts that she never testified about in her prior testimony. The defendant also advances the argument that Katherine’s allegations were “inherently unlikely” because they all involved incidents that she said occurred at a time that other family members were either home or due home soon.', 'Further, defendant emphasizes that Katherine’s allegations were not corroborated by any other testimony or medical evidence.', '-6-', 'When she ruled on defendant’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice first said that she was familiar with the standard on a motion for a new trial. She then proceeded to consider Katherine’s testimony in light of each count of the indictment. The trial justice ultimately concurred with the jury’s finding that Katherine was credible. She ruled that:', '“While the defense certainly raised issues regarding', 'inconsistencies in the victim’s testimony and her delayed', 'disclosure, there was nothing in that inconsistent testimony or the', 'disclosure testimony that, in this Court’s view, undermined the', 'credibility of [Katherine] as to the child molestation incidents', 'themselves or the weight to be afforded her testimony in that', 'regard.”', 'The trial justice then proceeded to analyze the delayed disclosures of the sexual- molestation incidents. She accepted Katherine’s reasoning that she did not reveal these incidents in a timely fashion because she feared that defendant would physically assault her and she wanted to wait until her mother and defendant were about to end their relationship before she revealed this information. The trial justice, in fact, did underscore the areas in which Katherine’s trial testimony was inconsistent with her prior testimony. However, she ultimately ruled that Katherine “never wavered in her testimony about the sexual assault incidents themselves,” and the trial justice did not consider the inconsistencies on “minor details” to affect the credibility of her testimony on the crucial issues.', 'The trial justice declared that she “saw nothing in [Katherine’s] testimony that indicated any motive on her part to lie, and * * * [she] withstood cross-examination with regard to the crux of these incidents very well.”', 'In our opinion, the trial justice appropriately recognized and applied the three-step process in which she was obliged to engage when ruling on a motion for a new trial after a jury verdict. As we reiterated in Reyes, 984 A.2d at 618, the trial justice first must consider the evidence in light of the charge to the jury. In our view the trial justice clearly did so when she', '-7- identified the five counts against Guerrero and then considered Katherine’s testimony on each count.', 'Second, the trial justice must assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence. Reyes, 984 A.2d at 618. Before this Court, defendant rests his argument for a new trial principally on this step and specifically on Katherine’s credibility, rather than the weight of the evidence. When she assessed Katherine’s credibility, the trial justice found her to be a witness worthy of belief.', 'Appellate courts, relegated to reading from a “lifeless record,” justifiably defer to trial justices who experience firsthand the delivery and demeanor of a witness’s testimony. State v. Collazo, 967 A.2d 1106, 1110 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. Barrett, 768 A.2d 929, 938 (R.I. 2001)). Consequently, we consistently have engaged in a deferential review of a trial justice’s credibility determinations. State v. DiCarlo, 987 A.2d 867, 872 (R.I. 2010). The defendant offers no compelling reason for this Court to overturn the trial justice’s credibility determination, and we hold that it will not be disturbed.', 'In the third, and in this case final, step, the trial justice agreed with the jury’s finding of guilt on all five remaining counts, and she clearly and articulately expressed her reason for doing so. In conclusion, it is our opinion that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion when she declined to grant Guerrero a new trial.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the Superior Court’s judgment of conviction and remand the record to that tribunal.', '-8-', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'State of Rhode Island v.

Trial counsel testified that he had initially considered employing an insanity or diminished capacity defense. Counsel explained, however, that he decided against employing either defense in view of the fact that he was expressly told by the psychiatrist who had evaluated Mr. Page and with whom trial counsel had consulted that Mr. Page was “one of the most dangerous individuals [whom the psychiatrist had] ever met.” Counsel testified that, in view of that assessment, he did not present the testimony of any psychiatrist or psychologist at trial because he believed that such testimony “could not help [his] client.”', 'Trial counsel testified that he also investigated the potential defense of intoxication by speaking directly to Mr. Page regarding his use of drugs and alcohol at the time of the murder. Mr. Page informed counsel that on the day of the murder he had smoked a “blunt” (which we understand to be a reference to marijuana) and that, on the day of his arrest, he had smoked marijuana and consumed alcohol. Trial counsel testified that he conducted research into and made himself aware of the case law concerning the relationship between intoxication and culpability for first-degree murder. It is a fair inference from the record that trial counsel 7', '“The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, section 10, of the Rhode Island Constitution provide that in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to the assistance of counsel in his or her defense.” Brown v.

Counsel further testified that he did use the evidence of intoxication as one of the grounds for his motion to suppress the incriminating statements that Mr. Page had made after his arrest. He added that the trial justice denied that motion. 8', 'Trial counsel further testified that he had attempted to reach a plea bargain with the Attorney General’s Office in view of (1) the trial justice’s ruling as to the admissibility of Mr. Page’s incriminating statements; (2) the likely admissibility of certain gruesome photographs of Mr. Gardiner’s brutally beaten body; 9 and (3) the fact that Mr. Page’s fingerprints were present on one of the murder weapons. He added that his attempt to reach a plea agreement was unsuccessful.', 'It was further trial counsel’s testimony that, when he realized that his plea bargaining attempt had not been successful, it was his belief that, in view of that adverse development and in view of the above-referenced formidable evidence of guilt, the best strategy would be to focus on sentencing. He testified that, at that point in time, he advised Mr. Page of his view that the most advisable course of action would be to proceed with a jury-waived trial on the basis of stipulated facts. 10 Trial counsel testified at the postconviction relief hearing that, “given the 8', 'In its 1998 opinion, this Court affirmed the trial justice’s ruling with respect to the motion to suppress.

Counsel’s hope was premised on the fact that, by opting for a nonjury trial with stipulated evidence, Mr. Page would thereby spare the victim’s family the travail of having to endure the highly upsetting evidence about the murder that would surely take place in a drawn-out and explicit manner during a jury trial or during a bench trial with no stipulation as to the facts. 12', 'After considering trial counsel’s testimony at the postconviction relief hearing, the hearing justice rejected Mr. Page’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel during the trial itself. He found that, once his attempt to persuade the trial justice to suppress his client’s confession proved unsuccessful, trial counsel had faced overwhelming physical evidence and had been left with no realistic trial strategy. He was further satisfied that trial counsel had conducted a reasonable investigation into the possible defenses of diminished capacity and insanity; he noted that, after consulting with a psychiatrist and considering the psychiatrist’s assessment, trial counsel had decided against employing either defense. The hearing justice was also satisfied with respect to trial counsel’s investigation and decision-making relative to possibly raising a defense based on intoxication. 11', 'Trial counsel testified that he advised Mr. Page to stipulate to the facts rather than to simply plead guilty because the latter option would have resulted in the waiver of his ability to appeal the denial of the motion to suppress his incriminating statements. 12', 'As was noted in this Court’s 1998 opinion, Mr. Page was in fact eventually “tried before a justice of the Superior Court on stipulated proof that consisted solely of documents and exhibits.” Page, 709 A.2d at 1044.', '-7-', 'The hearing justice summarized as follows his perception of the situation confronting trial counsel before the trial began:', '“[Trial counsel] had but one * * * chip to play.

The hearing justice further found that waiving a jury trial was consistent with counsel’s ultimate goal of attempting to obtain leniency for his client at sentencing—a decision which the hearing justice stated he could not fault trial counsel for making. The hearing justice described trial counsel’s advice to the effect that Mr. Page should waive his right to a jury trial and focus on making a plea for leniency at the time of sentencing as constituting “sound tactical decisions.”', 'The postconviction relief hearing justice was not persuaded by Mr. Page’s further contention that he might have been convicted of second-degree (rather than first-degree) murder had he opted for a jury trial. 14 In response to that argument, the hearing justice stated as follows:', '“There is no way on God’s green earth that I could conceive of', 'ever inviting, at least in Mr. Page’s case, anything but a first', 'degree murder instruction to the jury based on the facts that would', 'have been produced as I reviewed the file.” 13', 'The issue of the admissibility (vel non) of applicant’s confession was in fact preserved for appellate review—although that review eventually proved unfavorable to applicant.

He also pointed out to the trial justice at the sentencing hearing that Mr. Page had “stepped to the plate in this case” by accepting responsibility for his actions.

The trial justice, after having reviewed the presentence report, stated that “[w]ords can’t capture the essence of [Mr. Page’s] uncontrollable, violent nature.” The hearing justice additionally stated at the postconviction relief hearing that the evidence relative to the crime scene and the autopsy was the “worst [he had] seen in seventeen years on the bench, the worst, absolute worst.”', 'Moreover, during that postconviction relief hearing, the hearing justice expressed doubt that trial counsel could have presented any evidence that would have persuaded him not to sentence Mr. Page to life without the possibility of parole.', 'In light of the several findings of fact made by the postconviction relief hearing justice, which we have held to be not clearly erroneous, and after our own independent review of the', '- 21 - record, it is our conclusion that Mr. Page was not deprived of his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel at sentencing.', 'C', 'Appellate Counsel’s Performance with Respect to the Direct Appeal', 'We next consider Mr. Page’s contention that his appellate attorney did not provide effective assistance of counsel in view of the fact that he failed to argue before this Court that Mr. Page was statutorily entitled to de novo consideration by us of his sentence of life without the possibility of parole.', 'The pertinent statute, G.L. 1956 § 12-19.2-5, provides as follows:', '“The defendant shall have the right to appeal a sentence of life', 'imprisonment without parole to the [S]upreme [C]ourt of the state', 'in accordance with the applicable rules of court. In considering an', 'appeal of a sentence, the court, after review of the transcript of the', 'proceedings below, may, in its discretion, ratify the imposition of', 'the sentence of life imprisonment without parole or may reduce the', 'sentence to life imprisonment.”', 'We understand this statute to indicate that this Court should conduct a direct review of the facts of this case (to the extent that they are reflected in the transcript)—a role that is highly unusual for this Court to play, but one which we will undertake in deference to this unique statutory provision.', 'Although the statute does not employ the term “de novo” in referring to this Court’s review process, we have consistently conducted our review of the life without parole issue in a de novo manner. See, e.g., State v. Quinlan, 921 A.2d 96, 112 (R.I. 2007) (stating that, with respect to § 12-19.2-5, “[o]ur review is de novo”); see also State v. McManus, 941 A.2d 222, 235 (R.I. 2008) (“In conducting our de novo review of the sentence, we must don the robes of a trial justice * * *.”) (Internal quotation marks omitted.); State v. Motyka, 893 A.2d 267, 281 (R.I.', '- 22 - 2006) (“[T]he decision to impose a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole is * * * reviewed by this Court in a de novo manner.”).', 'While appellate counsel did appeal (albeit without success) the trial court’s imposition of a ten-year concurrent sentence, 25 he failed to make the further argument that a person sentenced to life without the possibility of parole, such as Mr. Page, has the statutory right to have the members of this Court determine in a de novo manner whether that sentence is appropriate.', 'In our judgment, the failure of applicant’s appellate attorney to seek de novo review by this Court of the issue of the appropriateness of a sentence of life without the possibility of parole constituted ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. The statutory right to such de novo consideration by the members of this Court is clear. Thus, counsel’s performance was deficient in his failure to raise Mr. Page’s statutory right to have his sentence reviewed by this Court. See Chalk, 949 A.2d at 399. We further perceive that Mr. Page was prejudiced by his appellate counsel’s failure to raise before this Court the contention that he had the right to that review. We view Mr. Page’s statutory right to a review pursuant to § 12-19.2-5 to be “not only meritorious, but ‘clearly stronger’ than those issues that actually were raised on appeal.” See Chalk, 949 A.2d at 399 (quoting Robbins, 528 U.S. at 288).', 'D', 'This Court’s De Novo Review of the Sentence of Life Without the Possibility of Parole', 'In this case, having found ineffective assistance of appellate counsel with respect to the failure of appellate counsel to invoke § 12-19.2-5, it is incumbent upon this Court to provide the remedy. 25', 'See footnote 6, supra.', '- 23 -', 'We begin by noting that, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 11-23-2, “a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole may be imposed in a first-degree murder case when one of seven enumerated grounds is present.” Motyka, 893 A.2d at 288; see also State v. Pacheco, 763 A.2d 971, 981 (R.I. 2001). 26 The relevant statutory provision with respect to the case at bar is § 11-23-2(4), which references a first-degree murder that was “committed in a manner involving torture or an aggravated battery to the victim.”', 'We have previously defined “aggravated battery” as meaning a “beating or infliction of traumatic force that is greater than necessary in order to render a victim helpless or to subject the victim to the will of the aggressor.” State v. Travis, 568 A.2d 316, 323 (R.I. 1990). We consider that description to be entirely applicable to the murder that occurred in this case. Mr. Gardiner’s 26', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-23-2 provides in pertinent part as follows:', '“Every person guilty of murder in the first degree shall be', 'imprisoned for life. Every person guilty of murder in the first', 'degree: (1) committed intentionally while engaged in the', 'commission of another capital offense or other felony for which', 'life imprisonment may be imposed; (2) committed in a manner', 'creating a great risk of death to more than one person by means of', 'a weapon or device or substance which would normally be', 'hazardous to the life of more than one person; (3) committed at the', 'direction of another person in return for money or any other thing', 'of monetary value from that person; (4) committed in a manner', 'involving torture or an aggravated battery to the victim; (5)', 'committed against any member of the judiciary, law enforcement', 'officer, corrections employee, assistant attorney general or special', 'assistant attorney general, or firefighter arising from the lawful', 'performance of his or her official duties; (6) committed by a', 'person who at the time of the murder was committed to', 'confinement in the adult correctional institutions or the state', 'reformatory for women upon conviction of a felony; or (7)', 'committed during the course of the perpetration or attempted', 'perpetration of felony manufacture, sale, delivery or other', 'distribution of a controlled substance * * * shall be imprisoned for', 'life and if ordered by the court pursuant to chapter 19.2 of title 12', 'that person shall not be eligible for parole from imprisonment.”', '- 24 - death was found by the medical examiner to have resulted from “[m]assive facial and craniocerebral injuries [due to] [b]lunt force trauma.” The autopsy revealed that he suffered from blunt trauma to the neck, chest, abdomen, groin, and, most severely, to the head and face, rendering the victim (in the words of the trial justice) “virtually unrecognizable.” The autopsy photographs indicate that one of the murder weapons, an axe handle, was lodged in the victim’s head. As we noted in our previous opinion, the medical examiner who performed the autopsy on Mr. Gardiner described his injuries as being the “worst she had ever seen.” Page, 709 A.2d at 1043. The trial justice at the time of sentencing similarly described the murder as “the most atrocious, barbaric killing imaginable.” In his confession, applicant admitted that, during much of the savage beating, Mr. Gardiner remained conscious and was still moving. He further confessed that the beating of Mr. Gardiner continued after a rope was tied around his neck. 27', 'Having thoroughly reviewed the evidence in the case, including the autopsy report, photographs, confession, and witness statements, there is no doubt in each of our minds that the evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that the murder of Mr. Gardiner was “committed in a manner involving torture or an aggravated battery to the victim * * *.” Thus, § 11-23-2(4) is satisfied, requiring us next to decide whether to “ratify the imposition of the sentence of life imprisonment without parole or [to] reduce the sentence to life imprisonment.” Section 12-19.2- 5.', 'In carrying out the statutorily required review, we first consider whether the “personal history, character, record, and propensities” of Mr. Page warrant the imposition of the sentence of life without the possibility of parole. See § 12-19.2-4; Motyka, 893 A.2d at 290; see also State v. Tassone, 749 A.2d 1112, 1119 (R.I. 2000). In doing so, we must consider “any 27', 'For a further description of the brutality that accompanied the murder of Mr. Gardiner, see Page, 709 A.2d at 1043.', '- 25 - aggravating circumstances as well as any mitigating factors.” Quinlan, 921 A.2d at 111-12; see also Motyka, 893 A.2d at 290 (examining aggravating factors along with mitigating evidence).', 'After having carefully scrutinized the evidence in this case, the findings of the trial justice, and the “personal history, character, record, and propensities” of the applicant, and having taken into account the mitigating factors cited by applicant, the members of this Court are in agreement that the sentence of life without the possibility of parole is appropriate in this instance. See § 12-19.2-4; McManus, 941 A.2d at 238.', 'We, like the trial justice, are of the view that there is only one significant mitigating factor that weighs in Mr. Page’s favor, that being his age. 28 However, in view of the heinousness of the crime and the blatant disregard for human life that Mr. Page exhibited in committing that crime and in view of his long history of violating the law and his repeated manifestations of violence, aggression, and anger, we conclude that his case warrants the imposition of the sentence of life without the possibility of parole. We take note that, at the time of sentencing in the Superior Court, the trial justice highlighted portions of Mr. Page’s Training School records in which professionals had indicated that Mr. Page was “full of anger [and] aggressiveness,” had already committed crimes of robbery and assault by the age of seventeen, exercised “poor impulse control,” utilized “violence as a primary coping strategy,” and was “resentful, socially arrogant and provocative, with a desire to provoke fear and intimidate others.” The trial justice stated that he had “absolutely no doubt that [Mr. Page was] the primary culprit in this savage killing, and that [Mr. Page was] the one who, with a final Satanic flurry, drove an ax handle through the victim’s head.” Having completed our own review of the record in this case, including the presentence report, we reach the same conclusion as did the trial justice with 28', 'See footnote 3, supra.', '- 26 - respect to Mr. Page’s violent character and propensities. The intimidating behavior and inability to control his anger that Mr. Page has demonstrated has led us to conclude that he is a dangerous individual, who possesses an enduring potential for violence.', 'We further agree that the mitigating factor (his age) does not outweigh the numerous aggravating factors that have been established in this case and that justify a sentence of life without the possibility of parole.', 'We find ourselves hard-pressed (as was the trial justice) to find sufficient words to describe the atrocity of the crime that was committed against Mr. Gardiner, an unassuming stranger.', 'Having completed our independent review and exercising the discretion that is mandated by statute, we are convinced that the trial justice’s imposition of the sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole was appropriate, and we ratify the imposition of same. See § 12-19.2-5.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court denying postconviction relief with respect to the applicant’s representation at trial and at the sentencing proceeding in the Superior Court. In addition, we have addressed the issue of the effectiveness of the applicant’s representation before this Court; and, having found that that representation was wanting in one respect, we have proceeded to conduct the review provided for in § 12-19.2-5. We have in the end concluded that the sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole was appropriate, and we have ratified the imposition of that sentence.', 'The record may be remanded to the Superior Court.', 'Justice Indeglia took no part in the consideration or decision of this appeal.', '- 27 -', 'Justice Flaherty, concurring in part and dissenting in part. I concur in all aspects of the majority’s well-written and well-reasoned opinion, save one: the affirming of the sentence of life without the possibility of parole.', 'From that part of the majority’s opinion, I must respectfully depart.', 'I agree with my colleagues that the assault on Mr. Gardiner was carried out with almost incomprehensible savagery. However, I believe that, perhaps affected by the unquestionable brutality of the crime, the majority has determined too quickly that Mr. Page is incapable of reform.', 'The record reveals a young man who has been driven by rage and an inability to control either his anger or his violent impulses throughout most of his short life. He has been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and has IQ values in the low range. He is a product of a dysfunctional family; both of his parents were drug addicted, and his father and grandfather were HIV positive, likely as a result of drug use. His father eventually died of AIDS.', 'Of course, none of this excuses the brutality of his actions, for which he deserves a life sentence. But, in my view, when one considers the obstacles with which he has been confronted, coupled with his young age, the chance for rehabilitation exists, and Mr. Page should not be consigned to the rubbish heap of life.', 'This is not a case of still another crime by a career criminal, or of a felony where barbarism was combined with a planned criminal venture. See, e.g., State v. Graham, 941 A.2d 848, 867 (R.I. 2008) (determining that defendant was likely beyond rehabilitation given his “life of crime” and affirming sentence of life without parole imposed for his conviction of committing murder for hire); State v. Brown, 898 A.2d 69, 72, 86-87 (R.I. 2006) (concluding that defendant’s numerous convictions and contacts with law enforcement rendered his “prospects for', '- 28 - rehabilitation” bleak and affirming sentence of life without parole for his conviction for the sadistic murder of an acquaintance); State v. Motyka, 893 A.2d 267, 271-72, 290-91 (R.I. 2006) (affirming sentence of life without parole where defendant, who had “prior criminal contacts” involving kidnapping, high-jacking, and assault, returned to the home where he previously had performed construction work and committed the heinous murder of the homeowner); State v. Harnois, 853 A.2d 1249, 1251, 1257 (R.I. 2004) (affirming sentence of life without parole following defendant’s conviction for his “deliberate planning and facilitation” of a successful murder for hire of his wife); State v. Travis, 568 A.2d 316, 326 (R.I. 1990) (discussing defendant’s prolific criminal career, including previous convictions for robbery, and affirming sentence of life without parole for his conviction of first-degree murder perpetrated in the commission of a robbery). By contrast, this unquestionably heinous act was the product of happenstance and the amoral impulses of a very troubled young man.', 'Life without parole for youthful offenders has been grist for the mill for a number of thoughtful law review articles. See, e.g., Lauren Fine, Death Behind Bars: Examining Juvenile Life Without Parole in Sullivan v. Florida and Graham v. Florida, 5 Duke J. of Const. L. & Pub. Pol’y 24, 41, 41-42 (2009) (proposing that the sentence of life without parole for juveniles does not achieve incarceration’s goals of deterrence and rehabilitation and should be held unconstitutional, in part because “[i]t is not until age twenty-one that individuals experience ‘tremendous gains in emotional maturity, impulse control and decision making’ that continue until the brain becomes fully developed in the mid-twenties”); Jeffrey Fagan, End Natural Life Sentences for Juveniles, 6 Criminology and Pub. Pol’y 735, 744 (2007) (arguing that no “extra benefits to crime control or to retributive justice” flow from a sentence of life without parole imposed on a juvenile).', '- 29 -', 'In his majority opinion for the United States Supreme Court in Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551, 573-74, 578 (2005), which held the imposition of the death penalty for offenders who were under eighteen years old at the time of the crime to be unconstitutional, Justice Kennedy said, “When a juvenile offender commits a heinous crime, the State can exact forfeiture of some of the most basic liberties, but the State cannot extinguish his life and his potential to attain a mature understanding of his own humanity.”', 'I am fully aware that the writings referred to above address the subject of life without parole for juveniles and that Mr. Page had passed the threshold of majority, if just barely, when he murdered Mr. Gardiner. But while there must be some arbitrary bright-line demarcation between youth and adulthood, there is no question that few, if any, young people are imbued with the attributes of adulthood as soon as their eighteenth birthday is achieved.', 'Finally, this is not to say that Mr. Page ever should be entitled to parole or that it ever should be granted to him. In any case, one sentenced to life in prison is not parole eligible until he has served at least fifteen years. G.L. 1956 § 11-23-2.2. If Mr. Page were eligible for parole, he would not have the opportunity until his mid-thirties to demonstrate to the parole board that he has reformed, matured, and that he is no longer the angry, violent, and impulsive person that he was at age eighteen. He would have the opportunity to show that he has changed, perhaps through counseling, education, maturity, or by embracing religious faith.', 'Of course, he may not prove a change in character to the satisfaction of the parole board and may indeed fail to show that he is fit for a return to law-abiding society; that is a determination for the board. Although I concede that this is a close case, in my opinion, Mr. Page should not be denied the opportunity for reform and for a return to society for the remainder of his natural life.', '- 30 -', 'For these reasons, I respectfully dissent from the majority’s affirmance of Mr. Page’s sentence of life without the possibility of parole, and would have reduced the sentence to life imprisonment in accordance with G.L. 1956 § 12-19.2-5.', '- 31 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'William Page v.

27,:,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The father (respondent) appeals from a Family Court decree terminating his parental rights with respect to his child, Brook Ann R. (Brook). This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After examining the written and oral submissions of the parties, we conclude that this appeal may be resolved without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the decree of the Family Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'The Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) first became involved with Brook’s family on July 2, 2006, when the child’s mother, with whom she lived, reportedly overdosed on psychotropic medication. Brook was removed from her mother’s custody three days later, after the Family Court entered an ex parte order of detention. She was adjudicated to be a neglected child as to her mother and was committed to the custody of DCYF on March 9, 2007. On April 4, 2008, DCYF petitioned the Family Court for the termination of her mother and father’s parental rights. On October 16, 2008, the Family Court entered a decree approving an open adoption agreement that her mother had executed.', '-1-', 'The respondent-father has been incarcerated since 2004. DCYF sought the termination of his parental rights in relation to Brook on the grounds that: (1) he was an unfit parent by virtue of his incarceration, which rendered it improbable that he could care for his daughter for an extended period; and (2) he had abandoned or deserted his daughter. On January 14, 2009, a trial was held before the Family Court, at which the trial justice heard testimony from respondent and Brook’s DCYF social worker.', 'The respondent testified, through an interpreter, that he was serving a life sentence after a murder conviction and that he had been incarcerated at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI) since December 31, 2004. He maintained that he did not commit the murder for which he was incarcerated, and he alleged that there was new exculpatory evidence in that case. 1', 'Concerning his relationship with Brook, respondent testified that he lived with Brook and her mother for the first five years of Brook’s life, but not thereafter. According to respondent’s testimony, after he stopped living with his daughter he continued to see her frequently. He also testified, however, that Brook’s mother frustrated his attempts to visit the child and that he had not seen her since his incarceration. He reported that he had requested visitation through his psychiatrist at the ACI.', 'The respondent further testified that he had provided financial support for Brook through her maternal grandfather, but that he has been unable to provide support since his incarceration. He stated that he and Brook’s maternal grandfather had an understanding that her grandfather would provide for her financially while respondent was incarcerated and that respondent would reimburse him upon his release. The respondent stated that he received updates about Brook from her grandfather approximately two or three times a month. 1', 'We note that a separate appeal concerning respondent’s murder conviction is pending before this Court in a separate action.', '-2-', 'Maureen Romano, the DCYF social worker assigned to Brook’s case, also testified at trial. She said that she was informed in July 2006, when the family’s DCYF case was opened, that respondent was incarcerated. She testified that respondent never contacted her to request services, reunification, or visits with Brook and that he had not provided financial support. She also stated that, to her knowledge, he had not engaged in any of the parenting services offered at the ACI. According to Ms. Romano, Brook had never requested to see her father and, when asked, Brook said she did not wish to see him.', 'She also testified that Brook’s therapist recommended that Brook not visit her father at the ACI. Additionally, Ms. Romano testified that, at the time of trial, Brook was living in a pre-adoptive home and was “extremely” bonded to her foster mother.', 'At the conclusion of the trial, the trial justice rendered a decision from the bench terminating respondent’s parental rights.', 'The trial justice found that respondent had been incarcerated for approximately four years, that he had been separated from Brook for approximately six years, and that he had not provided financial support for his daughter. The trial justice stated that there was no proof substantiating respondent’s assertion that he had provided financial assistance for the child through her maternal grandfather. The trial justice determined that respondent was an unfit parent because of his institutionalization. The trial justice also found that respondent had abandoned the child. On January 20, 2009, respondent filed a timely notice of appeal. 2 2', 'The termination-of-parental-rights decree was not entered until February 18, 2009. A prematurely filed notice of appeal, however, does not bar review by this Court in these circumstances. See, e.g., In re Brooklyn M., 933 A.2d 1113, 1121 n.15 (R.I. 2007); In re Kayla N., 900 A.2d 1202, 1206 n.6 (R.I. 2006).', '-3-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'On appeal, “[t]his Court reviews termination of parental rights rulings by examining the record to establish whether the [Family Court] justice’s findings are supported by legal and competent evidence.” In re Victoria L., 950 A.2d 1168, 1174 (R.I. 2008) (quoting In re Ariel N., 892 A.2d 80, 83 (R.I. 2006)). The trial justice’s findings are accorded great weight and will not be disturbed on appeal unless they “are clearly wrong or the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence.” In re Destiny D., 922 A.2d 168, 172 (R.I. 2007). “[T]he trial justice must find that the parent is unfit before terminating [his or her] parental rights.” In re Pricillion R., 971 A.2d 599, 604 (R.I. 2009). “The natural parent’s right to due process requires that the state support its allegations by at least clear and convincing evidence.” Id. (quoting In re Victoria L., 950 A.2d at 1174). Upon a determination of parental unfitness, “the best interests of the child outweigh all other considerations.” Id.', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, respondent argues that the trial justice erred in (1) finding that he had abandoned his daughter, and (2) terminating his parental rights based upon his incarceration. The respondent first contends that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that he abandoned Brook. Specifically, he contends that he is not entirely to blame for his failure to visit with Brook since his incarceration. He asserts that Brook’s mother would not bring her to the ACI to visit him and, once Brook was in DCYF’s custody, DCYF did not bring her to visit. He also argues that despite the state’s failure to refute his testimony that he provided financial', '-4- support for the child prior to his incarceration, the trial justice found that he had not provided said support.', 'The child’s guardian ad litem and DCYF counter that the six-year period during which respondent did not have contact with his daughter and failed to support her, both before and during his incarceration, constitutes prima facie evidence of abandonment. The guardian ad litem and DCYF further assert that it was the responsibility of respondent, not DCYF, to initiate contact with Brook.', 'General Laws 1956 § 15-7-7(a)(4) provides that “[a] lack of communication or contact with the child for at least a six (6) month period shall constitute prima facie evidence of abandonment or desertion.” The respondent’s testimony establishes that, at the time of the trial, he had not seen his daughter in at least four years, which is far longer than the statutory period of six months.', 'The respondent’s attempt to evade his responsibility to maintain contact with his daughter by placing the blame first on Brook’s mother and then on DCYF is unavailing. We have previously stated that we have “no tolerance for a parent ‘who makes halfhearted or no attempts to visit or contact his or her child within the six-month statutory time period * * *.’” In re Abby D., 839 A.2d 1222, 1225 (R.I. 2004) (quoting In re DeKarri P., 787 A.2d 1170, 1172 (R.I. 2001)). A parent, not DCYF, has the primary and ultimate responsibility “to substantially and repeatedly maintain contact with [his or her child]” in the care of DCYF. In re Amanda D., 918 A.2d 220, 224 (R.I. 2007) (quoting In re Shaylon J., 782 A.2d 1140, 1143 (R.I. 2001)). Furthermore, it is of no moment that respondent was incarcerated for this four-year period. This Court repeatedly has held that incarceration is not an excuse for failure to maintain contact with one’s child for the statutory period. See, e.g., In re Serenity K., 891 A.2d 881, 884 (R.I. 2006)', '-5- (stating that a parent’s responsibility to maintain substantial and repeated contact with his or her child endures “even when the parent whose rights are at issue was incarcerated for the six-month statutory period”). Furthermore, this Court has also held that “§ 15-7-7(a)(4) does not include the element of willfulness to show abandonment.” In re Craig G., 765 A.2d 1200, 1202 (R.I. 2001).', 'The respondent’s own testimony reflects that, at the time of trial, he had not had any contact, visitation or otherwise, with Brook for over four years. There was no evidence that he had made any attempt during this period to arrange for visitation with Brook, except for his assertion that he asked a psychiatrist for visitation. In addition, there is no evidence that he ever attempted to contact Brook by mail or telephone. Similarly, respondent conceded that he had not directly provided Brook with financial support since his incarceration.', 'Furthermore, when a parent is deemed unfit because he or she abandoned his or her child, as is the case here, DCYF has no obligation to engage in reasonable efforts to reunify the family. Section 15-7-7(b)(1). Consequently, DCYF was not required to contact respondent to engage in reasonable efforts to reunify him with Brook before successfully petitioning for the termination of his parental rights.', 'The respondent also argues that the trial justice improperly shifted the burden of proof by faulting respondent for not presenting evidence to corroborate his testimony regarding financial support.', 'This argument is without merit, however, because, as we have stated in similar circumstances,', '“[a]lthough the burden of proof never shifts from the state, ‘the', 'burden of going forward with the evidence may indeed shift from', 'side to side, and this same burden may properly devolve upon a', '[respondent] once the state has developed a prima facie case and', 'has adduced evidence sufficient to make it just that the', '[respondent] be required to challenge the proof with excuse or', '-6-', 'explanation.” In re Corryn B., 914 A.2d 978, 982 (R.I. 2007)', '(quoting In re Jarvis R., 766 A.2d 395, 399 (R.I. 2001)). Here, DCYF presented testimony by Ms. Romano that respondent had not provided any financial support for the child. Moreover, the trial justice did not credit respondent’s testimony, finding “that he has not provided any personal support even though he says that he gave the maternal grandfather money to give to the child.” This factual determination is neither clearly wrong, nor did the trial justice overlook or misconceive material evidence.', 'After reviewing the record and the trial justice’s findings of fact, we are fully satisfied that the trial justice did not err in finding by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent- father abandoned or deserted his daughter, Brook. Because we affirm the termination of the respondent’s parental rights on the basis of abandonment, we decline to pass on the termination of the respondent’s parental rights on the basis of his imprisonment.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Family Court decree terminating the parental rights of the respondent.

Haffenreffer et al.",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson for the Court.', 'This case comes before us on the defendant’s appeal from two grants of summary judgment entered in accordance with Rule 56 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure in favor of the plaintiff, David H. Haffenreffer. The defendant, Karl Haffenreffer, raises two principal issues on appeal. First, Karl1 contends that the hearing justice in the Superior Court erred in ruling (a) that an offer document authored by the coexecutors administering the Estate of Carolyn B. Haffenreffer was clear and unambiguous and should be understood as David would have it and (b) that the offer document correspondingly precluded Karl from using a credit, against his anticipated share in Carolyn’s overall estate, as a portion of the purchase price in acquiring three parcels of real estate from the estate. Secondly, Karl contends in the alternative that the hearing justice erred in failing to order a reformation of the 1', 'For the sake of simplicity, we shall frequently refer to members of the Haffenreffer family by their first names. We of course intend no disrespect.', '-1- offer document so as to comport with the actual preexisting intention of the coexecutors, at whose behest the offer document was drafted. For the reasons set forth below, we reverse and vacate the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'David and Karl are brothers. Their mother, Carolyn B. Haffenreffer, passed away on December 13, 2003. Carolyn’s estate plan was reflected in a will executed in 1995. Having set forth a plan for the distribution of her probate estate, Carolyn’s will then provided that the residue and remainder of her estate should be transferred, or should pour over, into a trust established in 1982 and subsequently amended some sixteen times, most recently in 1999 (the Trust Agreement or trust). Carolyn’s will named David and Karl as coexecutors of her estate; it also provided that Attorney Noel M. Field, Jr. should serve as a coexecutor.2', 'A', 'The Probate Estate', 'Carolyn’s probate estate consisted mainly of various parcels of real property and various items of personal property. Carolyn bequeathed all her tangible personal property in roughly equal shares to be divided amongst Karl, David, and David’s wife. Carolyn directed that three parcels of real estate in Little Compton be devised to David. She also instructed the coexecutors to sell one parcel of real estate on Congdon Street in Providence.3 2', 'Noel M. Field, Esq. was named as a defendant in his capacity as a coexecutor of the Estate of Carolyn B. Haffenreffer. He is, however, only a nominal defendant in this action. 3', 'The three particular parcels of real estate in Little Compton that were devised to David are not at issue in the instant case, nor is the parcel on Congdon Street in Providence.', '-2-', 'Additionally, Carolyn directed the coexecutors to sell several other parcels of real estate located in Little Compton; it is these parcels that lie at the core of the instant controversy. Section 10 of the will governed the preconditions for the sale of these parcels. Essentially, section 10 required that the coexecutors first offer to sell the parcels to a select group of family members for “the lowest price which the seller would be willing to accept for such parcel;” then, if any of the parcels remained unsold, the coexecutors were to offer them for sale to the public.', 'B', 'The Trust Agreement', 'Carolyn’s will provided that the residue and remainder of her estate should be transferred into her trust. Carolyn had established in 1982 a Trust Agreement with Fleet National Bank (now Bank of America) to serve as trustee.4 The Trust Agreement provided that, after accounting for taxes, debts, and expenses, Karl would receive one-third of the remainder of the estate and David would receive the balance.', 'In May of 2004, several months after Carolyn’s death, Attorney Field (one of the coexecutors) created a spreadsheet to better explain what assets would ultimately constitute the Overall Estate5 and would be distributed in accordance with the Trust Agreement. He opined that the value of the assets would amount to a total sum of $29,442,438.70. After deductions for estate taxes, specific gifts, and expenses, Attorney Field calculated that $11,847,788.13 would be available to Karl and David. Ultimately, Karl could expect to receive approximately $3.9 million and David could expect to receive approximately $7.9 million. This estimate was 4', 'Bank of America was originally a defendant in this action, but that institution has since been dismissed. 5', 'In this opinion, the term “Overall Estate” refers to the probate estate coupled with the assets encompassed by the Trust Agreement.', '-3- updated in May of 2005 so as to indicate that Karl could expect to receive approximately $4.1 million and that David could expect to receive approximately $8.3 million.', 'C', 'The Offer Document', 'On March 2, 2005, the three coexecutors (Karl, David, and Attorney Field) caused to be created a document (Offer Document) that would be used to facilitate the sale of the six Little Compton parcels as directed by Carolyn’s will; in that document, the coexecutors mutually agreed to sell the six parcels in four saleable units. The Offer Document permitted Karl, David, and David’s three children to make offers to purchase the four units in accordance with section 10 of Carolyn’s will. What ultimately lies at the heart of the instant dispute is the language in the so-called “credit provision” of the Offer Document which sets forth the terms of payment for the units. That provision reads as follows:', '“Payment shall be made in the form of cash, certified check, bank', 'check or wire transfer, with or without financing, excepting', 'however, seller financing, in the full amount of the purchase price,', 'subject to customary adjustments and prorations as of the date of', 'transfer and subject to adjustment or credit for shares or amounts', 'due to such offeree from the Estate of Carolyn B. Haffenreffer', 'pursuant to the terms of the Will.”', 'The Offer Document required that any family member who wished to purchase a unit return his or her response by May 2, 2005.', 'On May 2, 2005, Karl submitted his response to the Offer Document—accepting the offer by indicating that he wished to purchase three specific units of the four that had been offered; those three units had been appraised as having a total value of $5,215,500. Karl indicated that he would pay most of the purchase price by using, in the form of a credit, the', '-4- approximately $4.1 million that was due to him from Carolyn’s Overall Estate to be distributed in accordance with the Trust Agreement.6', 'Almost a month later, on June 1, 2005, Attorney Field responded to Karl’s acceptance of the coexecutors’ offer to sell the parcels. Attorney Field did so in a memorandum to the coexecutors and their counsel; he asserted that the credit provision set forth in the Offer Document did not permit Karl to purchase the three units by using a credit reflective of the amount due to him from the Overall Estate. Attorney Field indicated that Karl would have to pay for the properties in the form of cash, certified check, bank check, or wire transfer.', 'Less than a week later, on June 7, 2005, Karl, through his attorney, responded to Attorney Field and David, demanding that the sale take place and asserting that he was entitled to use a credit reflective of the amount due to him from Carolyn’s Overall Estate. It is undisputed that David and Attorney Field, in their capacities as coexecutors, ultimately refused to consummate the sale.', 'D', 'The Superior Court Actions', 'On May 6, 2005, David commenced the instant action in Newport County Superior Court by filing a verified complaint seeking (1) a declaratory judgment and (2) a temporary restraining order to prevent the sale of the properties. On June 22, 2006, David filed an amended verified complaint, again requesting declaratory relief pursuant to the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act.7 In count 3 of his amended complaint, David sought a declaration that Karl had breached the contract to purchase the three units because he had failed to “close on the properties within 6', 'Karl indicated that he would pay the remaining $1,115,500 of the purchase price in cash by means of funds from a bank in Maine. 7', 'G.L. 1956 § 9-30-1.', '-5- the time set forth in the Will (as extended by agreement of the Co-Executors) [which] * * * negates the Estate’s duty to sell him any of the subject parcels.”', 'Karl answered the amended complaint and also filed a counterclaim and cross-claim, asserting that it was David and Attorney Field who, when they refused to convey the three parcels to him, had breached the contract that had come into existence when he accepted the offer set forth in the Offer Document. Karl contended that, in drafting the Offer Document, the coexecutors had intended that the credit provision in the Offer Document would allow him to use his intended distribution from Carolyn’s Overall Estate as a credit for a portion of the purchase price. The parties thereafter filed cross-motions for summary judgment.', 'On May 3, 2007, the parties appeared in Superior Court and participated in a hearing on their cross-motions for summary judgment. On July 27, 2007, the hearing justice issued a written decision and ruled that the credit provision clearly and unambiguously permitted Karl to use a credit from his anticipated share of Carolyn’s probate estate only—and not from the Overall Estate. Notably, the hearing justice stated that she did not “resort to analysis of extrinsic evidence” in reaching her decision; after having made reference to the parole evidence rule, she expressed her view that such analysis would be “both unnecessary and impermissible.” She therefore granted summary judgment in favor of David with respect to count 3 of his amended verified complaint.', 'In the wake of the just-referenced ruling, Karl was granted leave to amend his counterclaim. He then added a count 3 to his original counterclaim. In count 3 of Karl’s counterclaim, he sought reformation of the contract on the basis of mutual mistake; he again argued that the coexecutors had intended that, in purchasing such parcels as he might choose to', '-6- purchase, he could use a credit from his expected share of the Overall Estate. David and Karl again filed cross-motions for summary judgment.', 'On May 23, 2008, the same hearing justice as had ruled on the earlier cross-motions addressed the most recent cross-motions for summary judgment; she once again ruled in favor of David and declined to allow reformation of the contract. The hearing justice again declared that the Offer Document was clear and unambiguous and should be understood as David would have it. She held that the phrase “pursuant to the terms of the Will” in that document meant that, in seeking to purchase the subject properties, Karl was entitled to use a credit only with respect to his shares of Carolyn’s probate estate and not with respect to shares due to him from the Overall Estate as would be distributed in accordance with the Trust Agreement. The hearing justice also found no evidence of mutual mistake, stating that “[the coexecutors] understood the terms of payment * * * in the offer document to read and mean exactly what [was] stated as written.” Partial final judgment was entered in accordance with Rule 54(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure on July 18, 2008. Karl filed a timely notice of appeal.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court employs a de novo standard in reviewing a hearing justice’s decision on a motion for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. Estate of Giuliano v. Giuliano, 949 A.2d 386, 391 (R.I. 2008). We carry out such a review in the same manner as did the hearing justice, “reviewing the evidence and drawing all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.” Fiorenzano v. Lima, 982 A.2d 585, 589 (R.I. 2009); see also Planned Environments Management Corp. v. Robert, 966 A.2d 117, 121 (R.I. 2009); Chavers v. Fleet Bank (RI), N.A., 844 A.2d 666, 669', '-7- (R.I. 2004). This Court “will affirm a summary judgment if there is no genuine issue of material fact and we conclude that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” O’Sullivan v. Rhode Island Hospital, 874 A.2d 179, 182 (R.I. 2005); see also Alves v. Hometown Newspapers, Inc., 857 A.2d 743, 750 (R.I. 2004).', 'Further, since the instant dispute involves contract interpretation, it should be recalled that “this Court reviews the trial justice’s interpretation of contracts de novo.” Zarrella v. Minnesota Mutual Life Insurance Co., 824 A.2d 1249, 1259 (R.I. 2003). In addition, whether or not a contract is ambiguous is a question of law. Gorman v. Gorman, 883 A.2d 732, 738 n.8 (R.I. 2005); see also Young v. Warwick Rollermagic Skating Center, Inc., 973 A.2d 553, 558 (R.I. 2009). Accordingly, our review of the hearing justice’s ruling as to that issue is conducted on a de novo basis. Young, 973 A.2d at 558.', 'III', 'Analysis', 'On appeal, Karl contends that the hearing justice should not have granted summary judgment in David’s favor. He asserts that the credit provision in the Offer Document is ambiguous, in that (in his view) it is susceptible to more than one possible meaning. Karl further contends, however, that there is only one reasonable interpretation of that provision—viz., that the provision contemplates a credit being taken with respect to the Overall Estate and not just Carolyn’s probate estate (as is contended by David). Karl further alleges error in the hearing justice’s failure to look to extrinsic evidence in interpreting the provision in question. Karl contends that extrinsic evidence demonstrates that, at the time of the drafting of the Offer', '-8- Document, the coexecutors intended that the credit provision refer to the Overall Estate. Karl therefore asserts that summary judgment should have been granted in his favor.8', 'For the reasons that follow, it is our conclusion that the phrase “Estate of Carolyn B. Haffenreffer” as used in the credit provision of the Offer Document unambiguously refers to Carolyn’s Overall Estate.9', 'The credit provision expressly allows an offeree who is a potential purchaser to make payment through an “adjustment or credit for shares or amounts due to such offeree from the Estate of Carolyn B. Haffenreffer pursuant to the terms of the Will.” Our case law is clear that “instruments referred to in a written contract may be regarded as incorporated by reference and thus may be considered in the construction of the contract.” Rotelli v. Catanzaro, 686 A.2d 91, 94 (R.I. 1996). Accordingly, since the Offer Document expressly references the will, we shall look to the language of Carolyn’s will as we construe the just-quoted provision of the Offer Document.', 'In reviewing the terms of Carolyn’s will, it is immediately apparent that the will transfers a large portion of the decedent’s estate to a trust, as Carolyn’s will expressly provides that the residue and remainder of her estate should be transferred “to Fleet National Bank as trustee under [Carolyn’s] 1982 Trust Agreement * * *.” In the law of wills and trusts, such a provision 8', 'We note that the instant case “is a case in which the [Super.R.Civ.P.] 56 option was entirely appropriate; there was no dispute between the parties as to the material facts, but rather only as to the legal conclusion to be drawn.” See O’Sullivan v. Rhode Island Hospital, 874 A.2d 179, 183 (R.I. 2005). 9', 'It is undisputed that a contract was created when Karl submitted his response to the Offer Document; he thereby accepted (with respect to three of the four offered units) the coexecutors’ offer to sell the units. See E. Allan Farnsworth, Farnsworth on Contracts § 3.13 (3d ed. 2004); see also 17A Am. Jur. 2d Contracts § 1 (2009). Thus, our analysis of the language in the Offer Document’s credit provision will be “governed by the well-settled rules on the interpretation of contracts.” See McBurney v. Teixeira, 875 A.2d 439, 443 (R.I. 2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).', '-9- is commonly referred to as a pour-over provision. See, e.g., Filippi v. Filippi, 818 A.2d 608, 615 (R.I. 2003); see also Notarantonio v. Notarantonio, 941 A.2d 138, 141 (R.I. 2008). When such a pour-over provision is utilized, the decedent’s will and her trust become inextricably linked. See Merrill v. Boal, 47 R.I. 274, 283, 132 A. 721, 725 (1926) (“Very frequently a trust agreement * * * is later incorporated by reference into a will and serves as a part thereof.”); see also 79 Am. Jur. 2d Wills § 196 (2009) (“[T]he general rule of incorporation by reference is applicable to permit the incorporation in a will wherein a bequest is made in trust of an extrinsic trust instrument to supply the terms of the trust.”). Since it employs a pour-over provision, Carolyn’s will not only provides for the distribution of her probate estate, but it also directs that a large portion of her estate be distributed through a trust. Therefore, it is our conclusion that the shares to which Karl is entitled “pursuant to the terms of the Will” include shares from Carolyn’s probate estate and from her trust.10 Accordingly, we hold that the term “Estate of Carolyn B. Haffenreffer” as used in the credit provision of the Offer Document unambiguously refers to Carolyn’s Overall Estate. Consequently, we further hold that, in purchasing the three units that he wished to purchase, Karl was entitled to use, in the form of a credit, the amount due to him from the Overall Estate.11 10', 'Further, an interpretation of the credit provision as referring only to Carolyn’s probate estate would render the provision meaningless, as Attorney Field stated in his memorandum of June 1, 2005 to the coexecutors and their counsel:', '“As the will leaves the entire residue of the probate estate (which', 'includes the proceeds of any sale of real estate) to a trust, there are', 'no adjustments or credits for shares or amounts due to any offeree', 'from the [probate] estate of Carolyn B. [Haffenreffer].” (Emphasis', 'added.) 11', 'Although the dissent proclaims that we have departed in this case from Rhode Island’s “long-standing” and “venerable” contract interpretation doctrines, that charge is without foundation. Conducting the requisite de novo review of the Superior Court’s summary judgment ruling, it became clear to us that the “pursuant to the terms of the Will” phrase in the Offer', '- 10 -', 'Even though what we have written thus far suffices to resolve the instant controversy, we believe it worthwhile to note that our interpretation of the credit provision as unambiguously allowing Karl to use as a credit his shares from Carolyn’s Overall Estate is entirely consistent with the intentions of the parties in preparing the Offer Document, as reflected in the copious extrinsic evidence in the record. This Court has long held that, in construing the terms of a contractual provision, our primary objective is to ascertain the intent of the parties. The Elena Carcieri Trust-1988 v. Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co. of Rhode Island, 871 A.2d 944, 947 (R.I. 2005). With respect to determining the intent of the parties, this Court in Hill v. M.S. Alper & Son, Inc., 106 R.I. 38, 256 A.2d 10 (1969) quite clearly summarized as follows certain basic principles:', '“In interpreting [an] instrument it is basic that the intention of the', 'parties must govern if that intention can be clearly inferred from its', 'terms and can be fairly carried out consistent with settled rules of', 'law. * * * In ascertaining what the intent is we must look at the', 'instrument as a whole and not at some detached portion thereof.', '* * * And, although there is no ambiguity, we will nonetheless', 'consider the situation of the parties and the accompanying', 'circumstances at the time the contract was entered into, not for the', 'purpose of modifying or enlarging or curtailing its terms, but to aid', 'in the interpretive process and to assist in determining its', 'meaning.” Id. at 47, 256 A.2d at 15 (emphasis added).', 'Accordingly, this Court may “consider extrinsic evidence where relevant to prove a meaning to which the language of the instrument is reasonably susceptible * * *.” Harrigan v. Document required us to look to the language of the will. An examination of the will immediately reveals that it contains a “pour-over” provision and that therefore Carolyn’s will and trust are inextricably linked. This is a complex analysis, but it is in no way unfaithful to this state’s long-standing and venerable doctrines governing contract interpretation.', '- 11 - Mason & Winograd, Inc., 121 R.I. 209, 213, 397 A.2d 514, 516 (1979);12 see also LPP Mortgage, Ltd. v.

Coordinated Health Partners, Inc., 852 A.2d 535, 542 (R.I. 2004). It is our judgment, however, that the parol evidence rule is inapplicable to the instant case, since the extrinsic evidence at issue is being used to provide insight into the parties’ intent at the time of the drafting of the credit provision, and not to modify or contradict its terms.

Haffenreffer” unambiguously refers to Carolyn’s Overall Estate, and not solely to her probate estate.16 We thus hold that summary judgment was improperly granted in favor of David on this issue. Rather, in our view, Karl was entitled to summary judgment.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we reverse and vacate the Superior Court’s grants of summary judgment in favor of David. We remand this case to the Superior Court.', 'Chief Justice Suttell did not participate.', 'Justice Indeglia took no part in the consideration or decision of this appeal. 15', 'We note that in his brief David states that “Karl’s Offer Response Form [accepting the offer to purchase three parcels] took David and Attorney Field by complete surprise.” At the time the Offer Document was created, they had expected him to purchase only one parcel, which was valued at $93,100—far lower than the $5,215,500 total purchase price for the three parcels Karl eventually opted to purchase. (Significantly, it is apparently undisputed that David and Attorney Field would have allowed Karl to use a credit from Carolyn’s Overall Estate for that lesser amount.) However, the inaccurate prediction by David and Attorney Field as to Karl’s potential future decisions does not affect our contractual analysis. 16', 'In view of the conclusion that we have reached as to the meaning of the credit provision, we need not (and therefore do not) reach the issue of contractual reformation, which was the subject of the second cross-motions for summary judgment.', '- 14 -', 'Justice Goldberg, dissenting.

I disagree with the legal conclusions reached by the majority, the marked departure from settled contract law, and the holding that the Superior Court’s grant of summary judgment should be vacated.

The hearing justice properly refused to engage in the interpretive acrobatics urged by Karl and that were adopted in the majority decision.', 'The hearing justice found that the controlling language of the so-called “credit provision” was clear and unambiguous and governed its consequences.', 'She then decided, correctly in my opinion, that it was incumbent upon her to enforce the agreement as written. In accordance with our well-settled law, the hearing justice, quoting 17A C.J.S. Contracts § 310 (1990), refused to attempt to ascertain “the actual mental process of the parties or their state of mind when the contract was executed,” nor resort to any extrinsic evidence—having found that both routes were unnecessary and impermissible. Significantly, the majority decision ignores the hearing justice’s conclusion that this distasteful agreement was clear and unambiguous. Instead, by examining both the will and the trust instruments, the majority reaches the conclusion that the term “Estate of Carolyn B. Haffenreffer” as set forth in the Offer Document, “unambiguously refers to Carolyn’s Overall Estate.” Further, the majority concludes that the phrase, “pursuant to the terms of the Will” means pursuant to the terms of the will and trust instrument―a result that is contrary to our well-established law and a marked departure from our precedent.', '- 15 -', 'In my opinion, the majority decision overlooks what really happened in this case as reflected in the issues and pleadings that were presented to the hearing justice. I particularly am concerned by the failure of the majority to decide the case based on the issues that were preserved, and not those that were not preserved. Is the agreement ambiguous or not? If it is ambiguous―a question of law for the Court―then summary judgment must be vacated and the case remanded for trial. If the agreement is not ambiguous, a conclusion that I have reached, then the judgment is affirmed. A holding that the agreement is not ambiguous, but does not mean what it says is confusing and foreign to our appellate jurisprudence. Consequently, I dissent.', 'The Facts', 'The decedent executed the will in 1995, and directed how her real and tangible property was to be distributed. She bequeathed her personal tangible property in equal shares to Karl, David, and David’s wife. She directed that her home in Providence be sold, and she gave David the option to receive three of her lots in Little Compton. The remaining real estate in Little Compton, consisting of six lots, was not devised to anyone; rather, the decedent directed that these lots be sold (but, in general, first offered to David, Karl, and her grandchildren). Although the will set forth specific instructions about how the sale was to be accomplished, the terms of the sale and the price were left to the coexecutors. Significantly, the will dictated that any offeree who accepts the offer shall make payment of the sale price to the executors within ninety days after the mailing of the offer. The majority decision overlooks this tight time frame in its examination of the remaining terms of the will.', 'The will also contained a provision specifying that the residue of the estate be poured over into a trust, which the decedent established in 1982, and amended numerous times; the final', '- 16 - amendment, the sixteenth, was amended on December 14, 1999, four years after the will.17 The will provided that the proceeds from the sale of the real property, after the expenses of administration, be paid into the trust and distributed in accordance with its terms. According to David, such a transfer in lieu of cash would leave the probate estate without sufficient cash to properly close the estate because, under the terms of the will, there are no liquid assets in the estate. The trust had a different, independent trustee (Fleet Bank) such that the probate estate and the trust estate were administered by separate fiduciaries. The record discloses and the hearing justice was advised that, according to David, the assets from the trust had already been distributed when the Offer Document was prepared and signed. Having been apprised of these permutations, the hearing justice refused to look to the extrinsic evidence.', 'After Carolyn’s death in 2003, the coexecutors, having been duly appointed and qualified, entered into an agreement with respect to the sale of the lots in Little Compton. The property was divided into four parcels, designated as (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv); appraisals were obtained and all three fiduciaries agreed upon the Offer Document. The Offer Document set forth precisely how payment was to be made:', '“Payment shall be made in the form of cash, certified check, bank', 'check or wire transfer, with or without financing, excepting', 'however, seller financing, in the full amount of the purchase price,', 'subject to customary adjustments and prorations as of the date of', 'transfer and subject to adjustment or credit for shares or amounts', 'due to such offeree from the Estate of Carolyn B.

According to the instrument, the sixteenth and final version amended the trust in its entirety.', '- 17 -', 'The record before this Court discloses that less than fifteen minutes before the deadline, Karl delivered his acceptance of the offer for three parcels, totaling $5,215,500.', 'Karl’s acceptance was unconditional.18', 'However, despite the provision in the Offer Document that expressly prohibited seller financing, and notwithstanding that there were no amounts currently due Karl under the will or the trust, Karl contended that he was entitled to use a “credit” to pay for all of parcel (iv) and some of parcel (i), and intended to pay for the remainder of parcel (i) and all of parcel (ii) by wire transfer.19 Although the Offer Document required that payment be made in cash, certified check, bank check, or wire transfer, Karl insisted that the money he eventually would receive from the trust could be applied as a credit by the estate. David disagreed with this contention and argues on appeal that this would have placed the estate in a position of having insufficient cash.', 'In addition, the will specifically set forth a strict closing schedule for the sale of this real estate—ninety days from offer to payment. A careful reading of the will and the Sixteenth Trust Amendment to the trust instrument—an exercise the hearing justice refused to allow—reveals that Karl wanted to apply a credit against an amount that he was not due under either instrument, but which would become due, in the future, after the probate estate was settled and the trust made its final payment. Before the Superior Court, Karl argued that the trust estate “owe[d]” Karl “value equal to one-third of its ‘available assets’” and that Karl was “simply taking his value in the form of real property.” (Emphases added.) According to Karl, the executors were 18', 'Carolyn’s grandson, David Haffenreffer, Jr., also returned a response indicating his desire to purchase parcel (i); Karl subsequently prevailed in a lottery as set forth in the will, and his acceptance was controlling. 19', 'David argues that Karl previously had expressed his intention to purchase parcel (ii) for $93,100 and, according to David, had no interest in purchasing parcels (i) and (iv).', '- 18 - free to distribute to the trust a promissory note, or other document, and Karl would then relinquish “an interest in his share of the [t]rust [e]state equal to the credit amount used to pay for [the] property.” The executors refused to do so, and the hearing justice also declined to engage in these scenarios.', 'The Proceedings Below', 'It is significant to me that in the Superior Court, neither party sought to have the hearing justice declare the contract to be ambiguous. It is undisputed that before the Superior Court, Karl argued that the contract was not ambiguous and that his interpretation was the only reasonable result. Although Karl argued that the contract was unambiguous, citing Paolella v. Radiologic Leasing Associates, 769 A.2d 596 (R.I. 2001), he nonetheless urged the hearing justice to look to extrinsic evidence “to aid in the interpretive process and to assist [the court] in determining the contract’s meaning”—an exercise the hearing justice deemed unnecessary and impermissible. In his memorandum to the hearing justice, Karl contended that the contract was not ambiguous because plaintiff’s interpretation was unreasonable as a matter of law and therefore “Karl’s [i]nterpretation is the one valid interpretation of the contracts that are before the court.” According to Karl, the contract “should be enforced according to the single, reasonable interpretation that gives meaning, life and effect to the [c]redit [p]rovision.” However, to reach “the single, reasonable interpretation” of the contract and give “meaning, life and effect to the [c]redit [p]rovision[,]” one must venture upon a journey that is foreign to our jurisprudence and extends far beyond the borders of our law.', 'The hearing justice refused to engage in the fact-finding that Karl advocated; she found the contract’s language to be clear and unambiguous and refused to resort to the analysis of extrinsic evidence. She correctly declared:', '- 19 -', '“As an initial matter, the Court finds Defendant’s urged', 'reading of the credit provision – so as to include the trust estate –', 'to be an unreasonable interpretation of the actual language', 'employed by the parties. The ‘credit provision’ clearly contains', 'the phrase ‘pursuant to the terms of the will.’ The decedent’s will', 'and trust are distinct creations, each possessing independent legal', 'significance. To accept Defendant’s contention would not only', 'require this Court to read an ambiguity in the agreement which, as', 'previously noted, does not exist, it also would compel the Court to', 'ignore the contractual language employed and essentially rewrite', 'the agreement. The Court declines to do either.”', 'Thus, the hearing justice gave effect to all of the provisions of the credit provision (including the prohibition against seller financing) and paid faithful allegiance to our pronouncements. In reversing her decision, the majority ignores most of the language in the Offer Document and rewrites the agreement in favor of Karl. In so doing, the majority declares that “it is our conclusion that the phrase ‘Estate of Carolyn B. Haffenreffer’ as used in the credit provision of the Offer Document unambiguously refers to Carolyn’s Overall Estate.” Thus, the term “estate” becomes “Overall Estate” and the remainder of the document, including the requirement that any credits must be due “pursuant to the terms of the Will” is ignored. According to the majority, because the will directs that the residue of the estate be transferred to the trust, the will and the trust “become inextricably linked” and are incorporated by reference into the credit provision and thus considered in the construction of the contract.

The plaintiff, Susan McNulty, appeals from the grant of summary judgment by the Superior Court in favor of the defendant, the City of Providence. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided.', 'After considering the written and oral submissions of the parties, we are of the opinion that the appeal may be resolved without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The plaintiff alleges that, on October 9, 2002, as she was walking on the sidewalk at the intersection of Weybosset Street and Claverick Street in Providence, she tripped and fell due to what she has described as “protrusions of conduit type material” that were allegedly jutting out of the concrete sidewalk.1 She further alleges that she suffered injuries as a result of that fall. 1', 'It is plaintiff’s surmise that the material over which she tripped was detritus left over from a prior construction project in the area where she fell.', '-1-', 'The plaintiff also alleges that, within a week of her fall, she contacted the City of Providence’s Department of the City Clerk in order to advise the city of the condition of the sidewalk and in order to notify the city of her intent to file a claim for injuries sustained as a result of what she called the city’s “negligence in failing to properly maintain the area where the incident occurred.” The plaintiff further alleges that she advised the clerk with whom she spoke in the City Clerk’s office of (1) the circumstances surrounding her fall; (2) her allegation that she had sustained injuries and incurred medical expenses as a result of the fall; and (3) her intent to file a claim against the city. She contends that the clerk informed her that the appropriate documentation and instructions as to how to complete the documentation would be sent to her. The plaintiff alleges that the clerk did not at any time advise her “that there were any time or other limitations required to file a claim with the City of Providence, other than completing the documentation * * *.”', 'The plaintiff thereafter received a letter, dated October 29, 2002, from City Clerk Michael Clement; enclosed with that letter was a document which Mr. Clement described as “a blank petition form to the City Council.”2 It is undisputed that neither the letter nor the enclosed petition form indicate that, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 45-15-9 and § 45-15-10, a person alleging 2', 'The body of the letter from City Clerk Michael Clement reads as follows:', '“Enclosed is a blank petition form to the City Council.', '“If it is your intention to file a claim against the City of', 'Providence for alleged injuries or damages, please complete in', 'detail and sign the enclosed.

In the instant case, plaintiff’s written notice was received by the city on April 4, 2003—nearly six months after the alleged October 9, 2002 incident.', 'The plaintiff contends that, based on (1) her conversation with the clerk with whom she spoke in the City Clerk’s office and (2) her understanding of the above-referenced letter and petition form, she believed that, if she submitted the petition form upon receipt thereof, it would be returned as incomplete due to the fact that she had yet to conclude her medical treatment and was therefore unable to provide her complete medical bills and records. She alleges that she relied on what she characterizes as “the limited and incomplete information” provided to her by the city with respect to what was necessary in order to seek recovery from the city; she contends that the city should have advised her of the statutorily imposed requirement that written notice be given to the city within sixty days of the alleged injury.', 'On November 6, 2003, plaintiff filed a complaint in the Providence County Superior Court, alleging that the city had a duty to maintain the sidewalk at issue in a “reasonably safe and secure condition” and a “duty to warn those reasonably expected upon the property * * * of any unsafe or dangerous conditions.” She further alleged that, as a proximate result of the city’s negligent failure to fulfill its duties, she suffered injuries and damages.3', 'On June 14, 2004, the city filed a motion for summary judgment. On September 28, 2004, a hearing was held before a justice of the Superior Court with respect to that motion. After 3', 'The plaintiff also included in her Superior Court complaint allegations against “John Doe Corporation,” which she alleged “maintained [the] premises, or were [sic] otherwise legally responsible for conditions existing at on or about” the area where her injury occurred. The present appeal pertains only to plaintiff’s allegations concerning the City of Providence and has no bearing on plaintiff’s claim against “John Doe Corporation.”', '-3- considering the written and oral submissions of the parties, the motion justice granted the city’s motion for summary judgment. In ruling on the motion, the motion justice stated that it is “undisputed that the claim was not timely filed in writing, as required under the statute * * *.” See § 45-15-9; 45-15-10. As for plaintiff’s argument in opposition to the motion for summary judgment to the effect that the doctrine of equitable estoppel was applicable and would allow her claim to proceed in spite of its untimeliness, the motion justice noted that the elements necessary to establish equitable estoppel were not present in this case. The motion justice found that the city had not made any affirmative representations and that there was no evidence of any “intentionally induced prejudicial reliance.”', 'Thereafter, on February 3, 2005, the motion justice caused partial final judgment to be entered in favor of the city pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.

In our judgment the city was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.', 'This Court has previously applied the straightforward statutory language applicable to this case, stating that, “pursuant to § 45-15-9, a person injured on a highway or bridge shall give notice to the [city or] town within sixty days of the injury in order to afford the [city or] town with an opportunity to make just and due satisfaction before the commencement of litigation.” Moseley v. Fitzgerald, 773 A.2d 254, 258 (R.I. 2001).4 We have repeatedly stated that the notice requirement set forth in § 45-15-9 “must be strictly obeyed;” and we have further stated that “the notice requirement is a condition precedent to the plaintiff’s right of action * * *.” Moseley, 773 A.2d at 258 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Morales v.

It is undisputed that plaintiff failed to provide notice to the city within the statutorily required sixty days; we therefore conclude that the motion justice’s grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant was proper. See Moseley, 773 A.2d at 259 (stating that the “plaintiffs’ failure to satisfy the statutory condition precedent of serving notice of the injury upon the city [was] fatal to their claim”); Mercado v. City of Providence, 770 A.2d 445, 447-48 (R.I. 2001) (stating that 4', 'Although G.L. 1956 § 45-15-9 speaks of giving notice to “the town,” this Court has consistently understood that term in this statute as referring to cities as well as towns.

Fitzgerald, 773 A.2d 254, 258 (R.I. 2001).', '-5- the plaintiff’s failure to provide the city with notice within the sixty days pursuant to § 45-15-9 was “fatal to his claim,” and therefore summary judgment against plaintiff was affirmed); Provost v. Finlay, 768 A.2d 1256, 1258-59 (R.I. 2001) (stating that the plaintiff’s claim against the town was properly dismissed because the plaintiff failed to give notice in a timely manner).', 'The plaintiff further argues, however, that in spite of her failure to have given timely notice, she should be permitted to pursue her claim because the city should be equitably estopped from raising the statutory notice provision as a defense. She contends that the city, “by and through its duly authorized representative, affirmatively misled [her] as to the proper course of action necessary to properly file a claim with the [c]ity * * *.” She further contends that neither the representative of the city (i.e., the clerk in the City Clerk’s office with whom plaintiff spoke) nor the documents provided to her informed her of “any time or other limitations” relative to filing a claim. She accordingly alleges that she relied on what she describes as “limited and incomplete information,” and she asserts that she was misled into not filing a petition in a timely manner.', 'For there to be a successful invocation of the doctrine of equitable estoppel, this Court has stated that the following elements must be present:', '“first, an affirmative representation or equivalent conduct on the', 'part of the person against whom the estoppel is claimed which is', 'directed to another for the purpose of inducing the other to act or', 'fail to act in reliance thereon; and secondly, [proof] that such', 'representation or conduct in fact did induce the other to act or fail', 'to act to his [or her] injury.” Providence Teachers Union v.', 'Providence School Board, 689 A.2d 388, 391-92 (R.I. 1997)', '(quoting Lichtenstein v.

See Providence Teachers Union, 689 A.2d at 391-92. It is uncontested that there were no explicit instructions or directives made on behalf of the city as to the time within which the plaintiff would have to file a claim; it follows that there were no affirmative representations upon which the plaintiff could have detrimentally relied.6 Therefore, in view of the facts of this case and this Court’s settled precedent, we perceive no basis for applying the doctrine of equitable estoppel so as to allow the plaintiff to proceed with her time-barred claim against the city.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the Superior Court’s grant of summary judgment. The record may be remanded to that tribunal.', 'Justice Indeglia took no part in the consideration or decision of this appeal. 6', 'Although we decline to hold that a municipality has a duty in a situation such as the one at bar, we by no means wish to dissuade municipalities from providing would-be claimants with information concerning the rigorous temporal requirements that are set forth in § 45-15-9.

30,Robert Buttie : v. : Norfolk & Dedham Mutual Fire Insurance Co. : et al.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. This case comes before us on a writ of certiorari seeking review of a Superior Court order confirming an arbitration award. In his decision, the arbitrator awarded damages for personal injuries suffered by the plaintiff, Robert Buttie, and the defendants, Raymond and Joan Cataldo, in an automobile accident.', 'The arbitrator also apportioned the damages between two insurance carriers that provided uninsured/underinsured motorist (UM) coverage to one or more of the parties. For the reasons hereinafter set forth, we vacate the order of the Superior Court confirming the arbitrator’s award.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On August 12, 1996, a motor vehicle owned by Mr. Buttie, in which he and the Cataldos were passengers, was involved in a collision with an underinsured motorist.', 'After the tortfeasor’s liability insurance was exhausted, plaintiff and the Cataldos sought UM benefits from plaintiff’s insurance carrier, and the Cataldos also sought UM benefits under a policy issued to Raymond Cataldo.', 'The plaintiff’s vehicle was insured by defendant Norfolk &', '-1- Dedham Mutual Fire Insurance Company (Norfolk) with UM coverage up to $300,000. 1 Raymond Cataldo’s policy was with defendant Travelers Insurance Company (Travelers), and he had UM coverage up to $100,000. The parties entered into binding arbitration in order to determine the amount of UM benefits to which each was entitled.', 'The arbitrator concluded that the $400,000 in available coverage was insufficient to cover the parties’ total damages.', 'According to the arbitrator, Mr. Buttie sustained $300,000 in damages, Raymond Cataldo sustained $90,000, and Joan Cataldo sustained $65,000.', 'The arbitrator added interest from the date of the accident through the date each individual received payment from the tortfeasor, then subtracted the amount received from the tortfeasor, and finally added additional interest through the date of the arbitration hearing. The arbitrator ultimately found $463,420 in damages for plaintiff, $93,272 in damages for Raymond Cataldo, and $80,146 in damages for Joan Cataldo, for a total of $636,838 among the parties.', 'The plaintiff does not dispute the arbitrator’s findings concerning damages, but contends that the arbitrator erred in the manner in which he apportioned the insurance proceeds. The arbitrator allocated the proceeds such that the Cataldos were given priority under the Norfolk policy. It is undisputed that plaintiff was not covered by the Travelers policy.', 'The Norfolk and Travelers policies both contain nearly identical “other insurance” clauses which read, in pertinent part, as follows:', '“If there is other applicable * * * insurance we will pay only our', 'share of the loss. Our share is the proportion that our limit of', 'liability bears to the total of all applicable limits. However, any', 'insurance we provide with respect to a vehicle you do not own', 'shall be excess over any other collectable auto insurance * * *.” 1', 'Norfolk was discharged from the case upon depositing its policy limits with the Registry of the Court.', '-2- In interpreting the clause, the arbitrator substituted the name of each policy owner in place of the word “you” in the last sentence of each provision. Read in this manner, the arbitrator determined that the clauses had different meanings and that the Travelers policy called for the Norfolk policy to be primary. Consequently, the arbitrator determined that the clauses were in conflict and that, therefore, the proceeds from each should be distributed pro rata, based upon his interpretation of this Court’s precedent, citing Hindson v. Allstate Insurance Co., 694 A.2d 682 (R.I. 1997), Brown v. Travelers Insurance Co., 610 A.2d 127 (R.I. 1992) and Ferreira v. Mello, 811 A.2d 1175 (R.I. 2002).', 'The arbitrator found that, because Norfolk’s coverage accounted for $300,000 of the $400,000 in available coverage, Norfolk should be responsible for 75 percent of the parties’ claims ($300,000/$400,000), and that Travelers should be responsible for 25 percent of the Cataldos’ claims ($100,000/$400,000). He first awarded the Cataldos the full amount of their damages, giving Raymond Cataldo $69,954 from the Norfolk policy and $23,318 from the Travelers policy, and Joan Cataldo $60,109 from Norfolk and $20,037 from Travelers. The arbitrator then awarded plaintiff the remaining amount under the Norfolk policy—$169,937, or approximately 37 percent of his total damages.', 'Mr. Buttie filed a motion in Superior Court on February 27, 2006, seeking to vacate, modify, or correct the arbitrator’s award. The Cataldos filed an answer on March 24, 2006, in which they requested that the arbitration award be affirmed. Travelers also answered and opposed plaintiff’s motion on March 6, 2006. A hearing on the motion was held on April 27, 2006, and the hearing justice thereafter entered an order confirming the arbitration award.', 'The plaintiff originally filed a notice of appeal on May 2, 2006, but that appeal was dismissed on procedural grounds on November 14, 2006. He then appealed from the dismissal', '-3- of his appeal. This Court denied that second appeal “without prejudice, so as to allow the plaintiff to file for a writ of certiorari to review the substantive issues raised in the original appeal from the denial of the motion to vacate the arbitrator’s award.” Thereafter, on December 7, 2007, plaintiff filed a petition for writ of certiorari, which was granted by this Court on January 17, 2008.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'In this jurisdiction, the authority of the Courts “to review an arbitral award is statutorily prescribed and is limited in nature.” North Providence School Committee v. North Providence Federation of Teachers, Local 920, American Federation of Teachers, 945 A.2d 339, 344 (R.I. 2008). “[J]udicial reversal of an arbitrator’s award solely on the ground of a reviewing court’s disagreement with [the arbitrator’s] construction of the contract is prohibited.” Council 94, American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees AFL-CIO v. State, 475 A.2d 200, 203 (R.I. 1984).', 'An arbitration award may be overturned, however, if the arbitrator manifestly disregarded the law or if the award was irrational. Aponik v. Lauricella, 844 A.2d 698, 703 (R.I. 2004) (citing Purvis Systems, Inc. v. American Systems Corp., 788 A.2d 1112, 1115 (R.I. 2002)). Further, while an arbitrator’s mistake of law is not, of itself, grounds to vacate an award, Pier House Inn, Inc. v. 421 Corp., 812 A.2d 799, 803 (R.I. 2002), this Court is obligated by law to “make such orders * * * as the rights of the parties and the ends of justice require.” G.L. 1956 § 10-3-19.', '-4-', 'III', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Writ of Certiorari', 'As a preliminary matter, Travelers argues that certiorari should not have been granted in this case. Travelers maintains that plaintiff lost his right to appeal because he failed to comply with procedural rules, and that there were no extraordinary circumstances justifying issuance of the writ. Specifically, Travelers asserts that plaintiff did not follow the correct procedure to order a transcript on appeal and compounded his negligence by failing to file a motion to extend the time for transmitting the record.', 'Travelers asserts that certiorari is generally unavailable when a party has had an adequate opportunity to seek appellate review and no extraordinary circumstances exist justifying issuance of the writ. Travelers claims that plaintiff has never given any valid reason for his failure to properly perfect his appeal. Travelers does not assert, however, that certiorari could never be available under its account of plaintiff’s alleged procedural errors.', 'In support of its argument, Travelers cites a case in which a notice of appeal was not timely filed. However, “a litigant will not be deprived, ipso facto, of his appellate remedy because of his failure to comply with some of the procedures required by the rules once the claim of appeal has been timely filed.” Martin v. Estrella, 107 R.I. 247, 251, 266 A.2d 41, 45 (1970) (decided under the substantially similar former Rule 73 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure). Article I, Rule 3(a) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure describes how a party shall take an appeal and further provides that “[f]ailure of an appellant to take any step other than the timely filing of a notice of appeal or payment of a filing fee * * * does not', '-5- affect the validity of the appeal, but is ground only for such action as the Supreme Court or trial court deems appropriate, which may include dismissal of the appeal.” (Emphasis added.) Thus, although Travelers asserts that certiorari is generally unavailable under similar circumstances, it was clearly within this Court’s discretion to grant the petition for a writ of certiorari to review the issues raised in plaintiff’s original appeal.', 'B', 'Denial of Plaintiff’s Motion to Vacate the Arbitration Award', '1', 'The Norfolk Policy', 'The plaintiff argues that it was “manifestly erroneous and plainly irrational” for the arbitrator to give the Cataldos priority in distributing the coverage available under the Norfolk policy. We find merit in his contention and conclude that it was indeed irrational for the arbitrator to have given the Cataldos preferential treatment under a policy that Mr. Buttie owned and for which Mr. Buttie paid the premiums.', 'It bears repeating that Mr. Buttie was not the tortfeasor, but was merely a passenger in a vehicle that he himself paid to insure.', 'Underinsured-motorist coverage is, by definition, “[i]nsurance that pays for losses caused by a driver who negligently damages the insured but does not have enough liability insurance to cover the damages.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1561 (8th ed. 2004) (emphasis added). Although it is true that the Cataldos also were insured parties under the terms of the Norfolk policy because they were passengers in Mr. Buttie’s vehicle, even the Cataldos acknowledge that they had no greater right to the Norfolk coverage than Mr. Buttie.', 'This Court previously has held that an arbitrator’s decision may be overturned if the decision, in essence, rewrites a contract. See Town of Coventry v. Turco, 574 A.2d 143, 147', '-6- (R.I. 1990). This is because while “public policy favors the final resolution of disputes * * * by arbitration, this policy relies on the premise that arbitrators act within their power and authority.” Id. We have stated specifically that, although arbitrators have “the power and the authority to interpret [a] contract * * * they [do] not have the power and authority to rewrite it.” Id. With respect to the Norfolk policy at issue in the case at bar, no provision expressly dictates that the Cataldos should have been given priority over the owner of the policy, Mr. Buttie. Thus, by giving the Cataldos priority, the arbitrator essentially rewrote the Norfolk contract to the detriment of the policyholder. We deem it irrational to subordinate the rights of the named insured under the policy to those of the other occupants of the automobile.', 'Logic and fairness dictate that when multiple individuals suffer damages and those individuals have equal rights under a policy that does not provide sufficient coverage, a pro rata distribution should be accomplished in proportion to each claimant’s relative damages. See 70 A.L.R.2d 416, 417, § 2[a] (1960); see also 12 Couch on Insurance § 171:17 (3d ed. 2005). As the Cataldos acknowledge, the arbitrator could have allocated the proceeds in this manner, and doing so would have been appropriate. 2 Such a pro rata allocation of the Norfolk policy would result in the following distribution: plaintiff, who sustained $463,420, or approximately 73 percent of the total damages incurred by all three parties, would be entitled to $219,000 of the proceeds of the Norfolk policy (73 percent of $300,000). Raymond Cataldo, who sustained $93,272, or roughly 15 percent of the total damages, would be entitled to $45,000 of the proceeds of the Norfolk policy (15 percent of $300,000). Joan Cataldo, who sustained $80,146, 2', 'The Cataldos argue, however, that the issue of an alternative pro-rata distribution is waived because plaintiff did not demand the proper method of distribution below. The plaintiff, however, points to the irrationality of an obviously inequitable result and claims generally that the distribution of the proceeds was improper. The fact that he did not present the exact equation that would create an equitable result is of no moment.', '-7- or close to 12 percent of the total damages, would be entitled to $36,000 of the proceeds of the Norfolk policy (12 percent of $300,000). This allocation is not only rational, but fair, and we direct this distribution upon remand pursuant to our “authority to make such orders ‘as the rights of the parties and the ends of justice require.’” Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Co. v. Barry, 892 A.2d 915, 918 (R.I. 2006) (quoting § 10-3-19).', '2', 'The Travelers Policy', 'Travelers also contends that, even if this Court determines that plaintiff is entitled to an additional recovery from Norfolk, the portion of the award concerning Travelers’ liability to the Cataldos must not be disturbed. Travelers reasons that plaintiff has not sought, and may not seek, to enforce any rights the Cataldos may have under the Travelers policy. Although it is true that plaintiff is not an insured under the Cataldos’ policy with Travelers, we find no merit in the argument that plaintiff may not challenge the arbitrator’s award in its entirety. Our grant of a writ of certiorari has brought the enforcement of the arbitrator’s entire award under review, and the arbitrator’s decision ought to be considered in light of the total economic consequences of that decision. The money awarded to the Cataldos has a direct bearing on the amount of money available to plaintiff. Mr. Buttie has clearly alleged that the arbitrator’s apportionment of liability between Norfolk and Travelers caused him injury in fact, the gravamen of standing. See Bowen v. Mollis, 945 A.2d 314, 317 (R.I. 2008). Further, it is our opinion that the arbitrator’s irrationality in distributing the Norfolk policy infected the entire award. We conclude, therefore, that the portion of the arbitrator’s award concerning the Cataldos’ recovery under the Travelers policy is also properly under review.', '-8-', 'The Cataldos argue that if we determine Mr. Buttie is entitled to additional sums from the Norfolk policy, the portion of the award involving Travelers’ liability to the Cataldos also must be altered “as the rights of the parties and the ends of justice require.” Section 10-3-19. As to the $100,000 in coverage that is available only to the Cataldos, the arbitrator determined that Travelers should pay 25 percent of both Raymond and Joan’s damages.', 'In other words, Raymond Cataldo, who sustained $93,272 in damages, would be entitled to $23,318 from Travelers (or 25 percent of $93,272). Likewise, Joan Cataldo would receive $20,037 from Travelers (or approximately 25 percent of $80,146). We find that the arbitrator’s conclusion in this regard leads to a plainly unjust result.', 'After receiving the proper portion of the coverage available under the Norfolk policy, the uncompensated portion of the Cataldos’ combined claims totals $92,418.3', 'The Cataldos, however, would receive a total of only $43,354.50 of their $100,000 policy limits if we were to uphold the arbitrator’s decision. This would result in a $49,063.50 windfall for Travelers ($92,418 minus $43,354.50), while the Cataldos would be uncompensated for the majority of their injuries.', 'Further, there is nothing in the “other insurance” clauses, upon which the arbitrator relied, to suggest that Travelers should not be liable for the full amount of their insureds’ damages. The clauses state that if there is other applicable similar insurance (in this case the Norfolk policy), each insurance company will pay only their share of the loss, which is the proportion that their “limit of liability bears to the total of all applicable limits” (in Travelers’ case, 25%). This language obviously contemplates a situation in which the relevant party or parties are covered by two policies. This case, however, is complicated by the fact that only the Cataldos are covered 3', 'These figures will need to be adjusted to reflect additional interest that has accrued since the date of the arbitrator’s award.', '-9- by both policies—Mr. Buttie was covered by the Norfolk policy only. If all of the relevant parties had been covered by both policies, the arbitrator’s basic premise of a pro rata distribution would have been just. However, under the facts of this case, the arbitrator’s determination creates an inequitable result and a windfall for Travelers because Travelers did not provide coverage to Mr. Buttie.', 'Additionally, the “other insurance” clauses go on to state that any insurance provided with respect to a vehicle not owned by the insured “shall be excess over any other collectable insurance.” (Emphasis added.) Because the Cataldos cannot collect the full amount of their damages from Norfolk, they are entitled to recover the remainder of their damages from their own insurance company. A windfall for Travelers would be unjust because the Cataldos paid premiums for $100,000 of UM coverage with the expectation that they would be compensated to the extent of their damages within or up to the policy limits if they were injured by an underinsured motorist.', 'Given that the Cataldos’ uncompensated damages do not exceed their available coverage, it is in the interests of justice that the Cataldos be able to recover the full amount of their damages. Raymond Cataldo, who sustained $93,272 in damages, but who should be paid only $45,000 under the Norfolk policy, is entitled to the remainder of his damages under the Travelers policy, or $48,272. Joan Cataldo, who sustained $80,146 in damages, but who is to be paid only $36,000 under the Norfolk policy, is entitled to the remainder of her damages under the Travelers’ policy: $44,146.', 'As we have vacated the arbitrator’s award, § 10-3-19 clearly provides that we shall “make such orders * * * as the rights of the parties and the ends of justice require.” Accordingly, we direct the Superior Court to enter an order consistent herewith.', '- 10 -', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'In order to avoid an irrational result, the plaintiff and the Cataldos must share the proceeds from the Norfolk policy in proportion to the monetary value of their damages. Further, justice requires that Travelers pay the remainder of their insureds’ damages. We remand the papers in the case to the Superior Court for proceedings consistent herewith.', 'Justice Indeglia took no part in the consideration or decision of this petition.', 'Flaherty, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part.', 'I concur in the majority’s holding with respect to the issuance of the writ of certiorari. However, I most respectfully, but nonetheless vigorously, dissent from the majority opinion that the arbitrator’s decision should be vacated.', 'As the majority correctly has set forth, our review of an arbitrator’s decision is extremely limited; it is certainly among the most stringent standards of review employed by judicial bodies. The majority aptly has said, “the authority of the Courts ‘to review an arbitral award is statutorily prescribed and is limited in nature.’ North Providence School Committee v. North Providence Federation of Teachers, Local 920, American Federation of Teachers, 945 A.2d 339, 344 (R.I. 2008).” Therefore, we will not vacate an arbitrator’s award “[a]bsent a manifest disregard of a contractual provision or a completely irrational result.” City of East Providence v. United Steelworkers of America, Local 15509, 925 A.2d 246, 252 (R.I. 2007) (quoting State Department of Corrections v. Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional Officers, 867 A.2d 823, 828 (R.I. 2005)).', '- 11 -', 'I have examined the arbitrator’s award and note that this very well respected and experienced arbitrator was faced with a complex and difficult situation in which the damages of the injured parties exceeded the available coverage limits of all the applicable policies, with the added complication that one of the policies covered only two, but not all three, of the occupants of the Buttie vehicle. In his effort to work his way to a just award, the arbitrator was confronted with “uninsured motorist” and “other insurance” provisions in the policies that differed from each other. He also evaluated and construed this Court’s decisions in Hindson v. Allstate Insurance Co., 694 A.2d 682 (R.I. 1997); Brown v. Travelers Insurance Co., 610 A.2d 127 (R.I. 1992), and Ferreira v. Mello, 811 A.2d 1175 (R.I. 2002). In the end, the arbitrator issued an award that he believed to be fair, in keeping with the applicable language in the two policies involved, and consistent with this Court’s prior holdings. In my opinion, under no circumstances can the arbitrator’s award be considered “completely irrational.”', 'The majority also faults the arbitrator for rewriting Buttie’s policy with Norfolk. I agree with the majority that although the arbitrator “had the power and the authority to interpret the contract, giving due regard to each provision,” he “did not have the power and authority to rewrite it.” Town of Coventry v. Turco, 574 A.2d 143, 147 (R.I. 1990). However, without saying how the policy was “rewritten,” the majority merely states that his doing so is further evidence of irrationality. The majority opinion states, “no provision [of the Norfolk policy] expressly dictates that the Cataldos should have been given priority over the owner of the policy.” However, in my opinion, the arbitrator did not rewrite the contract language, but rather did the best he could to walk a judicial high-wire and construe the typically dense language of two competing insurance policies. See Town of Coventry, 574 A.2d at 148-49, 149 (Kelleher, J.,', '- 12 - dissenting) (remarking that there was “no specific directive in the agreement concerning the particular issue at bar” and, therefore, “that which is not written cannot be rewritten”).', 'When setting forth the standard of review in this case, the majority properly cites the case of Council 94, American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees AFL-CIO v. State, 475 A.2d 200, 203 (R.I. 1984), for the proposition that “judicial reversal of an arbitrator’s award solely on the ground of a reviewing court’s disagreement with [the arbitrator’s] construction of the contract is prohibited.” But, with enormous respect for my learned and conscientious colleagues in the majority, I believe that this is precisely what they have done. The majority opines, “We find that the arbitrator’s conclusion in this regard leads to a plainly unjust result.” It then substitutes the arbitrator’s award with an award of its own, which it deems to be more fair. The difficulty with this approach, of course, is that fairness, or lack of it, is not the standard of review to be applied in this case.', 'Arbitration is a contractual process in which the parties agree to remove themselves from judicial determination and instead present their cases to an impartial finder of fact and law of their own choosing. See North Providence School Committee, 945 A.2d at 347 (“We review arbitral awards under an exceptionally deferential standard as a means of ensuring that parties may benefit from arbitration as a relatively informal and expedient alternative to litigation in the court system.”). The awards that flow from this process cannot be reversed for errors of fact or law and should only be disturbed in the narrowest of circumstances. Aponik v. Lauricella, 844 A.2d 698, 703 (R.I. 2004) (“[T]he role of the judiciary in the arbitration process is ‘extremely limited.’”) (quoting Purvis Systems, Inc. v. American Systems Corp., 788 A.2d 1112, 1114 (R.I. 2002)); Romano v. Allstate Insurance Co., 458 A.2d 339, 341-42 (R.I. 1983) (“arbitrators are free to determine the facts before them without having their award become subject to judicial', '- 13 - revision”); Jacinto v. Egan, 120 R.I. 907, 911, 391 A.2d 1173, 1175 (1978) (“The fact that the arbitrator misconstrued the contract or the law is no ground for striking down his award.”). We may or may not agree about how the arbitrator, who, after all, was selected by the parties, performed his duties in this case. But, in my view, his decision should not be vacated because there simply is no justification to do so under G.L. 1956 § 10-3-12; the award is not irrational nor is it occasioned by a manifest disregard of the law on behalf of the arbitrator. See Pier House Inn, Inc. v. 421 Corp., 812 A.2d 799, 802 (R.I. 2002).

The plaintiff, Grazina Kulawas (Kulawas or plaintiff), appeals from a Superior Court grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant, Rhode Island Hospital (hospital or defendant). Kulawas argues on appeal that the hearing justice erred in holding that the release 1 Kulawas entered into in connection with a workers’ compensation claim against her employer barred any subsequent civil action against the employer arising from the same incident. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'Kulawas had been employed as an administrative secretary in the Department of Medicine at the hospital since 1998. On April 5, 2005, while walking down a ramped corridor on her way to lunch in the hospital cafeteria, plaintiff “missed a step” and was propelled forward. She fractured her right femur in the resulting fall. 1', 'See Appendix A for the release.', '-1-', 'On September 8, 2005, plaintiff filed a petition in the Workers’ Compensation Court (WCC) against the hospital, seeking medical and weekly indemnity benefits for the work-related injury. The defendant denied liability, and Kulawas demanded a trial, which commenced on January 9, 2006. However, on March 2, 2006, while the decision was pending, the parties agreed to settle the claim for $48,000. A settlement proposal was submitted to the WCC trial judge based on G.L. 1956 § 28-33-25.1 entitled “Settlement of disputed cases;” 2 a procedure that commonly is known as a “deny and dismiss.”', 'In exchange for the payment of $48,000, Kulawas executed a document entitled “Workers’ Compensation Release” (release), in which she acknowledged that there was a bona fide dispute between the parties concerning whether she was entitled to workers’ compensation benefits for the claimed injury under the Workers’ Compensation Act (act).

In accordance with the statute, the decree provided that the claimed injury “did not occur in the course of [Kulawas’s] employment” and that the payment received “shall not be deemed to be the payment of compensation benefits, but shall be considered a compromise payment of a disputed claim.” The workers’ compensation action thereupon was concluded.', 'Nonetheless, on July 30, 2007, Kulawas filed suit in Providence Superior Court, alleging that her injury was the result of the hospital’s negligent failure to maintain the corridor in a reasonably safe condition and its failure to warn of a dangerous condition. 3 3', 'Kulawas’s husband joined in the suit, asserting that he suffered loss of care and companionship because of her injuries.

According to plaintiff, because the parties agreed that the injury was not work-related, it was not covered by the act, and, therefore, the exclusivity provision set forth in § 28-29-20 does not apply.', 'The plaintiff’s contentions largely rest on the language of the release and the decree; she argues that, although § 28-33-25.1 specifically provides that: “[u]pon payment, the employer and insurer shall be entitled to a duly executed release that fully and finally absolves and discharges the employer and insurer from any and all liability arising out of the claimed injury[,]” the parties in this case agreed to a release that provided defendant with less than that to which it was entitled.', 'The Exclusivity Provision', 'We begin by noting that chapter 33 of title 28, including § 28-33-25.1, the provision that provides for a compromise settlement of a disputed claim, falls squarely within the act’s exclusivity provision.

Id. at 379-80. Farr was driving a vehicle owned by her employer and insured by Aetna. Id. Aetna also was the employer’s workers’ compensation carrier under a separate insurance policy. Id. at 380. Farr’s claim for workers’ compensation benefits, defended by Aetna, was settled, and the parties executed a release that specifically referred to Farr’s workers’ compensation claim, but not her uninsured motorist claim. Id. at 380-81. Farr subsequently sought uninsured motorist benefits under the Aetna automobile policy, by filing a claim for arbitration. Id. at 380. Aetna filed a complaint for declaratory judgment, alleging that by executing a release in connection with her workers’ compensation claim, Farr forfeited all causes of action resulting from the collision. 6 Id.

In Manzi, summary judgment was entered with respect to the plaintiff’s tort claim against his employer, the State of Rhode Island, based on a workers’ compensation settlement in accordance with § 28-33- 25.1. Manzi, 687 A.2d at 462. The Superior Court hearing justice and this Court on appeal concluded that Manzi’s tort claims were barred because of the release executed in the WCC and the exclusivity provision of the act. Id. Significantly, in Manzi, the plaintiff argued that because the settlement he reached with his employer was a compromise payment of a disputed claim “and not payment of workers’ compensation benefits,” he could proceed with his civil action. Id. (emphasis added). This Court held that the clear and unambiguous language of § 28-33-25.1 specifies that “the employer and insurer shall be entitled to a duly executed release which fully and finally absolves and discharges the employer and insurer from any and all liability arising out of the claimed injury,” such that “Manzi discharged defendants from any liability when he signed the release pursuant to § 28-33-25.1.” Manzi, 687 A.2d at 462 (emphasis added).', 'Moreover, in Manzi, 687 A.2d at 462, the employer argued that the plaintiff was barred from pursuing a tort claim based on § 28-29-20, the exclusivity provision.

Our decision in Manzi did not rest on the breadth of the release or on its language. Indeed, Manzi submitted an affidavit from the state’s lawyer, that the parties agreed that the settlement “‘in no way barred’ plaintiff from filing a civil action against the state.” Manzi, 687 A.2d at 462. Although we cannot envision a more explicit waiver of liability on the part of an employer, this evidence equally was unavailing. We held that the exclusivity provision of the act “bars a plaintiff from filing a second cause of action on the basis of a different legal theory in circumstances in which a plaintiff seeks recovery for the same injuries on which his or her workers’ compensation claim was based.” Id. We are satisfied that our holding in Manzi determines the issues before us in this case.', 'The plaintiff also points to the decree entered in the WCC specifying that the claimed injury did not occur in the course of her employment with respondent. The plaintiff argues that, when examined in light of the language in the release stating that it “is specific to the claim that the injury is work-related and does not bar possible nonwork-related claims,” it becomes apparent that the resolution of plaintiff’s workers compensation claim expressly was based on preserving claims that were not work- related. Kulawas argues that, although she is precluded from seeking any additional sums in the WCC, she is free to seek payment for “possible nonwork-related claims” because these claims were preserved. We reject this contention and decline to engage in', '- 11 - a syllogistic exercise. We are satisfied that if the Legislature intended to exclude a settlement based on a carefully worded release from the provisions of the exclusivity provision of the act, it would have done so in clear and definite language.', 'The state’s workers’ compensation system “was established to provide expeditious relief to injured workers under a no-fault system of benefits replacing a cumbersome and often lengthy tort system.” Kaya v.

In creating this statutory compensation scheme, the Legislature clearly intended that this system of benefits serve “as the exclusive remedy available to injured workers, completely replacing all other remedies then available.” Id. Based on these venerable principles and because we fully are satisfied that the exclusivity provision of the act precludes a subsequent negligence suit against plaintiff’s employer, we agree with the hearing justice that plaintiff’s day in court has come and gone.', 'Waiver of Common Law Rights', 'The plaintiff contends that, notwithstanding her failure to preserve her common law rights in accordance with §§ 28-29-17 and 28-29-20, she may pursue a tort action against her employer. This argument, again, rests on Kulawas’s contention that she “has not accepted workers’ compensation benefits for a work-related injury” and, therefore, preservation of her common law rights in accordance with § 28-29-17 was unnecessary. We disagree.

I respectfully dissent from the holding of the majority and am of the opinion that summary judgment was improperly granted in this case. Although I share in my colleagues’ admiration of the “venerable principles” of this state’s workers’ compensation system, it is my opinion that employers and insurers are free to negotiate for less than that to which they are entitled under G.L. 1956 § 28-33- 25.1. See 2 John P. Ludington et al., Modern Workers Compensation § 204:16 at 27 (1993) (“A common question is whether a settlement of a tort claim releases a workers’ compensation claim, or whether the settlement of a workers’ compensation claim releases a tort claim.”). Counsel for Rhode Island Hospital conceded as much at oral argument. However, the majority forecloses this possibility by interpreting the exclusivity and immunity provisions of the Workers’ Compensation Act (the act) to apply in all instances in which there is a settlement under § 28-33-25.1. I agree that, at first blush, it would appear that those provisions of the act might bar plaintiff’s premises-liability claim. In my opinion, however, that is not a correct analysis because of the act’s definition of the term “injury” and because construing § 28-33-25.1 as foreclosing the ability of the parties to negotiate for less than a full and final release of all liability collides with the well- established canon of statutory interpretation that requires us to give meaning to every sentence in a statute. See Local 400, International Federation of Technical and Professional Engineers v. Rhode Island State Labor Relations Board, 747 A.2d 1002, 1005 (R.I. 2000) (“[W]e are mindful that ‘[t]his [C]ourt has long applied a canon of statutory interpretation which gives effect to all of a statute’s provisions, with no sentence, clause or word construed as unmeaning or surplusage.’”) (quoting Rhode Island', '- 15 - Department of Mental Health, Retardation, and Hospitals v. R.B., 549 A.2d 1028, 1030 (R.I. 1988)).', 'The Exclusivity Clause and Waiver of Common-Law Rights', 'It has not been established that plaintiff suffered an injury, as that term is defined in the act, to trigger the act’s exclusivity provision. See Hawkes v. Commercial Union Insurance Co., 764 A.2d 258, 261-62, 265 (Me. 2001) (holding that the tort claims of an employee who released any and all claims under Maine’s workers’ compensation act were not barred, in part “because the personal injury claims * * * did not arise in the course of his employment,” thus rendering the immunity and exclusivity provisions inapplicable). The exclusivity provision of the act provides that “the remedy for an injury * * * shall be in lieu of all rights and remedies as to that injury now existing, either at common law or otherwise * * *.” G.L. 1956 § 28-29-20 (emphasis added). However, “injury” is a defined term under the statute, which limits it to a “personal injury to an employee arising out of and in the course of his or her employment, connected and referable to the employment.” Section 28-29-2(7)(i). Whether plaintiff’s broken femur was an injury as defined by the act was the very point of contention between the parties that led to their eventual settlement and the execution of the release. Further, after they successfully negotiated a resolution to the dispute, the parties asked the court to approve their proposed settlement agreement, and the court specifically found as a fact in the WCC decree that the “claimed injury * * * did not occur in the course of [plaintiff’s] employment * * * connected therewith and referable thereto.” (Emphasis added.) Although the parties did not quibble about the fact that plaintiff fell and fractured her', '- 16 - femur, it was established that this injury did not occur during the course of her employment. Indeed, they agreed that the injury did not so occur.', 'If the exclusivity provision contained in § 28-29-20 is construed to bar all claims of an employee against an employer after a settlement of a disputed claim under § 28-33- 25.1, then the final sentence of § 28-33-25.1, which gives an employer the right to a duly executed release of all liability, would be rendered a nullity. In other words, the General Assembly’s inclusion of language entitling the employer to such a release after payment in accordance with a settlement under § 28-33-25.1 would be completely unnecessary if the exclusivity provision were interpreted to serve as an automatic bar to any further employer liability in every case in which there was a settlement of a disputed claim. In light of the statutory language, and in consideration of the canon of statutory interpretation requiring that meaning be given to every sentence, I cannot accept such a result. 8 See Local 400, International Federation of Technical and Professional Engineers, 747 A.2d at 1005.', 'I dissent as well from the majority’s holding that Kulawas’s premises-liability claim also is barred because she waived her common-law rights when she did not reserve these rights under § 28-29-17 and because she received a workers’ compensation remedy under § 28-33-25.1. First, as the majority notes, “a payment approved by a judge of the WCC, in accordance with § 28-33-25.1, ‘shall not be deemed to be the payment of workers’ compensation benefits, but shall be considered a compromise payment of a 8', 'In my view, the fact that the 258-page act contains no other provision for an “entitlement” to a release bolsters the conclusion that the General Assembly intended for this provision not to automatically release all liability, but to allow the employer to negotiate it in a release.', '- 17 - disputed claim.’” (Emphases added.) This Court has said that “if an employee has not properly reserved his or her common-law rights under the act, he or she is barred from bringing a tort action against his or her employer if workers’ compensation benefits are appropriate.” Cianci v. Nationwide Insurance Co., 659 A.2d 662, 668 (R.I. 1995) (holding that the act immunizes the insurer as well as the employer) (emphasis omitted). In my view, an employee who has not reserved his or her common-law rights is prohibited from bringing a tort action only if workers’ compensation benefits were appropriate, which is not the case here. 9 Again, for workers’ compensation benefits to be appropriate, there must be an injury that falls within the definition under the act. Also, in my opinion, construing § 28-29-17 to apply in every instance in which there is a settlement and accompanying remedy received under § 28-33-25.1 further would render the final sentence of that section entitling the employer to a release mere surplusage. Local 400, International Federation of Technical and Professional Engineers, 747 A.2d at 1005.', 'The Effect of Manzi', 'I acknowledge that in the case of Manzi v. State, 687 A.2d 461, 461-62 (R.I. 1997) (mem.), this Court held, in an order, that a plaintiff’s civil action, which was based on the same injuries that were the foundation of his settlement of a disputed workers’ compensation claim under § 28-33-25.1, was barred because the employee had signed an unquestionably comprehensive release of all liability stemming from the claimed injury.

Clearly, workers’ compensation benefits were “appropriate” in that case.', '- 18 - barred the plaintiff’s civil suit against his employer. Manzi, 687 A.2d at 461-62. In making that observation, however, we did not analyze the act’s definition of the word “injury.” Id. Therefore, I do not agree that the exclusivity clause, in and of itself, operates to bar civil claims in all situations where the parties have executed a release pursuant to § 28-33-25.1, because such a construction would reduce the final sentence of that section, entitling the employer to a release, to mere “surplusage.” Local 400, International Federation of Technical and Professional Engineers, 747 A.2d at 1005.', 'The Interpretation of the Release', 'After carefully examining the record, particularly the release, settlement proposal, and WCC decree, in a light most favorable to plaintiff as the nonmoving party, it is my opinion that there are genuine issues of material fact about whether plaintiff’s release encompasses only her workers’ compensation claim or, alternatively, whether it extinguishes all claims, including her premises-liability claim.

In the absence of a record that could illuminate what, if any, negotiations occurred between the parties concerning the release, and without evidence of their intent when they agreed to its terms, the release, in my opinion, is ambiguous. See 2 Modern Workers Compensation § 204:16 at 27 (explaining that the scope of a release “is primarily a question of intent as manifested by the settlement agreement terms”).

Chelsea proceeded to testify that, one morning during that particular visit to Rhode Island, defendant made her rub his penis; she stated that that act had occurred “a couple of days” after her seventh birthday (which was on June 15). Chelsea described what defendant did as follows: “My dad made me touch him. He put my hand on his penis and gave me direction to rub it up and down.” Chelsea stated that defendant’s penis was outside of his pants when the just-described act took place.2 Chelsea also testified that her father had told her “not to tell” anyone what had happened.

33,: v. : Daniel Ayriyan. :,criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. Before this Court is an appeal by Veronika Ayriyan from orders of the Family Court awarding Daniel Ayriyan full custody of their minor children and denying her motion to vacate the order of the Family Court entered on September 4, 2007. This case came before the Court for oral argument on April 8, 2010, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After hearing the parties’ arguments and considering the memoranda submitted by them, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide this appeal at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the orders of the Family Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'There are very few facts in this case that are not in dispute. The parties, Veronika and Daniel Ayriyan, do agree that a marriage ceremony took place in Portland, Maine, on February 12, 1999, and that they subsequently divorced on July 17, 2001. 1 It is also undisputed that Veronika was seventeen years old at the time of the marriage, and Daniel, Sr. was twenty-six years old. They have two children, Daniel, Jr., born in 1999, who is ten years old, and Rafael, born in 2004, who is five years old. The couple also acknowledges that they reconciled for several years after their divorce, during which time Rafael was born. They agree that the reconciliation ultimately failed, and that Veronika moved out of the family home in January 2005, although they disagree on the specific date. Beyond this paucity of common ground, the parties can agree on little else.', 'However, in spite of, or more likely because of, their deeply held differences, Veronika and Daniel, Sr.’s most significant point of agreement is that the shared physical placement of their children is not appropriate. The parties successfully shared custody of their children for about a year until early 2007, when their troubles were reignited. On February 20, 2007, after picking up Daniel, Jr. and Rafael from visitation with their father, Veronika called the Attleboro, Massachusetts, police and alleged that she observed redness on Daniel, Jr.’s face and bruises on his body. The incident report prepared by the responding officer attributes the source of those injuries to Daniel, Sr.’s brother, Levon. The responding officer advised Veronika to take the child to Sturdy Memorial Hospital. According to the report of the hospital, Daniel, Jr. said that his uncle had struck him on his left buttock and on the right side of his face. 1', 'In this opinion, we refer to the parties as Veronika and Daniel, Sr. This is for the purposes of clarity only, and we intend no disrespect by using their first names.', '-2-', 'On February 21, 2007, Veronika filed a complaint and sought a protective order in District Court in Attleboro, Massachusetts, where she was living at the time. In an affidavit accompanying her complaint, Veronika alleged that Daniel, Sr. slapped Daniel, Jr. on the face with his hand, and that his brother, Levon, was responsible for Daniel, Jr.’s bruises. The Massachusetts Department of Social Services conducted an investigation and made a finding that Daniel, Sr. had excessively disciplined Daniel, Jr. The case then was referred to the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF), which disagreed with the conclusion of the Massachusetts Department of Social Services that Daniel, Sr. had engaged in excessive discipline; DCYF determined that the allegations were unfounded.', 'On February 26, 2007, Daniel, Sr. filed a motion for emergency relief in Family Court. He alleged that Veronika had endeavored to prevent the exercise of his parental rights, and he cited Veronika’s action in Attleboro District Court. Among other requests for relief, he sought sole custody of their children, the reappointment of a guardian ad litem, and a finding of contempt against Veronika, with appropriate sanctions.', 'On March 9, 2007, Veronika filed a motion for ex parte relief, seeking a temporary restraining order against Daniel, Sr. In an accompanying affidavit, she alleged physical abuse of Daniel, Jr. by his father and also that Daniel, Sr.’s motion filed on February 26 contained “many significant misrepresentations.” On the basis of these allegations, a justice of the Family Court issued an emergency ex parte order that temporarily required that Daniel, Sr.’s visitation be supervised and temporarily restrained Daniel, Sr. from “harassing” Veronika.', 'The trial justice also reappointed attorney Janice Head as the guardian ad litem for the couple’s two children. 2 Soon after her reappointment as guardian, Ms. Head investigated the 2', 'Ms. Head previously had been appointed as the guardian ad litem for the children in 2005.', '-3- parties’ living conditions and submitted a preliminary report to the Family Court on April 13, 2007. After a hearing was held before the trial justice on April 16, 2007, the trial justice reinstated unsupervised visitation between the children and Daniel, Sr. and established a visitation schedule.', 'On July 5, 2007, Daniel, Sr. filed a motion for emergency relief, in which he alleged that his children’s living arrangement with their mother and her boyfriend was harmful to them, and he sought physical placement of his children, subject to Veronika’s visitation rights. A hearing was held on July 11, 2007, resulting in an order reinstating shared physical possession, and the matter was subsequently continued for review until mid-August.', 'After an in-chambers conference among counsel for the parties and the guardian held on August 16, 2007, the trial justice issued an order, dated September 4, 2007, which awarded Daniel, Sr. physical possession of the parties’ two children and continued the matter for a hearing on October 4, 2007. Veronika filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with this Court on August 29, 2007, in which she sought review of that order, which was made without an evidentiary hearing to supplement the recommendations of the guardian ad litem. This Court entered an order that directed the Family Court to conduct an evidentiary hearing forthwith.', 'In compliance with our order, the Family Court conducted evidentiary hearings on the issue of custody and placement over several days in September, October, and November, 2007. Several witnesses were called to testify, in addition to the parties, including the guardian ad litem, the boys’ pediatrician, a child psychologist who examined the parties and Daniel, Jr., a former coworker of Veronika, and Veronika’s fiancé, Todd Quinter. The hearings revealed divergent testimony among Daniel, Sr., Veronika, her fiancé, and the guardian.', '-4-', 'Ms. Head testified that when she conducted her investigation of the parties’ living arrangements in March 2007, Veronika was living in Attleboro, Massachusetts, with her fiancé, her younger brother, and her two sons. As of the date of the hearing, she said that Veronika had moved, and was living in Smithfield, Rhode Island, in a nice home and that she “didn’t see any evidence that [her fiancé] was living there” when she visited. According to the guardian, however, Veronika told her that after she moved to Smithfield, “she was living with her boyfriend and had been for some months before that.” The guardian testified that there was no indication that Daniel, Sr. had either a wife or girlfriend.', 'In her report, the guardian recommended to the Family Court that the children should be placed with their father. In her testimony, she said that she felt that it was most appropriate for the children to live with their father “because of the lack of [Veronika’s] fostering [of a] relationship between the children and their father, and because my belief is that [Veronika] has been pressuring Daniel[, Jr.] to say certain things to certain people.” Ms. Head also recounted several episodes that were of concern to her that decreased her confidence in Veronika. She discussed an incident in which Veronika contacted the Attleboro police on January 7, 2006, because she thought that Daniel, Sr. was driving by her house, although no charges were filed. According to Ms. Head, Daniel, Sr. informed her that he was at home sleeping at the time. The guardian testified that Veronika’s report of alleged abuse of Daniel, Jr. by Daniel, Sr. on February 20, 2007, also factored into her recommendation.', 'She said that she particularly considered the discrepancies between the police and hospital records reporting that Daniel, Jr.’s', '-5- uncle was solely responsible, and Veronika’s subsequent assertion in Attleboro District Court that Daniel, Sr. was responsible for the boy’s injuries, as well. 3', 'Next, she expressed her concern about a notation placed in Daniel, Jr.’s school records at the request of Veronika that no information was to be given to Daniel, Sr. The guardian said that she believed this to be inappropriate because the parties had joint custody at that time. Ms. Head also was alarmed by obscenities that eight-year-old Daniel, Jr. wrote on his school desk, in which he disparaged himself. She suspected that Rafael, who was also swearing in English, and Daniel, Jr. learned these offensive words from Veronika’s fiancé. She also was deeply troubled by Daniel, Jr.’s assertion that he saw his mother and her fiancé being inappropriately affectionate, which made him very upset to the point of declaring that it made him want to die. Overall, Ms. Head testified that she perceived “a clear pattern that [Veronika] is attempting to disrupt the relationship the children have with [Daniel, Sr.],” while she did not detect such a destructive effort on the part of Daniel, Sr.', 'In their testimony at the hearings, both Veronika and Mr. Quinter adamantly denied the conduct that the guardian attributed to them. They each testified that they purposely did not display any signs of affection in front of the children. According to Mr. Quinter, he never taught the children any swear words, nor had he used inappropriate language in their presence. He also testified that he did not live with Veronika and that he had not lived with her in the past.', 'Veronika, who emigrated from Russia to the United States as a teenager, testified to a harrowing tale of her marriage at seventeen years of age, a marriage that she characterized as 3', 'Boris Skurkovich, M.D., the children’s pediatrician, examined Daniel, Jr. on February 28, 2007. He testified that the child had bruises, but that they were “mostly old,” with the exception of a new bruise under the right shoulder blade. According to Dr. Skurkovich, Daniel, Jr. was “inconsistent” about where he sustained his various bruises; he testified that Daniel, Jr. attributed one bruise to being hit by his uncle and others to falling down.', '-6- arranged. According to Veronika, Daniel, Sr. raped her while they were dating, and she became pregnant. In his testimony, Daniel, Sr. denied raping Veronika. She said that the parties went to Maine to marry because they believed that state did not require parental consent for an individual under the age of eighteen to marry, and she wished to conceal the out-of-wedlock pregnancy from her parents. 4 Veronika also recounted being required to turn her paychecks over to her mother-in-law and having a poor relationship with her ex-husband’s parents.', 'Finally, Veronika testified about a claimed incident of abuse that immediately preceded the parties’ separation and eventual divorce. According to Veronika, Daniel, Sr. pushed her and sat on her chest, causing her “horrible pain.” She said that he called her names and banged her head on the floor. Veronika testified that even though her husband had physically abused her before, she called the police for the first time after this incident. It appears from the record that Daniel, Sr. was convicted of one count of domestic assault in District Court and subsequently appealed his conviction to the Superior Court. 5', 'The record further reveals that Veronika declined to participate in a second trial, and the case against Daniel, Sr. was dismissed.', 'Daniel, Sr. said that he lived in Warwick, and his parents assisted him with child care. He testified about his flexible work schedule, that he mostly speaks Russian with his children, and that he does not swear in front of his children. According to Daniel, Sr., he deliberately spoke positively about Veronika to Daniel, Jr. and Rafael.', 'Brian Hayden, Ph.D., a child psychologist, testified that he had been counseling Daniel, Jr. at the referral of the guardian. He said that upon his first meeting with Daniel, Jr. and Daniel, 4', 'In contrast to Veronika’s testimony that her parents did not consent to her marriage, Daniel, Sr. produced their marriage license from Portland, Maine, as an exhibit, which contained the purported signatures of her parents. 5', 'Rule 37 of the District Court Rules of Criminal Procedure provides in relevant part that “[a] defendant aggrieved by a sentence of the District Court may appeal therefrom to the Superior Court * * *.”', '-7- Sr., several months earlier, Daniel, Jr. “seemed confused.” He observed that the child was very affectionate with his father, and that the boy denied that his father ever hit him. According to Dr. Hayden, Daniel, Jr. told him that his mother’s boyfriend “says a lot of ‘bad things’ about his dad.” 6 However, he testified that Daniel, Jr. appeared “torn” between his parents and was anxious and inconsistent.', 'Doctor Hayden also conducted psychological evaluations of both parties. He testified that he found Veronika to be “vivacious” and “intelligent,” but that she displayed a “histrionic personality.” After interviewing and testing Daniel, Sr., Dr. Hayden said that he described him as “bright” and “methodical.” Doctor Hayden testified that he deliberately tested Daniel, Sr.’s expression of anger in light of the allegations of abuse against him, and Dr. Hayden found that Daniel, Sr. exhibited “a below average level of aggression and dominance.”', 'On April 2, 2008, the trial justice rendered her decision. She agreed with the parties “that an award of joint custody would be contrary to the best interest of Daniel, Jr., and Rafael.” As a result, the trial justice awarded Daniel, Sr. “sole custody of the children as well as sole physical placement.” She then proceeded to specify Veronika’s visitation rights, including alternating weekend visitation, sharing of significant holidays, alternating visitation on other holidays, and two nonconsecutive weeks of summer vacation. The decision also vacated the order restraining Daniel, Sr.’s brother, Levon, from being in the children’s presence. Finally, the trial justice found Veronika “in willful contempt of the orders of this court” for seeking and obtaining temporary restraining orders from Massachusetts courts that “directly impacted [Daniel’s] access to his children” even though “Rhode Island was declared the home state of the children.” The 6', 'Daniel, Jr. and Rafael often referred to Todd Quinter as “Brian.” Mr. Quinter insists that he has never gone by the name “Brian,” and he said that neither Daniel, Jr. nor Rafael ever has called him that.', '-8- order memorializing the decision was entered on June 24, 2008, from which Veronika timely appealed.', 'After she appealed this decision, Veronika moved to vacate the September 4, 2007 order. A hearing before the trial justice on the motion was heard on July 22, 2008, and the trial justice denied the motion. 7 Veronika also filed a notice of appeal from the denial of the motion to vacate. The two appeals were consolidated for briefing and argument before this Court.', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'Veronika raises three issues on appeal. First, she argues that the trial justice erred when she awarded full custody of the children to Daniel, Sr. Second, she contends that the trial justice erred when she found Veronika to be in contempt of the August 2002 order because she sought protective orders in Massachusetts courts. Third, Veronika asserts that the trial justice erred when she denied her motion to vacate the order of September 4, 2007. 8 7', 'Veronika then made a request for emergency relief to this Court for an order vacating the Family Court order of September 4, 2007, and reinstating the order entered on March 3, 2006, which was denied. 8', 'This issue is the sole basis of the second of these consolidated appeals.

The trial justice must consider a combination of and an interaction among all the relevant factors that affect the child’s best interests.” Pettinato, 582 A.2d at 914.', 'Veronika argues that the trial justice abused her discretion when she “substituted the unsubstantiated conclusions of the [guardian] for a meaningful application of Pettinato based upon the evidence.” Conversely, Daniel, Sr. maintains that the trial justice “carefully and precisely set forth in detail her consideration of the [Pettinato factors]” and conducted an “independent examination * * * that far transcends a bald reliance upon the testimony of the [guardian].” After careful review of the record, we agree with Daniel, Sr. and hold that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion when she awarded him custody of the couple’s two minor children.', 'In her decision, which, in our view, very well could serve as a template for how such a decision should be written, the trial justice discussed each of the Pettinato factors in detail.

Pettinato, 582 A.2d 909 (R.I. 1990), to be considered when determining the best interests of the child in custody disputes are as follows:', '“1. The wishes of the child’s parent or parents regarding the child’s custody.', '“2.

She then considered, in detail, the evidence that the parties presented concerning “the interaction and interrelationship of the child with the child’s parents, siblings, and any other person who may significantly affect the child’s best interest.” The trial justice noted that Daniel, Jr. told Dr. Hayden that his mother and her fiancé spoke badly of his father and suggested to him that he was abusive. She found, however, that young Daniel “denied any abuse at the hands of his father and never conveyed any fear of his father or any anxiety about being with him.” The trial justice noted that the guardian recounted her concerns for Daniel, Jr.’s mental health because of his negative comments about himself, such as his expressions that he would like to die. The trial justice concluded that the child “is confused emotionally.”', 'Further, the trial justice briefly discussed the children’s adjustment to home, school and community. She noted Daniel, Jr.’s involvement in sports in both Warwick and Smithfield. However, she expressed concern with the conclusions of a psychologist’s report prepared regarding Daniel, Jr. at his elementary school and Veronika’s “fail[ure] to appear at the appointed meeting” to discuss the psychologist’s recommendations.', 'Next, the trial justice discussed the mental and physical health of the family members. She found that Veronika “chose to weave a tale of rape and abuse,” and that her psychological evaluation revealed that she is “a person unable or unwilling to tell the truth.” The trial justice discussed multiple instances of “fabrications/exaggerations and misstatements made by [Veronika] that seriously strain her credibility as a witness.” As for Daniel, Sr., the trial justice noted that his psychological evaluation “demonstrates that defendant is ‘earnest, controlled and', '- 12 - deliberate.’” She considered that his assessment did not show a propensity toward extreme forms of anger, but rather the evaluation “indicated a below average level of aggression.”', 'The trial justice also found that both of the parties had stable homes, but that “[t]here is clear evidence that [Veronika] resides with her fiancé and has for some time,” despite Veronika and her fiancé’s testimony to the contrary. However, she held that “the court cannot be satisfied by clear and convincing evidence that Daniel, Jr. observed his mother and [her fiancé] in a compromising position” because of his tendency to tell “contradictory stories regarding both his father and his mother.” The trial justice also noted that “[t]here is no evidence that [Daniel, Sr.] has any women in his life.”', 'After reviewing the instances of claimed domestic violence that Veronika urged her to consider, the trial justice did “not find a pattern of domestic violence against [Veronika].” She noted that there was but one instance of domestic violence that had been established by a fair preponderance of evidence, and that occurred in 2000. The trial justice stressed that she took this incident “seriously,” but she concluded that Veronika “has failed to establish a continuing pattern of threatening behavior.”', 'With respect to the final factor, “the willingness and ability of each parent to facilitate a close and continuous relationship between the child and the other parent,” the trial justice restated her finding that Veronika lacked the ability “to foster a relationship between the boys and their father.” To support this finding, the trial justice cited the psychological evaluation conducted at Daniel, Jr.’s elementary school without notice to the father, the boy’s consistent description of his mother’s denigration of his father to him and his brother, “the constant interruption of the boys’ relationship with their father by means of temporary restraining orders obtained contrary to RI Family Court orders,” and her insistence that Daniel, Jr.’s elementary', '- 13 - school withhold all information about Daniel, Jr. from his father. In contrast, she noted that there was no indication in the record that Daniel, Sr. denigrated Veronika to the boys at any time. The trial justice concluded that Veronika’s “lack of credibility makes it impossible for the court to grant her any custodial rights to the minor children.”', 'We are of the opinion that the trial justice did indeed “review all the evidence and exhibits when she weighed the factors set forth in Pettinato.”', 'Veronika argues that the guardian’s recommendation was not adequately supported and that many of the trial justice’s findings were “erroneous.” However, this Court reviews the trial justice’s award for an abuse of discretion and thus affords her findings of fact considerable deference. Berard, 749 A.2d at 579.', 'After careful review of the record, we do not agree with Veronika that the trial justice “substituted the unsubstantiated conclusions of the [guardian] for a meaningful application of Pettinato based upon the evidence.” She obviously gave significant weight to the testimony and report of the guardian, but did not do so to the exclusion of other evidence. Rather, the trial justice carefully weighed all the evidence, including the testimony of the witnesses and documentary evidence such as police reports, hospital records, the pediatrician’s report, educational records and reports, and the psychological evaluations conducted by Dr. Hayden. Further, the trial justice did not blindly accept everything in the guardian’s report and testimony, as illustrated by her finding that certain portions were not supported by clear and convincing evidence. Therefore, in our view, the trial justice’s award of sole custody and placement of the two children with Daniel, Sr. was made after she applied the Pettinato factors in a meaningful way, based on all of the evidence and her credibility determinations. We see no abuse of discretion in this record.', '- 14 -', 'B', 'Finding of Contempt', '1', 'Standard of Review', '“A finding of contempt is within the sound discretion of the trial justice.” State v.

It is implicit in the trial justice’s finding of contempt that she was convinced that Veronika’s claims that served as the basis for the protective orders that she sought in Massachusetts court were merely pretextual. Additionally, “it is within the discretion of the court to impose sanctions for contempt.” Gardiner v. Gardiner, 821 A.2d 229, 232 (R.I. 2003) (quoting E.M.B. Associates, Inc. v.

Lynch, from the issuance of that 2003 license has been rendered moot by the expiration of, subsequent renewal of, and later transfer of said license.1', 'For the reasons set forth herein, it is our opinion that the issue of the validity (vel non) of the 2003 license is not moot.', 'Accordingly, we grant the Attorney General’s petition for certiorari and quash the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'We wish to thank the amici curiae for the helpful briefs that they submitted to this Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Pond View Recycling, Inc., the predecessor in interest to defendant TLA-Providence LLC (TLA),2 operated a refuse facility in East Providence that was allowed to receive up to 150 tons per day of construction and demolition debris.3 Between August of 2000 and July of 2002, Pond View began the process of applying for a DEM license pursuant to which it would be able to operate at a 500 tons per day capacity. See G.L. 1956 § 23-18.9-9.', 'A public hearing was held on September 10 and September 11, 2002 with respect to that license application. At the hearing, the Attorney General provided “substantive comment” to DEM in opposition to the issuance of the license. See § 23-18.9-9(a)(4) through (6). The Attorney General cited what he considered to be (1) Pond View’s noncompliance with state environmental laws and (2) its failure to have obtained the permits and/or licenses required for operation as constituting cause for denial of the license; the Attorney General further contended that Pond View’s pending application contained numerous deficiencies.', 'Thereafter, on January 10, 2003, DEM issued Pond View the sought-after license to operate at a 500 tons per day capacity. It should be noted that § 23-18.9-9(c) provides that such “[l]icenses shall expire three (3) years from the date of issuance unless sooner suspended or revoked.” Accordingly, the license issued to Pond View would in the normal course have expired on January 10, 2006. 2', 'The sale of the assets of Pond View Recycling, Inc. to TLA-Providence LLC is discussed later in this “Facts and Travel” section. 3', 'It should be noted that, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 23-18.9-8(c), “[p]rocessing facilities that accept less than one hundred and fifty (150) tons per day of construction and demolition debris (C&D) are exempt from the requirement of obtaining a solid waste management facility license * * *.” Such facilities are, however, subject to the other requirements, rules, and regulations that are set forth in that statute.', '-2-', 'On April 1, 2003, the Attorney General, acting pursuant to § 23-18.9-9(a)(6), commenced an administrative appeal of the issuance of the license. In connection with that appeal, he requested a hearing before the Administrative Adjudication Division for Environmental Matters (AAD)—a division within DEM. In his appeal, the Attorney General contended that DEM had violated its own rules and regulations in issuing the license to Pond View.', 'Hearings before the AAD with respect to the Attorney General’s appeal began on April 12, 2004.4 On May 14, 2004, the chief of the DEM’s Office of Waste Management testified at the AAD hearing pursuant to a subpoena issued by the Attorney General. However, while that witness was being questioned, counsel for DEM objected to a question posed by the Attorney General; counsel for DEM contended that the question at issue called for improper expert opinion testimony. The hearing officer overruled the objection, noted the objection for the record, and told the witness, “[Y]ou may answer the question.” Nonetheless, counsel for DEM then instructed the witness not to answer the question.5 The hearing officer indicated on the 4', 'After the Attorney General’s appeal was filed, but prior to the commencement of the AAD hearings, the parties made attempts to reach a mutually acceptable resolution through voluntary mediation.

Ultimately, on December 31, 2007,6 a justice of the Superior Court ordered the witness who had been under subpoena to “comply with the', '“[Witness]: It would be primarily the solid waste rules and regulations, at', 'least the rules and regulations for solid waste, management facilities,', 'compost facilities.', '“[Attorney General]: And do those regulations contain provisions relative', 'to construction, demolition, and debris processing facilities?', '“[DEM counsel]: Objection.

The director thereafter issued an order requiring DEM witnesses to answer only “fact-specific, ‘non-opinion’ inquiries.” The Attorney General subsequently appealed that order to the Superior Court. The December 31, 2007 Superior Court order referenced in the text is the product of the Attorney General’s appeal of the order of the director of DEM.', 'We further note that, during the period of more than two years that transpired between the posing of the objected-to question at the AAD hearing and the Superior Court’s eventual ruling, the parties appeared in the Superior Court on several occasions and before various justices of the Superior Court.

At the hearing on the motion, Pond View contended that the controversy was moot and that the appeal should therefore be dismissed. Pond View argued that the 2003 license had expired on January 10, 2006. Pond View further indicated that a new license had been issued on January 10, 2006 (which would in the normal course expire on the same date in 2009), and it contended that the Attorney General had not preserved his right to challenge the issuance of the 2006 license. Lastly, Pond View relied on the doctrine of laches; it alleged that there had been unreasonable delay on the part of the Attorney General in prosecuting the case.', 'The Attorney General objected to Pond View’s motion to dismiss. He contended that the controversy was not moot because the AAD had yet to reach a final decision as to the validity of the underlying 2003 license. The Attorney General additionally pointed to the unresolved constitutional and due process contentions that he had articulated with respect to the manner in which DEM conducts its administrative proceedings. The Attorney General further contended that, because the 2006 license was in actuality a renewal of the 2003 license (the latter being the subject of the administrative appeal), “[i]t is self-evident that if the original license is eventually deemed to be invalid, the ‘renewal’ of such license is impacted.” The Attorney General also 7', 'We pause to note that the December 31, 2007 order of the Superior Court has neither been appealed to this Court, nor is it the subject of the present appeal before this Court. We therefore consider that order to be unaffected by this decision and to remain in full force and effect.', '-5- argued against the mootness contention on the ground that the appeal involved issues that are of extreme public importance that are capable of repetition, but which will evade review. In addition, he contended that the appeal was not time-barred by the doctrine of laches, due to the fact that the stay of administrative proceedings pending the termination of the Superior Court proceedings had been agreed upon by all parties; he further noted that Pond View had proffered no proof of either unreasonable delay or prejudice (both of which are requisite elements of a meritorious claim of laches).', 'On January 4, 2008, the AAD hearing officer made the following findings of fact: (1) DEM issued Pond View a license to operate a Construction and Demolition Debris Processing Facility on January 10, 2003; (2) the Attorney General filed an appeal from the issuance of that license on April 1, 2003; (3) the license at issue had expired on January 10, 2006; (4) on January 10, 2006 “a new license to operate [a facility] was issued” by DEM to Pond View; and (5) there had been no appeal filed with the AAD regarding the new license.', 'Based upon the just-summarized findings of fact, the AAD hearing officer issued an order and decision dismissing the appeal as moot. She held that, pursuant to § 23-18.9-9 and the terms of the license, the 2003 license expired on January 10, 2006. She further ruled that the Attorney General had “failed to preserve [his] right to challenge the validity of the 2006 license.” Accordingly, she concluded that the appeal as to the validity of the 2003 license issued to Pond View had been rendered moot.', 'In February of 2008, shortly after the AAD hearing officer issued her mootness decision, the Attorney General, in reliance upon chapter 35 of title 42 of the General Laws of 1956, filed a two-count complaint in the Providence County Superior Court, naming both DEM and Pond', '-6- View as defendants.8 In count 1 of the amended complaint (entitled “Administrative Procedures Act Appeal”), the Attorney General sought review of the AAD’s mootness decision with respect to the 2003 license. In count 2 (entitled “Request For Declaratory Judgment”), the Attorney General sought a declaratory judgment with respect to the validity of the 2006 license. He further alleged that he has “an interest under state law in the legality of licenses issued by [DEM] and compliance with the applicable statutory requirements governing such licenses;” he alleged that he has therefore been “adversely affected by the regulations used by [DEM] in the conduct of its administrative hearings.” The Attorney General also contended that he had an interest in “ensuring that due process of law is afforded to those engaged in [DEM] administrative hearings.”', 'Pond View answered the Attorney General’s complaint, and it filed a lengthy responsive pleading that included a section entitled “Counterclaims,” which contained several counts. In one count, Pond View sought compensation for its litigation expenses pursuant to the statute entitled “Equal Access to Justice for Small Businesses and Individuals,” G.L. 1956 § 42-92-1; other counts alleged abuse of process and malicious prosecution.', 'During the course of the just-referenced Superior Court proceedings, TLA purchased the assets of Pond View. On February 28, 2008, as a result of that asset purchase and upon TLA’s application to DEM for a license transfer, the license was transferred to TLA; and that entity was issued a three-year renewal license (which in the normal course will expire on February 28, 8', 'The Attorney General’s original complaint named DEM as the only defendant. He subsequently filed an amended complaint, approximately one week later, in which he added Pond View as a defendant.', '-7- 2011).9 As a result, TLA became licensed to operate the same facility as its predecessor in interest (Pond View) had operated. In March of 2008, TLA was substituted as a party defendant in place of Pond View in the Superior Court action.10', 'On May 29, 2008, a justice of the Superior Court issued a decision with respect to count 1 of the Attorney General’s complaint (entitled “Administrative Procedures Act Appeal”) and with respect to count 2 of the complaint (entitled “Request For Declaratory Judgment”). At the outset, the trial justice stated, as he had on previous occasions, that he considered the “internal friction within the executive department of government” to be “unseemly.” He expressed his particular displeasure over the fact that this matter had returned to the Superior Court without there having been compliance with the “[c]ourt’s direction that the witnesses respond to the questions” and “without any further evidence [having been] taken * * *.” We agree with his observations.', 'The trial justice then began his review of the AAD hearing officer’s decision by quoting on the record the portion of § 23-18.9-9(c) which states that licenses issued pursuant to that statutory provision “shall expire three (3) years from the date of issuance unless sooner suspended or revoked.” He found that the 2003 license, which was the focus of the Attorney General’s administrative appeal, had been effective for a span of time commencing on January 10, 2003 and ending on January 10, 2006.

He stated that, if the Attorney General had “appealed or done something to stop the issuance of the ‘06 license,” the case might not have become moot. The trial justice further stated that, in his view, the plain language of the licensing statute “makes it clear that it is not a continuance.” The trial justice summarily stated: “It is not the same license.” He reasoned that “it was incumbent upon [the Attorney General] either to ask [the Superior Court] or the director or the hearing officer or somebody to stay the issuance of the renewed license [in 2006].” On the basis of this reasoning, the trial justice affirmed the AAD hearing officer’s judgment of dismissal of the administrative appeal on the ground that the issue of the validity of the 2003 license was moot.11 11', 'The Superior Court justice concluded his decision with the following blunt admonition:', '“[When the Superior Court] issues orders, they are not to be', 'ignored.

However, it further provides that', '“[t]he provisions in this section for issuance of a license shall not', 'apply to the renewal of a license and any facility shall be', 'relicensed if it meets the criteria in effect when the facility was', 'licensed; provided, however, that any renewal application which', 'substantially deviates from the use or purpose of the license shall', 'be subject to the provisions of this chapter * * *.” Id. (Emphasis', 'added.)', 'Both DEM and TLA contend on appeal that the issue of the validity vel non of the 2003 license is moot because that license expired in 2006, at which time a renewal license was issued for another three-year period; they further contend that the latter license was replaced by yet another license at the time of the transfer in 2008. They note that the 2006 and 2008 licenses each contain conditions that are different from each other and from the 2003 license.', 'After due consideration of the respective contentions of the parties, our understanding of the above-quoted portion of § 23-18.9-9(c) has led us to a conclusion that is quite different from that reached by the trial justice and the AAD hearing officer. In our view, the 2006 and 2008 licenses are in actuality inherently linked to and dependent upon the validity of the original 2003', '- 12 - license—as opposed to being truly new licenses. When the matter is so viewed, the issue of the validity (vel non) of the original license has not become moot by virtue of its having been rendered a dead letter for all purposes; its initial validity may still be challenged, even though it survives only in the form of the 2006 and 2008 permutations.', 'We understand § 23-18.9-9(c) to mean that, once an original license has been granted (after the completion of the above-described extensive application process consisting of documentation, notice, hearing, and comment), the requirements and the process for renewal and for transfer are essentially pro forma, absent a substantial deviation with respect to the use or purpose of the facility. An applicant for a renewal license (or a license transfer) is not required to provide the director with a certificate from the municipality in which the proposed site is located, stating that the facility conforms with the “applicable local land use and control ordinances of the municipality;” and such an applicant is not required to provide a “certificate of approval of the proposed site issued by the state planning council;” nor is an applicant for a renewal or transfer license subject to the same public notice and comment requirements— whereas all of the foregoing are required in order to obtain a new license. See § 23-18.9-9(a)(1) through (4) and (c).', 'For these reasons, we are unpersuaded by the contention of DEM and TLA that the licenses which were issued in 2006 and 2008 were entirely separate and distinct from the original 2003 license.13 We conclude instead that, as the Attorney General has contended, pursuant to the 13', 'Although it is by no means dispositive of the issue of whether the 2006 and 2008 licenses are in actuality closely related offshoots of the original 2003 license, it is worth noting that each of the licenses bears the same “64” license number.', '- 13 - system of licensing for these solid waste facilities, “[t]he validity of the license which [DEM] ‘renewed’ in January of 2006 obviously depends on the validity of the original license * * *.”14', 'DEM has also contended that this Court’s decision, in Hallsmith-Sysco Food Services, LLC v. Marques, 970 A.2d 1211 (R.I. 2009), supports the contention that the issue of the 2003 license is moot. However, we consider that case to be factually distinguishable from the present case. In Hallsmith-Sysco Food Services, we held that the town’s elimination of a liquor license rendered moot the issue of the plaintiff’s attempts to file a notice of objection to the future transfer of that liquor license. Id. at 1213-14. By contrast, in the instant case, although the original 2003 license expired by its own terms, that license was at the time of initial expiration renewed and was subsequently transferred.15 Therefore, unlike the situation in Hallsmith-Sysco Food Services, the issue of the validity (vel non) of the original 2003 license continues to be ripe for review.', 'Both the trial justice and defendants noted that the Attorney General had not appealed or taken other action in an effort to prevent the issuance of the subsequent 2006 license or the 2008 transfer. Although there may hypothetically have been judicial remedies of which the Attorney General could have availed himself in an effort to prevent the renewal of the license in 2006, we are unconvinced that the Attorney General’s option not to avail himself of such purported remedies renders the issue of the 2003 license moot. 14', 'We further consider to be persuasive the Attorney General’s argument that, if the 2006 and 2008 licenses were indeed “new” (as DEM and TLA contend they were), then there was not compliance with the above-referenced statutory requirements before those licenses were issued. 15', 'We note that our analysis is similar to that conducted by the Supreme Court of Texas in the case of Harris County Bail Bond Board v. Blackwood, 41 S.W.3d 123 (Tex. 2001). In Blackwood, the court noted that it had “long held that the expiration of a license will not moot the controversy if the appeal arises from the renewal or refusal to renew a license under a statutory scheme that contemplates a continuous cycle of license renewals.” Id. at 126 n.2.', '- 14 -', 'In our view, the statutory scheme pertinent to the case at bar provides no mechanism for the Attorney General as an objector (or for any other objector) to the renewal or transfer of the license to have contested or appealed the 2006 or 2008 licenses. As previously indicated, the statute governing new licenses provides that “[t]he applicant and/or any person who provided substantive comment at any time during the public comment period may appeal the decision of the director * * *.” Section 23-18.9-9(a)(6).16 Since the statutory requirements for renewal and transfer are far more truncated than are those governing the issuance of new licenses, we conclude that the Attorney General had no meaningful recourse but to continue to pursue his challenge to the underlying 2003 license (which he had the statutory right to appeal since he had provided substantive comment in opposition to the issuance of the license).', 'We are further unpersuaded by DEM’s argument that, because each license that was issued contained different conditions, the post-2003 licenses could not be considered to be the same as the 2003 license—and that therefore the controversy as to the validity of the 2003 license became moot three years after its issuance. We view DEM’s own reasoning (that, because “solid waste facilities frequently modify their operations during the three year lifespan of their license * * * [and] [s]o long as those modifications do not change the overall nature or capacity of the operation, then the license will be renewed and the License Conditions will be 16', 'DEM regulations provide an opportunity for hearing for “[a]ny person whose application for a registration, registration renewal, license, license renewal, other approval, or a variance has been denied by the Department, acting through the Office of Waste Management * * *.” 12-030- 021 R.I.

Such person “may appeal to the Administrative Adjudication Division for review of the decision on which the denial is based.” Id.', 'Our reading of this regulation leads us to conclude that, had Pond View or TLA been denied either a renewal or a transfer of the license, the entity so denied would have had the opportunity to appeal the denial through the AAD hearing process.

In our view, the different conditions on the various licenses are meant to address the changes that such facilities undergo over time, but which fall well below the substantial deviations that trigger the requirement of a “new” license.17 See § 23-18.9-9(c). Thus, absent such substantial deviations, the renewed licenses are in fact a product of the issuance of the original license, which, in the case at bar, was the 2003 license.18', 'For the reasons set forth above, we conclude that the administrative appeal concerning the issuance of the 2003 license is not moot.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, the petition for certiorari is granted, the judgment of the Superior Court is hereby quashed, and the papers in this case are remanded to the Superior Court with instructions that it, in turn, remand this matter to the Administrative Adjudication Division for Environmental Matters of the Department of Environmental Management for further proceedings to commence expeditiously in a manner consistent with this opinion and the December 31, 2007 order of the Superior Court. 17', 'With respect to a transferred license, DEM regulations provide that a change in ownership which entails “significant amendments and/or revisions to the operating plan or facility will require the issuance of a new license or registration (versus renewal).” 12-030-021 R.I.

35,": v. : Edward Marandola, Jr. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. This case came before the Supreme Court on April 6, 2010, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. 1 The defendant, Edward Marandola, Jr. (Edward or defendant), appeals from an order of the Family Court enforcing an arbitrator’s decision that declared that it was reasonable for Edward to be required to pay for two years of private high school tuition for his son. The defendant argues on appeal that the Family Court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the arbitration decision and that, in the alternative, if subject matter jurisdiction is deemed to exist, the trial justice erred in automatically confirming the decision without properly reviewing it. After examining the record and memoranda submitted by the parties, we 1', 'The defendant, whose attorney in this case has withdrawn, failed to appear at the scheduled oral argument; thus, this case has been decided on the basis of the written filings of the parties.', '-1- are satisfied that cause has not been shown and, thus, the appeal may be decided at this time. 2 For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the order of the Family Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'In 1996, Carmen K. (Marandola) Vanderheiden (Carmen or plaintiff) filed a divorce petition in the Family Court. 3 As part of the divorce settlement, the parties entered into a non-merged settlement agreement that set forth, in pertinent part, the rights and duties of the parties that pertain to their four minor children’s educational and related expenses. Paragraph nine provides:', '“A. Grammar and High School Education. The Husband', 'shall be responsible for the payment of all reasonable', 'grammar and high school tuition and tutoring expenses for', 'said minor children of the parties. The parties agree to', 'discuss any and all issues regarding high school and to', 'mutually select the appropriate high school for each', 'attending child. If the parties are unable to mutually select', 'and [sic] appropriate high school for each attending child,', 'or as to what is reasonable, they agree to submit this matter', 'to bind[sic] arbitration.” A final judgment was entered on March 27, 1997.', 'In 2003, the parties could not agree on which private high school their oldest child should attend for his sophomore year.', 'Edward wanted their son to attend LaSalle Academy in Providence, Rhode Island, for the 2003-2004 school term at a cost of $8,000 in tuition. Carmen wanted him to attend the Forman School, a private boarding school in Litchfield, Connecticut; the 2003-2004 tuition at that school was $40,000. The parties 2', 'While this appeal was pending, defendant filed for relief from his creditors in the Bankruptcy Court for the District of Rhode Island. That filing has no effect on the case at bar as this issue pertains to child support. See 11 U.S.C. § 362(b)(2)(A)(ii) (recognizing that the filing of a bankruptcy petition will not operate as an automatic stay with respect to the establishment or modification of an order for domestic support). 3', 'We respectfully will refer to the parties by their first names.', '-2- agreed, by consent order, that he would attend the Forman School for one year, but that Edward would pay only $8,000 toward the expense.', 'Their son continued at the Forman School for the 2004-2005 term. It appears from the record, however, that Edward did not make a payment for that year’s tuition until June 2005, at which time the parties stipulated that Edward was immediately responsible for contributing a sum equal to the 2004-2005 tuition for LaSalle Academy. The parties also agreed that they would seek a determination in the Family Court whether Edward should be responsible for the Forman School’s entire 2004-2005 tuition. On July 29, 2005, in accordance with yet another consent order issued by the Family Court, the parties agreed to arbitrate the issue of what were the “reasonable expenses” for their son’s education for the completed 2004-2005 school term and for the then-upcoming 2005- 2006 school term, pursuant to paragraph nine of their settlement agreement.', 'Although the arbitrator met with the parties in October 2005, memoranda from the parties were not provided until the spring of 2006. In a written decision issued on July 7, 2006, the arbitrator decided that the cost of attending the Forman School was a reasonable expense. Carmen filed a motion in the Family Court to enforce the arbitrator’s decision, and Edward motioned the court to reconsider or, in the alternative, to set aside the arbitrator’s decision.', 'Edward argued that the Family Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to confirm or vacate an arbitration decision. Carmen countered that the Family Court had jurisdiction to enforce the property settlement agreement, which contained the arbitration provision, and also had jurisdiction by virtue of the subsequent consent order, in which the parties agreed to submit this issue to an arbitrator. On May 14, 2007, the trial justice', '-3- determined that “the issue before the Court is not whether the Court should set aside the arbitrator’s decision but should the Court enforce the parties’ contract to be bound by the arbitrator’s decision.” The trial justice concluded that because the parties agreed on July 29, 2005, to submit this issue to arbitration, the arbitrator’s decision would be enforced. This timely appeal followed.', 'Analysis', 'A', 'Jurisdiction of the Family Court', 'Edward’s first argument on appeal is that the Family Court does not have subject- matter jurisdiction to confirm an arbitration decision under the Rhode Island Arbitration Act, as set forth in G.L. 1956 chapter 3 of title 10. 4', 'This argument, however, is misplaced. The Family Court did not order the parties to arbitrate, nor did it confirm an arbitration award; it merely enforced the property settlement agreement and subsequent consent order in which both parties agreed to submit their dispute to arbitration.', 'At the outset, we note that the arbitrator’s decision was not an enforceable arbitration award; the arbitrator simply determined that “the cost of attending the Foreman [sic] School [is] in fact reasonable expenses in accordance with the lifestyle enjoyed by the parties” as evidenced by their property settlement agreement. The Family Court is a court of limited jurisdiction; the General Assembly specifically conferred upon it the power to review only certain categories of disputes. See G.L. 1956 § 8-10-3 4', 'See G.L. 1956 § 10-3-1 (entitled “The Arbitration Act”). The thrust of Edward’s argument is that only the Superior Court has jurisdiction to review matters pertaining to arbitration because not only was the Family Court not in existence when the Arbitration Act was created, but also the act itself frequently references the Superior Court. We need not address these contentions, as they are not determinative of the outcome of this case.', '-4- (establishing jurisdiction of the Family Court). Section 8-10-3(a) provides in pertinent part, that that the Family Court has the authority “to hear and determine * * * all motions for * * * support and custody of children” and additionally, it has jurisdiction over “property settlement agreements and all other contracts between persons, who at the time of execution of the contracts, were husband and wife * * *.” Thus, the Family Court is vested with statutorily conferred authority to oversee proceedings relating to child support and property settlement agreements stemming from divorce actions. See Bowen v. Bowen, 675 A.2d 412, 414 (R.I. 1996) (recognizing that the Family Court clearly has subject matter jurisdiction to hear and determine all matters pertaining to property settlement agreements entered into between husbands and wives).', 'Additionally, this Court has stated on numerous occasions that non-merged property settlement agreements retain the characteristics of an ordinary contract. See Zaino v. Zaino, 818 A.2d 630, 637 (R.I. 2003); Bowen, 675 A.2d at 413. However, we also have noted that there is a fundamental difference between spousal agreements and ordinary business contracts; as a result, it is the Family Court’s responsibility, when called upon to do so, to “monitor such agreements with special attention and with a concern for the equities of the situation.” Gorman v. Gorman, 883 A.2d 732, 737 (R.I. 2005).', 'In the case at bar, the parties freely entered into and agreed to be bound by the terms of their non-merged property settlement agreement. The portion of the agreement pertaining to educational expenses contained a clause stating that, if the parties could not agree on what constituted reasonable tuition expenses, then they would submit the issue to an arbitrator. Additionally, the parties reaffirmed their commitment to submit this', '-5- issue to an arbitrator when they both agreed to the Family Court’s July 29, 2005 consent order. “[A]lthough [a consent order] ‘receives a court’s imprimatur,’ [it] is ‘in essence a contract’ and therefore must ‘be construed as a contract * * *.’” Now Courier, LLC v. Better Carrier Corp., 965 A.2d 429, 435 (R.I. 2009) (quoting Trahan v. Trahan, 455 A.2d 1307, 1310 (R.I. 1983)).', 'We are of the opinion that defendant is bound by the terms of his property settlement agreement as well as by the subsequent consent order. We note that Edward failed to raise any contractual defenses before the trial justice. See Zaino, 818 A.2d at 637 (recognizing property settlement agreements may be rescinded because of fraud or trickery); In re McBurney Law Services, Inc., 798 A.2d 877, 882 (R.I. 2002) (noting that consent orders “can not be ‘opened, changed or set aside without the assent of the parties in the absence of fraud, mutual mistake or actual absence of consent [.]’” (quoting Douglas Construction and Supply Corp. v. Wholesale Center of North Main Street, Inc., 119 R.I. 449, 452, 379 A.2d 917, 918 (R.I. 1977)). Thus, these defenses are deemed waived, based on this Court’s “raise or waive” rule. See Waterman v. Caprio, 983 A.2d 841, 847-48 (R.I. 2009) (recognizing that parties cannot raise an issue on appeal that was not brought to the attention of the trial justice).', 'It is not the function of this Court, or the Family Court, to set aside a property settlement agreement or consent order simply because a party no longer wishes to be bound by its terms or is unhappy with the result. The defendant’s contention that the Family Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the issues in this case is erroneous.', '-6-', 'B', 'Review of Arbitrator’s Decision', 'Edward’s second contention on appeal is that the trial justice committed reversible error when he determined that because the parties agreed to binding arbitration, the arbitrator’s decision was insulated from any review and therefore was confirmed. Although we agree that the trial justice did not perform any meaningful review of the arbitrator’s decision, we are not persuaded that this omission amounts to reversible error.', 'During the hearing, the trial justice declared:', '“The Court finds that the issue before the Court is', 'not whether the Court should set aside the arbitrator’s', 'decision but should the Court enforce the parties’ contract', 'to be bound by the arbitrator’s decision.', '“* * *', '“The Court finds that since the parties agreed to be', 'bound by the arbitrator’s decision the defendant’s motion to', 'set aside the arbitrator’s decision is denied.” We are satisfied that the trial justice failed to review the arbitrator’s decision in accordance with established child support principles, but rather simply, relied on the parties’ agreement to seek arbitration in the first place.', 'The property settlement agreement provides that Edward was responsible for the payment of all reasonable education expenses of his children. This is a form of child support and such awards are considered in light of established child support guidelines. Koziol v. Koziol, 720 A.2d 230, 233 (R.I. 1998). The child support guidelines encourage Family Court justices to exercise broad discretion and to take appropriate action, when application of the guidelines would be inequitable to the child or the parties. Id. Thus, we are of the opinion that the hearing justice should have reviewed the arbitrator’s', '-7- decision to determine whether his conclusion was inequitable to the parties or was in the child’s best interest.', 'We equally are satisfied, however, that the trial justice’s error was harmless. There is no evidence in the record before us demonstrating that the arbitrator’s decision was not in their son’s best interests; both parties agreed that he should remain at the Forman School. Additionally, there is no suggestion that the arbitrator’s decision was inequitable to Edward. The arbitrator noted in his decision that:', '“As of July 29, 2005, from the pleadings reviewed', '* * * [Edward] had at no time since 1996 motioned the', 'Family Court to review the issue of * * * reduction of', 'support and/or filed any type of objection to the minor child', '* * * attending Foreman [sic] School.

The applicant, Richard Cote, appeals from a Superior Court order denying his application for postconviction relief, wherein he sought to modify a sentence imposed in 1992 for multiple counts of robbery, conspiracy, and assault with a dangerous weapon. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On December 6, 1991, a grand jury indicted applicant on two counts of robbery, one count of conspiracy, four counts of felony assault with a dangerous weapon, four counts of', '-1- assault with intent to murder, and one count of discharging a firearm from a motor vehicle. On September 21, 1992, applicant entered nolo contendere pleas to the counts of robbery, conspiracy, and assault with a dangerous weapon; the state dismissed the counts of assault with intent to murder and discharging a firearm from a motor vehicle pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. He was thereafter sentenced to forty years in the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI) on each of the robbery counts, with twenty years to serve and twenty years suspended; ten years to serve on the conspiracy count; and twenty years to serve on each of the counts of assault with a dangerous weapon.', 'All sentences were to run concurrently.', 'At the time applicant entered his plea, the Department of Corrections (DOC) calculated all of the good-behavior and institutional-industries (work-time) credits that an inmate potentially could earn over the course of his or her period of incarceration at the beginning of his or her sentence and estimated that inmate’s earliest possible release date based on that calculation. We have referred to this as the so-called “up-front” method for the calculation of good-behavior and work-time credits, because', '“a convicted defendant, upon his [or her] arrival at the prison, and', 'before serving one day of his or her sentence, would be awarded', 'good prison behavior time credits as well as institutional industries', 'work time credits before that prisoner had exhibited any good', 'behavior or worked in any prison industry.” Barber v. Vose, 682', 'A.2d 908, 911 (R.I. 1996).', 'The applicant represents that, at the time of his plea, he was provided with a table setting forth estimated times to serve based on his sentence term. In light of this information, applicant believed that, if he accepted a plea of forty years with twenty years to serve, his actual time to serve would be approximately twelve years after consideration of all potential good-behavior and', '-2- work-time credits. 1 The applicant argues that he relied on the estimated time to serve set forth in the DOC table in agreeing to plea nolo contendere. 2', 'This Court reviewed the DOC’s method for calculating good-behavior and work-time credits in Barber v. Vose, 682 A.2d 908 (R.I. 1996). In that case, we held that the DOC’s “up- front” computation method was not consistent with the plain language of G.L. 1956 § 42-56-24. Barber, 682 A.2d at 917. Specifically, we noted that “good behavior or good time credits under our statute do not accrue as a matter of right,” id., and we stated that such credits should be awarded on a monthly basis only after an inmate has earned them during the preceding month. Id. at 914. The DOC thereafter altered its good-behavior and work-time-credit-calculation policy to comport with our holding. Under this new policy, the minimum time to serve on a twenty- year sentence is approximately 14.3 years.', 'Less than one year later, this Court addressed issues raised in more than 100 applications for postconviction relief that had been filed and heard by the Superior Court prior to our decision in Barber. See Leach v. Vose, 689 A.2d 393 (R.I. 1997). The applicants in Leach alleged that the DOC’s policy 3 of computing good-behavior and work-time credits on a monthly basis 1', 'The applicant was paroled in 2000, but was reincarcerated as a violator in 2006.

We noted in Leach, however, that the applicants’ constitutional arguments were equally applicable to the DOC policy post-Barber. See Leach, 689 A.2d at 397 n.2. Accordingly, we addressed the Leach applicants’ constitutional arguments “in light of the change required by Barber since that [was] the most recent change in [the good-behavior and work-time- credit-]calculation method.” Id.', '-3- violated various constitutional and statutory provisions.

This Court further held that the applicants’ constitutional rights were not violated by changes to the DOC’s good-behavior and work-time-credit-calculation methods. Id. at 397, 398. Specifically, the ex post facto clause “is not implicated when the [DOC] changes its procedures to conform to the mandates of [§ 42-56-24].” Leach, 689 A.2d at 397. Moreover, “[b]ecause * * * there is no liberty interest created by our good time and industrial time credit statute since it is completely discretionary, the [DOC’s] modification of its manner of calculating good time and industrial time credits does not implicate the due-process clause.” Id. at 398.', 'On August 21, 2007, approximately ten years after the DOC policy change, Mr. Cote filed an application for postconviction relief in the Superior Court seeking to vacate his nolo contendere pleas. 4 A hearing was held in the matter on April 3, 2008. At the hearing, applicant argued that he had relied on the DOC’s calculation of his minimum time to serve on a twenty- 4', 'Although both parties indicate that applicant sought to vacate his nolo contendere plea in his original application, nowhere in that application (nor at the hearing on the application) did he specifically request such relief. Instead, applicant requested relief in the form of an “adjustment” of his sentence to reflect the time he would have received under the earlier DOC method of calculation of good-behavior and work-time credit. The applicant did, however, raise and argue the fundamental issue underlying this case—namely, the question of whether the change in the DOC policy affected the knowing, intelligent, and voluntary nature of his plea—and the hearing justice made specific findings on that issue. At oral argument, applicant, through his counsel, explained that the relief sought is vacation of the original sentence and resentencing consistent with the DOC’s pre-1996 good-behavior and work-time-credit-calculation policy.', '-4- year prison sentence, which allegedly was provided to him prior to his plea. The state filed a motion to dismiss the application for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.', 'The hearing justice focused on the narrow issue of whether the DOC’s method of computing good-behavior and work-time credits affected the voluntariness of applicant’s plea; he did not review the transcript of applicant’s original plea hearing to evaluate the adequacy of the on-the-record examination of applicant prior to the taking of his plea. The hearing justice ruled that the “consequences” of a sentence agreed to in a plea agreement do not include “how the prison regulates and assesses its good time placement * * *.” The hearing justice further observed that it is beyond the purview of the courts to consider matters within the sole discretion of other agencies, including issues such as work-release eligibility and good-behavior-credit computation, when sentencing a defendant.', 'The state’s motion to dismiss was granted on April 3, 2008. An order was entered on April 7, 2008 dismissing the application. The applicant timely appealed to this Court.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'Pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-1(a)(1), “post-conviction relief is available to a defendant convicted of a crime who contends that his original conviction or sentence violated rights that the state or federal constitutions secured to him.” Young v. State, 877 A.2d 625, 628 (R.I. 2005). “This Court will not disturb a trial justice’s factual findings made on an application for post- conviction relief absent clear error or a showing that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence in arriving at those findings.” Bustamante v. Wall, 866 A.2d 516, 522 (R.I. 2005) (quoting Taylor v. Wall, 821 A.2d 685, 688 (R.I. 2003)). We review de novo “any post- conviction relief decision involving questions of fact or mixed questions of law and fact', '-5- pertaining to an alleged violation of an applicant’s constitutional rights.” Bleau v. Wall, 808 A.2d 637, 641-42 (R.I. 2002).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, applicant contends that the DOC’s “erroneous calculation of good time credits resulted in a misrepresentation [of] the minimum time he would be required to serve” in the ACI. 5 He asserts that he relied upon the DOC’s alleged representations in deciding to plea nolo contendere to the charges against him and to accept a sentence of forty years, with twenty years to serve. Because the information that allegedly formed the basis of his plea later was deemed unlawful, he suggests that “his plea was not knowing, intelligent and voluntary, and thus should be vacated.”', 'The decision to plead nolo contendere is not one to be taken lightly. In Rhode Island, a plea of nolo contendere is treated as a guilty plea. See State v. Feng, 421 A.2d 1258, 1266 (R.I. 1980). “A defendant entering such a plea ‘waives several federal constitutional rights and consents to judgment of the court.’” Id. at 1266. Thus, under Rule 11 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, “[t]he [Superior Court] shall not accept * * * a plea of nolo contendere without first addressing the defendant personally and determining that the plea is made voluntarily with understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea.” “The signal issue at a hearing for postconviction relief is whether a defendant knowingly and voluntarily entered his plea.” Beagen v. State, 705 A.2d 173, 175 (R.I. 1998). 5', 'The applicant suggests that the DOC’s erroneous calculation of his earliest potential release date “was a material factor in his decision to plea because the minimum period of time an inmate is actually required to serve is a true reflection of the inmate’s actual sentence.”', '-6-', 'As we previously have discussed, the DOC “can decide, within its discretion, whether to award good time and industrial time credits at all * * *.” Leach, 689 A.2d at 398. The Superior Court has no authority over the DOC’s decision-making in this area with respect to individual inmates.', 'Thus, such considerations do not implicate the court’s determination of the voluntariness of a plea. Cf. Skawinski v. State, 538 A.2d 1006, 1010-11 (R.I. 1988) (holding that the adoption of new parole guidelines at a time after petitioner’s plea does not retroactively affect the voluntariness of that plea because parole considerations played no role in the court’s sentencing function and the parole statute itself remained unchanged). We conclude, therefore, that applicant’s reliance on alleged DOC representations had no bearing on the knowing and voluntary nature of his plea.', 'Moreover, the applicant’s arguments must fail because he has not satisfied his burden of proof. An individual who files an application for postconviction relief “bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that [such] relief is warranted.” Gonder v. State, 935 A.2d 82, 84 n.1 (R.I. 2007). There was no evidence presented to the hearing justice on the application for postconviction relief, other than the applicant’s unsubstantiated assertions that he was “informed” by the DOC that he might serve a lesser time based upon a table circulated to inmates illustrating credits that could be received for good behavior and work time. There was no evidence of discussions before the Superior Court at the plea hearing concerning the applicant’s understanding of the voluntariness of his plea, or of discussions with his attorney concerning the same. Indeed, the applicant provided no documentation of good behavior and work time actually earned during his incarceration. Given the bare record before us, we can discern no basis upon which relief may be granted.', '-7-', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, the order of the Superior Court denying the application for postconviction relief is affirmed.

(Plainfield Pike Realty) 1 and Dashrath Patel (Dashrath). 2 The plaintiff, Plainfield Pike Gas & Convenience, LLC (Gas & Convenience, LLC or LLC), claiming to hold an interest under that agreement as the nominee of Dashrath, appeals from: (1) a summary judgment in favor of the defendant; (2) an order denying its motion for relief from judgment; and (3) an order removing the plaintiff’s attachment of the defendant’s real property. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'The defendant has acknowledged that it is a party to the contract at issue in this dispute although the contract was executed in the name of what apparently is a predecessor corporation, 1889 Plainfield Pike Leasing Corp. 2', 'We refer to Dashrath Patel by his first name because there is at least one other party with the same surname involved in this matter. We intend no disrespect.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'This dispute arises from a contract, executed in March 2002, for property at 1889 Plainfield Pike in Johnston, Rhode Island. The agreement identified defendant as the “landlord” and “Dashrath Patel * * * or his nominee” as the “tenant.” The contract recited that the tenant could not assign the agreement without the prior written consent of defendant.', 'Under the agreement, the tenant agreed to pay a $200,000 initial fee in exchange for the right to lease the premises. That sum was to be refunded in the event that conditions precedent set forth in Section 2 of the contract were not satisfied. Said conditions included construction of a convenience store and gasoline sales facility on the property by defendant on or before September 1, 2003. According to plaintiff, the investors in Gas & Convenience, LLC deposited a total of $175,000 into various accounts as directed by defendant.', 'The gas station and convenience store were not constructed by September 1, 2003, but an amendment was executed that month that extended the time for construction. The amendment stated that construction would be completed within four months of its commencement, weather conditions permitting. Further, the amendment identified Dashrath as the tenant and restated that the tenant could not assign the agreement without the written consent of defendant.', 'According to plaintiff, construction of the gas station and convenience store began in March 2004. Shortly thereafter, plaintiff LLC was formed. The plaintiff claims it subsequently asserted itself as Dashrath’s nominee in communications with defendant’s agents.', 'Similar transactions were alleged to have taken place in Connecticut and Rhode Island between defendant’s principal and some or all of the investors in plaintiff. In these transactions,', '-2- the tenant also was listed as “Dashrath Patel or his nominee,” and a limited liability company was formed that ultimately became the tenant under the various lease agreements.', 'At some point, Dashrath left the country and relocated to India. The convenience store and gas station were not completed as of 2007. As a result, plaintiff claims it made a demand for return of the $175,000, but defendant refused. The defendant admits that the premises were never delivered to plaintiff, but it denies plaintiff had any right to the premises or return of the $175,000.', 'The plaintiff filed a complaint in February 2005, as well as a motion to attach the subject real property, which was granted.', 'Because defendant did not answer, plaintiff filed an application for entry of a default judgment for failure to plead, which also was granted. Later, on December 8, 2005, defendant filed a motion to vacate the default judgment and remove the attachment. On February 20, 2006, the Superior Court vacated the entry of the default judgment, but continued the motion to vacate the writ of attachment. The defendant answered plaintiff’s complaint on February 20, 2006.', 'On September 14, 2007, defendant filed a motion for summary judgment that ultimately was heard and granted by the Superior Court on April 1, 2008. Final judgment in favor of defendant was entered by the Superior Court on April 9, 2008. Shortly after the summary- judgment hearing, plaintiff received an affidavit that was executed by Dashrath which, it asserts, establishes that plaintiff was Dashrath’s nominee under the agreement. The plaintiff moved for relief from judgment under Rule 60(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, arguing that the delay in post from India was beyond its control and amounted to excusable neglect. 3 3', 'According to plaintiff, the affidavit had been forwarded to Dashrath in India and executed by him on March 6, 2008, but it was not received until four days after the summary-judgment hearing on April 1, 2008.', '-3- The Superior Court denied plaintiff’s motion. 4 Shortly after the grant of summary judgment, defendant moved to remove the attachment on its property, which motion was granted on April 24, 2008.', 'The plaintiff timely appealed from the final judgment, from the denial of its motion to vacate, and from the order removing the attachment. The plaintiff then filed a motion in this Court seeking a stay of the removal of the attachment pending appeal. This Court issued an order on May 7, 2008, denying plaintiff’s motion to stay.', 'II', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Grant of Summary Judgment', 'The plaintiff argues that the Superior Court erred in granting summary judgment because questions of fact existed concerning whether plaintiff was a real party in interest. The defendant argues that plaintiff was neither a signatory to, nor a beneficiary of, the contract in question, nor did Dashrath assign the contract to plaintiff. Further, defendant argues plaintiff did not produce sufficient evidence to substantiate its assertion that plaintiff was Dashrath’s nominee 5 under the 4', 'Although both parties acknowledge that a motion for relief from judgment was filed and then denied by the court, we are unable to locate either the motion or an order denying the same in the record, nor does any docket entry reflect the entry of such an order. Accordingly, plaintiff’s appeal from the denial of its motion for relief from final judgment is not properly before us. 5', 'It should be noted that plaintiff did not allege it was Dashrath’s assignee which, according to the terms of the agreement, would have required defendant’s written approval. Rather, plaintiff alleged it was Dashrath’s nominee. While “nominee” is not defined in the contract, a nominee is traditionally “[a] person designated to act in place of another * * * in a very limited way” or “[a] party who holds bare legal title for the benefit of others or who receives and distributes funds for the benefit of others.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1149 (9th ed. 2009). On the other hand, assignment is the vehicle by which plaintiff could have assumed all the rights and obligations of tenancy; assignment is defined in the contract to include “an agreement by any person or entity', '-4- contract, and that such a contract would have had to have been in writing to satisfy the statute of frauds. 6', '“This Court reviews a trial justice’s decision to grant summary judgment on a de novo basis.” Credit Union Central Falls v. Groff, 966 A.2d 1262, 1267 (R.I. 2009). “[W]e will affirm a summary judgment ‘if, after reviewing the admissible evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, we conclude that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.’” DiBattista v. State, 808 A.2d 1081, 1085 (R.I. 2002) (quoting Woodland Manor III Associates v. Keeney, 713 A.2d 806, 810 (R.I. 1998)). A party “opposing a motion for summary judgment has the burden of proving by competent evidence the existence of a disputed issue of material fact and cannot rest” on allegations, denials in the pleadings, conclusions, or legal opinions. D’Allesandro v. Tarro, 842 A.2d 1063, 1065 (R.I. 2004) (quoting Santucci v. Citizens Bank of Rhode Island, 799 A.2d 254, 257 (R.I. 2002)). However, “[s]ummary judgment is an extreme remedy that should be applied cautiously.” Johnston v. Poulin, 844 A.2d 707, 710 (R.I. 2004) (quoting Sjogren v. Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Co., 703 A.2d 608, 610 (R.I. 1997)). Thus, “[i]f the affidavit of [a] nonmoving party alleges facts that, if believed, would constitute a valid defense, the affidavit must be taken as true and the motion denied.” Rotelli v. Cantanzaro, 686 A.2d 91, 93 (R.I. 1996).', 'In granting defendant’s motion for summary judgment, the motion justice framed the issue as “whether * * * plaintiff * * * [came] forward with admissible evidence to demonstrate a other than Tenant to directly or indirectly assume the obligations of Tenant * * * or * * * a transfer * * * of Tenant’s interest in this Lease.” See id. at 136. 6', 'The defendant additionally asserts in its brief that Dashrath forfeited any right he may have had to money provided to defendant because he was convicted of a crime of moral turpitude and was deported. Section 7(c)(8) of the contract states that the landlord may terminate the lease if the tenant is convicted of “any felony involving moral turpitude[.]” However, it became evident at oral argument that there is no evidence that Dashrath had, in fact, been convicted of any crime, nor that he had been deported.', '-5- genuine dispute about its * * * nominee status.” Finding no such evidence, she granted the motion. We agree with plaintiff, however, that it did present sufficient evidence to demonstrate outstanding issues of material fact that rendered summary judgment inappropriate.', 'In opposition to defendant’s motion for summary judgment, plaintiff submitted an affidavit executed by one of its members, Arvind Patel (Arvind). Additionally, plaintiff drew attention to the deposition of Demetrios Haseotes, the president and sole shareholder, director, and officer of defendant corporation.', 'In his affidavit, Arvind stated that plaintiff was Dashrath’s nominee under the contract, and affirmed that he and other investors in plaintiff LLC had joined in past commercial enterprises with Dashrath. He stated that they agreed to pool their resources and authorized Dashrath “to act on their behalf in negotiating leases and asset purchase agreements.” He further attested that he and the other investors agreed that, subsequent to Dashrath’s executing the agreement at issue, “a limited liability company would be formed as nominee of Dashrath * * * and thereby assume all rights and obligations of Dashrath * * * under said lease agreement.” Arvind stated that plaintiff LLC was formed around the time construction of the gasoline filling station and convenience store had begun, or was about to begin, in March 2004. He also stated that the described nominee arrangement in this case was consistent with prior dealings between the LLC’s investors and Mr. Haseotes.', 'Arvind further swore in his affidavit that after the LLC was formed there were communications between plaintiff’s agents and defendant’s agents in which plaintiff asserted its status as Dashrath’s nominee, without dispute. He additionally averred that $175,000 had been paid by plaintiff’s members under the contract as specifically directed by the principal of defendant. Finally, Arvind maintained that the parties engaged in extensive negotiations to', '-6- resolve the instant dispute and that no objection was raised to plaintiff’s status as tenant during that process.', 'The plaintiff also submitted to the Court a deposition of Mr. Haseotes, who acknowledged that he received $175,000, which money was to be applied for the purpose of the lease. When shown some of the checks received in payment of the $175,000, he verified they were drawn on accounts in the name of Arvind. Additionally, Mr. Haseotes confirmed that in previous lease agreements with Dashrath, in both Rhode Island and Connecticut, a limited liability company had been formed that eventually became the actual tenant.', 'The assertions contained in Arvind’s affidavit must be taken as true for the purposes of summary judgment. See Rotelli, 686 A.2d at 93. Further, Mr. Haseotes’ deposition testimony supports plaintiff’s contention that a nominee arrangement in this transaction would be consistent with the prior course of dealings between the parties. “The purpose of the summary-judgment procedure is to identify disputed issues of fact necessitating trial, not to resolve such issues.” Id. Further, “[s]ummary judgment is an extreme remedy that should be applied cautiously.” Sjogren, 703 A.2d at 610. Reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff, we conclude that an issue of material fact exists as to whether plaintiff was Dashrath’s nominee, which precluded a grant of summary judgment for defendant.', 'Additionally, defendant claims that plaintiff’s “assertion it is the nominee does not comply with the [s]tatute of [f]rauds.” G.L. 1956 § 9-1-4. The defendant, however, does not cite any supportive authority, nor does he develop this argument any further. We have held that “[s]imply stating an issue for appellate review, without a meaningful discussion thereof or legal briefing * * * does not assist the Court in focusing on the legal questions raised, and therefore', ""-7- constitutes a waiver of that issue.” Wilkinson v. State Crime Laboratory Com'n, 788 A.2d 1129, 1132 n.1 (R.I. 2002). Thus, defendant waived its argument regarding the statute of frauds."", 'Accordingly, we vacate the judgment entered in favor of defendant.', 'B', 'Removal of Attachment', 'Although the docket sheet clearly reflects that an order removing the attachment on the defendant’s property was entered on April 24, 2008, we are unable to locate such an order in the record.', 'Nevertheless, because we vacate the summary judgment entered in favor of the defendant, we also vacate any order removing the attachment and direct that the Superior Court, on remand, reinstate the writ of attachment.', 'III', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate both the judgment in favor of the defendant and any order removing attachment by the plaintiff of the defendant’s property at 1889 Plainfield Pike in Johnston.

The question before this Court is whether a Family Court justice retains the authority to place a juvenile in a facility other than the Training School when that juvenile has been certified under G.L. 1956 § 14-1-7.3 and sentenced to serve the period of the child’s minority “in the training school for youth in a facility to be designated by the court.” We granted the state’s request for review by writ of certiorari of a Family Court order placing a minor at Ocean Tides Residential Treatment Program (Ocean Tides), a facility dedicated to the treatment of male adolescents. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on February 9, 2010, pursuant to an order directing both parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised by this petition should not summarily be decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that the issues raised by this petition should be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the order of the Family Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In December 2007, when he was sixteen years old, Paul Harrison sexually assaulted a young woman, whom he described as a friend. 1 Because of the serious nature of the allegations, the state requested that the Family Court waive its jurisdiction over Harrison, so that he could be tried as an adult. 2 But, on June 16, 2008, after an agreement apparently had been reached, the state requested that Harrison’s waiver hearing be converted to a certification hearing. A Family 1', 'Although we ordinarily refrain from using a minor’s full name in Family Court matters, Harrison’s name is in the public domain by nature of G.L. 1956 § 14-1-7.3(h). 2', 'Section 14-1-7.1 provides:', '“(a) Upon a motion by the attorney general pursuant to §', '14-1-7, the court shall conduct a hearing at which it shall be the', 'duty of the attorney general to produce evidence to enable the', 'court to determine:', '“(1) That probable cause exists to believe that the offense', 'charged has been committed and that the child charged has', 'committed it, unless the proof has been elicited at a prior hearing', 'on detention of the juvenile and the findings have been made by', 'the same justice of the family court who is conducting the waiver', 'proceeding; and', ""“(2) That the child's past history of offenses, history of"", 'treatment, or the heinous or premeditated nature of the offense is', 'such that the court finds that the interests of society or the', 'protection of the public necessitate the waiver of jurisdiction of the', 'court over the child.', '“(b) If the court finds that subdivisions (a)(1) and (a)(2) of', 'this section have been proven by a preponderance of evidence, it', 'may waive jurisdiction over the child and refer the child to the', 'appropriate adult court to be tried for the offense as an adult.', '“(c) A waiver of jurisdiction over a child pursuant to this', 'section shall constitute a waiver of jurisdiction over that child for', 'the offense upon which the motion is based as well as for all', 'pending and subsequent offenses of whatever nature, and the child', 'shall be referred to the court which would have had jurisdiction if', 'the offense had been committed by an adult. In the event that the', 'child is acquitted of the offense for which the waiver has been', 'sought, the waiver shall be vacated.”', '-2- Court justice certified him and, after Harrison pleaded nolo contendere to first-degree sexual assault, the justice sentenced him to fifteen years imprisonment at the Adult Correctional Institutions, with five years to be served at the Training School and ten years suspended. 3', 'On January 12, 2009, Harrison appeared before the Family Court for a periodic review of his progress. At that hearing, the state and the Public Defender agreed that Harrison was doing well at the Training School; he had received a GED, had made progress in his sex-offender treatment, and he was free of serious disciplinary citations. The Public Defender, citing the impressive nature of Harrison’s progress, suggested that when the court next reviewed his case a few months later, it might consider him for a “step-down program,” such as a group-home placement. 4', 'When the Family Court justice inquired about which program might be appropriate, the Public Defender offered several possibilities, and she also mentioned that Ocean Tides had earlier accepted him into its program. Without further inquiry, the Family Court justice ordered Harrison’s immediate transfer to Ocean Tides as a Temporary Community Placement (TCP). He explained to Harrison, “[y]oung man, you’re doing very well. That’s why I gave you a break, you understand?”', 'On January 16, 2009, the state filed a motion asking the court to reconsider its order, which the Family Court justice denied. On January 21, 2009, the state requested a stay in Family Court. 5 It also filed a petition for certiorari and a motion to stay the Family Court justice’s order in this Court. We granted the state’s petition for writ of certiorari, and on February 9, 2009, we 3', 'We do not have the record of the June 16, 2008, hearing at which Harrison was certified, pleaded nolo contendere, and was sentenced, and we presume that there was compliance with the statutory requirements of § 14-1-7.2. 4', 'Although perhaps a bit ambiguous, the state also seemed to have contemplated a future placement outside of the Training School for Harrison.

He testified that Harrison was a good candidate for the facility’s sex-offender program. He also said that Ocean Tides previously had accepted certified youths into its program as TCPs, including one who had been convicted of attempted murder. The state presented no evidence whatsoever at the hearing, and it dedicated the majority of its cross-examination of Brother Shafer to establishing that Ocean Tides was not a locked facility and that it had less rigorous supervision than the Training School.', 'The Family Court justice issued his decision on February 25, 2009. After finding Brother Shafer’s testimony to be credible, the justice addressed the legal arguments of the parties. He rejected the state’s argument that transferring a certified minor to Ocean Tides as a TCP amounted to a modification of the minor’s sentence as set forth in § 14-1-42. 6 Rather, the 6', 'Section 14-1-42 provides in relevant part:', '“(c) In any case where a child has been certified and', 'adjudicated pursuant to §§ 14-1-7.2 and 14-1-7.3, and sentenced', 'pursuant to § 14-17.3(a)(2)[sic], the court shall schedule a review', 'of the child’s case thirty (30) days prior to the child’s eighteenth', 'birthday or thirty (30) days prior to the one-year anniversary of the', 'imposition of the sentence, whichever is greater.

To protect society from these more or less hopeless cases, the Family Court may waive a child from its jurisdiction so that he may be tried as an adult and punished accordingly upon a finding of guilt. Section 14-1-7.1. In 1990, as a middle ground between these polar opposites, the General Assembly also provided for certification, the process selected for Harrison.', 'The certification process is set forth in chapter 1 of title 14 of the General Laws. Section 14-1-7(c) permits the attorney general to institute a certification hearing with respect to any minor “who is charged with an offense which would constitute a felony if committed by an adult.” At such a hearing, the attorney general must demonstrate that (1) “[p]robable cause exists to believe that the offense charged has been committed and that the child charged has committed it[,]” (2) “[t]he child’s past history of offenses, history of treatment, or the heinous or premeditated nature of the offense is such that the court finds that the interests of society or the protection of the public necessitate the certification[,]” and (3) “[t]he jurisdiction of the court but for the exercise of certification is in all likelihood an insufficient period of time in which to accomplish a rehabilitation of the child.” Section 14-1-7.2. Certification allows the minor to be tried as an adult in Family Court, but affords the justice with broader options when he imposes a sentence. 10 In the case before us, the Family Court justice opted to “[i]mpose a sentence upon 10', 'Section 14-1-7.3(a) provides:', '“Upon a finding by the court that the child is subject to', 'certification pursuant to § 14-1-7.2, the court shall afford the child', 'a right to a jury trial, and upon conviction for the offense charged,', 'the court shall sentence the child in accordance with one of the', 'following alternatives:', '“(1) Impose a sentence upon the child to the training school', 'for youth until the time that the child attains the age of nineteen', '(19) years;', '“(2) Impose a sentence upon the child for a period in excess', 'of the child’s nineteenth birthday to the adult correctional', '-8- the child for a period in excess of the child’s nineteenth birthday to the adult correctional institutions, with the period of the child’s minority to be served in the training school for youth in a facility to be designated by the court.” Section 14-1-7.3(a)(2).', 'The nub of the parties’ dispute lies in their differing interpretations of the statutory clause “to be served in the training school for youth in a facility to be designated by the court.” The state contends that this clause plainly says that a Family Court justice may not place a certified juvenile at Ocean Tides because that facility is outside of the Training School. On the other hand, defendant argues that the phrase contemplates and provides the Family Court with discretion with regard to placement, because the Training School consists of merely one long- term facility for boys. Thus, in defendant’s view, to require that a certified juvenile must be confined at the Training School would reduce the statutory phrase in § 14-1-7.3(a)(2) “in a facility to be designated by the court” to mere surplusage.', 'We begin our consideration of this question, as we must, by carefully reviewing the plain language of the specific statute in question. After examining the statute, we believe that the language “to be served in the training school for youth in a facility to be designated by the court” is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation. The meaning of the term “the training school” would appear, at the outset, to be reasonably clear. “The training school” would seem to be a singular entity, an impression that is reinforced by the use of the more concrete word “in” rather than the more general “to” to describe a certified juvenile’s sentence. Moreover, G.L. 1956 § 42-72-17.2(a) provides a very specific definition of the Training School as “consist[ing] of a youth development center, a youth assessment center and a female correctional treatment', 'institutions, with the period of the child’s minority to be served in', 'the training school for youth in a facility to be designated by the', 'court. However, the sentence shall not exceed the maximum', 'sentence provided for by statute for conviction of the offense.”', '-9- facility.” However, that seeming clarity is befogged considerably by the clause’s next phrase, which adds “in a facility to be designated by the court.” Although the Training School is made up of three nominal facilities, a juvenile’s long-term placement is determined by gender, leaving no discretion to the Family Court justice. Such a construction, however, would relegate the second phrase of the statutory clause to “mere surplusage.” Thus, we must conclude that the statutory language is ambiguous.', 'Consequently, we must construe § 14-1-7.3 in the context of the entire juvenile justice statutory framework to glean the intent of the legislature when it enacted this ambiguous provision. The state directs us to § 14-1-42, which it maintains supports its position, because that statute provides for strict limitations on the modification of a sentence in the case of a certified child. The state is correct that the provision prohibits a Family Court justice from modifying the sentence of a certified youth until “thirty (30) days prior to the child’s eighteenth birthday or thirty (30) days prior to the one-year anniversary of the imposition of the sentence, whichever is greater.” Section 14-1-42(c). Further, to modify a sentence, the Family Court justice must be satisfied that clear and convincing evidence “demonstrates that the person has made sufficient efforts at rehabilitation and that the modification of the order of certification would not pose a threat to the safety of the public * * *.” Id.', 'We believe, however, that the state’s reliance on the language of § 14-1-42 is misplaced, because we do not agree that the placement of Harrison at Ocean Tides is a modification of his sentence under the statute. The use of the term “modification” in this provision is somewhat misleading. In fact, § 14-1-42 applies to the limited circumstances in which “the court may suspend, but shall not vacate, the balance of the [juvenile’s] sentence.” See In re Nicholas V., 622 A.2d 447, 449 (R.I. 1993) (“Section 14-1-42 provides specific procedures for suspending the', '- 10 - rest of a sentence imposed pursuant to § 14-1-7.3(b)”). Because the Family Court justice did not modify Harrison’s sentence within the meaning of § 14-1-42, this provision is not controlling.', 'Rather, we believe that § 14-1-36.1, entitled “Release from training school,” provides the best vehicle for resolving this dispute. 11 The state argues that § 14-1-36.1(b) applies only to youths found to be delinquent or wayward and does not contemplate community placement for certified youths. We disagree.', 'A review of the history of § 14-1-36.1 is instructive. Before 2008, § 14-1-36.1(a) cloaked a Family Court justice with broad discretion to release a delinquent or wayward juvenile from the Training School. 12 Moreover, § 14-1-36.1(b) allowed for “[a] child so sentenced” to be 11', 'Section 14-1-36.1, as amended by P.L. 2008, ch. 9, art. 17, § 10 provides:', '“(a) No child sentenced to the training school for youth,', 'after being found delinquent or wayward, shall be released prior to', 'the end of his or her sentence unless authorized by a justice of the', 'family court, after a hearing with due notice to the parties to the', 'petition upon which the child was sentenced. At any such hearing,', 'the family court shall authorize the release of the child to his or her', 'home and/or to the care and custody of the department of children,', 'youth and families unless the court finds that the child:', '“(1) Poses a substantial risk of harm to self; or', '“(2) Poses a substantial risk of harm to others; or', '“(3) Has demonstrated that he or she may leave the', 'jurisdiction of the court.', '“Provided, however, any child who has been certified and', 'adjudicated pursuant to §§ 14-1-7.2 and 14-1-7.3, may not be', 'released prior to the end of his or her sentence, except as', 'authorized under § 14-1-42 of this chapter.', '“(b) A child so sentenced may be allowed as part of a', 'rehabilitation program to be placed temporarily in a community', 'program outside of the training school only when authorized by the', 'family court.” 12', 'Section 14-1-36.1, as enacted by P.L. 1990, ch. 430, § 1 provided:', '“(a) No child sentenced to the training school for youth,', 'after being found delinquent or wayward, shall be released prior to', 'the end of his or her sentence unless authorized by a justice of the', 'family court, after a hearing with due notice to the parties to the', 'petition upon which the child was sentenced.', '- 11 - placed in a TCP. In 2008, the General Assembly amended subsection (a) of § 14-1-36.1 to require the Family Court justice to make more stringent findings before releasing a delinquent or wayward youth who had been sentenced to the Training School. P.L. 2008, ch. 9, art. 12, § 2. Furthermore, as a prophylactic measure against any ambiguity, the General Assembly included within subsection (a) an explicit reaffirmation that § 14-1-42 exclusively governs the release of certified juveniles. P.L. 2008, ch. 9, art. 12, § 2.', 'It is within the context of the statute’s evolution that we analyze the current language. The first paragraph of subsection (a) begins “[n]o child sentenced to the training school for youth, after being found delinquent or wayward * * *.” Section 14-1-36.1. It is clear that the remainder of the subsection’s language applies only to the release of children who satisfy two independent conditions: (1) that they have been sentenced to the Training School and (2) that they have been adjudicated delinquent or wayward. The General Assembly’s 2008 amendment to subsection (a) added new language that applies to a second category of juveniles who have been (1) sentenced to the Training School and (2) certified under § 14-1-7.3.', 'Significantly, the pre-2008 version of subsection (b) in § 14-1-36.1 begins merely, “[a] child so sentenced.” Rather than explicitly referring to a child who meets both conditions of a sentence to the Training School and an adjudication of delinquency or waywardness, the General Assembly chose the more general language of “[a] child so sentenced.” Moreover, when it amended § 14-1-36.1, the General Assembly preserved this broader language. The General Assembly could have distinguished delinquent or wayward juveniles from certified juveniles as', '“(b) A child so sentenced may be allowed as part of a', 'rehabilitation program to be placed temporarily in a community', 'program outside of the training school only when authorized by the', 'family court.”', '- 12 - it did in subsection (a), but it made no such distinction. We therefore construe the predicate in subsection (b), “[a] child so sentenced,” to refer to any child sentenced to the Training School for youth, whether by adjudication of waywardness or delinquency or after certification and subsequent conviction. Accordingly, reading § 14-1-7.3(a) together with § 14-1-36.1(b), we conclude that the General Assembly intended to vest the Family Court with broad authority to order a TCP for children sentenced to the Training School, even when they have been certified. 13', 'Finally, the state argues that such an interpretation of the statute would be inconsistent with the policy aims underpinning the certification statute. It invokes the painful memory, discussed in our opinion in Rock v. State, 681 A.2d 901 (R.I. 1996), of the rape and murder of a seventeen-year-old female by an eighteen-year-old male who had been sentenced to the Training School pursuant to a delinquency adjudication after he raped and attempted to murder a twelve- year-old girl. Id. at 905-06. The state emphasizes that this horrific crime occurred while the delinquent juvenile was enrolled in a private vocational school as a TCP. We are very much aware that the public’s perception that the juvenile system was overly lenient toward young offenders was the impetus behind the General Assembly’s creation of the certification process in 1990. See John J. Cloherty III, Note, The Serious Juvenile Offender in the Adult Criminal System: The Jurisprudence of Rhode Island’s Waiver and Certification Procedures, 26 Suffolk U. L. Rev. 407, 407, 424-25 (1992) (discussing public outcry when thirteen-year-old Craig Price murdered a neighbor and then, at age fifteen, brutally slaughtered a mother and her two children, but received only the maximum allowable sentence of detention at the Training School until age twenty-one). 13', 'Although perhaps the word “appropriate” in G.L. 1956 § 14-1-6.2 engenders some ambiguity, we are further buoyed in our interpretation by the General Assembly’s 2007 requirement (P.L. 2007, ch. 532, § 2) that the Family Court justice in all cases “consider placing the juvenile in the least restrictive appropriate facility or program.”', '- 13 -', 'This Court recognizes and appreciates the state’s obligation to protect the public from dangerous juveniles. Although “the best interests of the child” ordinarily is the lodestar in Family Court matters, we have long recognized the need “to strike a balance between the desirability of rehabilitating the offending child on the one hand and the need to protect the security of the community on the other.” Knott v. Langlois, 102 R.I. 517, 527, 231 A.2d 767, 772 (1967). The certification statute plainly represents the General Assembly’s recognition of these different and, at times, conflicting policy aims by explicitly requiring a Family Court justice not only to find by a preponderance of the evidence that the child likely has committed the offense charged but also that (1) “[t]he child’s past history of offenses, history of treatment, or the heinous or premeditated nature of the offense is such that the court finds the interests of society or the protection of the public necessitate the certification” and (2) “[t]he jurisdiction of the court but for the exercise of certification is in all likelihood an insufficient period of time in which to accomplish a rehabilitation of the child.” Section 14-1-7.2(a)(2)(3). 14 The requirement for those findings ensures that certification is reserved for those juveniles whose crimes are sufficiently serious that a transition to a more balanced approach of punishment is appropriate, even though the overarching goal of rehabilitation is not abandoned. The General Assembly has elected, as a matter of policy, to hold out hope for the rehabilitation of certified juveniles. In this 14', 'See Laureen D’Ambra, Legal Response to Juvenile Crime: Why Waiver of Juvenile Offenders is Not a Panacea, 2 Roger Williams U. L. Rev. 277, 291 (1997),', '“In keeping with the national trend, Rhode Island law has', 'shifted away from its previous rehabilitative emphasis by', 'expanding legal provisions for treating juveniles as adults. * * *', 'Certification retains rehabilitation as a goal, but as a mechanism', 'for long-term ‘adult’ sentences, it is not generally in the child’s', 'best interest. In addition, automatic certification of repeat', 'offenders over age sixteen creates an irrebuttable presumption that', 'these offenders are unlikely to be rehabilitated. Finally,', 'certification also may result in reverse effects on punishment, if the', 'family court imposes harsher sentences than the superior court.”', '- 14 - case, the Family Court justice has made factual findings that Ocean Tides would provide Harrison with “the best opportunity to rehabilitate himself,” findings that the state conspicuously has not challenged. We conclude that the TCP of a certified youth is not plainly inconsistent with the policy aims of the certification statute and, therefore, hold that a justice of the Family Court is cloaked with the authority to temporarily place a certified juvenile at a facility in the community, such as Ocean Tides.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, the order of the Family Court is affirmed.

We are confronted with a scant record of the facts underlying this serious felony crime. However, the juvenile sex offender evaluation report that was ordered by the Family Court and prepared by a clinical social worker set forth the factual allegations of this sexual assault; suffice it to say, this was a serious felony.', '- 15 - Adult Correctional Institutions, five years to serve (after the period of his minority was served at the Rhode Island Training School), followed by a ten-year suspended sentence and probation.', 'As is customary during the course of an adversary proceeding, this disposition was the result of a negotiated plea in which the state agreed to withdraw its petition for a waiver of Family Court jurisdiction over Harrison in exchange for certification in accordance with § 14-1- 7.3 and a term of incarceration beyond Harrison’s minority. Negotiated plea dispositions are part of the foundation upon which our system of criminal justice rests. However, as the travel of this case demonstrates, adherence to these principles and even a basic understanding of the law as it relates to certification of juvenile offenders painfully was absent in this case.', 'Six months after the plea, during Harrison’s first review before the Family Court, the chief judge of that court, sua sponte, ordered Harrison transferred from the Training School, where he was midway through a rehabilitation program, and placed in temporary community placement. Although the suitability and efficacy of Ocean Tides and its rehabilitative programs for the state’s youth, including those who have been certified in accordance with § 14-1-7.3, is well known and unquestioned, the manner in which this order was issued, without regard to the parties (and the young victim), was inappropriate. Significantly, neither party sought nor asked for the issuance of this extraordinary relief, it was issued by a jurist who, the record reflects, appears to have had no understanding of the nature of the charge or the legal significance of statutory certification. See Direct Action for Rights and Equality v. Gannon, 713 A.2d 218, 225 (R.I. 1998) (stating that it is inappropriate for a trial justice to award a party relief that the party has not requested).', 'At the review proceeding, the chief judge was informed that Harrison had been sentenced in June 2008, that he had obtained a GED, completed substance-abuse counseling, and was', '- 16 - progressing in the sex-offender unit of the Training School.', 'According to the prosecutor, Harrison was in the beginning stages of treatment and eventually could be transitioned into a step-down program, but the prosecutor added that the Training School was “not willing to transition him at this time.” Significantly, Harrison’s lawyer asked for another review date in a few months. The Training School representative recommended a remand to that facility and suggested that a step-down program would be possible at some future time. Among the possible step-down options discussed were “Communities for People” or “Turning the Corner.” However, the tenor of the proceeding changed when defense counsel indicated that Harrison had been accepted at Ocean Tides before the plea in this case.

His only colloquy with Harrison was the following:', '“The Court: Young man, you’re doing very well. That’s why I', 'gave you a break, you understand?', '“[Harrison]: Thank you, sir.”', 'Four days later, on January 16, 2009, the chief judge again took up this case. The state filed a motion to reconsider placement at Ocean Tides, based on the fact that Harrison had been certified and stood convicted of a felony. According to the prosecutor, Harrison had been certified by the Family Court based on the fact that he was incarcerated “on a pretty bad first degree sexual assault.”', 'The motion to reconsider was denied again, without findings or explanation.', 'Five days later, on January 21, 2009, the parties again appeared before the chief judge. As is required by Article I, Rule 8 of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure, a party must first seek a stay of an order in the lower court before this Court will entertain such a request. Although the prosecutor indicated that the state intended to seek review in the Supreme Court, the chief judge refused to decide the motion for a stay.

This Court noted that the record did not support the requisite factual and legal underpinnings for a transfer to community placement.

39,"William J. Nye : v. : Paul G. Brousseau et al. : Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty, and Robinson, JJ. OPINION Justice Flaherty, for the Court. “Good fences make good neighbours.”1 William J. Nye appeals from a Superior Court judgment that fixed the boundary dividing his property from that of his neighbors, the defendants, Paul G. Brousseau and Susan J. Brousseau, enjoined Nye from trespassing on the Brousseaus’ property, and awarded the Brousseaus damages on the basis of breach of contract. This case came before the Court for oral argument on April 8, 2010, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After hearing the parties’ arguments and considering the memoranda they submitted, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide this appeal without further briefing or argument. For the 1 Robert Frost, “Mending Wall,” North of Boston (1914), quoted in The Oxford Dictionary of Modern Quotations 86 (Tony Augarde ed. 1991). -1- reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the Superior Court’s judgment in part and vacate it in part. I Facts and Travel Nye’s parents, now deceased, purchased the property at 251 Tiffany Avenue, Warwick, Rhode Island in 1964. Nye himself resided at that address during his childhood, until 1977. As an adult, he resumed living at 251 Tiffany Avenue in 1992, until the present. He purchased the property from his father’s estate in March 2003. Between 1964 and 1966, Nye’s mother planted evergreen bushes, known as Japanese yews, in a row extending from the northern to the southern end of the property and on the western edge of 251 Tiffany Avenue, abutting the next-door property of 265 Tiffany Avenue. The bushes are located adjacent to the properties’ respective driveways. Over the years, the yews grew to be quite tall, at times reaching in excess of fifteen feet. In 1979, Paul and V. Tang Lintereur purchased the property at 265 Tiffany Avenue. According to an affidavit signed by the Lintereurs, the couple did not consider themselves to be the owners of these bushes when they lived at that address and “did not consider the boundary bushes to be part of [their] former property.” Rather, they “always believed [that the Nyes] owned the boundary bushes.” According to Nye, he, too, “always considered the land to the east of the evergreen * * * to be our land.” In 2003, the Lintereurs sold the property at 265 Tiffany Avenue to the Brousseaus. In September or October 2003, Mr. Brousseau asked Nye if he could trim and remove bushes to improve his visibility while he exited and entered his driveway. Nye said that he appreciated that Brousseau asked for his permission before trimming the bushes, and so he assented to -2- Brousseau’s pruning and removal of those bushes that obscured the view from the Brousseaus’ driveway. Later, in the spring of 2004, Brousseau discussed trimming the bushes again to shorten them, and Nye again agreed. Soon after, the pair discussed removing debris from the corner of their respective properties, extracting stumps from between their garages, and replacing a couple of defoliated yews with arborvitae shrubbery. According to Brousseau, Nye assumed that the boundary between their properties “was somewhere near the bushes in a north-south direction,” but that Nye thought that a survey should be conducted. Brousseau testified that he expressed his concern about the expense of a survey, and so Nye agreed to contribute half of the cost of the survey.2 According to Nye, he “was being generous” when he agreed to pay half the survey’s cost. In early September 2005, Nye and Brousseau again discussed the maintenance of the row of bushes. During this conversation, they agreed to remove the bushes at the properties’ southern end and replace them with arborvitae. Brousseau cut and removed the bushes, leaving several stumps near the adjacent driveways. Nye assisted Brousseau in removing one of the stumps, but Brousseau decided to hire a professional to remove the remaining stumps. Sometime later, Brousseau broached the topic of extending his retaining wall, which, according to Brousseau, prompted Nye to again suggest that a survey be conducted before any extension was initiated. Brousseau agreed to have a survey conducted, and he hired a surveyor who completed the survey in November 2005. The surveyor discovered a granite boundary marker in the southeastern corner of the Brousseaus’ property and placed a metal stake in a portion of Nye’s driveway. The surveyor concluded that a portion of Nye’s driveway and a 2 Nye also said that Brousseau asked him to pay only a quarter of the cost of the survey because the surveyor would be surveying the entirety of the Brousseaus’ lot, most of which had nothing to do with the boundary issue. -3- portion of the southernmost bushes were actually on the Brousseaus’ property. Brousseau provided Nye with a copy of the survey, but Nye disputed its accuracy and declined to reimburse the Brousseaus for any portion of the survey’s cost. Nye maintained that “[i]t was [the Brousseaus’] project” and “it wasn’t my survey.” According to Nye, no agreement existed “as to payment.” Nye and Brousseau also disputed the placement of trash and recycling bins in the vicinity of what each perceived to be the boundary between their properties. Brousseau asked Nye to remove his trash cans, but, according to Brousseau, Nye refused. On one occasion, Brousseau moved Nye’s trash cans to “the other side of the survey line,” but Nye moved them back because they were damaging the grass. Nye also said that he showed Brousseau the affidavit from the Lintereurs memorializing their belief as to the location of the boundary, but Brousseau did not see any significance in that document. The men exchanged words, and Brousseau described himself as “emotional” at that time. According to Brousseau, Nye then informed him that he was going to have his own survey conducted. Later, at the end of June 2006, Nye again contacted the Warwick police in connection with the dispute about the proper location of the trash and recycling containers. Brousseau showed the responding police officer a copy of the survey indicating that he owned the land in question, and the officer talked to Nye and departed. As a result, Nye moved his trash cans. On August 14, 2006, Brousseau trimmed the remaining yews.3 According to Brousseau, he placed the branches that he cut on the side of his driveway. Nye took issue with this work because he said that he had refused Brousseau’s request to cut those bushes. In response, Nye 3 Currently, seven of the original Japanese yews and two stumps remain. -4- contacted the Warwick Police Department “to make a record of the event.” An officer came and talked to both parties, and, according to Nye, “that was basically the end of it.” Nye filed a pro se complaint against the Brousseaus in Superior Court on August 9, 2006, in which he alleged that he had requested that the Brousseaus obtain a survey of their property and asserted that he “contest[ed] the location of the disputed boundary.” He claimed that “the boundary * * * between the Nye real estate and the Brousseau real estate is a line, which follows a row of bushes.” He alleged that before the survey was completed, the Brousseaus did not believe that the area included within their surveyed boundary was part of their property. Nye further alleged that the Brousseaus are “liable in trespass for traveling in, and beyond, the disputed area, and for moving [his] recycling bins.” He claimed that the parties “and former owners and users of both properties have demonstrated mutual acquiescence regarding their respect of [Nye’s] asserted boundary.” He sought a temporary restraining order and permanent injunctive relief to prevent the Brousseaus “from trespass of the asserted boundary line,” “[a]n order declaring the true boundary line,” and “[a]ny other such equitable relief as the Court may allow.” As part of their answer to Nye’s complaint, the Brousseaus raised two counterclaims. First, they sought a declaratory judgment that the boundary line dividing the two properties was as determined in the survey conducted in November 2005. Second, they sought a temporary restraining order and injunction preventing Nye from entering their property, placing his personal property upon it, or parking motor vehicles on their property. For both counts of the counterclaim, the Brousseaus also requested that they “be granted such other and further relief as [the Superior Court] shall deem appropriate and the circumstances of the case may require.” -5- A nonjury trial was held before a justice of the Superior Court on June 16, 17, 19, and 30, 2008, and July 7, 2008. Nye represented himself during these proceedings, while the Brousseaus were represented by counsel.4 Nye called several witnesses, including his brother, a landscape arborist who testified about the value of the shrubbery, the Brousseaus’ surveyor, who was under subpoena, and himself. The trial justice allowed video recordings of the Lintereurs’ depositions into evidence. At the close of plaintiff’s case, the Brousseaus moved for judgment as a matter of law. In response to defendants’ motion, Nye argued to the trial justice that the boundary should run along the edge of the bushes’ trunks so that each trunk is entirely on his property, but he acknowledged that that was the “ideal location” and that a boundary running through the center of the trunks was “a possible solution.” The trial justice denied the motion because he wished to hear testimony from the Brousseaus, as well. The trial justice’s decision was entered on September 23, 2008. He issued an injunction preventing the Brousseaus “from passing onto Mr. Nye’s property.” He also ruled that because Nye “demonstrated that at the time of the August 2006 trimming, he was in possession of one- half of the shrubs near the border,” Brousseau converted Nye’s portion of ownership in the shrubbery when he undertook “his significant trimming” on August 14, 2006. Taking into consideration the positive effects that Brousseau’s trimming had on the shrubbery, the trial justice set the value of the damage from the trimming of the nine shrubs at $2,200, and he awarded Nye damages in the amount of $1,100, reflecting his one-half ownership of the shrubbery. With respect to the boundary question, the trial justice ruled that the row of shrubbery was “sufficiently obvious to command notice of [Nye’s] claim of ownership.” Therefore, 4 Counsel filed an entry of appearance in Superior Court on behalf of Nye on December 22, 2008. That attorney represents Nye before this Court. -6- because Nye “demonstrated that the row of shrubbery has existed for a sufficient period of time,” the shrubbery represented the boundary between the properties under the doctrine of title by acquiescence. The trial justice found that “[t]he new boundary shall run from the granite bound, which is the northernmost border of the two properties, southward until the northernmost yew, then turning and running along the centerline of the yews to the southernmost yew, then turning slightly eastward and running directly to the point which is the edge of Mr. Nye’s paved driveway at its intersection with Tiffany Avenue.” However, the trial justice went on to say, “Any property interest clarified, confirmed or conveyed to Mr. Nye by this Decision shall be invalid until it is set forth in a Judgment, duly approved by the Court and sufficiently describing this line.” He directed Nye to prepare a survey description for inclusion in the final judgment. Acknowledging that the Brousseaus “prayed for an award of any other relief that the Court may deem equitable and just,” the trial justice ruled that “[t]he Brousseaus established that Mr. Nye breached an agreement to pay for one-half of the cost of the surveyor’s bill” and “[a]n award of costs for the [Brousseaus] is most appropriate here.” Therefore, in recognition of the value of this survey to Nye in preparation for and during the trial proceedings, the trial justice ruled that the Brousseaus were to “be awarded one-half of the cost of the survey as Mr. Nye originally agreed.” Finally, he enjoined Nye from entering the Brousseaus’ “real estate without the consent of either Mr. or Mrs. Brousseau.”5 Nye filed a motion to amend the decision on September 29, 2008, which the trial justice denied. Final judgment was entered on October 29, 2008. To comply with the trial justice’s decision, Nye prepared and submitted an order with an attached surveyor’s description of the 5 The trial justice also enjoined Mr. Brousseau from entering “Mr. Nye’s real estate without the consent of Mr. Nye.” -7- new boundary line to the Superior Court on November 12, 2008. This legal description of the border was reflected in the amended final judgment that was entered on April 30, 2009.6 Nye timely appealed to this Court. II Issues on Appeal Nye raises three issues on appeal. First, he argues that, although the trial justice correctly ruled that the doctrine of acquiescence applied, he “erred in fixing the boundary between the two properties through the center of the trunks of the first and last bushes, rather than with reference to where the bushes were before the Brousseaus removed them in 2004, and by not locating the bushes entirely on the Nye property.” Second, he contends that the trial justice erred when he issued an injunction preventing him from entering the Brousseaus’ property without their consent. Third, he argues that the trial justice erred when he entered judgment in favor of the Brousseaus on an “unasserted” breach-of-contract claim. III Standard of Review We “will not disturb the findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury in a civil matter ‘unless such findings are clearly erroneous or unless the trial justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence or unless the decision fails to do substantial justice between the parties.’” Union Station Associates v. Rossi, 862 A.2d 185, 193 (R.I. 2004) (quoting Harris v. Town of Lincoln, 668 A.2d 321, 326 (R.I. 1995)). This is so because “[t]he task of determining the credibility of witnesses is peculiarly the function of the trial justice when sitting without a jury.” 6 In an order that was entered on December 4, 2008, the trial justice appears to have denied Nye’s filed survey map as insufficient to comply with the decision’s requirement that he submit a survey description. -8- Houde v. State, 973 A.2d 493, 498 (R.I. 2009) (quoting McEntee v. Davis, 861 A.2d 459, 464 (R.I. 2004)). This Court also applies a deferential standard of review to the trial justice’s “resolution of mixed questions of law and fact, as well as the inferences and conclusions drawn from the testimony and evidence * * *.” Id. (quoting Narragansett Electric Co. v. Carbone, 898 A.2d 87, 97 (R.I. 2006)). However, we review questions of law de novo. Id. (citing Fleet National Bank v. 175 Post Road, LLC, 851 A.2d 267, 273 (R.I. 2004)). IV Discussion A Boundary Determination Under the doctrine of acquiescence, “even when there has been no express agreement, adjoining landowners are ‘precluded from denying a boundary line recognized by both owners for a length of time equal to that prescribed by the statute of limitations barring a right of reentry.” Acampora v. Pearson, 899 A.2d 459, 464 (R.I. 2006) (quoting Locke v. O’Brien, 610 A.2d 552, 556 (R.I. 1992)); see also O’Donnell v. Penney, 17 R.I. 164, 167, 20 A. 305, 306 (1890) (recognizing doctrine of acquiescence for the first time in Rhode Island). “A determination of acquiescence is a mixed question of law and fact.” Acampora, 899 A.2d at 462 (citing Locke, 610 A.2d at 556). Specifically, “[a]lthough, ‘the issue of what constitute[s] the boundaries of a parcel of land is a question of law, the determination of where such boundaries are is a question of fact.’” Norton v. Courtemanche, 798 A.2d 925, 932 (R.I. 2002) (quoting Rosa v. Oliveira, 115 R.I. 277, 279, 342 A.2d 601, 602 (1975)); see DeCosta v. DeCosta, 819 A.2d 1261, 1265 (R.I. 2003) (vesting title in the entirety of the shrubbery that served as a boundary under the doctrine of acquiescence in the party who “located and planted the -9- shrubbery,” but remanding for a declaration of “where the hedgerow originally was located”) (emphasis added). Nye does not find fault with the trial justice’s determination that the yews and arborvitae constituted the boundary between his and the Brousseaus’ property under the doctrine of acquiescence. Consequently, he does not challenge certain findings of fact that the trial justice made in the context of determining this mixed question of law and fact, such as “whether the boundary is sufficiently obvious to command notice.” Acampora, 899 A.2d at 465. He does, however, challenge “where” the trial justice determined the boundary to be. Nye argues that the proper boundary should hug the outside edge of the trunks of the shrubs so that the entire circumference of the trunks rests on his property. Because this is a question of fact, we afford deference to the trial justice’s finding on this issue. Applying that standard of review, and after careful review of the record, it is our opinion that the trial justice did not misconceive or overlook material evidence when he determined that the boundary should bisect the trunks of the bushes. In making findings of fact to support his decision, the trial justice considered the testimony of the witnesses and made several credibility determinations. He found that Nye “used the driveway and land up to the shrubbery.” Additionally, the trial justice found that the shrubs “were rarely maintained.” He perceived Nye’s testimony to be “obviously self-serving,” but “credible.” As for Mr. Brousseau, the trial justice found him to be “highly credible.” The trial justice acknowledged the Lintereurs’ deposition testimony that they “‘assumed’ that the shrubbery was the border” and also that Nye’s father never objected to “Mr. Lintereur trimming the bushes.” - 10 - Nye asserts that “there was certainly not any evidence to suggest that the Lintereurs or the Brousseaus exercised dominion and control of the property up to the centerline of the bushes—as though someone occasionally crawled under the bushes up to the centerline. People do not do that.” However, there was no evidence that Nye exercised complete dominion of the entirety of the shrubbery to support his contention that he is entitled to a boundary determination that places the shrubbery completely on his property. For example, Nye did not maintain the bushes on the Brousseaus’ side of the property; in fact, he rarely maintained the shrubbery at all. In addition, the Lintereurs and Brousseaus both trimmed the shrubbery that faced their property. An authoritative treatise has said that mutual acceptance of the boundary line “is an objective test, without regard to what either party knew or thought.” 9 Richard R. Powell, Powell on Real Property § 68.05[6][a] at 68-29, 68-30 (Michael Allen Wolf ed. 2000). Therefore, although Nye insists that he always believed that the shrubbery belonged to his family and the Lintereurs’ affidavit contains the statement that they “always believed [that the Nyes] owned the boundary bushes,” the trial justice’s boundary determination is consistent with an objective factual determination of the location of the boundary. Based on the actions of the parties and the former owners of the respective properties in maintaining each side of the shrubbery, we cannot say that the trial justice’s resolution of where the boundary runs was clearly wrong. B Injunction Against Nye “A party seeking injunctive relief ‘must demonstrate that it stands to suffer some irreparable harm that is presently threatened or imminent and for which no adequate legal remedy exists to restore that plaintiff to its rightful position.’” National Lumber & Building - 11 - Materials Co. v. Langevin, 798 A.2d 429, 434 (R.I. 2002) (quoting Fund for Community Progress v. United Way of Southeastern New England, 695 A.2d 517, 521 (R.I. 1997)). “Irreparable injury must be either ‘presently threatened’ or ‘imminent’; injuries that are prospective only and might never occur cannot form the basis of a permanent injunction.” Id. (quoting Rhode Island Turnpike & Bridge Authority v. Cohen, 433 A.2d 179, 182 (R.I. 1981)). Nye argues that there is no support for the permanent injunction imposed on him because “[t]here was no evidence that [he] ha[d] ever trespassed on the Brousseau property beyond the point that the Court agreed had become part of the Nye property.” Therefore, he maintains that he presents no actual threat of imminent irreparable injury. We agree with Nye that the injunction against him is unnecessary. “When reviewing the grant or denial of a permanent injunction, we will reverse the lower court on appeal only ‘when it can be shown that the trial justice misapplied the law, misconceived or overlooked material evidence or made factual findings that were clearly wrong.’” Holden v. Salvadore, 964 A.2d 508, 512-13 (R.I. 2009) (quoting Renaissance Development Corp. v. Universal Properties Group, Inc., 821 A.2d 233, 236 (R.I. 2003)). Currently, the amended final judgment reflects the boundary description as submitted by Nye in accordance with the trial justice’s decision. Whatever imminent injury that the trial justice may have perceived at the time that he issued the injunction does not exist at this time, because the portion of the property that the Brousseaus challenged now belongs to Nye. This has been the case since the trial justice approved Nye’s legal description of the boundary in accordance with the decision and incorporated it into the amended final judgment. As a result, there no longer is any imminent threat that Nye will trespass on the Brousseaus’ property. Thus, we hold that the permanent injunction that continues to be in force against Nye is no longer called for, and that it - 12 - should have been vacated when the trial justice approved Nye’s submitted legal description of the boundary. C Damages for Breach of Agreement Finally, Nye argues that the trial justice erred when he awarded the Brousseaus damages based on his finding that Nye breached the parties’ agreement that they would share the cost of the survey. He maintains that he “was not on notice that this relief was within the realm of possibility” by the language of the counterclaim and that as a result he “did not argue his side of the story on this apparent non-issue.” Although Nye did argue that there was no agreement about payment of the cost of the survey, maintaining that he was simply being “generous” in his offer to pay half the cost, and this statement was part of the evidence during the trial, we hold that the boilerplate language of the Brousseaus’ counterclaim was not a sufficient basis for the trial justice’s award in their favor for monetary damages. In count one of their counterclaim, the Brousseaus alleged that the survey completed for their property on November 15, 2005, “delineate[d] the boundary lines of the parties’ respective properties,” and requested that they “be granted such other and further relief as [the Superior Court] shall deem appropriate and the circumstances of the case may require.” The trial justice determined that an award of damages in favor of the Brousseaus for half the cost of the survey was appropriate in light of the circumstances of the case because Nye “met with [the surveyor], subpoenaed [the surveyor] for trial, and had [the surveyor] wait for several days to testify.” He further found that the “survey was used as the basis for [the landscape arborist] to prepare his report.” - 13 - Essentially, Nye argues before this Court that the trial justice erroneously awarded these damages sua sponte. We agree; “[o]ur caselaw consistently has mandated that when a trial justice considers and rules on an issue sua sponte, the parties must be afforded notice of the issue and allowed an opportunity to present evidence and argue against it.” Catucci v. Pacheco, 866 A.2d 509, 515 (R.I. 2005) (citing Vargas Manufacturing Co. v. Friedman, 661 A.2d 48, 55 (R.I. 1995)) (holding that the trial justice erred when he sua sponte added additional defendants as parties “at the close of plaintiff’s case” and defendants “were not prepared to offer any witnesses or otherwise defend”). In short, “a party should not be granted relief that it did not request.” Providence Journal Co. v. Convention Center Authority, 824 A.2d 1246, 1248 (R.I. 2003) (holding that the trial justice erred when she ordered unrequested redactions of certain information from several contracts) (citing Direct Action for Rights and Equality v. Gannon, 713 A.2d 218, 225 (R.I. 1998); Vargas Manufacturing Co., 661 A.2d at 55, and Santos v. Santos, 568 A.2d 1010, 1011 (R.I. 1990)); see Vargas Manufacturing Co., 661 A.2d at 54-55 (holding that the trial justice erred when he awarded punitive damages for threats amounting to the crime of extortion although the defendants mentioned and requested only punitive damages for knowing, intentional, and willful misrepresentations). This Court has noted that “[a]ppellate courts are especially hesitant to read a particular claim into a complaint’s general boilerplate prayer for relief.” Bandoni v. State, 715 A.2d 580, 596 (R.I. 1998) (citing Thomas R.W. v. Massachusetts Department of Education, 130 F.3d 477, 480 (1st Cir. 1997)). In Bandoni, this Court viewed consideration of an award of declaratory and injunctive relief as “inappropriate” because it was not sought in the complaint, despite the complaint’s general language that “prayed for monetary damages and ‘all such other relief deemed meet and just by this Honorable Court.’” Id. at 596. We characterized the complaint’s - 14 - “general boilerplate language [as] superfluous and simply insufficient to support any claim upon which other relief may be granted.” Id. at 597. Here, the similarly general boilerplate language in the Brousseaus’ counterclaim cannot support an award of damages for breach of agreement. The Brousseaus’ counterclaim was restricted to seeking declaratory and injunctive relief; nowhere does it allege the breach of an agreement to share the cost of a surveyor, nor does it request monetary damages. See Bandoni, 715 A.2d at 596-97. In addition, the Brousseaus were free to file a motion under Rule 15 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure to conform the pleadings to the evidence at trial regarding the alleged agreement between the parties to share the expense of the survey, but they did not do so. Therefore, we hold that the trial justice erroneously granted the Brousseaus relief that they did not request when he awarded them damages for a portion of the surveyor’s fees. See Providence Journal Co., 824 A.2d at 1248. IV Conclusion We affirm the Superior Court judgment in part and vacate the judgment in part.

Brousseau provided Nye with a copy of the survey, but Nye disputed its accuracy and declined to reimburse the Brousseaus for any portion of the survey’s cost.', 'Nye maintained that “[i]t was [the Brousseaus’] project” and “it wasn’t my survey.” According to Nye, no agreement existed “as to payment.”', 'Nye and Brousseau also disputed the placement of trash and recycling bins in the vicinity of what each perceived to be the boundary between their properties. Brousseau asked Nye to remove his trash cans, but, according to Brousseau, Nye refused. On one occasion, Brousseau moved Nye’s trash cans to “the other side of the survey line,” but Nye moved them back because they were damaging the grass. Nye also said that he showed Brousseau the affidavit from the Lintereurs memorializing their belief as to the location of the boundary, but Brousseau did not see any significance in that document. The men exchanged words, and Brousseau described himself as “emotional” at that time. According to Brousseau, Nye then informed him that he was going to have his own survey conducted.', 'Later, at the end of June 2006, Nye again contacted the Warwick police in connection with the dispute about the proper location of the trash and recycling containers. Brousseau showed the responding police officer a copy of the survey indicating that he owned the land in question, and the officer talked to Nye and departed. As a result, Nye moved his trash cans.', 'On August 14, 2006, Brousseau trimmed the remaining yews.3 According to Brousseau, he placed the branches that he cut on the side of his driveway. Nye took issue with this work because he said that he had refused Brousseau’s request to cut those bushes. In response, Nye 3', 'Currently, seven of the original Japanese yews and two stumps remain.', '-4- contacted the Warwick Police Department “to make a record of the event.” An officer came and talked to both parties, and, according to Nye, “that was basically the end of it.”', 'Nye filed a pro se complaint against the Brousseaus in Superior Court on August 9, 2006, in which he alleged that he had requested that the Brousseaus obtain a survey of their property and asserted that he “contest[ed] the location of the disputed boundary.” He claimed that “the boundary * * * between the Nye real estate and the Brousseau real estate is a line, which follows a row of bushes.” He alleged that before the survey was completed, the Brousseaus did not believe that the area included within their surveyed boundary was part of their property. Nye further alleged that the Brousseaus are “liable in trespass for traveling in, and beyond, the disputed area, and for moving [his] recycling bins.” He claimed that the parties “and former owners and users of both properties have demonstrated mutual acquiescence regarding their respect of [Nye’s] asserted boundary.” He sought a temporary restraining order and permanent injunctive relief to prevent the Brousseaus “from trespass of the asserted boundary line,” “[a]n order declaring the true boundary line,” and “[a]ny other such equitable relief as the Court may allow.”', 'As part of their answer to Nye’s complaint, the Brousseaus raised two counterclaims. First, they sought a declaratory judgment that the boundary line dividing the two properties was as determined in the survey conducted in November 2005. Second, they sought a temporary restraining order and injunction preventing Nye from entering their property, placing his personal property upon it, or parking motor vehicles on their property. For both counts of the counterclaim, the Brousseaus also requested that they “be granted such other and further relief as [the Superior Court] shall deem appropriate and the circumstances of the case may require.”', '-5-', 'A nonjury trial was held before a justice of the Superior Court on June 16, 17, 19, and 30, 2008, and July 7, 2008. Nye represented himself during these proceedings, while the Brousseaus were represented by counsel.4 Nye called several witnesses, including his brother, a landscape arborist who testified about the value of the shrubbery, the Brousseaus’ surveyor, who was under subpoena, and himself. The trial justice allowed video recordings of the Lintereurs’ depositions into evidence. At the close of plaintiff’s case, the Brousseaus moved for judgment as a matter of law. In response to defendants’ motion, Nye argued to the trial justice that the boundary should run along the edge of the bushes’ trunks so that each trunk is entirely on his property, but he acknowledged that that was the “ideal location” and that a boundary running through the center of the trunks was “a possible solution.” The trial justice denied the motion because he wished to hear testimony from the Brousseaus, as well.', 'The trial justice’s decision was entered on September 23, 2008. He issued an injunction preventing the Brousseaus “from passing onto Mr. Nye’s property.” He also ruled that because Nye “demonstrated that at the time of the August 2006 trimming, he was in possession of one- half of the shrubs near the border,” Brousseau converted Nye’s portion of ownership in the shrubbery when he undertook “his significant trimming” on August 14, 2006. Taking into consideration the positive effects that Brousseau’s trimming had on the shrubbery, the trial justice set the value of the damage from the trimming of the nine shrubs at $2,200, and he awarded Nye damages in the amount of $1,100, reflecting his one-half ownership of the shrubbery.', 'With respect to the boundary question, the trial justice ruled that the row of shrubbery was “sufficiently obvious to command notice of [Nye’s] claim of ownership.”', 'Therefore, 4', 'Counsel filed an entry of appearance in Superior Court on behalf of Nye on December 22, 2008. That attorney represents Nye before this Court.', '-6- because Nye “demonstrated that the row of shrubbery has existed for a sufficient period of time,” the shrubbery represented the boundary between the properties under the doctrine of title by acquiescence. The trial justice found that', '“[t]he new boundary shall run from the granite bound, which is the', 'northernmost border of the two properties, southward until the', 'northernmost yew, then turning and running along the centerline of', 'the yews to the southernmost yew, then turning slightly eastward', 'and running directly to the point which is the edge of Mr. Nye’s', 'paved driveway at its intersection with Tiffany Avenue.” However, the trial justice went on to say, “Any property interest clarified, confirmed or conveyed to Mr. Nye by this Decision shall be invalid until it is set forth in a Judgment, duly approved by the Court and sufficiently describing this line.” He directed Nye to prepare a survey description for inclusion in the final judgment.', 'Acknowledging that the Brousseaus “prayed for an award of any other relief that the Court may deem equitable and just,” the trial justice ruled that “[t]he Brousseaus established that Mr. Nye breached an agreement to pay for one-half of the cost of the surveyor’s bill” and “[a]n award of costs for the [Brousseaus] is most appropriate here.” Therefore, in recognition of the value of this survey to Nye in preparation for and during the trial proceedings, the trial justice ruled that the Brousseaus were to “be awarded one-half of the cost of the survey as Mr. Nye originally agreed.” Finally, he enjoined Nye from entering the Brousseaus’ “real estate without the consent of either Mr. or Mrs. Brousseau.”5', 'Nye filed a motion to amend the decision on September 29, 2008, which the trial justice denied. Final judgment was entered on October 29, 2008. To comply with the trial justice’s decision, Nye prepared and submitted an order with an attached surveyor’s description of the 5', 'The trial justice also enjoined Mr. Brousseau from entering “Mr. Nye’s real estate without the consent of Mr. Nye.”', '-7- new boundary line to the Superior Court on November 12, 2008. This legal description of the border was reflected in the amended final judgment that was entered on April 30, 2009.6 Nye timely appealed to this Court.', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'Nye raises three issues on appeal. First, he argues that, although the trial justice correctly ruled that the doctrine of acquiescence applied, he “erred in fixing the boundary between the two properties through the center of the trunks of the first and last bushes, rather than with reference to where the bushes were before the Brousseaus removed them in 2004, and by not locating the bushes entirely on the Nye property.” Second, he contends that the trial justice erred when he issued an injunction preventing him from entering the Brousseaus’ property without their consent. Third, he argues that the trial justice erred when he entered judgment in favor of the Brousseaus on an “unasserted” breach-of-contract claim.', 'III', 'Standard of Review', 'We “will not disturb the findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury in a civil matter ‘unless such findings are clearly erroneous or unless the trial justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence or unless the decision fails to do substantial justice between the parties.’” Union Station Associates v.

Consequently, he does not challenge certain findings of fact that the trial justice made in the context of determining this mixed question of law and fact, such as “whether the boundary is sufficiently obvious to command notice.” Acampora, 899 A.2d at 465. He does, however, challenge “where” the trial justice determined the boundary to be. Nye argues that the proper boundary should hug the outside edge of the trunks of the shrubs so that the entire circumference of the trunks rests on his property. Because this is a question of fact, we afford deference to the trial justice’s finding on this issue. Applying that standard of review, and after careful review of the record, it is our opinion that the trial justice did not misconceive or overlook material evidence when he determined that the boundary should bisect the trunks of the bushes.', 'In making findings of fact to support his decision, the trial justice considered the testimony of the witnesses and made several credibility determinations. He found that Nye “used the driveway and land up to the shrubbery.” Additionally, the trial justice found that the shrubs “were rarely maintained.” He perceived Nye’s testimony to be “obviously self-serving,” but “credible.” As for Mr. Brousseau, the trial justice found him to be “highly credible.” The trial justice acknowledged the Lintereurs’ deposition testimony that they “‘assumed’ that the shrubbery was the border” and also that Nye’s father never objected to “Mr. Lintereur trimming the bushes.”', '- 10 -', 'Nye asserts that “there was certainly not any evidence to suggest that the Lintereurs or the Brousseaus exercised dominion and control of the property up to the centerline of the bushes—as though someone occasionally crawled under the bushes up to the centerline. People do not do that.” However, there was no evidence that Nye exercised complete dominion of the entirety of the shrubbery to support his contention that he is entitled to a boundary determination that places the shrubbery completely on his property. For example, Nye did not maintain the bushes on the Brousseaus’ side of the property; in fact, he rarely maintained the shrubbery at all. In addition, the Lintereurs and Brousseaus both trimmed the shrubbery that faced their property.', 'An authoritative treatise has said that mutual acceptance of the boundary line “is an objective test, without regard to what either party knew or thought.” 9 Richard R. Powell, Powell on Real Property § 68.05[6][a] at 68-29, 68-30 (Michael Allen Wolf ed. 2000). Therefore, although Nye insists that he always believed that the shrubbery belonged to his family and the Lintereurs’ affidavit contains the statement that they “always believed [that the Nyes] owned the boundary bushes,” the trial justice’s boundary determination is consistent with an objective factual determination of the location of the boundary. Based on the actions of the parties and the former owners of the respective properties in maintaining each side of the shrubbery, we cannot say that the trial justice’s resolution of where the boundary runs was clearly wrong.', 'B', 'Injunction Against Nye', '“A party seeking injunctive relief ‘must demonstrate that it stands to suffer some irreparable harm that is presently threatened or imminent and for which no adequate legal remedy exists to restore that plaintiff to its rightful position.’” National Lumber & Building', '- 11 - Materials Co. v.

(quoting Rhode Island Turnpike & Bridge Authority v. Cohen, 433 A.2d 179, 182 (R.I. 1981)). Nye argues that there is no support for the permanent injunction imposed on him because “[t]here was no evidence that [he] ha[d] ever trespassed on the Brousseau property beyond the point that the Court agreed had become part of the Nye property.” Therefore, he maintains that he presents no actual threat of imminent irreparable injury.', 'We agree with Nye that the injunction against him is unnecessary.', '“When reviewing the grant or denial of a permanent injunction, we will reverse the lower court on appeal only ‘when it can be shown that the trial justice misapplied the law, misconceived or overlooked material evidence or made factual findings that were clearly wrong.’”', 'Holden v.

Currently, the amended final judgment reflects the boundary description as submitted by Nye in accordance with the trial justice’s decision. Whatever imminent injury that the trial justice may have perceived at the time that he issued the injunction does not exist at this time, because the portion of the property that the Brousseaus challenged now belongs to Nye. This has been the case since the trial justice approved Nye’s legal description of the boundary in accordance with the decision and incorporated it into the amended final judgment. As a result, there no longer is any imminent threat that Nye will trespass on the Brousseaus’ property. Thus, we hold that the permanent injunction that continues to be in force against Nye is no longer called for, and that it', '- 12 - should have been vacated when the trial justice approved Nye’s submitted legal description of the boundary.', 'C', 'Damages for Breach of Agreement', 'Finally, Nye argues that the trial justice erred when he awarded the Brousseaus damages based on his finding that Nye breached the parties’ agreement that they would share the cost of the survey. He maintains that he “was not on notice that this relief was within the realm of possibility” by the language of the counterclaim and that as a result he “did not argue his side of the story on this apparent non-issue.” Although Nye did argue that there was no agreement about payment of the cost of the survey, maintaining that he was simply being “generous” in his offer to pay half the cost, and this statement was part of the evidence during the trial, we hold that the boilerplate language of the Brousseaus’ counterclaim was not a sufficient basis for the trial justice’s award in their favor for monetary damages.', 'In count one of their counterclaim, the Brousseaus alleged that the survey completed for their property on November 15, 2005, “delineate[d] the boundary lines of the parties’ respective properties,” and requested that they “be granted such other and further relief as [the Superior Court] shall deem appropriate and the circumstances of the case may require.” The trial justice determined that an award of damages in favor of the Brousseaus for half the cost of the survey was appropriate in light of the circumstances of the case because Nye “met with [the surveyor], subpoenaed [the surveyor] for trial, and had [the surveyor] wait for several days to testify.” He further found that the “survey was used as the basis for [the landscape arborist] to prepare his report.”', '- 13 -', 'Essentially, Nye argues before this Court that the trial justice erroneously awarded these damages sua sponte.

See Bandoni, 715 A.2d at 596-97. In addition, the Brousseaus were free to file a motion under Rule 15 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure to conform the pleadings to the evidence at trial regarding the alleged agreement between the parties to share the expense of the survey, but they did not do so.

40,"John E. Ashley et al. : v. : Kenneth A. Kehew et al. : Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty, and Robinson, JJ. OPINION Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The central issue before the Court in this appeal is whether restrictive covenants, which are set forth in instruments of conveyance, and which prohibit a further subdivision of two lots in the Town of Portsmouth, remain enforceable. A Superior Court justice ruled that the restrictions no longer were enforceable because all parties had agreed to release them. The owners of one of the two lots in the subdivision appealed. We vacate the judgment. I Facts and Travel In 1982, Lucille Ashley deeded lot No. 20 on Assessor’s Plat No. 64 in Portsmouth to her granddaughter, Laure Ashley. Subsequently, and for reasons not necessary to decide this appeal, Franklyn Ashley, Laure’s father, and John Ashley, Laure’s brother, filed suit in Newport County Superior Court against Laure, challenging the conveyance. In 1986, the parties reached a settlement that was approved by the Superior Court. Per the terms of the settlement, which was included as part of a consent judgment entered by the Superior Court, Laure agreed to subdivide -1- lot No. 20 and give John title to “the farm house” on lot No. 20, along with 2.54 acres of land. Laure retained the balance of lot No. 20, roughly five acres.1 However, in a separate agreement, Laure agreed to convey those same five acres to her attorney, Daniel McKinnon, to satisfy legal fees that she owed to him. To effectuate the consent judgment, a subdivision application was submitted to the Portsmouth Planning Board (the board) in 1988 designating two discrete lots: lot No. 1, which measured about five acres, and lot No. 2, which was about two and a half acres.2 However, the initial plan was not acceptable to the board; it required that amendments be made, including that two conditions be imposed on both lots. Those conditions were that “Lots No. 1 & No. 2 May Not Be Further Subdivided” and “Not More Than One Single Family Home With Normal Outbuildings Shall Be Constructed On Each Lot.” McKinnon and Laure agreed to the conditions, and the board eventually approved a subdivision plat that included both conditions on the face of the plat. In June 1990, Laure executed a quitclaim deed to lot No. 2 to John, which included both of the aforementioned conditions imposed by the board. For some reason, the deed was not recorded in the land evidence record until July 11, 1995. To complicate matters further, at trial, John denied any knowledge of this deed. When Laure conveyed lot No. 1 to McKinnon in 1991, the quitclaim deed contained the identical covenants found in Laure’s 1990 deed to John. (“Said lot may not be further subdivided” and “Not more than one single family home with normal outbuildings shall be constructed on said lot.”) The deed to McKinnon was recorded on September 13, 1991. 1 As part of the settlement, Franklyn’s and John’s claims against Laure were dismissed. 2 Although lot No. 1 was not deeded to McKinnon until July 12, 1991, and the deed was not recorded until September 13, 1991, he is designated as the “owner” on the site plan submitted to -2- Then, on June 4, 1996, Laure executed and later recorded what was denominated as a “Confirmatory Quitclaim Deed” to lot No. 2 to John Ashley and Cheryl Beach. That deed contains the same two conditions as the 1990 deed from Laure to John, i.e., “Said lot may not be further subdivided” and “Not more than one single family home with normal outbuildings shall be constructed on said lot.” But on that same day, Laure also executed an “Affidavit and Release,” which was recorded with the confirmatory quitclaim deed. That document reiterated the same two restrictions but then said that: “This language was included in the deeds because the Town of Portsmouth has imposed these conditions on the use of the aforementioned property and because these conditions appear on the subdivision plan referred to in said deeds. It was not and is not my intention to burden the aforementioned premises with these restrictions, and, to the extent that I have the authority, I hereby release John E. Ashley and the premises from said conditions.” The confirmatory deed also declared that it is “subject * * * to the terms and conditions of the Affidavit and Release.” On June 19, 2001, McKinnon executed a warranty deed conveying lot No. 1 to himself and John B. Harwood as tenants in common. That deed provided that lot No. 1 was “[s]ubject to restrictions put on the face of the above plan imposed by the Town of Portsmouth but released by these grantors.” On that same day, McKinnon and Harwood executed a warranty deed for the same premises to Kenneth and Mary Ellen Kehew. This deed also contained the provision that lot No. 1 was “[s]ubject to restrictions put on the face of the above plan imposed by the Town of Portsmouth but released by these grantors.” Both deeds were recorded on July 9, 2001. Shortly thereafter, the Kehews applied to the Portsmouth Planning Board to subdivide lot No. 1 so that Mr. Kehew’s brother could build a home. It appears that their initial application the board, and it appears from the record that he was an interested party throughout the entire municipal process. -3- was withdrawn, but in 2005 another application was submitted in its stead. The board approved the Kehews’ application to subdivide the property, and it agreed to rescind the condition that it had previously imposed prohibiting any further subdivision of either lot No. 1 or lot No. 2.3 On March 8, 2005, John Ashley and Cheryl Beach filed a complaint in Newport County Superior Court against the Kehews, seeking injunctive relief. Specifically, they asked that the Kehews “be permanently enjoined and restrained from presenting to the Portsmouth Planning Board an application to subdivide Lot No. 1 into 2 lots, subdividing Lot No. 1 into 2 lots and erecting or permitting a third person to erect a residential dwelling on said lot.”4 After a trial without a jury, the trial justice issued a decision. After summarizing the essential facts surrounding the three purported releases by Laure Ashley, by McKinnon and Harwood, and by the board, the trial justice articulated the law upon which she relied in reaching her decision. She observed that restrictive covenants can be discharged either through releases or agreements. Then she commented that “several jurisdictions have held that the consent of all owners is required to release a subdivision’s restrictions” and cited three cases for this proposition: Flowers v. August, 426 S.W.2d 480, 482 (Ky. 1968); Dartmouth-Willow Terrace, Inc. v. MacLean, 371 S.W.2d 937, 938 (Ky. 1963); Truong v. City of Houston, 99 S.W.3d 204, 214 (Tex. Ct. App. 2002). 3 John Ashley and Cheryl Beach represented in their appeal to this Court that the board’s action in rescinding the conditions was being appealed. The status of that appeal is unknown at this time. 4 Prior to the filing of this complaint, John Ashley, Cheryl Beach, Timothy Banks, and several other plaintiffs filed a complaint in 2003, also in Newport County Superior Court, seeking a declaratory judgment that Selina Lane, the road on which lots No. 1 and No. 2 are situated, was a private road, not a public road. The trial justice consolidated both cases for purposes of trial. The trial justice concluded that Selina Lane was a public road. Timothy Banks, a plaintiff in that action and an owner of property on Selina Lane, appealed the trial justice’s decision to this Court. This Court was evenly divided on whether Selina Lane was a private or public road. That being the case, the trial justice’s decision was affirmed. Ashley v. Kehew, No. 2008-265-A. (R.I., filed April 28, 2010) (mem.). -4- The trial justice went on to hold that: “The credible evidence demonstrates that all the parties agreed to the release of the original restrictions, albeit not simultaneously. Since the lot owners by ‘mutual agreement’ have ‘released and relinquished their right to enforce the same’ the restrictions in controversy are no longer enforceable. See Dartmouth-Willow Terrace, 371 S.W.2d at 938.” The trial justice found that the board had released the restrictions on the subdivision plat in 2005, that McKinnon had released the restrictions on lot No. 1 through his deed to Harwood and himself and then “reinforced that release” via his deed to the Kehews, and that lot No. 2 was released from the restrictions by the 1996 confirmatory quitclaim deed and affidavit and release signed by Laure. The trial justice entered a judgment denying John Ashley and Cheryl Beach’s claim for injunctive relief to enforce the restrictive covenants. John Ashley and Cheryl Beach timely appealed to this Court. On appeal, we must resolve whether the restrictions remain in effect or whether they effectively were released by the respective parties. II Standard of Review “A judgment in a nonjury case will be reversed on appeal when it can be shown that the trial justice misapplied the law, misconceived or overlooked material evidence or made factual findings that were clearly wrong.” Ondis v.

When we examine the record, “[w]e review with deference the factual findings made by a trial justice in a nonjury case.” State v. Germane, 971 A.2d 555, 573 (R.I. 2009). When, as is the case here, the issue is a pure question of law, our review is de novo. Ondis, 934 A.2d at 802. -5- III Analysis We recognize at the outset that Rhode Island law is relatively scant on what constitutes an effective release of a restrictive covenant. Previously, when faced with an issue about the enforceability of a restrictive covenant when a Rhode Island law was unclear or sparse, we have looked “to leading authorities and the law of other jurisdictions for guidance in making our determination.” Ridgewood Homeowners Association v. Mignacca, 813 A.2d 965, 972 (R.I. 2003) (quoting Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. v. Harbor Insurance Co., 603 A.2d 300, 302 (R.I. 1992)); cf. Jackvony v. Poncelet, 584 A.2d 1112, 1116 (R.I. 1991) (“No case law exists in Rhode Island that directly addresses the precise issue now before us. Consequently we must look to the general law dealing with the extinguishment of easements and to any other jurisdictions that have ruled on the issue.”). We do so here as well. Covenants can be terminated by merger, release, rescission, unclean hands, acquiescence, abandonment, laches, and estoppel. 9 Richard R. Powell, Powell on Real Property § 60.10[1] at 60-120 (Michael Allan Wolf ed., LexisNexis Matthew Bender 2009). “A person entitled to enforce the benefit of a covenant may extinguish this right by means of a written and recorded release.” Id. at 60-122. “Such a release, however, extinguishes the obligation only so far as it relates to the estate of the releasor, and all of the benefited property owners must join in a release in order to completely extinguish the obligation.” Id. When we review a document that purports to release rights, this Court is “governed by the ‘well-settled rules on the interpretation of contracts.’” McBurney v. Teixeira, 875 A.2d 439, 443 (R.I. 2005) (quoting W.P. Associates v. Forcier, Inc., 637 A.2d 353, 356 (R.I. 1994)). If the -6- terms of the release are clear and unambiguous, “the task of judicial construction is at an end and the agreement must be applied as written.” Id. To determine if a release is clear and unambiguous, we view “the document * * * in its entirety and [give] its language * * * its plain, ordinary and usual meaning.” Id. A release is ambiguous only if “it is reasonably and clearly susceptible to more than one interpretation.” Id. We carefully have scrutinized what purports to be the releasing language in the deeds and other instruments related to the various conveyances. After doing so, it is our opinion that John Ashley and Cheryl Beach, as the owners of lot No. 2, never released their right to enforce the restrictions against further subdivision placed upon lot No. 1. In our view, the trial justice clearly was wrong when she concluded “that all parties agreed to the release of the original restrictions.” It may be accurate to say that all parties released, or attempted to release, their own properties from the restrictions, but that is not the same as relinquishing one’s right to enforce the restrictions on another lot. We do not agree with the trial justice’s reliance on the Truong, Flowers, and Dartmouth- Willow Terrace cases. There are obvious and critical factual distinctions between those cases and the situations confronting us in this appeal. For example, in Truong, 99 S.W.3d at 214-15, individual owners in a subdivision executed written releases in accordance with the terms of a deed restriction document. In Flowers, 426 S.W.2d at 482, all owners in a subdivision collectively signed a release lifting the restrictions for just a single lot. And in Dartmouth- Willow Terrace, 371 S.W.2d at 938, the two holders of the right to enforce a restriction executed deeds to the burdened estate holder and released any rights they had to enforce the restriction. The aforementioned cases all involved situations in which the owners of the estate that benefited from the restrictions executed documents that explicitly lifted the restrictions on the -7- burdened estate(s). For example, in Flowers, 426 S.W.2d at 482, the release stated, in relevant part, “IT IS NOW AGREED by all of the owners of property in the Spring Hill Subdivision that such portion of the [three specific] restrictions * * * shall be deleted, and shall no longer be a portion of the restrictions upon said Spring Hill Subdivision * * *.” Similarly in Dartmouth- Willow Terrace, 371 S.W.2d at 938, the two owners who held the right to enforce a restrictive covenant executed quitclaim deeds to the burdened estate holder “releasing any rights which they might have to enforce the restrictions.” This is not the situation facing us as we endeavor to resolve the issues in this case. Here, we have purported releases from the owners of lots No. 1 and No. 2 but neither specifically states that the owners waive their right to enforce the restrictions on the adjacent lot or even refers to their right to enforce the restriction on the other lot. McKinnon’s intent to release the restrictions in the 2001 deed to himself and Harwood and the subsequent deed by them to the Kehews both contain a provision that lot No. 1 was “[s]ubject to restrictions put on the face of the above plan imposed by the Town of Portsmouth but released by these grantors.” The language “but released by these grantors” must be viewed as an attempt to free lot No. 1 from the restriction. This attempted release, however, cannot be effective to remove the restriction on lot No. 1 because the owners of the burdened estate, lot No. 1, cannot unilaterally release themselves from a condition that burdens their estate. Only the owner of the estate benefiting from the covenant, in this case lot No. 2, can release the burdened estate. See Leverton v. Laird, 190 N.W.2d 427, 432-33 (Iowa 1971) (“Except as to the releasing parties themselves, the releases could not affect the rights created by the dedication.”) (citing Beeler Development Co. v. Dickens, 120 N.W.2d 414, 417 (Iowa 1963)); Albright v. Fish, 394 A.2d 1117, 1121 (Vt. 1978) (“A release extinguishes only the estate of the releasor.”); 9 Powell -8- on Real Property § 60.10[1] at 60-122. Therefore, McKinnon and Harwood’s attempt to release the restrictions had no impact on the rights of the owners of lot No. 2 to enforce the restrictive covenant prohibiting further subdivision of lot No. 1. Likewise, Laure Ashley’s 1996 affidavit and release that was recorded with the so-called confirmatory deed to lot No. 2 failed to affect the rights of the owners of lot No. 2 to enforce the restrictive covenants burdening lot No. 1. This document reiterates the two conditions placed upon the land and with reference to these conditions provides that: “This language was included in the deeds because the Town of Portsmouth has imposed these conditions on the use of the aforementioned property and because these conditions appear on the subdivision plan referred to in said deeds. It was not and is not my intention to burden the aforementioned premises with these restrictions, and, to the extent that I have the authority, I hereby release John E. Ashley and the premises from said conditions.” This document merely is an attempt to unburden lot No. 2 from the two conditions and it cannot operate to divest the owner of lot No. 2 of the right to enforce the restrictive covenants placed upon lot No. 1. In our analysis, the plain meaning of this document refers to lot No. 2 only; no reference is made to lot No. 1 or to any other property. See McBurney, 875 A.2d at 443. The Kehews argue that the use of the plural “deeds” and “premises” in the document refers to the deeds to lot No.1 and lot No. 2, and therefore is indicative of Laure’s intent to release lot No. 1 from the conditions. In our view, that is not a reasonable interpretation of the document. After considering the document in its entirety, we believe that “deeds” refers to the two deeds from Laure to John, the 1990 quitclaim deed and the 1996 confirmatory quitclaim deed, and that “premises” refers only to lot No. 2. The board’s 2005 decision to rescind the two conditions that it imposed on the subdivision plat does not alter our conclusion. This is so because, irrespective of the board’s -9- action, the owners of lot No. 2 had a right to rely on the restrictions set forth in the subdivision plat and contained in Laure Ashley’s 1991 deed to McKinnon. This certainly is consistent with our prior holdings. See Ridgewood Homeowners Association, 813 A.2d at 971 (providing that “this Court has recognized that owners may enforce restrictive covenants on land burdened by the same restrictions as their land, when the purpose of the covenants is to maintain a common scheme of development”); Houlihan v. Zoning Board of Review of New Shoreham, 738 A.2d 536, 538 (R.I. 1999) (“recogniz[ing] that when recorded plat-lot restrictions appear intended to provide for a uniform development and use of platted subdivision lots, any one of the plat-lot owners may seek judicial assistance to compel compliance by another lot owner with the restrictive covenants”); Farrell v. Meadowbrook Corp., 111 R.I. 747, 750, 306 A.2d 806, 808 (1973); Emma v. Silvestri, 101 R.I. 749, 751-52, 227 A.2d 480, 481 (1967); Noonan v. Cuddigan, 85 R.I. 328, 333, 131 A.2d 241, 244 (1957) (“It is well settled that where, in conformity with a general plan for development, the owner of property divides it into building lots and places upon them uniform restrictions, any subsequent owner may enforce the restrictions against any other grantee or present owner of such lots.”). It is clear to us that the record owners of lot No. 2 have never relinquished their right to enforce the covenants benefiting them. In the absence of a valid release we will give effect to the restrictive covenant. In doing so, “[w]e construe the terms of any restrictive covenant ‘in favor of the free alienability of land while still respecting the purposes for which the restriction was established.’” Martellini v. Little Angels Day Care, Inc., 847 A.2d 838, 843 (R.I. 2004) (quoting Gregory v. State Department of Mental Health, Retardation and Hospitals, 495 A.2d 997, 1000 (R.I. 1985)). This Court “will not * * * seek ambiguity where none exists but rather we will effectuate” the restrictive covenant’s - 10 - objective. Ridgewood Homeowners Association, 813 A.2d at 972 (quoting Hanley v. Misischi, 111 R.I. 233, 238, 302 A.2d 79, 82 (1973)). “Moreover, in those instances when the limitation in issue is unambiguous, restrictive covenants are to be strictly construed.” Martellini, 847 A.2d at 843 (citing Hanley, 111 R.I. at 238, 302 A.2d at 82). Here, the meaning of the restrictive covenant is undisputed; by its terms it prohibits further subdivision. John Ashley and Cheryl Beach, as owners of lot No. 2, never released their right to prohibit further subdivision of lot No. 1, and, therefore, retain their right to enforce the covenant. IV Conclusion For the reasons stated in this opinion, the Superior Court’s judgment is vacated and the record is remanded to the Superior Court for entry of judgment for the plaintiffs John Ashley and Cheryl Beach. - 11 - Supreme Court No. 2008-264-Appeal. (NC 05-97) John E. Ashley et al. : v. : Kenneth A. Kehew et al. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The central issue before the Court in this appeal is whether restrictive covenants, which are set forth in instruments of conveyance, and which prohibit a further subdivision of two lots in the Town of Portsmouth, remain enforceable. A Superior Court justice ruled that the restrictions no longer were enforceable because all parties had agreed to release them. The owners of one of the two lots in the subdivision appealed. We vacate the judgment.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In 1982, Lucille Ashley deeded lot No. 20 on Assessor’s Plat No. 64 in Portsmouth to her granddaughter, Laure Ashley. Subsequently, and for reasons not necessary to decide this appeal, Franklyn Ashley, Laure’s father, and John Ashley, Laure’s brother, filed suit in Newport County Superior Court against Laure, challenging the conveyance. In 1986, the parties reached a settlement that was approved by the Superior Court. Per the terms of the settlement, which was included as part of a consent judgment entered by the Superior Court, Laure agreed to subdivide', '-1- lot No. 20 and give John title to “the farm house” on lot No. 20, along with 2.54 acres of land. Laure retained the balance of lot No. 20, roughly five acres.1 However, in a separate agreement, Laure agreed to convey those same five acres to her attorney, Daniel McKinnon, to satisfy legal fees that she owed to him.', 'To effectuate the consent judgment, a subdivision application was submitted to the Portsmouth Planning Board (the board) in 1988 designating two discrete lots: lot No. 1, which measured about five acres, and lot No. 2, which was about two and a half acres.2 However, the initial plan was not acceptable to the board; it required that amendments be made, including that two conditions be imposed on both lots. Those conditions were that “Lots No. 1 & No. 2 May Not Be Further Subdivided” and “Not More Than One Single Family Home With Normal Outbuildings Shall Be Constructed On Each Lot.”', 'McKinnon and Laure agreed to the conditions, and the board eventually approved a subdivision plat that included both conditions on the face of the plat.', 'In June 1990, Laure executed a quitclaim deed to lot No. 2 to John, which included both of the aforementioned conditions imposed by the board. For some reason, the deed was not recorded in the land evidence record until July 11, 1995. To complicate matters further, at trial, John denied any knowledge of this deed.', 'When Laure conveyed lot No. 1 to McKinnon in 1991, the quitclaim deed contained the identical covenants found in Laure’s 1990 deed to John.', '(“Said lot may not be further subdivided” and “Not more than one single family home with normal outbuildings shall be constructed on said lot.”) The deed to McKinnon was recorded on September 13, 1991. 1', 'As part of the settlement, Franklyn’s and John’s claims against Laure were dismissed. 2', 'Although lot No. 1 was not deeded to McKinnon until July 12, 1991, and the deed was not recorded until September 13, 1991, he is designated as the “owner” on the site plan submitted to', '-2-', 'Then, on June 4, 1996, Laure executed and later recorded what was denominated as a “Confirmatory Quitclaim Deed” to lot No. 2 to John Ashley and Cheryl Beach. That deed contains the same two conditions as the 1990 deed from Laure to John, i.e., “Said lot may not be further subdivided” and “Not more than one single family home with normal outbuildings shall be constructed on said lot.” But on that same day, Laure also executed an “Affidavit and Release,” which was recorded with the confirmatory quitclaim deed. That document reiterated the same two restrictions but then said that:', '“This language was included in the deeds because the Town of', 'Portsmouth has imposed these conditions on the use of the', 'aforementioned property and because these conditions appear on', 'the subdivision plan referred to in said deeds. It was not and is not', 'my intention to burden the aforementioned premises with these', 'restrictions, and, to the extent that I have the authority, I hereby', 'release John E. Ashley and the premises from said conditions.” The confirmatory deed also declared that it is “subject * * * to the terms and conditions of the Affidavit and Release.”', 'On June 19, 2001, McKinnon executed a warranty deed conveying lot No. 1 to himself and John B. Harwood as tenants in common. That deed provided that lot No. 1 was “[s]ubject to restrictions put on the face of the above plan imposed by the Town of Portsmouth but released by these grantors.” On that same day, McKinnon and Harwood executed a warranty deed for the same premises to Kenneth and Mary Ellen Kehew. This deed also contained the provision that lot No. 1 was “[s]ubject to restrictions put on the face of the above plan imposed by the Town of Portsmouth but released by these grantors.” Both deeds were recorded on July 9, 2001.', 'Shortly thereafter, the Kehews applied to the Portsmouth Planning Board to subdivide lot No. 1 so that Mr. Kehew’s brother could build a home. It appears that their initial application the board, and it appears from the record that he was an interested party throughout the entire municipal process.', '-3- was withdrawn, but in 2005 another application was submitted in its stead. The board approved the Kehews’ application to subdivide the property, and it agreed to rescind the condition that it had previously imposed prohibiting any further subdivision of either lot No. 1 or lot No. 2.3', 'On March 8, 2005, John Ashley and Cheryl Beach filed a complaint in Newport County Superior Court against the Kehews, seeking injunctive relief. Specifically, they asked that the Kehews “be permanently enjoined and restrained from presenting to the Portsmouth Planning Board an application to subdivide Lot No. 1 into 2 lots, subdividing Lot No. 1 into 2 lots and erecting or permitting a third person to erect a residential dwelling on said lot.”4', 'After a trial without a jury, the trial justice issued a decision. After summarizing the essential facts surrounding the three purported releases by Laure Ashley, by McKinnon and Harwood, and by the board, the trial justice articulated the law upon which she relied in reaching her decision. She observed that restrictive covenants can be discharged either through releases or agreements. Then she commented that “several jurisdictions have held that the consent of all owners is required to release a subdivision’s restrictions” and cited three cases for this proposition: Flowers v. August, 426 S.W.2d 480, 482 (Ky. 1968); Dartmouth-Willow Terrace, Inc. v. MacLean, 371 S.W.2d 937, 938 (Ky. 1963); Truong v. City of Houston, 99 S.W.3d 204, 214 (Tex. Ct. App. 2002). 3', 'John Ashley and Cheryl Beach represented in their appeal to this Court that the board’s action in rescinding the conditions was being appealed. The status of that appeal is unknown at this time. 4', 'Prior to the filing of this complaint, John Ashley, Cheryl Beach, Timothy Banks, and several other plaintiffs filed a complaint in 2003, also in Newport County Superior Court, seeking a declaratory judgment that Selina Lane, the road on which lots No. 1 and No. 2 are situated, was a private road, not a public road. The trial justice consolidated both cases for purposes of trial. The trial justice concluded that Selina Lane was a public road. Timothy Banks, a plaintiff in that action and an owner of property on Selina Lane, appealed the trial justice’s decision to this Court. This Court was evenly divided on whether Selina Lane was a private or public road. That being the case, the trial justice’s decision was affirmed. Ashley v. Kehew, No. 2008-265-A. (R.I., filed April 28, 2010) (mem.).', '-4-', 'The trial justice went on to hold that:', '“The credible evidence demonstrates that all the parties agreed to', 'the release of the original restrictions, albeit not simultaneously.', 'Since the lot owners by ‘mutual agreement’ have ‘released and', 'relinquished their right to enforce the same’ the restrictions in', 'controversy are no longer enforceable. See Dartmouth-Willow', 'Terrace, 371 S.W.2d at 938.”', 'The trial justice found that the board had released the restrictions on the subdivision plat in 2005, that McKinnon had released the restrictions on lot No. 1 through his deed to Harwood and himself and then “reinforced that release” via his deed to the Kehews, and that lot No. 2 was released from the restrictions by the 1996 confirmatory quitclaim deed and affidavit and release signed by Laure. The trial justice entered a judgment denying John Ashley and Cheryl Beach’s claim for injunctive relief to enforce the restrictive covenants.', 'John Ashley and Cheryl Beach timely appealed to this Court.

41,"(concurrence and dissent begins on page 17) George Karousos et al. : v. : Jonathan Pardee et al. : Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty, and Robinson, JJ. OPINION Justice Flaherty, for the Court. A Superior Court judgment arising from the filing of an abuse-of-process claim and the affirmative defense provided by the anti-SLAPP (strategic litigation against public participation) statute, G.L. 1956 chapter 33 of title 9, has precipitated appeals both from the plaintiffs and the defendants. The Superior Court granted summary judgment in favor of Jonathan Pardee and the remaining defendants1 (defendants or Pardee)2 holding that they were immune from civil liability on an abuse-of-process action brought against them because their actions were not subjectively baseless and, therefore, they were cloaked with 1 The complaint listed twelve defendants. Only Jonathan Pardee, Leonard Decof, Alfred Carpionato, Sidney S. Gorham III, and Jay Schochet answered the complaint. The seven remaining defendants, Alexander G. Walsh, Frank DeFruscio, Sr., Richard C. Angelone, Ian McColough, Frank Marinelli, Turner C. Scott, and James F. Hyman, never answered the complaint, but no default judgment ever was entered against them. Only four defendants, Pardee, Schochet, Gorham, and Carpionato, are appellees and cross-appellants before this Court. 2 We refer to Pardee and the three other appellees and cross-appellants in the singular. We do so for clarity and convenience only. -1- immunity by the anti-SLAPP statute. In accordance with the statute, the Superior Court awarded Pardee what it deemed to be reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. George and Anna Karousos (collectively Karousos) appeal from the entry of summary judgment and the award of costs and attorneys’ fees to Pardee.3 Pardee cross-appeals the amount of the attorneys’ fees awarded to his counsel. We carefully have reviewed the record and considered the arguments raised by the parties. After doing so, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. I Facts and Travel Bellevue Avenue in Newport traverses a genteel section of that city. It is the address of the so-called “mansions” that served as summer homes for those who were this country’s financial elite during the gilded age. Bellevue Avenue has become one of the city’s showpieces, and is a major tourist attraction. The central dispute in this case is about how a building, known as Fairlawn, at 518 Bellevue Avenue, may be used. In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, Fairlawn was used as a preparatory school and, for part of that time, as Vernon Court Junior College. In 1972, Fairlawn’s school use ceased and the building was used exclusively as a residence. The zoning ordinance of the City of Newport permits the use of the building for residential purposes, but considers its use for educational purposes to be nonconforming. In 1991, Karousos leased the property, with an option to purchase, with the expectation that he could use the building as a culinary school. Karousos based his expectation on a 1989 letter from Newport Zoning Enforcement Officer Guy Weston (Weston) to Fairlawn’s then owners, George and Rosalyn Rosner. In that correspondence, Weston indicated that the use of Fairlawn as a school had not been abandoned, even though it had not been used as such since 3 Anna Karousos died while this action was pending. -2- 1972. In Weston’s opinion, because the school use was never abandoned, the use of the property as a school remained a legal nonconforming use. As soon as they leased Fairlawn, Karousos began making substantial improvements to the property, and at one point approached Salve Regina University about a possible affiliation with the school. In 1993, Karousos also began to advertise his intention to open an International Institute for Culinary Arts at Fairlawn. However, the City of Newport objected to the use of Fairlawn as a culinary school, and it initiated a zoning enforcement action against Karousos. In September 1994, Weston sent Karousos a letter, in which he detailed the actions that were necessary before the City of Newport would approve of the use of Fairlawn as a culinary school, including affiliating with Salve Regina.4 After Karousos complied, Weston further corresponded with Karousos, informing him that the City of Newport now approved of the use of Fairlawn as a culinary school; the enforcement action was dismissed, as well. Subsequently, Karousos exercised his option to purchase Fairlawn. In December 1994, Jonathan Pardee purchased a lot at the corner of Bellevue Avenue and Marine Avenue, adjacent to Fairlawn. In early 1996, Roger King, a former owner of Fairlawn, informed Pardee that Karousos intended to operate a culinary school there. In March 1996, Pardee, through his attorney Alexander Walsh, inquired of Weston about whether Fairlawn’s use as a culinary school was a permissible use under the city’s zoning ordinance. In correspondence dated March 19, 1996, Weston wrote that such a use was permitted, and he reiterated his opinion from his 1989 letter and attached a copy of it. On March 28, 1996, Pardee appealed to the 4 In addition to affiliating with Salve Regina, Weston said that Karousos and Salve Regina must comply with several requests, including that Salve Regina license Fairlawn from Karousos, that Salve Regina offer certain courses in the pertinent curriculum, that Salve Regina issue certificates of attendance, and that the facility could not offer public dining. -3- Newport Zoning Board (the board), asking that it determine that the use of Fairlawn as a culinary school was not permissible under the zoning ordinance. The board held multiple hearings between June 1996 and January 1997. After first ruling that Pardee’s appeal was timely, the board decided that the school use had been abandoned and that Karousos’s use of Fairlawn as a culinary school was an illegal nonconforming use.5 Karousos appealed the board’s decision to the Superior Court. A Superior Court justice reversed the board, ruling that the board had erred when it determined that Pardee’s appeal was timely. The hearing justice concluded that the only appealable action was Weston’s 1989 letter, and that the time to appeal from that letter had long passed. On December 12, 1996, while the hearings before the board were still ongoing, Karousos filed an abuse-of-process complaint in the Superior Court against Pardee and eleven other defendants. In his complaint, Karousos alleged that defendants used the March 19, 1996 letter from Weston as a pretext to “appeal” the 1989 and 1994 letters detailing Weston’s opinion that the use of Fairlawn as a school was permissible. The defendants, the complaint alleged, long since had waived any right to object to the use of Fairlawn as a school, and their appeal to the board “constitutes a gross misuse of the administration appellate process” for a “wrongful purpose.” Pardee and four other defendants answered the complaint; they asserted an affirmative defense that their actions in seeking review of the 1996 letter from Weston to Walsh (Walsh was acting on Pardee’s behalf) entitled them to immunity from civil liability, based upon § 9-33-2, the anti-SLAPP statute. 5 In March 1997, Karousos sold the property at 518 Bellevue Avenue to Salve Regina University. This property currently houses the Pell Center for International Relations and Public Policy. -4- In the spring of 1997, Pardee, along with the same four codefendants, moved for summary judgment, arguing that the anti-SLAPP statute’s grant of immunity applied to them because their seeking review of Weston’s 1996 letter was not objectively baseless. The motion justice denied the motion, ruling that because Pardee’s appeal was deemed untimely by the Superior Court, a question of fact remained about whether Pardee’s appeal was objectively baseless. Pardee petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari, which we denied. After we denied certiorari, the parties conducted discovery and the case languished for six more years. Jonathan Pardee and Alexander Walsh were deposed, and, at least based in part on their deposition testimony, Pardee filed a renewed motion for summary judgment in March 2003.6 He again argued that his appeal to the board entitled him to immunity under the anti- SLAPP statute because his actions were neither objectively nor subjectively baseless. In the motion, Pardee’s primary arguments were that (1) his appeal was not objectively baseless because he was successful before the board and (2) his appeal was not subjectively baseless because he pressed the appeal in an effort to prevent Fairlawn’s use as a culinary school, with no ulterior motive. Karousos opposed Pardee’s motion for summary judgment. Karousos argued that Pardee’s appeal to the board was objectively baseless because it was untimely, and the gross untimeliness of the appeal demonstrated that Pardee tried to use the administrative appeal process for a wrongful purpose in an effort to cause unjust delays to Karousos. This time, a different hearing justice granted summary judgment to Pardee. In a written decision, the motion justice determined that Pardee’s appeal was objectively baseless because, in her opinion, Pardee had no right to appeal any of the letters from Weston. The motion justice ruled that zoning enforcement officers derive their authority to provide advisory information 6 In 2001, Karousos’s claim against Leonard Decof was dismissed. -5- from G.L. 1956 § 45-24-54, but that such information is only for “guidance or clarification.” The motion justice reasoned that because such a letter is not binding, it does not aggrieve anyone, and therefore it cannot be appealed. Consequently, she determined that there was no enforceable right to appeal Weston’s letter to the board; and the motion justice ruled that Pardee’s attempt to be objectively baseless. Nonetheless, the motion justice granted Pardee’s summary-judgment motion because she concluded that Pardee’s appeal was not subjectively baseless. She reasoned that the stated basis for the appeal, namely, to halt the use of Fairlawn as a culinary school, was the only motive behind Pardee’s actions. Finally, the motion justice further found that even if Pardee was not entitled to immunity under the anti-SLAPP statute, the abuse-of-process claim would be unsuccessful because Karousos had failed to offer any ulterior motives for Pardee pursuing the zoning appeal, and thus he could not satisfy the elements of the claim.7 In 2007, the parties appeared before yet another Superior Court justice to determine whether Pardee was entitled to costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees as provided for in the anti- SLAPP statute. The motion justice determined that the award of costs and attorneys’ fees is mandatory with respect to a defendant who prevails at trial or by motion in successfully asserting immunity under the statute. But, she also ruled that the reasonableness of the attorneys’ fees and 7 An abuse-of-process claim requires proof “(1) that the defendant instituted proceedings or process against the plaintiff and (2) that the defendant used these proceedings for an ulterior or wrongful purpose that the proceedings were not designed to accomplish.” Fiorenzano v. Lima, 982 A.2d 585, 590 (R.I. 2009) (quoting Palazzo v. Alves, 944 A.2d 144, 154 (R.I. 2008)). Here, the motion justice found that Pardee’s stated reason for the appeal to the board was to seek review of Weston’s 1996 letter, and in turn, to prevent the use of Fairlawn as a culinary school. If Pardee was successful in his appeal, the property could not have been used to house a culinary school. Therefore, the motion justice held that Pardee appealed to the board to prevent what he believed to be an impermissible use of the land. The motion justice ruled that no ulterior motive reasonably can be drawn from the record and that Karousos was unable to meet his burden on the second element of the abuse-of-process claim. -6- the costs were within the court’s equitable discretion. The motion justice ruled that Pardee was entitled only to those costs and attorneys’ fees related to their successful motions, but not for the unsuccessful summary-judgment motion in 1997 or the petition for a writ of certiorari to this Court. Karousos timely appealed the grant of summary judgment and the award of costs and attorneys’ fees. Subsequently, Pardee timely filed a cross-appeal on the amount of attorneys’ fees and costs. II Issues on Appeal On appeal, Karousos raises two arguments. First, he argues that whether defendants’ actions were subjectively baseless is a matter for a fact-finder and that the motion justice erred by determining that issue as a matter of law. Second, Karousos seeks to have the award of attorneys’ fees vacated if the Court reverses the motion justice’s ruling that defendants’ actions were not subjectively baseless. In the cross-appeal, Pardee and the remaining defendants argue that they are entitled to the attorneys’ fees and costs that they incurred, including those relating to this appeal, as well as those incurred in the unsuccessful summary judgment motion and petition for a writ of certiorari, because these unsuccessful motions were, nonetheless, reasonable. III Analysis A Summary Judgment and the Anti-SLAPP Statute 1 Standard of Review -7- This Court reviews the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo. Berardis v. Louangxay, 969 A.2d 1288, 1291 (R.I. 2009). We apply the same standard as the motion justice: we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and if we conclude that no genuine issue of material fact exists, then the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and we affirm the grant of summary judgment. Id. 2 The “Sham” Exception “The anti-SLAPP statute was enacted to prevent vexatious lawsuits against citizens who exercise their First Amendment rights of free speech and legitimate petitioning by granting those activities conditional immunity from punitive civil claims.” Alves v. Hometown Newspapers, Inc., 857 A.2d 743, 752 (R.I. 2004) (citing Hometown Properties, Inc. v. Fleming, 680 A.2d 56, 61 (R.I. 1996)). Rhode Island’s anti-SLAPP statute derived from several United States Supreme Court cases: Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127 (1961) (Noerr), and United Mine Workers of America v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657 (1965), and Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc. v. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., 508 U.S. 49 (1993). In Noerr, 365 U.S. at 129, the United States Supreme Court considered whether a railroad association’s unfavorable publicity campaign against the trucking business constituted an antitrust violation. The Noerr Court held that the actions did not constitute an antitrust violation, but it also noted that “[t]here may be situations in which a publicity campaign, ostensibly directed toward influencing governmental action, is a mere sham to cover what is actually nothing more than an attempt to interfere directly with the business relationships of a competitor * * * .” Id. at 144. Four years later, in Pennington, 381 U.S. at 670, the Court interpreted Noerr -8- to “shield[] from [antitrust violations] a concerted effort to influence public officials regardless of intent or purpose.” In Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc., 508 U.S. at 60, 61, the Court established a “two-part definition” of actions constituting what the Noerr Court referred to as a “mere sham.” Noerr, 365 U.S. at 144. “First, the lawsuit must be objectively baseless in the sense that no reasonable litigant could realistically expect success on the merits.” Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc., 508 U.S. at 60. Second, the court must inquire whether the lawsuit is subjectively an attempt to interfere directly with an adversary’s business through the use of the governmental process rather than an effort to use the outcome of the governmental process for its legitimate ends. Id. at 60-61. If the definition’s “two-part definition” is satisfied, the challenged conduct is deemed a sham, and is not entitled to immunity. Id. at 61. By amending § 9-33-2 in 1995 (P.L. 1995, ch. 386, § 1), the Rhode Island General Assembly essentially adopted the two-part definition of sham participation outlined in Professional Real Estate Investors, but broadened its application to contexts beyond the field of antitrust. See Hometown Properties, Inc., 680 A.2d at 60-62. Section 9-33-2(a) provides that “[t]he petition or free speech constitutes a sham only if it is not genuinely aimed at procuring favorable government action, result, or outcome, regardless of ultimate motive or purpose.” The statute specifies that a petition or free speech constitutes a sham only if it is both objectively and subjectively baseless, as both of those terms are defined in the statute. Section 9-33-2(a)(1)(2). We will consider separately whether Pardee’s appeal was objectively or subjectively baseless. -9- a Objectively Baseless Section 9-33-2(a)(1) defines objectively baseless as meaning that “no reasonable person exercising the right of speech or petition could realistically expect success in procuring the government action, result, or outcome * * * .” It is worth noting that this Court has had several occasions to address this definition, and we never have held that a defendant’s actions were objectively baseless. In Cove Road Development v. Western Cranston Industrial Park Associates, 674 A.2d 1234, 1239 (R.I. 1996), we held that an appeal by landowners and industrial park members of a zoning amendment that was beneficial to a residential real estate developer that could have negatively impacted the industrial park operations “was not objectively baseless, in that an objective litigant could reasonably have expected a successful outcome.” In Hometown Properties, Inc., 680 A.2d at 58-59, 64, we held that letters and statements made to the Department of Environmental Management and other state and federal agencies opposed to a proposed landfill were not objectively baseless because, in part, they were grounded in scientific reports and studies. In Global Waste Recycling, Inc. v. Mallette, 762 A.2d 1208, 1210-13 (R.I. 2000), we affirmed the grant of conditional immunity under the anti-SLAPP statute to neighbors who made statements to a newspaper that were critical of the handling of flammable materials at a waste recycling plant after a fire broke out at the plant, because the statements were based on personal knowledge and publicly available information, and, therefore, were not objectively baseless. Most recently in Alves, 857 A.2d at 754, this Court determined that letters to the editor of a newspaper that addressed an issue of public concern that was currently under consideration by - 10 - the local government were not objectively baseless because they were a reasonable attempt to petition the government to address the defendant’s concerns. Indeed, only once, in Pound Hill Corp. v. Perl, 668 A.2d 1260, 1264 (R.I. 1996) (Pound Hill), has this Court determined that there were genuine issues of fact that required the denial of summary judgment and remand to the Superior Court for trial on the issue of whether a defendant’s petitioning activities constituted a sham. In Pound Hill, a landowner protested a town council’s vote to rezone a parcel of land even though the council vote clearly met the ordinances requirement of a three-fifths majority to rezone land. Id. at 1262. Additionally, the landowner in that case filed an action in the Superior Court to enjoin the town council from taking further action after the time for filing an appeal had expired, and also sought a further administrative appeal that lacked substantive merits, and an appeal to the Superior Court that was untimely. Id. at 1262, 1264. We vacated a grant of summary judgment on the ground that genuine issues of fact remained about whether the landowner’s actions “were objectively baseless and utilized the process itself rather than the intended outcome in order to hinder and delay plaintiff.” Id. at 1264, 1264-65. Here, the motion justice determined that Pardee’s actions were objectively baseless because she ruled that Pardee had no right to appeal Weston’s letters. She reasoned that the letters were purely informational and nonbinding, because such letters were statutorily restricted to be for “guidance or clarification” only. Reasoning that Pardee had not been aggrieved by a decision, and that only an aggrieved party can appeal to the board, the motion justice ruled that Pardee’s attempt to appeal lacked a legal basis and was thus objectively baseless. Before this Court, Pardee argues that even if there was no clear right to appeal Weston’s letters under the zoning ordinance, his appeal was not objectively baseless because the board, as - 11 - well as the motion justice who heard the 1997 motion for summary judgment, agreed that Pardee had the right to appeal from Weston’s letter. In other words, he asks how his appeal can be categorized as objectively baseless if the board granted it and the motion justice overruled the Board only because she said the appeal was untimely. In his appeal, Karousos embraces the 2003 motion justice’s rationale that Pardee’s actions were objectively baseless because Pardee had no statutory right to appeal from any of Weston’s letters. Because we agree with the motion justice’s ruling that Pardee’s appeal to the zoning board of review did not meet the second prong of the sham exception in that it was not subjectively baseless, we need not, and do not reach the issue of whether his efforts were objectively baseless. b Subjectively Baseless Section 9-33-2(a)(2) defines a subjectively baseless activity as that which “is actually an attempt to use the governmental process itself for its own direct effects.” However, “[u]se of outcome or result of the governmental process shall not constitute use of the governmental process itself for its own direct effects.” Id. In Pound Hill, 668 A.2d at 1264, this Court addressed the elements of “sham” litigation in a decision that predated the enactment of § 9-33- 2’s definition of subjectively baseless. The Pound Hill Court suggested that courts must inquire into whether the litigants “utilized the process itself rather than the intended outcome in order to hinder and delay plaintiff.” Pound Hill, 668 A.2d at 1264. The 2003 motion justice found that: “[The Karousoses] do not allege that Pardee’s appeal was meant to harass, blackmail, or otherwise serve a purpose other than to contest what the parties appear to have taken to be a binding determination of the Zoning Officer. Rather, their suit is based - 12 - solely upon the existence of the 1989 letter and Pardee’s alleged desire to appeal that determination. However, where, as here, a potential litigant’s motivation in seeking review of a governmental action, albeit non-binding governmental action, relates solely to the substance of that action, the existence of a previous action to the same effect does not render the appeal any less an attempt to use the outcome or result of the process, rather than the direct effects.” The motion justice determined that in his objection to the motion for summary judgment Karousos was unable to offer any facts that would suggest that Pardee’s appeal was motivated by anything other than outcome of the process. She therefore found that Pardee’s appeal was not subjectively baseless and ruled that summary judgment must be granted. We agree with the motion justice’s conclusions, and affirm the grant of summary judgment. A “party opposing a summary judgment motion may not simply rest on the allegations and denials in his or her pleadings, but must prove by competent evidence the existence of a disputed material issue of fact.” Brito v. Capone, 819 A.2d 663, 666 (R.I. 2003) (citing Accent Store Design, Inc. v. Marathon House, Inc., 674 A.2d 1223, 1225 (R.I. 1996)). “Therefore, we will affirm the grant of summary judgment ‘against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party’s case * * *.’” Berardis, 969 A.2d at 1291 (quoting Lavoie v. North East Knitting, Inc., 918 A.2d 225, 228 (R.I. 2007)). In his 2003 motion for summary judgment, Pardee submitted the transcripts from two depositions, his own and that of Alexander Walsh, who was Pardee’s attorney and an original defendant in this action.8 In those depositions, both Pardee and Walsh testified that Weston’s 1996 letter was appealed because Pardee wanted to prevent Fairlawn’s use as a culinary school. In Pardee’s words, “I didn’t want any commercial activity next to my planned home.” Neither Pardee nor Walsh testified to any other motive for pressing the appeal. Once Pardee came 8 Although Walsh was a defendant with respect to the abuse-of-process claim, he is not an appellee or cross-appellant in this appeal. - 13 - forward with this evidence, the burden shifted to Karousos to offer some evidence to establish that Pardee sought the appeal for its direct effects and not for its outcome. See § 9-33-2(a)(2); Brito, 819 A.2d at 666. In his opposition to Pardee’s 2003 motion for summary judgment, Karousos merely repeated his allegations that, given the long delay between Weston’s 1989 letter and his 1996 letter, Pardee could have been motivated only by an interest in causing further burdens and delays to the opening of Karousos’s culinary school. Karousos’s mere allegations were insufficient to rebut the statements under oath offered by Pardee, and therefore Karousos failed to meet his burden of showing the existence of a disputed material issue of fact. See Casco Indemnity Co. v. Gonsalves, 839 A.2d 546, 548 (R.I. 2004) (“the party opposing the motion for summary judgment, carries the burden of proving by competent evidence the existence of a disputed material issue of fact and cannot rest on allegations or denials in the pleadings or on conclusions or legal opinions”). As a result, Pardee’s petitioning activity was not a sham and warrants immunity under the anti-SLAPP statute. Consequently, Pardee was entitled to summary judgment in his favor because his appeal to the board was not subjectively baseless. B Attorneys’ Fees and Costs Section 9-33-2(d) provides that “[i]f the court grants the motion asserting the immunity established by this section, * * * the court shall award the prevailing party costs and reasonable attorney’s fees, including those incurred for the motion and any related discovery matters.” In Alves, 857 A.2d at 757, we said that when a party “prevail[s] under the anti-SLAPP statute * * * an award of costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees [is] mandatory.” - 14 - The statute does not provide, however, what costs are mandatory or a specific measure of reasonable attorneys’ fees. We said in Alves that we would not disturb the motion justice’s award of attorneys’ fees and costs. Alves, 857 A.2d at 757. This deference to the lower court justice’s determination of what constitutes reasonable attorneys’ fees is consistent with our case law. See Schroff, Inc. v. Taylor-Peterson, 732 A.2d 719, 721 (R.I. 1999) (“the amount awarded in counsel fees is within the sound discretion of the trial judge in light of the circumstances of each case”) (citing Annunziata v. ITI Royal Electric Co., 479 A.2d 743, 744 (R.I. 1984)). In Alves, 857 A.2d at 747, 757, the motion justice considered affidavits and exhibits concerning the costs and fees incurred in preparing the defendant’s response to a complaint for one slander count, two libel counts, and two false-light counts, and adjusted the total award to what she deemed reasonable. The motion justice granted to the defendant, who benefited from conditional immunity, all his fees for defending the slander count but half his fees for defending the libel and false-light claims. Id. at 757. In his 2007 motion for attorneys’ fees and costs, Pardee’s counsel submitted affidavits and exhibits detailing the attorneys’ fees incurred. The 2007 motion justice agreed with Pardee that costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees were mandatory under the anti-SLAPP statute but awarded an amount for those fees based upon what she deemed to be equitable. After reviewing Pardee’s request, the motion justice determined that Pardee should receive fees only for the successful assertion of anti-SLAPP immunity, and she denied awarding the costs and attorneys’ fees that were related to his unsuccessful 1997 motion for summary judgment and the petition for a writ of certiorari that was denied. In his appeal of that ruling, Pardee argues that the motion justice “committed legal error” when she limited his award of attorneys’ fees and costs only to the successful motions. Pardee - 15 - emphasizes that the statute’s only limitation on the amount of the award of attorneys’ fees is whether the fees were reasonable; whether the litigant was successful in every tactical move is not a consideration. In particular, Pardee argues that the 1997 summary judgment motion and subsequent petition for a writ of certiorari were reasonable efforts to comply with the statute’s purpose in granting conditional immunity at the onset of litigation, even if those particular efforts did not bear fruit. See § 9-33-1 (acknowledging the rise of lawsuits aimed at suppressing legitimate exercises of constitutional rights and declaring that resolutions of such lawsuits “should be resolved quickly with minimum cost to citizens who have participated in matters of public concern”). Pardee contends that the 1997 summary judgment motion and petition for a writ of certiorari both were reasonable because the 1997 motion justice thought the motion had “considerable merit” and “she encouraged the petition” for a writ of certiorari. Additionally, Pardee argues that he is also entitled to attorneys’ fees and costs for this appeal. After considering the record and the motion justice’s decision, we hold that the motion justice did not abuse her discretion in finding that Pardee’s reasonable attorneys’ fees should not include the fees incurred in his unsuccessful 1997 summary judgment motion and his unsuccessful petition for a writ of certiorari to this Court. The motion justice was correct when she concluded that the anti-SLAPP statute’s attorneys’ fees and costs provision was mandatory, but that the amount of the fees and costs were subject to her determination of what was reasonable. See § 9-33-2(d); Alves, 857 A.2d at 757; Schroff, Inc., 732 A.2d at 721. Here, the motion justice appropriately considered the affidavits and exhibits submitted by Pardee’s counsel in determining the reasonableness of the award of attorneys’ fees and costs. We find no fault in her reasoning or her conclusion, and affirm her judgment. - 16 - Finally, Pardee asks this Court for attorneys’ fees and costs in connection with this appeal. We agree that the anti-SLAPP statute entitles him to reasonable attorneys’ fees for the defense of the judgment. We remand this case to the Superior Court for a determination of what those fees and costs should be. IV Conclusion The judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed. The record in this case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. Robinson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part. I readily concur in the Court’s holding to the effect that the defendants should not be awarded attorneys’ fees in connection with either their unsuccessful first motion for summary judgment or their unsuccessful petition for certiorari; in my view, the anti-SLAPP statute should not be construed as authorizing the payment of attorneys’ fees for such unsuccessful quests. However, I respectfully part company from the majority with respect to its sustaining the Superior Court’s later grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants under the anti-SLAPP statute and its consequent award of attorneys’ fees. As I understand Rule 56 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure and the copious body of jurisprudence relative to the summary judgment mechanism, I do not believe that the hearing justice should have granted summary judgment on the basis of her ruling that defendants’ actions were “not subjectively baseless.” I am firmly convinced that summary judgment is not an appropriate mechanism for resolving - 17 - controversies that turn on an assessment of the subjective intent of a party—and certainly the issue of subjective baselessness vel non involves a determination of subjective intent.9 It is my view that the determination of whether defendants’ actions were subjectively baseless (vel non) should have been grist for the mill of a fact-finder. In my judgment, such a determination is simply not susceptible to summary disposition. It is noteworthy that, in his supplemental memorandum in opposition to defendants’ successful 2003 motion for summary judgment, Karousos explicitly argued that “[t]he gross untimeliness alone of the defendants’ concerted efforts to burden and delay Mr. Karousos from opening his culinary school * * * creates a triable issue regarding the propriety of the defendants’ actions.” (Emphasis added.) In my opinion, it is very much a question of fact as to whether it was defendants’ subjective intention to legitimately petition the zoning board or whether, alternatively, the petition was a “mere sham.” See G.L. 1956 § 9-33-2. Numerous issues (including, I submit, the issue of subjective baselessness vel non) are, by their very nature, inherently incapable of being decided by summary judgment. See, e.g., Gliottone v. Ethier, 870 A.2d 1022, 1028 (R.I. 2005) (“[I]ssues of negligence are ordinarily not susceptible of summary adjudication, but should be resolved by trial in the ordinary manner.”) 9 Furthermore, prescinding from the procedural (i.e., Rule 56 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure) issue, I wish to indicate that I am troubled by the provision in the anti-SLAPP statute that requires the awarding of attorneys’ fees to a party whose actions have been found to have been “objectively baseless” (provided only that those actions are also found not to have been subjectively baseless). See G.L. 1956 § 9-33-2. Our law does not usually grant attorneys’ fees to a party that has engaged in “objectively baseless” activity. However, I realize that we are faced here with a statutory mandate, and I also realize “[t]he remedy for a harsh law is not in interpretation, but in amendment or repeal.” State v. Duggan, 15 R.I. 403, 409, 6 A. 787, 788 (1886). Anti-SLAPP statutes undoubtedly serve a useful purpose, but it is important that they not improperly thwart the constitutional right of access to the courts. See Palazzo v. Alves, 944 A.2d 144, 150 & nn.10 & 11 (R.I. 2008). - 18 - (quoting Rogers v. Peabody Coal Co., 342 F.2d 749, 751 (6th Cir. 1965)); see generally Poller v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 368 U.S. 464, 473 (1962) (“We believe that summary procedures should be used sparingly in complex antitrust litigation where motive and intent play leading roles, the proof is largely in the hands of the alleged conspirators, and hostile witnesses thicken the plot.”); Schmidt v. McKay, 555 F.2d 30, 37 (2d Cir. 1977); see also Hunt v. Cromartie, 526 U.S. 541, 552 (1999) (holding that whether the gerrymandering at issue was the product of impermissible racial motivation was a disputed fact and that “it was error in this case for the District Court to resolve the disputed fact of motivation at the summary judgment stage”); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986) (“Credibility determinations, the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions * * *.”); Santana v. Rainbow Cleaners, Inc., 969 A.2d 653, 658 (R.I. 2009); Pontbriand v. Sundlun, 699 A.2d 856, 865 (R.I. 1997).10 It is self-evident to me that the determination of the presence of subjective baselessness vel non requires the scrutiny of the human heart and mind.11 It has long been held that the summary judgment procedural mechanism is ordinarily inappropriate for resolving such issues of 10 In addition, this Court has on numerous occasions emphasized the drastic nature of the summary judgment mechanism. See, e.g., Estate of Giuliano v. Giuliano, 949 A.2d 386, 390 (R.I. 2008) (“Summary judgment is a drastic remedy, and a motion for summary judgment should be dealt with cautiously.”) (Internal quotation marks omitted.); DePasquale v. Venus Pizza, Inc., 727 A.2d 683, 685 (R.I. 1999) (“This Court has consistently acknowledged that summary judgment is a harsh remedy that must be applied cautiously.”); Sjogren v. Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Co., 703 A.2d 608, 610 (R.I. 1997) (“Summary judgment is an extreme remedy that should be applied cautiously.”). Moreover, this Court has repeatedly emphasized that the “purpose of the summary judgment procedure is issue finding, not issue determination.” Industrial National Bank v. Peloso, 121 R.I. 305, 307, 397 A.2d 1312, 1313 (1979); see also Estate of Giuliano, 949 A.2d at 391; Saltzman v. Atlantic Realty Co., Inc., 434 A.2d 1343, 1345 (R.I. 1981). 11 One can conceive of a case where subjective baselessness is entirely clear—for example where there is an unambiguous admission by a party to that effect. But this is no such case. - 19 - intent and state of mind. See Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. v. Farr, 594 A.2d 379, 381 (R.I. 1991) (“If a dispute about intent is apparent in the record, then a genuine issue of material fact has been discovered and it may not be decided in a motion for summary judgment.”); see also Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Home Insurance Co., 672 F.2d 252, 257 (2d Cir. 1982) (“In light of the court’s obligation to draw all reasonable inferences against the moving party, summary judgment is rarely appropriate where the moving party’s state of mind is a material issue.”); Maiorana v. MacDonald, 596 F.2d 1072, 1076-77 (1st Cir. 1979) (“We are well aware * * * that cases like this one in which state of mind is at issue do not usually lend themselves to summary judgment.”); Croley v. Matson Navigation Co., 434 F.2d 73, 77 (5th Cir. 1970) (“The court should be cautious in granting a motion for summary judgment when resolution of the dispositive issue requires a determination of state of mind.”); Brett T. Reynolds, Comment: Appellate Review of Lanham Act Violations: Is Likelihood of Confusion a Question of Law or Fact?, 38 Southwestern L. J. 743, 772 (1984) (“Summary judgment is usually inappropriate to resolve disputes concerning state of mind and conflicting interpretations of perceived events because state of mind is normally an inference drawn from facts.”). For the foregoing reasons, it is my opinion that summary judgment was not an appropriate procedural mechanism for evaluating the subjective baselessness component of the anti-SLAPP statute. I would have remanded the case to the Superior Court for fact-finding with regard to the issue of the defendants’ subjective intent. - 20 - Supreme Court No. 2008-174-Appeal. No. 2008-188-Appeal.

A Superior Court judgment arising from the filing of an abuse-of-process claim and the affirmative defense provided by the anti-SLAPP (strategic litigation against public participation) statute, G.L. 1956 chapter 33 of title 9, has precipitated appeals both from the plaintiffs and the defendants. The Superior Court granted summary judgment in favor of Jonathan Pardee and the remaining defendants1 (defendants or Pardee)2 holding that they were immune from civil liability on an abuse-of-process action brought against them because their actions were not subjectively baseless and, therefore, they were cloaked with 1', 'The complaint listed twelve defendants. Only Jonathan Pardee, Leonard Decof, Alfred Carpionato, Sidney S. Gorham III, and Jay Schochet answered the complaint. The seven remaining defendants, Alexander G. Walsh, Frank DeFruscio, Sr., Richard C. Angelone, Ian McColough, Frank Marinelli, Turner C. Scott, and James F. Hyman, never answered the complaint, but no default judgment ever was entered against them.

In accordance with the statute, the Superior Court awarded Pardee what it deemed to be reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. George and Anna Karousos (collectively Karousos) appeal from the entry of summary judgment and the award of costs and attorneys’ fees to Pardee.3', 'Pardee cross-appeals the amount of the attorneys’ fees awarded to his counsel. We carefully have reviewed the record and considered the arguments raised by the parties. After doing so, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Bellevue Avenue in Newport traverses a genteel section of that city. It is the address of the so-called “mansions” that served as summer homes for those who were this country’s financial elite during the gilded age. Bellevue Avenue has become one of the city’s showpieces, and is a major tourist attraction. The central dispute in this case is about how a building, known as Fairlawn, at 518 Bellevue Avenue, may be used. In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, Fairlawn was used as a preparatory school and, for part of that time, as Vernon Court Junior College. In 1972, Fairlawn’s school use ceased and the building was used exclusively as a residence. The zoning ordinance of the City of Newport permits the use of the building for residential purposes, but considers its use for educational purposes to be nonconforming.', 'In 1991, Karousos leased the property, with an option to purchase, with the expectation that he could use the building as a culinary school. Karousos based his expectation on a 1989 letter from Newport Zoning Enforcement Officer Guy Weston (Weston) to Fairlawn’s then owners, George and Rosalyn Rosner. In that correspondence, Weston indicated that the use of Fairlawn as a school had not been abandoned, even though it had not been used as such since 3', 'Anna Karousos died while this action was pending.', '-2- 1972. In Weston’s opinion, because the school use was never abandoned, the use of the property as a school remained a legal nonconforming use.', 'As soon as they leased Fairlawn, Karousos began making substantial improvements to the property, and at one point approached Salve Regina University about a possible affiliation with the school. In 1993, Karousos also began to advertise his intention to open an International Institute for Culinary Arts at Fairlawn. However, the City of Newport objected to the use of Fairlawn as a culinary school, and it initiated a zoning enforcement action against Karousos. In September 1994, Weston sent Karousos a letter, in which he detailed the actions that were necessary before the City of Newport would approve of the use of Fairlawn as a culinary school, including affiliating with Salve Regina.4 After Karousos complied, Weston further corresponded with Karousos, informing him that the City of Newport now approved of the use of Fairlawn as a culinary school; the enforcement action was dismissed, as well.', 'Subsequently, Karousos exercised his option to purchase Fairlawn.', 'In December 1994, Jonathan Pardee purchased a lot at the corner of Bellevue Avenue and Marine Avenue, adjacent to Fairlawn. In early 1996, Roger King, a former owner of Fairlawn, informed Pardee that Karousos intended to operate a culinary school there. In March 1996, Pardee, through his attorney Alexander Walsh, inquired of Weston about whether Fairlawn’s use as a culinary school was a permissible use under the city’s zoning ordinance. In correspondence dated March 19, 1996, Weston wrote that such a use was permitted, and he reiterated his opinion from his 1989 letter and attached a copy of it. On March 28, 1996, Pardee appealed to the 4', 'In addition to affiliating with Salve Regina, Weston said that Karousos and Salve Regina must comply with several requests, including that Salve Regina license Fairlawn from Karousos, that Salve Regina offer certain courses in the pertinent curriculum, that Salve Regina issue certificates of attendance, and that the facility could not offer public dining.', '-3- Newport Zoning Board (the board), asking that it determine that the use of Fairlawn as a culinary school was not permissible under the zoning ordinance.', 'The board held multiple hearings between June 1996 and January 1997. After first ruling that Pardee’s appeal was timely, the board decided that the school use had been abandoned and that Karousos’s use of Fairlawn as a culinary school was an illegal nonconforming use.5 Karousos appealed the board’s decision to the Superior Court. A Superior Court justice reversed the board, ruling that the board had erred when it determined that Pardee’s appeal was timely. The hearing justice concluded that the only appealable action was Weston’s 1989 letter, and that the time to appeal from that letter had long passed.', 'On December 12, 1996, while the hearings before the board were still ongoing, Karousos filed an abuse-of-process complaint in the Superior Court against Pardee and eleven other defendants. In his complaint, Karousos alleged that defendants used the March 19, 1996 letter from Weston as a pretext to “appeal” the 1989 and 1994 letters detailing Weston’s opinion that the use of Fairlawn as a school was permissible. The defendants, the complaint alleged, long since had waived any right to object to the use of Fairlawn as a school, and their appeal to the board “constitutes a gross misuse of the administration appellate process” for a “wrongful purpose.” Pardee and four other defendants answered the complaint; they asserted an affirmative defense that their actions in seeking review of the 1996 letter from Weston to Walsh (Walsh was acting on Pardee’s behalf) entitled them to immunity from civil liability, based upon § 9-33-2, the anti-SLAPP statute. 5', 'In March 1997, Karousos sold the property at 518 Bellevue Avenue to Salve Regina University. This property currently houses the Pell Center for International Relations and Public Policy.', '-4-', 'In the spring of 1997, Pardee, along with the same four codefendants, moved for summary judgment, arguing that the anti-SLAPP statute’s grant of immunity applied to them because their seeking review of Weston’s 1996 letter was not objectively baseless. The motion justice denied the motion, ruling that because Pardee’s appeal was deemed untimely by the Superior Court, a question of fact remained about whether Pardee’s appeal was objectively baseless. Pardee petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari, which we denied.', 'After we denied certiorari, the parties conducted discovery and the case languished for six more years. Jonathan Pardee and Alexander Walsh were deposed, and, at least based in part on their deposition testimony, Pardee filed a renewed motion for summary judgment in March 2003.6', 'He again argued that his appeal to the board entitled him to immunity under the anti- SLAPP statute because his actions were neither objectively nor subjectively baseless. In the motion, Pardee’s primary arguments were that (1) his appeal was not objectively baseless because he was successful before the board and (2) his appeal was not subjectively baseless because he pressed the appeal in an effort to prevent Fairlawn’s use as a culinary school, with no ulterior motive. Karousos opposed Pardee’s motion for summary judgment. Karousos argued that Pardee’s appeal to the board was objectively baseless because it was untimely, and the gross untimeliness of the appeal demonstrated that Pardee tried to use the administrative appeal process for a wrongful purpose in an effort to cause unjust delays to Karousos.', 'This time, a different hearing justice granted summary judgment to Pardee. In a written decision, the motion justice determined that Pardee’s appeal was objectively baseless because, in her opinion, Pardee had no right to appeal any of the letters from Weston. The motion justice ruled that zoning enforcement officers derive their authority to provide advisory information 6', 'In 2001, Karousos’s claim against Leonard Decof was dismissed.', '-5- from G.L. 1956 § 45-24-54, but that such information is only for “guidance or clarification.” The motion justice reasoned that because such a letter is not binding, it does not aggrieve anyone, and therefore it cannot be appealed. Consequently, she determined that there was no enforceable right to appeal Weston’s letter to the board; and the motion justice ruled that Pardee’s attempt to be objectively baseless.', 'Nonetheless, the motion justice granted Pardee’s summary-judgment motion because she concluded that Pardee’s appeal was not subjectively baseless. She reasoned that the stated basis for the appeal, namely, to halt the use of Fairlawn as a culinary school, was the only motive behind Pardee’s actions. Finally, the motion justice further found that even if Pardee was not entitled to immunity under the anti-SLAPP statute, the abuse-of-process claim would be unsuccessful because Karousos had failed to offer any ulterior motives for Pardee pursuing the zoning appeal, and thus he could not satisfy the elements of the claim.7', 'In 2007, the parties appeared before yet another Superior Court justice to determine whether Pardee was entitled to costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees as provided for in the anti- SLAPP statute. The motion justice determined that the award of costs and attorneys’ fees is mandatory with respect to a defendant who prevails at trial or by motion in successfully asserting immunity under the statute. But, she also ruled that the reasonableness of the attorneys’ fees and 7', 'An abuse-of-process claim requires proof “(1) that the defendant instituted proceedings or process against the plaintiff and (2) that the defendant used these proceedings for an ulterior or wrongful purpose that the proceedings were not designed to accomplish.” Fiorenzano v.

Here, the motion justice found that Pardee’s stated reason for the appeal to the board was to seek review of Weston’s 1996 letter, and in turn, to prevent the use of Fairlawn as a culinary school. If Pardee was successful in his appeal, the property could not have been used to house a culinary school. Therefore, the motion justice held that Pardee appealed to the board to prevent what he believed to be an impermissible use of the land. The motion justice ruled that no ulterior motive reasonably can be drawn from the record and that Karousos was unable to meet his burden on the second element of the abuse-of-process claim.', '-6- the costs were within the court’s equitable discretion. The motion justice ruled that Pardee was entitled only to those costs and attorneys’ fees related to their successful motions, but not for the unsuccessful summary-judgment motion in 1997 or the petition for a writ of certiorari to this Court. Karousos timely appealed the grant of summary judgment and the award of costs and attorneys’ fees. Subsequently, Pardee timely filed a cross-appeal on the amount of attorneys’ fees and costs.', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'On appeal, Karousos raises two arguments. First, he argues that whether defendants’ actions were subjectively baseless is a matter for a fact-finder and that the motion justice erred by determining that issue as a matter of law. Second, Karousos seeks to have the award of attorneys’ fees vacated if the Court reverses the motion justice’s ruling that defendants’ actions were not subjectively baseless. In the cross-appeal, Pardee and the remaining defendants argue that they are entitled to the attorneys’ fees and costs that they incurred, including those relating to this appeal, as well as those incurred in the unsuccessful summary judgment motion and petition for a writ of certiorari, because these unsuccessful motions were, nonetheless, reasonable.', 'III', 'Analysis', 'A', 'Summary Judgment and the Anti-SLAPP Statute', '1', 'Standard of Review', '-7-', 'This Court reviews the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo.

The Pound Hill Court suggested that courts must inquire into whether the litigants “utilized the process itself rather than the intended outcome in order to hinder and delay plaintiff.” Pound Hill, 668 A.2d at 1264.', 'The 2003 motion justice found that:', '“[The Karousoses] do not allege that Pardee’s appeal was meant to', 'harass, blackmail, or otherwise serve a purpose other than to', 'contest what the parties appear to have taken to be a binding', 'determination of the Zoning Officer. Rather, their suit is based', '- 12 -', 'solely upon the existence of the 1989 letter and Pardee’s alleged', 'desire to appeal that determination. However, where, as here, a', 'potential litigant’s motivation in seeking review of a governmental', 'action, albeit non-binding governmental action, relates solely to the', 'substance of that action, the existence of a previous action to the', 'same effect does not render the appeal any less an attempt to use', 'the outcome or result of the process, rather than the direct effects.” The motion justice determined that in his objection to the motion for summary judgment Karousos was unable to offer any facts that would suggest that Pardee’s appeal was motivated by anything other than outcome of the process. She therefore found that Pardee’s appeal was not subjectively baseless and ruled that summary judgment must be granted. We agree with the motion justice’s conclusions, and affirm the grant of summary judgment.', 'A “party opposing a summary judgment motion may not simply rest on the allegations and denials in his or her pleadings, but must prove by competent evidence the existence of a disputed material issue of fact.” Brito v. Capone, 819 A.2d 663, 666 (R.I. 2003) (citing Accent Store Design, Inc. v. Marathon House, Inc., 674 A.2d 1223, 1225 (R.I. 1996)). “Therefore, we will affirm the grant of summary judgment ‘against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party’s case * * *.’” Berardis, 969 A.2d at 1291 (quoting Lavoie v. North East Knitting, Inc., 918 A.2d 225, 228 (R.I. 2007)).', 'In his 2003 motion for summary judgment, Pardee submitted the transcripts from two depositions, his own and that of Alexander Walsh, who was Pardee’s attorney and an original defendant in this action.8 In those depositions, both Pardee and Walsh testified that Weston’s 1996 letter was appealed because Pardee wanted to prevent Fairlawn’s use as a culinary school. In Pardee’s words, “I didn’t want any commercial activity next to my planned home.” Neither Pardee nor Walsh testified to any other motive for pressing the appeal. Once Pardee came 8', 'Although Walsh was a defendant with respect to the abuse-of-process claim, he is not an appellee or cross-appellant in this appeal.', '- 13 - forward with this evidence, the burden shifted to Karousos to offer some evidence to establish that Pardee sought the appeal for its direct effects and not for its outcome. See § 9-33-2(a)(2); Brito, 819 A.2d at 666.', 'In his opposition to Pardee’s 2003 motion for summary judgment, Karousos merely repeated his allegations that, given the long delay between Weston’s 1989 letter and his 1996 letter, Pardee could have been motivated only by an interest in causing further burdens and delays to the opening of Karousos’s culinary school.', 'Karousos’s mere allegations were insufficient to rebut the statements under oath offered by Pardee, and therefore Karousos failed to meet his burden of showing the existence of a disputed material issue of fact. See Casco Indemnity Co. v. Gonsalves, 839 A.2d 546, 548 (R.I. 2004) (“the party opposing the motion for summary judgment, carries the burden of proving by competent evidence the existence of a disputed material issue of fact and cannot rest on allegations or denials in the pleadings or on conclusions or legal opinions”). As a result, Pardee’s petitioning activity was not a sham and warrants immunity under the anti-SLAPP statute.', 'Consequently, Pardee was entitled to summary judgment in his favor because his appeal to the board was not subjectively baseless.', 'B', 'Attorneys’ Fees and Costs', 'Section 9-33-2(d) provides that “[i]f the court grants the motion asserting the immunity established by this section, * * * the court shall award the prevailing party costs and reasonable attorney’s fees, including those incurred for the motion and any related discovery matters.” In Alves, 857 A.2d at 757, we said that when a party “prevail[s] under the anti-SLAPP statute * * * an award of costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees [is] mandatory.”', '- 14 -', 'The statute does not provide, however, what costs are mandatory or a specific measure of reasonable attorneys’ fees. We said in Alves that we would not disturb the motion justice’s award of attorneys’ fees and costs. Alves, 857 A.2d at 757. This deference to the lower court justice’s determination of what constitutes reasonable attorneys’ fees is consistent with our case law. See Schroff, Inc. v. Taylor-Peterson, 732 A.2d 719, 721 (R.I. 1999) (“the amount awarded in counsel fees is within the sound discretion of the trial judge in light of the circumstances of each case”) (citing Annunziata v. ITI Royal Electric Co., 479 A.2d 743, 744 (R.I. 1984)).', 'In Alves, 857 A.2d at 747, 757, the motion justice considered affidavits and exhibits concerning the costs and fees incurred in preparing the defendant’s response to a complaint for one slander count, two libel counts, and two false-light counts, and adjusted the total award to what she deemed reasonable. The motion justice granted to the defendant, who benefited from conditional immunity, all his fees for defending the slander count but half his fees for defending the libel and false-light claims. Id. at 757.', 'In his 2007 motion for attorneys’ fees and costs, Pardee’s counsel submitted affidavits and exhibits detailing the attorneys’ fees incurred. The 2007 motion justice agreed with Pardee that costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees were mandatory under the anti-SLAPP statute but awarded an amount for those fees based upon what she deemed to be equitable. After reviewing Pardee’s request, the motion justice determined that Pardee should receive fees only for the successful assertion of anti-SLAPP immunity, and she denied awarding the costs and attorneys’ fees that were related to his unsuccessful 1997 motion for summary judgment and the petition for a writ of certiorari that was denied.', 'In his appeal of that ruling, Pardee argues that the motion justice “committed legal error” when she limited his award of attorneys’ fees and costs only to the successful motions. Pardee', '- 15 - emphasizes that the statute’s only limitation on the amount of the award of attorneys’ fees is whether the fees were reasonable; whether the litigant was successful in every tactical move is not a consideration. In particular, Pardee argues that the 1997 summary judgment motion and subsequent petition for a writ of certiorari were reasonable efforts to comply with the statute’s purpose in granting conditional immunity at the onset of litigation, even if those particular efforts did not bear fruit. See § 9-33-1 (acknowledging the rise of lawsuits aimed at suppressing legitimate exercises of constitutional rights and declaring that resolutions of such lawsuits “should be resolved quickly with minimum cost to citizens who have participated in matters of public concern”). Pardee contends that the 1997 summary judgment motion and petition for a writ of certiorari both were reasonable because the 1997 motion justice thought the motion had “considerable merit” and “she encouraged the petition” for a writ of certiorari. Additionally, Pardee argues that he is also entitled to attorneys’ fees and costs for this appeal.', 'After considering the record and the motion justice’s decision, we hold that the motion justice did not abuse her discretion in finding that Pardee’s reasonable attorneys’ fees should not include the fees incurred in his unsuccessful 1997 summary judgment motion and his unsuccessful petition for a writ of certiorari to this Court. The motion justice was correct when she concluded that the anti-SLAPP statute’s attorneys’ fees and costs provision was mandatory, but that the amount of the fees and costs were subject to her determination of what was reasonable. See § 9-33-2(d); Alves, 857 A.2d at 757; Schroff, Inc., 732 A.2d at 721. Here, the motion justice appropriately considered the affidavits and exhibits submitted by Pardee’s counsel in determining the reasonableness of the award of attorneys’ fees and costs. We find no fault in her reasoning or her conclusion, and affirm her judgment.', '- 16 -', 'Finally, Pardee asks this Court for attorneys’ fees and costs in connection with this appeal. We agree that the anti-SLAPP statute entitles him to reasonable attorneys’ fees for the defense of the judgment. We remand this case to the Superior Court for a determination of what those fees and costs should be.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'The judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed. The record in this case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.', 'Robinson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part. I readily concur in the Court’s holding to the effect that the defendants should not be awarded attorneys’ fees in connection with either their unsuccessful first motion for summary judgment or their unsuccessful petition for certiorari; in my view, the anti-SLAPP statute should not be construed as authorizing the payment of attorneys’ fees for such unsuccessful quests.', 'However, I respectfully part company from the majority with respect to its sustaining the Superior Court’s later grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants under the anti-SLAPP statute and its consequent award of attorneys’ fees. As I understand Rule 56 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure and the copious body of jurisprudence relative to the summary judgment mechanism, I do not believe that the hearing justice should have granted summary judgment on the basis of her ruling that defendants’ actions were “not subjectively baseless.” I am firmly convinced that summary judgment is not an appropriate mechanism for resolving', '- 17 - controversies that turn on an assessment of the subjective intent of a party—and certainly the issue of subjective baselessness vel non involves a determination of subjective intent.9', 'It is my view that the determination of whether defendants’ actions were subjectively baseless (vel non) should have been grist for the mill of a fact-finder. In my judgment, such a determination is simply not susceptible to summary disposition. It is noteworthy that, in his supplemental memorandum in opposition to defendants’ successful 2003 motion for summary judgment, Karousos explicitly argued that “[t]he gross untimeliness alone of the defendants’ concerted efforts to burden and delay Mr. Karousos from opening his culinary school * * * creates a triable issue regarding the propriety of the defendants’ actions.” (Emphasis added.) In my opinion, it is very much a question of fact as to whether it was defendants’ subjective intention to legitimately petition the zoning board or whether, alternatively, the petition was a “mere sham.” See G.L. 1956 § 9-33-2.', 'Numerous issues (including, I submit, the issue of subjective baselessness vel non) are, by their very nature, inherently incapable of being decided by summary judgment.

See G.L. 1956 § 9-33-2. Our law does not usually grant attorneys’ fees to a party that has engaged in “objectively baseless” activity.

42,State : v. : Jose Luis Vargas. :,criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. This case came before the Supreme Court on appeal by the defendant, Jose Luis Vargas (Vargas or defendant), after a jury convicted him of multiple counts of child molestation. The defendant presents three arguments on appeal. He contends that: (1) the trial justice erred by allowing the state to use his prior criminal convictions for impeachment purposes, should the defendant have testified at trial; (2) the trial justice erred by permitting cross-examination of the complainant’s grandmother about the defendant’s sexual relationship with her then-minor daughter; and (3) the trial justice erred by failing to adequately inform the jury about the factual distinctions between counts 5 and 6 of the indictment, each of which charged the defendant with second-degree child molestation sexual assault. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'In June 2002, defendant was indicted by a Providence County grand jury for two counts of first-degree child molestation sexual assault, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-37-', '-1- 8.1 1 and four counts of second-degree child molestation sexual assault, in violation of § 11-37-8.3, 2 stemming from allegations made by his former girlfriend Eve’s daughter, Debra. 3 A trial was held in the Providence Superior Court in January 2004.', 'The state presented two witnesses. Debra, who was seventeen years old at the time of trial, testified that when she was six years old, defendant molested her on four separate occasions. The first incident occurred while Debra was watching television in her living room. Debra testified that defendant came into the room and “just sat next to me and started rubbing my chest on top of my clothes[,]” and told her “not to worry, that it’s nothing bad.” Approximately one month later, the second episode, consisting of two counts of first-degree molestation and one count of second-degree molestation occurred when she was alone in the apartment with defendant. The defendant took Debra into Eve’s bedroom; he sat her on the bed, felt her chest underneath her shirt, engaged in cunnilingus, forced the child to perform fellatio, and attempted to engage in anal sex. Debra testified that she began to cry and attempted to flee the room, but defendant 1', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-37-8.1 provides:', '“A person is guilty of first degree child molestation sexual', 'assault if he or she engages in sexual penetration with a', 'person fourteen (14) years of age or under.” 2', 'Section 11-37-8.3 provides:', '“A person is guilty of a second degree child molestation', 'sexual assault if he or she engages in sexual contact with', 'another person fourteen (14) years of age or under.” 3', 'Because the victim was a minor when the molestations occurred, we shall use a pseudonym to protect her privacy. We shall also use pseudonyms for all family members involved in this case.', '-2- stopped her. The defendant also told Debra that if she told anyone, he would injure her mother, Eve.', 'Nonetheless, Debra testified that after this second incident, she told her grandmother, Estelle, who in turn assured Debra that she would handle it. However, Estelle did nothing, and defendant molested Debra two additional times. Several weeks after the second episode, Vargas ordered Debra into the bathroom, and forced her to “grab his penis and move [her] hand up and down slowly[,]” which she did until defendant ejaculated. The final incident occurred a few weeks later when defendant followed Debra into the bathroom and made her perform the same act. She testified that defendant again threatened to hurt Eve if Debra told anyone.', 'Years later, when she was fifteen years old, Debra finally told Eve about the molestation. According to Debra, Estelle and Eve had gone shopping for Christmas presents, and Debra was baby-sitting her cousin Charlie (who was defendant’s son with Eve’s younger sister, Darcy). 4 Debra testified that while she was baby-sitting Charlie, she realized how much he resembled Vargas, and this caused her to recall the incidents of molestation. A few days later, Debra told Eve about the assaults.', 'Eve testified for the prosecution and stated that she and Vargas had dated for two years, beginning around 1992, and that she and Debra had lived with defendant for 4', 'According to the testimony in this case, it is alleged that Vargas had sexual relationships with essentially all parties involved. Debra testified that Vargas started dating Darcy when she was only fourteen years old. Eve later testified that Vargas had sexual relationships with her sisters, Ellen and Darcy. Ellen, who testified for the defense, denied having a relationship with Vargas, but described how Eve accused their mother, Estelle, also of having a sexual relationship with Vargas. Estelle denied this, but admitted that she knew Vargas was having a relationship with her daughter, Darcy, when she was a minor. Darcy testified that she had a sexual relationship with Vargas, but only after he ended his relationship with her sister, Eve.', '-3- approximately one year.', 'According to Eve, when she heard that Vargas also was involved with two of her sisters, Ellen and Darcy, the relationship ended. Eve described how Debra initially denied that anything was wrong, but after Eve repeatedly asked her whether anything happened, “[Debra] told me that he raped her. That Jose Vargas raped her.” Eve said that she arranged for counseling and contacted the Providence Police Department. Eve also testified that she no longer had a relationship with her mother, Estelle, because Estelle knew about the allegations and had done nothing to protect Debra.', 'On the other hand, Estelle testified on behalf of defendant. She stated that she had a difficult relationship with Eve and that it further deteriorated when these events came to light. According to Estelle, Eve was seeking revenge against Vargas, and she (Estelle) believed that the molestation allegations were false because, she declared, Debra would say whatever Eve told her to say. 5 Estelle denied that Debra had confided in her and declared that “of course” she would have intervened if she had been aware of these allegations. However, on cross-examination, Estelle admitted that she did not notify the police when Vargas was having a sexual relationship with her own daughter, who, at the time, was a young teenager.', 'Darcy also testified for the defense. She described how at fifteen years old, she gave birth to defendant’s son, Charlie. She testified that although she did not begin dating Vargas until after he and Eve separated, Eve was “very angry and jealous” about the relationship and wanted revenge. 5', 'Additionally, Estelle disclosed that Eve had made a prior false allegation when she accused another former boyfriend of raping Debra.', '-4-', 'After two hours of deliberations, the jury found defendant guilty of all six counts. He was sentenced to fifty years at the Adult Correctional Institutions, with thirty-five years to serve, fifteen years suspended, and fifteen years with probation on the first- degree molestation counts, and concurrent terms of ten years to serve on each of the second-degree molestation counts. 6 This timely appeal followed.', 'Standard of Review', '“It is well settled in this jurisdiction that the trial justice has broad discretion in deciding whether or not to admit evidence of prior convictions under Rule 609.” State v.

Additionally, this Court accords great “latitude to a trial justice’s rulings made during examination of witnesses at trial.” State v. Gomez, 848 A.2d 221, 237 (R.I. 2004). This Court will reverse evidentiary decisions made by a trial justice only if we determine that there was an abuse of discretion. Id.

Additionally, in State v. Mattatall, 603 A.2d 1098, 1117 (R.I. 1992), this Court outlined factors that the trial justice must balance when determining whether to allow the state to impeach criminal defendants with their prior convictions. We held that the trial justice must look at the nature of the crimes, the remoteness of the convictions, and the defendant’s disdain for the law as represented by the extent of his or her criminal record.

However, the passage of time is merely one factor that the trial justice must consider when making a Rule 609 decision. The fact that the convictions were more than ten years old is not determinative on the question of admissibility because of the nature and number of the crimes. Cf. State v. Gillespie, 960 A.2d 969, 981 (R.I. 2008) (affirming trial justice’s decision to exclude witness’s prior conviction of loitering for indecent purposes, as it was the only conviction in her record available to the jury, was not indicative of her credibility, and the record as a whole did not demonstrate her disdain for the law).', 'As we previously have declared, “conviction of the earliest crime, though committed many years before, as well as intervening convictions, should be admissible', '-8- for impeachment purposes unless the trial justice determines that the prejudicial effect outweighs the probative value of the past conviction.” Mattatall, 603 A.2d at 1117. In the case at bar, the trial justice determined that the probative value of defendant’s previous convictions for possession of a stolen motor vehicle and check forgery, if admitted, would outweigh any prejudicial effect of this evidence. As the trial justice noted, both convictions speak to defendant’s credibility; possession of a stolen motor vehicle and check forgery are crimes that involve dishonesty, such that the jury was entitled to consider these convictions when determining whether to believe defendant’s testimony.', 'II', 'Cross-Examination', 'The defendant’s second contention on appeal is that the trial justice erred when he allowed the state to cross-examine Estelle about her response, or lack thereof, to Vargas’s relationship with her then-fifteen-year-old daughter, Darcy.

Conversely, Estelle not only denied that Debra told her about the molestations, but also she insisted that if Debra had disclosed the assaults, “of course” she would have informed the authorities. The state then asked Estelle whether she had notified the police when she suspected that her own daughter, Darcy, was engaged in an illicit sexual relationship with defendant.', 'The defendant objected to this testimony, and at a bench conference he argued that the state was “attempting somehow to bring in the charges against [him] that * * * he had committed a third degree sexual assault,” which the state was barred from using to impeach Vargas if he testified at trial. The prosecutor argued that Estelle’s answer was relevant on the issue of her credibility because she boldly declared that “of course” she would have informed the authorities about Debra’s allegations if she had known about them, yet she did not report her suspicions about her own daughter. The trial justice overruled the objection, and the witness admitted that she did not inform the authorities that Vargas and Darcy were involved in a sexual relationship.', 'However, the jury was not informed that defendant had been convicted of third- degree sexual assault in connection with his relationship with Darcy.

The information about Darcy’s relationship with defendant previously had been disclosed to the jury when the state’s witnesses testified that Vargas was the father of Darcy’s child and that the relationship began when Darcy was approximately fourteen years old. Rule 401 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence provides that “relevant evidence” is evidence that has a “tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.” In this case, Estelle testified for the defense and adamantly declared that Debra did not tell her that defendant was abusing her; but she added that if she had known, she certainly would have reported Vargas. On cross- examination, however, she admitted that she failed to tell authorities about Vargas’s relationship with her own young daughter. When asked why she did not inform the police, Estelle replied, “I didn’t think I had to.

During his instructions, the trial justice reviewed the counts in the indictment, including the four occasions in their chronological sequence. With regard to counts 5 and 6, he explained that the incidents consisted of “hand-to-penile contact.”', 'At the end of the instructions, defendant objected to the charge and argued that the trial justice should instruct the jury in a manner that better differentiated between counts 5 and 6, because the indictment listed counts 5 and 6 only as “hand/penile contact,” and the second answer to defendant’s request for a bill of particulars specified that the counts pertained to the third and fourth episodes. The trial justice declined to modify his instruction because the proffered comments probably would confuse the jurors.', 'Although it would have been preferable for the trial justice to explain to the jury that it must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that there were two separate incidents of sexual abuse, as reflected in counts 5 and 6, we do not deem his failure to do so to be error.

43,"State : v. : Robert Erminelli. : Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty, and Robinson, JJ. OPINION Justice Flaherty, for the Court. This is an appeal by the defendant, Robert Erminelli, (Erminelli or defendant) from a judgment of conviction by a trial justice, sitting without a jury, for second-degree child molestation, sexual assault. Erminelli was sentenced to twenty-five years, with eight years to serve and seventeen years of probation. He also was ordered to have no contact with the victim, and he was required to register as a sex offender. The defendant filed a timely appeal to this Court. The parties appeared for oral argument on March 10, 2010, pursuant to an order of this Court that they show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided without further briefing or argument. After considering the record, the memoranda submitted by the parties, and the oral arguments advanced by each, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that the case should be decided at this time. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the Superior Court’s judgment of conviction. -1- I Facts and Travel On September 16, 2004, the state filed criminal information number P2/04-2850A alleging two counts against Erminelli. The first count maintained that Erminelli, on May 14, 2004, “did engage in sexual contact with [Megan], a person fourteen (14) years of age or under, in violation of [G.L. 1956] § 11-37-8.3 and § 11-37-8.4.1” In the second count, the state alleged that on that same day Erminelli “did assault [Megan] with intent to commit first degree sexual assault, in violation of [G.L. 1956] § 11-5-1 * * *.2” In November 2006, a Superior Court justice, sitting without a jury, convicted Erminelli of violating G.L. 1956 § 11-37-8.3.3 The trial justice stated that “[t]here is no question in my mind that the state has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that an assault took place, that there was * * * an inappropriate touching of [Megan] by the defendant.” Further, the trial justice was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that Megan was under fourteen years of age when this 1 General Laws 1956 § 11-37-8.3 provides: “Second degree child molestation sexual assault. – A person is guilty of a second degree child molestation sexual assault if he or she engages in sexual contact with another person fourteen (14) years of age or under.” Section 11-37-1(7) defines sexual contact as “the intentional touching of the victim’s or accused’s intimate parts, clothed or unclothed, if that intentional touching can be reasonably construed as intended by the accused to be for the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification, or assault.” Section 11-37-8.4 provides: “Penalty for second degree child molestation sexual assault. – Every person who shall commit second degree child molestation sexual assault shall be imprisoned for not less than six (6) years nor more than thirty (30) years.” 2 General Laws 1956 § 11-5-1 provides: “Assault with intent to commit specified felonies. – Every person who shall make an assault with intent to commit murder, robbery, sexual assault, burglary, or the abominable and detestable crime against nature, shall be imprisoned not exceeding twenty (20) years nor less than one year.” 3 The trial justice found Erminelli not guilty of violating § 11-5-1. In finding Erminelli not guilty of violating § 11-5-1, the trial justice stated that “I can’t say for sure in my mind beyond a reasonable doubt that he actually intended to penetrate her * * * [a]nd, because it is a specific intent crime, I’m not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that he intended the act of penetration.” -2- assault took place and that Erminelli inappropriately touched the young girl for the purposes of his own sexual gratification. The trial record reveals the following facts. In the afternoon on May 14, 2004, Jared H., Matthew V., Debbie L., and three other children were playing hide-and-seek in a wooded lot in their Providence neighborhood. Jared and Matthew saw an older man, two girls, and a boy enter the woods through an opening in a fence adjacent to a trash dumpster in a parking lot behind a Family Dollar store. Jared, who was thirteen years old when he testified at trial in November 2006, said that he saw the older man, who was bearded with white and black hair and who was wearing a blue shirt, and whom Jared identified at trial as Robert Erminelli, bring a brown-haired girl, who was wearing glasses, deeper into the woods. According to Jared, Erminelli told the boy and the other girl to wait by the fence opening. Jared then testified that he heard Erminelli tell the girl with brown hair and glasses to go over by a particular tree. Erminelli then grabbed her hair and pushed her in the direction of the tree. Once they got to the tree, Jared said that Erminelli told the girl to pull her pants down, which she did to her ankles, as Erminelli loosened his own pants and lowered them to his ankles. Jared said that he heard Erminelli order the little girl to get down on all fours, with her hands and feet touching the ground. After she complied, Jared testified that Erminelli got behind the girl and moved his body up and down against the girl’s backside for two or three minutes. Matthew V., who was fifteen at the time of trial, also testified about his observations that day. Matthew said that he was with Jared, playing hide-and-seek, when he saw an older man and a young girl enter the woods. He identified Erminelli as the older man he saw that day, and, like Jared, he described the young girl as having brown hair and wearing glasses. He also testified -3- that a girl and boy were with Erminelli and the brown-haired girl, but those two children stood by the opening in the fence and did not venture farther into the woods. Matthew testified that Erminelli had his pants down, as did the brown-haired girl, and that his “privates” were touching the girl’s buttocks; he described Erminelli as “humping” the girl. Matthew also said that Erminelli told the other two children, who were standing near the fence, “not to look.” Matthew and Jared’s accounts diverged slightly about what occurred next. Matthew said that after he observed the interaction between Erminelli and the girl, Erminelli noticed him and Jared, and then Erminelli ceased his activity and pulled up his pants. He then dragged the girl over to the fence where the other two children were still standing. At this point, Matthew said that he and Jared went over to the fence, and Erminelli told them that they could take anything they wanted from a neighbor’s yard. According to Matthew, it was only after this conversation that he and Jared left the area. Matthew said that he and Jared went to his mother’s house and then to Debbie’s house to seek assistance from Debbie’s father, Daniel Mulcahy. In contrast, Jared said that he never spoke with Erminelli. Jared also testified that when he left the woods to get help, Erminelli remained in the woods with the little girl. Jared also said that he, Debbie, and Matthew went directly to Daniel’s home and that they did not go to Matthew’s home first. Daniel, Debbie’s father, lived in the immediate area of the wooded lot. He testified that on May 14, 2004, his daughter Debbie and Jared came to his home. Debbie was nervous; her voice was fast and Daniel could tell by looking at her that something was wrong. As soon as he talked with Debbie, Daniel said he went outside into the woods. Daniel did not see anyone in the woods, but he did see an adult male and three children near the dumpster in the Family Dollar parking lot at the edge of the woods. At trial, Daniel identified that adult male as Erminelli. -4- Daniel said that he called out to Erminelli to “come here[,]” but that Erminelli ran away. Daniel then called the police. Erminelli was arrested shortly thereafter at Lane’s, a local drugstore. Megan,4 the girl with brown hair and glasses alleged to be the victim, also testified. She said that she was eleven years old in May 2004, when this incident was alleged to have occurred. She testified that Robert Erminelli was her mother’s boyfriend and the father of her four siblings, but that he was not her father. Megan testified that on May 14, 2004, she, defendant, her brother William, and her sister Laura5 went through the wooded area on their way to the home of a friend of defendant, whose name was Eddie. Megan said that they were only in the woods for a minute, and that they did not stop in the woods for any reason, including to go to the bathroom or to change their clothes. She said that her brother and sister did not stop either. Megan said that Eddie was not home, so the group went to the home of Joe, another friend of defendant. Joe was at home, and Megan said that she remembered that she and her siblings played with a caterpillar. Then Erminelli, Megan, Laura, and William went to Lane’s, where Erminelli purchased candy for the children. Later, all four of them went to the Family Dollar store, and then to defendant’s friend Tony’s house, and then back to Lane’s, where the police met them. Soon after the police arrested Erminelli, the police interviewed Megan. She denied to the police that anything ever occurred between herself and Erminelli in the woods. Megan said that the police brought her to the hospital for an examination, and during the examination she also denied that anything had happened. The results of the medical examination indicated that Megan had suffered “no outward signs of harm.” She was interviewed by a Department of 4 We have used a pseudonym to protect the identity of the victim. 5 William and Laura are also pseudonyms. -5- Children, Youth, and Families employee, but again she denied that any sexual assault took place on May 14. The defense called Laura, Erminelli’s daughter, as a witness. Laura was eight years old on May 14, 2004. She testified that on that day she went to Lane’s with Megan, William, and Erminelli, then to Family Dollar, and then to Tony’s. Laura testified that neither she nor Megan went into the woods with Erminelli between the time they went to the Family Dollar store and the time they arrived at Tony’s house. William, who was only six years old on May 14, 2004, also testified at trial. William said that he, Megan, and Laura attended school on May 14. After school, he, Erminelli, Megan, and Laura left their home and cut through the woods to get to Eddie’s house. When Eddie wasn’t home they all went to Lane’s for chips and soda. William also testified that they took a break while walking through the woods to Eddie’s. He said that none of them went to the bathroom and that William and Megan sat next to each other while Laura and Erminelli rested a few feet away. William testified that they then continued to Lane’s. They also went to Joe’s, and William also said that the three children played with a caterpillar. William said that they subsequently went to the Family Dollar store, then to Tony’s house and then back to Lane’s. The defense also called Anthony Ciaramello as a witness. Ciaramello said he resided in the neighborhood and that his backyard abutted the wooded lot where the incident allegedly took place. He described the area behind his house as more of a field than woods, because there was just “one tree, grass and some brush.” Ciaramello said that he could see the wooded area “plain as day” from his backyard, that he was outside in his backyard throughout the day on May 14, 2004, and that he never saw Erminelli and the children in the woods, although he saw some other neighborhood kids playing in the woods. He testified that Erminelli, who performed odd jobs for -6- him and had worked for him that morning, stopped by his house with the children in tow in the afternoon. They talked briefly, and then Erminelli and the children left in the direction of Lane’s. Erminelli did not testify. II Issue on Appeal The sole issue on appeal is whether the trial justice erred when he denied defendant’s motion for a new trial under Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. In his bench decision, the trial justice made a credibility determination that the two boys, Matthew and Jared, and their accounts of the events of May 14, 2004, were “believable” and that they “were being absolutely truthful with the Court as to what they saw.” In making this determination, the trial justice stated that “it’s so important to observe and eyeball and examine the demeanor of witnesses” and that he did so throughout the trial testimony. On the other hand, the trial justice characterized the testimony of the alleged victim and her two siblings as “programmed,” remarking that “[i]t lacked the credibility or the feeling that one would expect from somebody who was testifying truthfully.” The defendant argues that he is entitled to a new trial because “[t]he trial justice was clearly wrong in finding [defendant] guilty of second degree sexual assault because the evidence was insufficient to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that a sexual touching had occurred.” The defendant urges to this Court that “the alleged account of events as portrayed by the state’s witnesses were neither credible nor reliable, and the trial justice’s findings of fact and conclusions of law were flawed.” The defendant argues that the state failed to prove two of the three elements of second-degree child molestation sexual assault; namely that there was no -7- “actual physical sexual contact” and that there was no proof that “there was sexual contact for the purpose of gratification or arousal.” III Standard of Review “When this Court reviews the denial of a Rule 33 motion [for a new trial] in the context of a jury-waived trial, we apply the same deferential standard of review as would be applied to the Superior Court justice’s factual findings on the merits.” State v. Adewumi, 966 A.2d 1217, 1222 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. DiPetrillo, 922 A.2d 124, 131 (R.I. 2007)). “When reviewing determinations of credibility and findings of fact by a trial justice sitting without a jury, this Court will not disturb the trial justice’s findings unless they are clearly wrong or the trial justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence on a controlling issue.” Id. (quoting State v. LaCroix, 911 A.2d 674, 679 (R.I. 2006)). It is well-established that we “accord ‘a great deal of respect to the factual determinations and credibility assessments made by the judicial officer who has actually observed the human drama that is part and parcel of every trial and who has had an opportunity to appraise witness demeanor and to take into account other realities that cannot be grasped from a reading of a cold record.’” State v. Gonzalez, 986 A.2d 235, 242 (R.I. 2010) (quoting In the Matter of the Dissolution of Anderson, Zangari & Bossian, 888 A.2d 973, 975 (R.I. 2006)). IV Analysis In affording the trial justice’s findings of fact and credibility determinations due deference, as we must, we cannot say that the trial justice’s findings were “clearly wrong or the trial justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence on a controlling issue.” Adewumi, -8- 966 A.2d at 1222 (quoting LaCroix, 911 A.2d at 679). In this proceeding, the trial justice was faced with the task of reconciling conflicting accounts of what transpired in a wooded area on May 14, 2004. Jared and Matthew both testified that they watched as Erminelli had his pants down and then rubbed his body against Megan. This is diametrically opposed to the testimony of Megan, Laura, and William, all of whom testified that no such thing occurred. The trial justice recognized the discrepancy, and he made a credibility determination that Jared and Matthew’s accounts were truthful and that Megan, Laura, and William were not testifying accurately. The trial justice explained in detail the necessity for him to determine the witnesses’ credibility and the steps he undertook to evaluate it. After summarizing the testimony in the case, the trial justice stated: “Some thoughts. Number one, the Court had the opportunity to observe the witnesses as they testified. As I always tell the jurors, one of the things that the fact-finder has to do is to watch the witnesses on both direct and cross-examination, to consider their demeanor, to see if there are consistencies or inconsistencies with what they said while they testified and what they may have said at an earlier time, and I had that opportunity.” The trial justice then proceeded to appraise the credibility of Jared and Matthew. He found their testimony to be “accurate” and that with the exception of some minor inconsistencies each boy’s testimony corroborated the others. The trial justice then concluded by stating that he considered both boys to be “believable witnesses.” As to Megan, Laura, and William, the trial justice found at least Megan to be “programmed” and that “[h]er responses were just automatic.” Further, the trial justice stated with regard to the siblings’ testimony “you could almost sense an automatic nature to it. It -9- lacked the credibility or the feeling that one would expect from somebody who was testifying truthfully.” Consequently, the trial justice afforded little weight to their testimony. To the extent that the trial justice considered the siblings’ testimony, he noted the discrepancies between their testimony about whether Erminelli and the siblings went into the woods. William and Megan both testified that they went into the woods, but Laura denied ever going into the woods. Finally, the trial justice determined that “as these siblings testified, they were not being candid with the Court. They may well have believed, * * * as to what they were testifying to, but I’m convinced that they have, essentially, convinced themselves that nothing happened that day * * *.” As a result of our review of the record, we hold that the trial justice’s findings of fact and credibility determinations will not be disturbed on appeal. We similarly detect no error in the trial justice’s finding that Erminelli was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of second-degree child molestation sexual assault. The crime of second-degree child molestation sexual assault, § 11- 37-8.3, requires proof that the defendant engaged in sexual contact, as that term is defined in § 11-37-1(7), with the victim and that the victim was fourteen years of age or younger. Here, Megan was born on December 30, 1992, which clearly made her fourteen years of age or younger on May 14, 2004. Next, based upon the credible testimony of Jared and Matthew, the trial justice found that Erminelli intentionally touched Megan’s naked buttocks with his penis. Such contact “can be reasonably construed as intended by [Erminelli] to be for the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification, or assault.” Section 11-37-1(7). Finally, there was no newly discovered evidence offered to the trial justice for his consideration in ruling on the defendant’s motion for a new trial. We therefore perceive no error in the trial justice’s denial of the defendant’s motion for a new trial. - 10 - V Conclusion For the reasons discussed in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

The first count maintained that Erminelli, on May 14, 2004, “did engage in sexual contact with [Megan], a person fourteen (14) years of age or under, in violation of [G.L. 1956] § 11-37-8.3 and § 11-37-8.4.1” In the second count, the state alleged that on that same day Erminelli “did assault [Megan] with intent to commit first degree sexual assault, in violation of [G.L. 1956] § 11-5-1 * * *.2”', 'In November 2006, a Superior Court justice, sitting without a jury, convicted Erminelli of violating G.L. 1956 § 11-37-8.3.3 The trial justice stated that “[t]here is no question in my mind that the state has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that an assault took place, that there was * * * an inappropriate touching of [Megan] by the defendant.”', 'Further, the trial justice was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that Megan was under fourteen years of age when this 1', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-37-8.3 provides: “Second degree child molestation sexual assault. – A person is guilty of a second degree child molestation sexual assault if he or she engages in sexual contact with another person fourteen (14) years of age or under.” Section 11-37-1(7) defines sexual contact as “the intentional touching of the victim’s or accused’s intimate parts, clothed or unclothed, if that intentional touching can be reasonably construed as intended by the accused to be for the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification, or assault.”', 'Section 11-37-8.4 provides: “Penalty for second degree child molestation sexual assault. – Every person who shall commit second degree child molestation sexual assault shall be imprisoned for not less than six (6) years nor more than thirty (30) years.” 2', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-5-1 provides: “Assault with intent to commit specified felonies. – Every person who shall make an assault with intent to commit murder, robbery, sexual assault, burglary, or the abominable and detestable crime against nature, shall be imprisoned not exceeding twenty (20) years nor less than one year.” 3', 'The trial justice found Erminelli not guilty of violating § 11-5-1. In finding Erminelli not guilty of violating § 11-5-1, the trial justice stated that “I can’t say for sure in my mind beyond a reasonable doubt that he actually intended to penetrate her * * * [a]nd, because it is a specific intent crime, I’m not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that he intended the act of penetration.”', '-2- assault took place and that Erminelli inappropriately touched the young girl for the purposes of his own sexual gratification.', 'The trial record reveals the following facts. In the afternoon on May 14, 2004, Jared H., Matthew V., Debbie L., and three other children were playing hide-and-seek in a wooded lot in their Providence neighborhood. Jared and Matthew saw an older man, two girls, and a boy enter the woods through an opening in a fence adjacent to a trash dumpster in a parking lot behind a Family Dollar store.', 'Jared, who was thirteen years old when he testified at trial in November 2006, said that he saw the older man, who was bearded with white and black hair and who was wearing a blue shirt, and whom Jared identified at trial as Robert Erminelli, bring a brown-haired girl, who was wearing glasses, deeper into the woods. According to Jared, Erminelli told the boy and the other girl to wait by the fence opening. Jared then testified that he heard Erminelli tell the girl with brown hair and glasses to go over by a particular tree. Erminelli then grabbed her hair and pushed her in the direction of the tree. Once they got to the tree, Jared said that Erminelli told the girl to pull her pants down, which she did to her ankles, as Erminelli loosened his own pants and lowered them to his ankles. Jared said that he heard Erminelli order the little girl to get down on all fours, with her hands and feet touching the ground. After she complied, Jared testified that Erminelli got behind the girl and moved his body up and down against the girl’s backside for two or three minutes.', 'Matthew V., who was fifteen at the time of trial, also testified about his observations that day. Matthew said that he was with Jared, playing hide-and-seek, when he saw an older man and a young girl enter the woods. He identified Erminelli as the older man he saw that day, and, like Jared, he described the young girl as having brown hair and wearing glasses. He also testified', '-3- that a girl and boy were with Erminelli and the brown-haired girl, but those two children stood by the opening in the fence and did not venture farther into the woods. Matthew testified that Erminelli had his pants down, as did the brown-haired girl, and that his “privates” were touching the girl’s buttocks; he described Erminelli as “humping” the girl.', 'Matthew also said that Erminelli told the other two children, who were standing near the fence, “not to look.”', 'Matthew and Jared’s accounts diverged slightly about what occurred next. Matthew said that after he observed the interaction between Erminelli and the girl, Erminelli noticed him and Jared, and then Erminelli ceased his activity and pulled up his pants. He then dragged the girl over to the fence where the other two children were still standing. At this point, Matthew said that he and Jared went over to the fence, and Erminelli told them that they could take anything they wanted from a neighbor’s yard. According to Matthew, it was only after this conversation that he and Jared left the area. Matthew said that he and Jared went to his mother’s house and then to Debbie’s house to seek assistance from Debbie’s father, Daniel Mulcahy. In contrast, Jared said that he never spoke with Erminelli. Jared also testified that when he left the woods to get help, Erminelli remained in the woods with the little girl. Jared also said that he, Debbie, and Matthew went directly to Daniel’s home and that they did not go to Matthew’s home first.', 'Daniel, Debbie’s father, lived in the immediate area of the wooded lot. He testified that on May 14, 2004, his daughter Debbie and Jared came to his home. Debbie was nervous; her voice was fast and Daniel could tell by looking at her that something was wrong. As soon as he talked with Debbie, Daniel said he went outside into the woods. Daniel did not see anyone in the woods, but he did see an adult male and three children near the dumpster in the Family Dollar parking lot at the edge of the woods. At trial, Daniel identified that adult male as Erminelli.', '-4- Daniel said that he called out to Erminelli to “come here[,]” but that Erminelli ran away. Daniel then called the police. Erminelli was arrested shortly thereafter at Lane’s, a local drugstore.', 'Megan,4 the girl with brown hair and glasses alleged to be the victim, also testified. She said that she was eleven years old in May 2004, when this incident was alleged to have occurred. She testified that Robert Erminelli was her mother’s boyfriend and the father of her four siblings, but that he was not her father. Megan testified that on May 14, 2004, she, defendant, her brother William, and her sister Laura5 went through the wooded area on their way to the home of a friend of defendant, whose name was Eddie.', 'Megan said that they were only in the woods for a minute, and that they did not stop in the woods for any reason, including to go to the bathroom or to change their clothes. She said that her brother and sister did not stop either. Megan said that Eddie was not home, so the group went to the home of Joe, another friend of defendant. Joe was at home, and Megan said that she remembered that she and her siblings played with a caterpillar. Then Erminelli, Megan, Laura, and William went to Lane’s, where Erminelli purchased candy for the children. Later, all four of them went to the Family Dollar store, and then to defendant’s friend Tony’s house, and then back to Lane’s, where the police met them.', 'Soon after the police arrested Erminelli, the police interviewed Megan.', 'She denied to the police that anything ever occurred between herself and Erminelli in the woods. Megan said that the police brought her to the hospital for an examination, and during the examination she also denied that anything had happened. The results of the medical examination indicated that Megan had suffered “no outward signs of harm.” She was interviewed by a Department of 4', 'We have used a pseudonym to protect the identity of the victim. 5', 'William and Laura are also pseudonyms.', '-5- Children, Youth, and Families employee, but again she denied that any sexual assault took place on May 14.', 'The defense called Laura, Erminelli’s daughter, as a witness. Laura was eight years old on May 14, 2004. She testified that on that day she went to Lane’s with Megan, William, and Erminelli, then to Family Dollar, and then to Tony’s. Laura testified that neither she nor Megan went into the woods with Erminelli between the time they went to the Family Dollar store and the time they arrived at Tony’s house.', 'William, who was only six years old on May 14, 2004, also testified at trial. William said that he, Megan, and Laura attended school on May 14. After school, he, Erminelli, Megan, and Laura left their home and cut through the woods to get to Eddie’s house. When Eddie wasn’t home they all went to Lane’s for chips and soda. William also testified that they took a break while walking through the woods to Eddie’s. He said that none of them went to the bathroom and that William and Megan sat next to each other while Laura and Erminelli rested a few feet away. William testified that they then continued to Lane’s. They also went to Joe’s, and William also said that the three children played with a caterpillar. William said that they subsequently went to the Family Dollar store, then to Tony’s house and then back to Lane’s.', 'The defense also called Anthony Ciaramello as a witness. Ciaramello said he resided in the neighborhood and that his backyard abutted the wooded lot where the incident allegedly took place. He described the area behind his house as more of a field than woods, because there was just “one tree, grass and some brush.” Ciaramello said that he could see the wooded area “plain as day” from his backyard, that he was outside in his backyard throughout the day on May 14, 2004, and that he never saw Erminelli and the children in the woods, although he saw some other neighborhood kids playing in the woods. He testified that Erminelli, who performed odd jobs for', '-6- him and had worked for him that morning, stopped by his house with the children in tow in the afternoon. They talked briefly, and then Erminelli and the children left in the direction of Lane’s. Erminelli did not testify.', 'II', 'Issue on Appeal', 'The sole issue on appeal is whether the trial justice erred when he denied defendant’s motion for a new trial under Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.', 'In his bench decision, the trial justice made a credibility determination that the two boys, Matthew and Jared, and their accounts of the events of May 14, 2004, were “believable” and that they “were being absolutely truthful with the Court as to what they saw.” In making this determination, the trial justice stated that “it’s so important to observe and eyeball and examine the demeanor of witnesses” and that he did so throughout the trial testimony. On the other hand, the trial justice characterized the testimony of the alleged victim and her two siblings as “programmed,” remarking that “[i]t lacked the credibility or the feeling that one would expect from somebody who was testifying truthfully.”', 'The defendant argues that he is entitled to a new trial because “[t]he trial justice was clearly wrong in finding [defendant] guilty of second degree sexual assault because the evidence was insufficient to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that a sexual touching had occurred.” The defendant urges to this Court that “the alleged account of events as portrayed by the state’s witnesses were neither credible nor reliable, and the trial justice’s findings of fact and conclusions of law were flawed.” The defendant argues that the state failed to prove two of the three elements of second-degree child molestation sexual assault; namely that there was no', '-7- “actual physical sexual contact” and that there was no proof that “there was sexual contact for the purpose of gratification or arousal.”', 'III', 'Standard of Review', '“When this Court reviews the denial of a Rule 33 motion [for a new trial] in the context of a jury-waived trial, we apply the same deferential standard of review as would be applied to the Superior Court justice’s factual findings on the merits.” State v. Adewumi, 966 A.2d 1217, 1222 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. DiPetrillo, 922 A.2d 124, 131 (R.I. 2007)). “When reviewing determinations of credibility and findings of fact by a trial justice sitting without a jury, this Court will not disturb the trial justice’s findings unless they are clearly wrong or the trial justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence on a controlling issue.” Id. (quoting State v. LaCroix, 911 A.2d 674, 679 (R.I. 2006)). It is well-established that we “accord ‘a great deal of respect to the factual determinations and credibility assessments made by the judicial officer who has actually observed the human drama that is part and parcel of every trial and who has had an opportunity to appraise witness demeanor and to take into account other realities that cannot be grasped from a reading of a cold record.’” State v. Gonzalez, 986 A.2d 235, 242 (R.I. 2010) (quoting In the Matter of the Dissolution of Anderson, Zangari & Bossian, 888 A.2d 973, 975 (R.I. 2006)).', 'IV', 'Analysis', 'In affording the trial justice’s findings of fact and credibility determinations due deference, as we must, we cannot say that the trial justice’s findings were “clearly wrong or the trial justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence on a controlling issue.” Adewumi,', '-8- 966 A.2d at 1222 (quoting LaCroix, 911 A.2d at 679). In this proceeding, the trial justice was faced with the task of reconciling conflicting accounts of what transpired in a wooded area on May 14, 2004. Jared and Matthew both testified that they watched as Erminelli had his pants down and then rubbed his body against Megan. This is diametrically opposed to the testimony of Megan, Laura, and William, all of whom testified that no such thing occurred. The trial justice recognized the discrepancy, and he made a credibility determination that Jared and Matthew’s accounts were truthful and that Megan, Laura, and William were not testifying accurately.', 'The trial justice explained in detail the necessity for him to determine the witnesses’ credibility and the steps he undertook to evaluate it. After summarizing the testimony in the case, the trial justice stated:', '“Some thoughts.', 'Number one, the Court had the', 'opportunity to observe the witnesses as they testified. As I always', 'tell the jurors, one of the things that the fact-finder has to do is to', 'watch the witnesses on both direct and cross-examination, to', 'consider their demeanor, to see if there are consistencies or', 'inconsistencies with what they said while they testified and what', 'they may have said at an earlier time, and I had that opportunity.” The trial justice then proceeded to appraise the credibility of Jared and Matthew. He found their testimony to be “accurate” and that with the exception of some minor inconsistencies each boy’s testimony corroborated the others. The trial justice then concluded by stating that he considered both boys to be “believable witnesses.”', 'As to Megan, Laura, and William, the trial justice found at least Megan to be “programmed” and that “[h]er responses were just automatic.” Further, the trial justice stated with regard to the siblings’ testimony “you could almost sense an automatic nature to it. It', '-9- lacked the credibility or the feeling that one would expect from somebody who was testifying truthfully.” Consequently, the trial justice afforded little weight to their testimony.', 'To the extent that the trial justice considered the siblings’ testimony, he noted the discrepancies between their testimony about whether Erminelli and the siblings went into the woods. William and Megan both testified that they went into the woods, but Laura denied ever going into the woods. Finally, the trial justice determined that “as these siblings testified, they were not being candid with the Court. They may well have believed, * * * as to what they were testifying to, but I’m convinced that they have, essentially, convinced themselves that nothing happened that day * * *.”', 'As a result of our review of the record, we hold that the trial justice’s findings of fact and credibility determinations will not be disturbed on appeal. We similarly detect no error in the trial justice’s finding that Erminelli was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of second-degree child molestation sexual assault. The crime of second-degree child molestation sexual assault, § 11- 37-8.3, requires proof that the defendant engaged in sexual contact, as that term is defined in § 11-37-1(7), with the victim and that the victim was fourteen years of age or younger. Here, Megan was born on December 30, 1992, which clearly made her fourteen years of age or younger on May 14, 2004. Next, based upon the credible testimony of Jared and Matthew, the trial justice found that Erminelli intentionally touched Megan’s naked buttocks with his penis. Such contact “can be reasonably construed as intended by [Erminelli] to be for the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification, or assault.” Section 11-37-1(7). Finally, there was no newly discovered evidence offered to the trial justice for his consideration in ruling on the defendant’s motion for a new trial. We therefore perceive no error in the trial justice’s denial of the defendant’s motion for a new trial.', '- 10 -', 'V', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons discussed in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty, Robinson, JJ., and Williams, C.J. (ret.). OPINION Justice Goldberg, for the Court. This case comes before us on appeal by the plaintiffs, Simcha Berman and Sarah Berman from summary judgment entered in the Superior Court in favor of the defendants, The Preservation Society of Newport (Society) and the City of Newport (Newport or city). For the reasons that follow, we affirm the Superior Court’s grant of summary judgment for the Society but we vacate the grant of summary judgment for the city. Facts and Travel Once again, this Court finds itself faced with a catastrophic injury that occurred on the Cliff Walk, a major Newport tourist attraction. 1 The Cliff Walk runs along 18,000 1 See Cain v. Johnson, 755 A.2d 156, 158 (R.I. 2000) (recognizing that the decedent died after falling from the Cliff Walk when the ground beneath his feet gave way). Ironically, this Court issued the Cain opinion a mere twenty-three days before the incident at bar occurred. -1- feet of Newport’s shoreline, high above the rocky Atlantic coast; its majestic cliffs and scenic viewpoints beckon hundreds of thousands of visitors every year. Although the vast majority of these visits result in enjoyable experiences, the situation at bar decidedly did not. The record establishes that the Cliff Walk is a public easement over private land; a number of individuals and entities, including the Society and Salve Regina University (Salve Regina), own the land over which it runs. It is undisputed, however, that the city has assumed authority and exercises control over the Cliff Walk, both by regulation and maintenance. The city has enacted ordinances restricting access to the Cliff Walk and limiting enjoyment thereon to foot traffic. 2 The city also established the Cliff Walk Commission, an organization responsible for raising money and contracting for the repair and improvement on this important coastal attraction. 3 Additionally, the record is replete with evidence of collective efforts by the city and the State of Rhode Island (state) to secure funding for Cliff Walk-related construction and repair. 2 Newport City Ordinance § 12.32.010(C) restricts public access, requiring that the Cliff Walk “shall be closed for public use between nine p.m. and six a.m. * * * and no person shall go upon such public areas during the hours of closing * * * except that the Cliff Walk shall remain open for the purpose of access to the water for fishing.” Newport City Ordinance § 12.32.010(F) prohibits the use of “[b]icycles, motorcycles, skateboards, roller blades, and roller skates of all kinds * * *.” 3 The Cliff Walk Commission (commission) is charged with raising and expending funds for Cliff Walk repairs, improvements, and maintenance. See Newport City Ordinance § 2.76.010 (entitled “Creation–Function”). The commission also enacts rules and regulations concerning the Cliff Walk and has “full authority and power to * * * enter into and execute such contracts in relation to the repair, renovation, improvement and maintenance of the Cliff Walk * * *.” Newport City Ordinance § 2.76.040 (entitled “Rules and regulations–Limitation on expenditures”). -2- On August 17, 2000, newly married twenty-three-year-old Simcha (Simcha) Berman 4 and his wife, Sarah, stopped in Newport as part of a belated honeymoon. 5 The couple, from Brooklyn, New York, decided to take a late-afternoon tour of The Breakers, one of the historic mansions in Newport owned and operated by the Society. They paid admission to tour the mansion and the lavishly landscaped grounds. During the tour, the Society’s guide pointed out the Cliff Walk, which runs along The Breakers’ property, separated by a fence; plaintiffs allege that the guide suggested that, after the tour, the group experience the Cliff Walk. After the tour, plaintiffs first spent some time enjoying the grounds of The Breakers, and then they decided to take an excursion to the Cliff Walk. They exited the fenced-in area of The Breakers through a gate on the north side of the property onto Shepard Avenue, a public street. The plaintiffs followed Shepard Avenue to the portion of the Cliff Walk that runs along the Society’s property—an area known as Ochre Point. The plaintiffs allege that there were no signs warning of the Cliff Walk’s potential hazards at either The Breakers or the Shepard Avenue entrance. According to plaintiffs, after they reached the paved portion of the Cliff Walk, the couple noticed a “beaten path,” which they assumed would guide them toward the water. Simcha took the lead and proceeded down the path with Sarah close behind. Suddenly, the ground beneath Simcha’s feet gave way and he plummeted approximately twenty- nine feet to the rocks below. His injuries were catastrophic; he suffered a severe spinal cord injury that rendered him a quadriplegic. 4 For clarity’s sake, we will hereinafter refer to Simcha and Sarah by their first names. 5 The plaintiffs subsequently have divorced. -3- In 2003, plaintiffs filed this action in the Superior Court, alleging that the Society, Newport, and the state negligently caused Simcha’s injuries by failing to properly inspect, maintain, and repair the Cliff Walk and, further, that they knew of its defects and failed to guard or warn against them. In 2005, defendants moved for summary judgment on the ground that Rhode Island’s Recreational Use Statute (RUS) immunized them from liability. The original hearing justice denied summary judgment, partly because of perceived ambiguities surrounding the applicability of the RUS to the facts of this case. Subsequently, in 2007, plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment seeking to preclude defendants from raising the RUS as a defense. The defendants filed a cross- motion for summary judgment based on the RUS, relying on this Court’s recent decisions interpreting its provisions. After a hearing, a second hearing justice denied plaintiffs’ motion and the state’s motion, but granted summary judgment in favor of both the Society and the city. Judgment in favor of the Society and the city subsequently was entered in accordance with Rule 54(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. This appeal followed. Further facts will be supplied as necessary. Standard of Review It is well established that this Court employs a de novo standard to review a hearing justice’s decision to grant summary judgment. National Refrigeration, Inc. v. Standen Contracting Co., 942 A.2d 968, 971 (R.I. 2008). “We examine the evidence in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and we will affirm the judgment if we conclude that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Ouch v. Khea, 963 A.2d 630, 632 (R.I. 2009) (citing Benaski v. Weinberg, 899 A.2d 499, 502 (R.I. 2006)). -4- Additionally, we review questions of statutory interpretation on a de novo basis. Bucki v. Hawkins, 914 A.2d 491, 495 (R.I. 2007). “It is well settled that when the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, this Court must interpret the statute literally and must give the words of the statute their plain and ordinary meanings.” Accent Store Design, Inc. v. Marathon House, Inc., 674 A.2d 1223, 1226 (R.I. 1996). Our obligation is to ascertain the legislative intent behind the enactment and give effect to that intent. Kaya v. Partington, 681 A.2d 256, 260 (R.I. 1996). We are also mindful, however, that “under no circumstances will this Court ‘construe a statute to reach an absurd result.’” Smiler v. Napolitano, 911 A.2d 1035, 1041 (R.I. 2006) (quoting State v. Menard, 888 A.2d 57, 60 (R.I. 2005)). Furthermore, this Court can affirm the Superior Court’s judgment on grounds other than those relied upon by the trial justice. State v. Lynch, 770 A.2d 840, 847 (R.I. 2001). Finally, it is well settled that in a negligence action, “[w]hether a duty exists in a particular situation is a question of law to be decided by the court.” Ferreira v. Strack, 636 A.2d 682, 685 (R.I. 1994). Whether the duty has been breached, however, is a question for the fact-finder. Seide v. State, 875 A.2d 1259, 1268 (R.I. 2005). Analysis I Recreational Use Statute In 1978, the General Assembly enacted the RUS, G.L. 1956 chapter 6 of title 32 (P.L. 1978, ch. 375, §1), to encourage private landowners to make their land free and -5- open to the public for recreational purposes. See § 32-6-1. 6 To accomplish this salutary purpose, the General Assembly declared in pertinent part as follows: “[A]n owner of land who either directly or indirectly invites or permits without charge any person to use that property for recreational purposes does not thereby: “(1) Extend any assurance that the premises are safe for any purpose; “(2) Confer upon that person the legal status of an invitee or licensee to whom a duty of care is owed; nor “(3) Assume responsibility for or incur liability for any injury to any person or property caused by an act of omission of that person.” Section 32-6-3. The legislative intent was “to treat those who use private property for recreational purposes as though they were trespassers.” Tantimonico v. Allendale Mutual Insurance Co., 637 A.2d 1056, 1060 (R.I. 1994). Thus, landowners who open their land for recreational activities have no duty to the public other than to refrain from willful or wanton conduct. Id. at 1061. In 1996, the Legislature expanded the term “owners” to include the state and its municipalities. 7 Section 32-6-2(3), as amended by P.L. 1996, ch. 234, §1. However, and 6 General Laws 1956 § 32-6-1 provides, “[t]he purpose of this chapter is to encourage owners of land to make land and water areas available to the public for recreational purposes by limiting their liability to persons entering thereon for those purposes.” 7 As we undertake this analysis, we are mindful that Rhode Island’s governmental entities enjoy a judicially created immunity known as the public duty doctrine. See Morales v. Town of Johnston, 895 A.2d 721, 727-28 (R.I. 2006) (recognizing that some governmental operations should be insulated from tort claims). These operations include, but are not limited to, inspecting buildings, undertaking highway construction work, and maintaining traffic signals. See, e.g., Torres v. Damicis, 853 A.2d 1233, 1239 (R.I. 2004); DeFusco v. Todesca Forte, Inc., 683 A.2d 363, 365 (R.I. 1996); Bierman v. Shookster, 590 A.2d 402, 403 (R.I. 1991). Over the years, this Court has carved out exceptions to the doctrine, which if applicable, deprive the governmental entity of immunity. See, e.g., Adams v. Rhode Island Department of Corrections, 973 A.2d 542, -6- determinatively, we conclude that regarding Newport’s duty in this case, the RUS has its limitations. Relevant to our analysis here, § 32-6-5 provides, in relevant part, as follows: “(a) Nothing in this chapter limits in any way any liability which, but for this chapter, otherwise exists: “(1) For the willful or malicious failure to guard or warn against a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity after discovering the user’s peril; or “(2) For any injury suffered in any case where the owner of land charges the person or persons who enter or go on the land for the recreational use thereof * * *.” (Emphases added.) Thus, the Legislature declared that all people who use this state’s public recreational resources are classified as trespassers to whom no duty of care is owed, save to refrain from willful or malicious conduct as defined in the RUS. 8 It is that limitation for willful or malicious conduct that controls the result in this case for Newport. 546 (R.I. 2009) (recognizing exception when the governmental entity acts negligently while performing a proprietary function including acting “as a landowner”); Morales, 895 A.2d at 730 (recognizing exception when the government owes a special duty to an individual plaintiff); Verity v. Danti, 585 A.2d 65, 67 (R.I. 1991) (recognizing exception when the governmental entity acts in an egregious manner). We have declared that a governmental entity engaged in a proprietary activity has a duty to maintain its parks and other lands in a reasonably safe condition for people who are invited onto the land. Brindamour v. City of Warwick, 697 A.2d 1075, 1077 (R.I. 1997). However, we also have recognized that this duty does not extend to trespassers – if a person is on the land after hours or in violation of an ordinance or regulation, that person is classified as a trespasser to whom the governmental entity owes no duty, save to refrain from wanton or willful conduct pertaining to the maintenance of the land. Id. By its enactment of the RUS, the Legislature has abrogated this latter exception to the judicially created public duty doctrine, and, under the RUS as it stands today, everyone who uses public recreational facilities is classified as a trespasser. Although not necessary to this decision, we are of the opinion that the public duty doctrine and its exceptions are not relevant to the case at bar. 8 This Court recently had occasion to comment upon the unfortunately harsh consequences that flow from classifying those who use public recreational facilities as trespassers. See Lacey v. Reitsma, 899 A.2d 455, 458 (R.I. 2006) (stating that it is the -7- II The Society’s Liability The RUS and the Society The trial justice granted summary judgment in favor of the Society, based on her conclusion that the Society was the fee owner of the property where the incident occurred, but that it did not charge an admission for entrance onto the Cliff Walk. She further found that there was no evidence in the record “that the Society discovered [p]laintiffs in a position of peril,” and therefore the Society was shielded from liability by the RUS. Before this Court, plaintiffs proffer several reasons to support their argument that the RUS does not apply to the facts in this case. As we shall explain in this opinion, it is our conclusion that with or without the protections afforded to landowners by the RUS, the Society does not owe a duty of care to those who enter upon the Cliff Walk. Accordingly, we affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of the Society, but we do so on grounds other than those relied upon by the hearing justice. See Lynch, 770 A.2d at 847 (stating that the Supreme Court may affirm a judgment of the Superior Court on grounds other than those relied upon by the trial court to justify its ruling). However, we shall briefly address the issues that plaintiffs raise to support their contentions that the Society should be answerable in tort in this case. The plaintiffs argue that because the Society charged an admission to The Breakers—which they contend includes a fee to experience the Cliff Walk—the RUS does not apply. The plaintiffs attempt to distinguish the case at bar from the situation in Hanley v. State, in which this view of this Court “that people who use public recreational facilities should not be classified as trespassers”). -8- Court held that the state, as landowner, could invoke the protections of the RUS because the fee it charged the injured plaintiff to park her car did not constitute a fee for admission. See Hanley v. State, 837 A.2d 707, 714 (R.I. 2003) (recognizing that the state charged patrons for parking, not admission). The difficulty with this argument becomes clear when one considers the statute’s plain language: a “charge” is defined as “the admission price or fee asked in return for invitation or permission to enter or go upon the land[.]” Section 32-6-2(1) (emphasis added). It is undisputed that plaintiffs paid an admission fee to visit The Breakers mansion and grounds; it is clear that the fee did not include “admission” to the Cliff Walk. If Simcha’s injury occurred while he was inside the mansion or in the gated backyard, both areas that required payment of a fee in exchange for permission to enter, then the RUS would be of no assistance to the Society. Simcha’s injury, however, occurred outside the area for which he paid an admission fee; it occurred on the public easement. If plaintiffs chose not to visit The Breakers, they nonetheless could have entered the Cliff Walk, free of charge, at Shepard Avenue, or they could have gained access from a number of other points, including the area known as Forty Steps. See Cain v. Johnson, 755 A.2d 156, 159 (R.I. 2000) (recognizing the Cliff Walk’s multiple entrance points). Thus, the fee that plaintiffs paid to tour the mansion and enclosed grounds was not a “charge” to get access to the Cliff Walk as contemplated by the statute. Second, plaintiffs argue that the RUS does not apply because they were the Society’s invited guests; this Court previously has determined that the RUS does not apply to a landowner’s invited guests. See Bucki, 914 A.2d at 497-98. The Cliff Walk, however, is free and open to the public; an invitation to visit is not necessary. The -9- plaintiffs place great emphasis on the fact that The Breakers’ tour guide “invited” them to experience the Cliff Walk after the tour and argue that this “invitation” places the Society outside the protections afforded by the RUS. The fact remains, however, that plaintiffs did not need an invitation of any kind to visit the Cliff Walk. Unlike the private backyard at issue in Bucki, the Cliff Walk has all of the attributes of public property—it is a public easement over private land and is open to all for recreational purposes. See id. at 498 (recognizing that the backyard was not free and open to the public as evidenced by a “No Trespassing” sign and the landowner’s use of specific invitations for entry). Finally, plaintiffs contend that the Society and the city were engaged in a joint enterprise, sufficient to satisfy the limiting language in the RUS with respect to liability for “the willful or malicious failure to guard or warn against a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity after discovering the user’s peril[.]” Section 32-6-5(a)(1). After careful review of the record before this Court, we are of the opinion that the defendants were not so engaged, such that each is liable for the negligence of the other, or that a duty on the part of one defendant—the city as we ultimately determine in this case—may be imputed to the Society. The record discloses that in 2005, the original hearing justice observed that there was “some sort of joint venture going on” among the Society, city, and state concerning the Cliff Walk. A joint enterprise requires “such circumstances that each has the authority * * * to act for all in respect to the control of the means or agencies employed to execute such common purpose * * *.” Salmeron v. Nava, 694 A.2d 709, 712 (R.I. 1997) (quoting Farrar v. Edgewood Yacht Club, 111 R.I. 376, 380, 302 A.2d 782, 784 (1973)). Despite the hearing justice’s rather loose use of the term “joint venture,” there is - 10 - not a scintilla of evidence in this record suggesting that the Society and the city were involved in a joint enterprise; indeed, the evidence points to a contrary conclusion. As far back as 1970, in response to a request from the Army Corps of Engineers, the city passed a resolution, giving assurance that the city “will maintain the public easement of passage along the Cliff Walk.” See Council Resolution No. 12-70; see also Cain, 755 A.2d at 169-71 (Goldberg, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (discussing the city’s maintenance and control over the Cliff Walk). The record also contains evidence of a 1991 letter from the mayor of the City of Newport to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which stated that “[the state] and the City of Newport admit and acknowledge that one or the other, or both, have the responsibility to supervise and maintain the Cliff Walk.” 9 The evidence submitted in this case in no way establishes that the landowners whose property abuts the Cliff Walk, including the Society, agreed or even contemplated acting in such a close relationship with the city (or state) that a joint enterprise is a plausible construction of their relationship. “[T]he mere fact that two persons are doing something together does not make each chargeable with the negligence of the other, nor does the mere fact that they have certain plans in common.” Najjar v. Horovitz, 54 R.I. 224, 227, 172 A. 255, 256 (1934) (quoting McGinley v. Winters, 166 A. 166, 167 (N.J. 1933)). 9 The letter was also signed by the then-governor of Rhode Island. We note that the state also may share control and thus responsibility for the maintenance of the Cliff Walk; that question, however, is not before us. - 11 - Having discussed the issue of the availability of the RUS to the Society, we turn now to the penultimate issue of what, if any, is the duty of care owed by the Society to the multitude of tourists who annually visit the Cliff Walk. Whether the Society owed a Duty of Care to Plaintiffs To prevail on a claim of negligence, it is incumbent upon Simcha to establish that the Society owed him a legal duty, the Society breached that duty of care, and he suffered injury as a result. See Haley v. Town of Lincoln, 611 A.2d 845, 848 (R.I. 1992) (noting that a prima facie case of negligence requires proof of a legal duty owed by defendant, “the breach of which serves as the basis of liability”). The record demonstrates that the Cliff Walk is a public easement over private land; a number of private individuals and entities including the Society and Salve Regina own the land along which the Cliff Walk runs. It is a well established legal principle in this jurisdiction, as well as others, that a landowner whose property abuts a public way has no duty to repair or maintain it. Typically, courts will not impose liability for injuries that occur on land over which the owner has no control, and significantly, no duty to repair. “Whether a duty exists in a particular situation is a question of law to be decided by the court.” Ferreira, 636 A.2d at 685. It is our opinion that because the Society has no control over the public easement, it has no responsibility to those who come upon it. Our decision in Ferreira is instructive; the tragic events in that case occurred on Christmas Eve in 1986, when three church parishioners, returning to their car after Midnight Mass, crossed Broadway, a public street in Newport, to travel from the church to a small parking lot owned by a third party. Ferreira, 636 A.2d at 684. While crossing the street, two of the worshipers were struck by a drunk driver; one parishioner suffered - 12 - severe injuries and the other died. Id. The plaintiffs sued the church, but this Court rejected the contention that the church was responsible for their injuries. Id. at 686. We noted that “the protection of the public while on a public way is a duty allocated to the government, not to private individuals who own land abutting public ways.” Id. The plaintiffs additionally argued that, because the church knew that its worshipers customarily crossed the public way to attend services, injuries such as the ones suffered by the plaintiffs were foreseeable. Id. at 688. We declared, however, that because “a landowner neither owns nor controls a public way,” the church could not be liable for failing to prevent the injury, even if such injury was foreseeable. Id. (noting that Rhode Island law consistently recognizes that the foreseeability of an injury does not impose a duty); see also Cornell v. Jan Co. Central, Inc., 671 A.2d 1223, 1224-25 (R.I. 1996) (holding that an abutting corporate landowner did not have a duty to control or manage traffic on an abutting public way). Other jurisdictions are in accord. Recently, the North Dakota Supreme Court declined to hold a landowner responsible for injuries occurring on a public way that ran through his property. Kappenman v. Klipfel, 765 N.W.2d 716, 728 (N.D. 2009). A thirteen-year-old boy died when his all-terrain vehicle fell into a trench that crossed a town section line, 10 which ran through private property. Id. at 718. The defendant owned land on both sides of the line. Id. at 719. The court stated that “[a]lthough the landowner abutting a section line continues to own the land subject to the easement * * * [he] does not owe to the public a duty to keep the [easement] in a safe condition.” Id. at 728. 10 Section lines are “considered public roads open for public travel.” Kappenman v. Klipfel, 765 N.W.2d 716, 720 (N.D. 2009) (quoting N.D.C.C. § 24-07-03). - 13 - Additionally, the New York Court of Appeals rejected an argument that a baseball stadium was liable for injuries that a fourteen-year-old boy suffered after a drunk driver struck him while he was chasing a foul ball into the public street adjacent to the stadium. Haymon v. Pettit, 880 N.E.2d 416, 417 (N.Y. 2007). The stadium sponsored an incentive program in which members of the public who gathered outside the building would receive free tickets in exchange for retrieving and returning foul balls. Id. The plaintiff argued that since this type of an injury was a consequence of the stadium’s incentive program, it owed the public a duty of protection. Id. The court held that the plaintiff’s argument presupposed that a duty existed, but the court declined to impose such a duty because the stadium “could control neither the public street nor third persons who use it.” Id. at 418; see also Lacey v. Bekaert Steel Wire Corp., 799 F.2d 434, 437 (8th Cir. 1986) (observing that, under Arkansas law, the defendant who owned property under and adjacent to the public highway did not owe a duty to travelers); Davis v. Westwood Group, 652 N.E.2d 567, 571 (Mass. 1995) (noting that the state’s control over the public way undermined the plaintiff’s attempt to impose liability on the abutting private landowner). It is not the function of this Court to declare a duty when none exists. Although the Society owns the land over and along which the public easement runs, it has no control over the Cliff Walk; it cannot restrict or limit access to the easement by the hordes of tourists who visit it each year. The law in this state, as well as in other jurisdictions, is clear: a public easement is the responsibility of the governmental agency that undertakes the control and maintenance of the easement. Whether a private abutter owns the land running under the - 14 - easement is of no moment; nor does it matter that the risk of injury from the easement’s use is foreseeable. We are of the opinion that landowners whose property abuts the Cliff Walk, including the Society, do not have a duty of care to maintain the easement. These landowners have no duty to warn, construct fences, or take any other precautions concerning the attraction’s dangers. Because there is no duty owed by the Society, we affirm the grant of summary judgment, but we do so on grounds other than those relied upon by the trial justice. See Lynch, 770 A.2d at 847. III City of Newport’s Liability As previously stated, the RUS accords a member of the public the status of a trespasser, qualified only by the landowner’s responsibility to refrain from “willful or malicious failure to guard or warn against a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity after discovering the user’s peril[.]” Section 32-6-5(a)(1). The city contends that it has no duty to maintain the Cliff Walk or to warn visitors of its known hazards unless a city employee, perhaps by happenstance, is present on the Cliff Walk and fails to warn a visitor—such as plaintiff—who is approaching danger. 11 Although this may be a plausible argument based on our previous cases in which we touched upon § 32-6- 5(a)(1), this argument must fail in the face of the facts and the instrumentality at issue in this case. It is a well settled principle of our law that this Court will not interpret a statute literally when doing so would lead to an absurd result, or one that is at odds with legislative intent. See Raso v. Wall, 884 A.2d 391, 395 n.11 (R.I. 2005) (recognizing that 11 The city makes this argument in response to plaintiffs’ contention that the Society’s employees’ alleged negligence could be imputed to the city. - 15 - the plain meaning approach to statutory construction is not to be adhered to when it would lead to an absurd result) (citing State v. Santos, 870 A.2d 1029 (R.I. 2005)). This Court always will strive to adopt a construction of a statute that avoids an absurd or unjust result. Id. (citing Berthiaume v. School Committee of Woonsocket, 121 R.I. 243, 247, 397 A.2d 889, 892 (1979)). Under the RUS, a landowner enjoys immunity from ordinary negligence unless the landowner engages in behavior that falls within the exceptions set forth in the statute. It is the exception set forth in § 32-6-5(a)(1) that is relevant to this case; that is, liability is not limited in any way “[f]or the willful or malicious failure to guard or warn against a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity after discovering the user’s peril[.]” Essentially this is a two-part test. It remains for the fact-finder to determine whether the city engaged in a willful or malicious failure to warn or guard against a known danger. However, it is the last phrase—“after discovering the user’s peril”—that requires our analysis and leads us to conclude that applying the term literally is unreasonable and would render the exception meaningless in the context of this case. Accordingly, we shall address the phrases separately, and we shall analyze the more troublesome phrase first. Discovering the User’s Peril The record before us is replete with evidence that the city, for some time, has known about the Cliff Walk’s latent dangers, including the eroding cliff edge, the drainage defects, and the fact that rainwater runoff “creates what seems to be paths along the Cliff Walk.” 12 Additionally, the record indicates that the city knew “most users of the 12 2001 Annual Report of the Cliff Walk Commission. - 16 - Cliff Walk would like to get as close to the water as possible, [and] they might mistake these erosion trails as foot paths.” 13 Tragically, the record suggests that even in the face of several fatal or near fatal incidents, the city has failed to either guard against these dangers or post warnings. According to the record before us, this does not appear to be a case in which a visitor came too close to the edge of a cliff and fell off, as tragic as that would be. As alleged in this case, however, the events leading to Simcha’s tragic injury were caused by latent defects in the structure of the Cliff Walk that are not obvious to the occasional visitor. The alleged facts in this case bear a haunting similarity to the plight of Michael Cain, who died in 1991 from injuries that he suffered during a visit to the Cliff Walk. See Cain, 755 A.2d at 158. The record in that case established that when Cain stepped from the paved area onto a “well-worn spot * * * that appear[ed] to be a perfectly natural area for a stroller to stop * * * and look[ed] out over the Atlantic Ocean,” he fell to his death, “after the ground beneath his feet gave way.” Id. at 158, 168 (Goldberg, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (emphasis added). Nine years later, almost to the day, plaintiffs allege that Simcha stepped off the Cliff Walk’s pavement, onto what appeared to his untrained eye to be a well-worn, grassy path when, as he contends, the “ground gave way” beneath his feet and he plunged to the rocks below. The city contends that it did not have a duty to warn against this danger because neither the city nor the Society observed Simcha before his fateful descent. According to the city, Simcha was not in a perilous position until he ventured off the paved walkway and attempted to walk down to the water over an area that he says he mistook for a path 13 See note 12, supra. - 17 - and which, allegedly, had been eroded by runoff. The city argues that it has no duty to guard against the latent dangers on the Cliff Walk. The city contends that for a duty to exist in this case would mean that “all visitors to the Cliff Walk * * * would be owed a duty to be free from willful and wanton conduct as soon as they enter upon the land” and that, if that were the case, “the user does not need to be discovered in peril by the owner” because the city’s “mere knowledge that the land has a perilous condition is sufficient.” We are of the opinion that the city’s argument is based on an overly narrow reading of the statutory language and that such a reading would lead to an absurd and blatantly unjust result. The city argues that a user of recreational land cannot be discovered in a position of peril until the owner (in this case, a city employee) actually perceives the person approaching a known danger. The term “discovery” means the “process of finding or learning something that was previously unknown.” Black’s Law Dictionary 533 (9th ed. 2009). However, at the time of Simcha’s injury, the dangers surrounding the Cliff Walk were anything but “unknown,” and tragedies such as this have occurred on multiple occasions. It is beyond dispute that for many years, the city has had actual notice of the dangerous instability of the ground underneath the Cliff Walk and its eroding edge. Indeed, the record before us is replete with evidence demonstrating that long before the Cain tragedy, the city knew that the forces of natural erosion were taking a toll on the Cliff Walk. In 1983, and again in 1987, after Brian Putney, a Salve Regina student, fell to his death from the Cliff Walk, Sister Lucille McKillop, the college’s then- president, wrote to Newport’s city manager expressing her concerns about the attraction. She conveyed her “concern for the safety of travelers because the entire under support - 18 - structure of [the] area is so weak.” Sister Lucille twice requested that the city install fencing around Shepard Avenue—the very point where plaintiff at bar accessed the Cliff Walk—“to delineate those points beyond which it is unsafe to pass.” In July 1989, the North Atlantic Regional Office of the National Park Service reported that the Cliff Walk was in desperate need of repair. Cain, 755 A.2d at 167 (Goldberg, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The report suggested that three years before Cain’s death in 1991, the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the USDA Soil Conservation Service “indicated a serious level of hazard to Cliff Walk visitors.” Id. Additionally, a 1991 memorandum from the City of Newport recognized that “[t]he Soil Conservation Service has identified seven critical areas where immediate action is needed to maintain a safe treadway for pedestrians on the Cliff Walk.” Accordingly, the evidence produced in this case demonstrates that the city had actual or constructive knowledge of the perilous circumstances, and, having been afforded a reasonable amount of time to eliminate the dangerous condition, failed to do so. This failure places the members of the public whom the city invites to visit the Cliff Walk in a position of peril. In Smiler, 911 A.2d at 1041, this Court discussed the “discovery” language of the RUS, and we declared that “[i]t would be absurd to conclude that the Legislature would require a landowner to sit idly by and wait until peril arose before a duty to warn the individual attached.” Smiler involved a woman who fell after she was attacked by a swarm of bees at a Providence park. Id. at 1037. We held that the RUS was a bar to liability because Providence did not know of the presence of the bees and thus had not yet discovered the plaintiff’s peril. Id. at 1037-38, 1041. “It is clear to this Court that the city’s duty would arise at the point when a city employee discovered that [the visitor] was - 19 - approaching an area where there was a known risk of bees.” Id. at 1041 (emphasis added). We also emphasize that we are not confronted with a single injury in a given location, such as the plaintiff in Smiler, who fell while running from a swarm of bees; or the nine-year-old boy in Lacey v. Reitsma, 899 A.2d 455, 456 (R.I. 2006), who was injured at Fort Adams State Park in Newport, when his bicycle “veered over the cliff and fell to the rocks below, sustaining severe and permanent injuries.” In Lacey, the parents of the injured child filed suit against the state, alleging negligence for failure “to place a guard-rail, wall, fence, or other protective device along the road to prevent people from falling off the cliff.” Id. In both of the aforementioned cases, there was no evidence that the governmental entity knew of the danger and then failed to take any action to guard against it, such that additional tragic injuries continued to occur. It is because of the multiple incidents of death and grievous injury that we conclude that the city may not successfully defend this claim based on an assertion that it had no specific knowledge of Simcha or any peril confronting him. Hundreds of thousands of people annually visit the Cliff Walk, an area in which there is a known risk of death or serious injury to unsuspecting visitors who might innocently venture off the paved path. We reject the city’s argument that it does not have a duty to guard or warn against these known perils simply because a city employee did not literally discover Simcha’s peril. 14 In our opinion, the city had an affirmative duty to take reasonable steps to warn and shield unsuspecting visitors, such as the Bermans, against these known and 14 As we shall discuss infra, the term “guard” means to take precautions and “[t]o protect from harm or danger, esp[ecially] by careful watching; * * * [t]o take precautions[.]” American Heritage Dictionary 580 (2nd ed. 1985). - 20 - grave dangers in some reasonable manner. To construe the RUS otherwise would not only lead to an absurd result, but it would also render the exception nugatory. Furthermore, and most significantly, in the face of these multiple tragedies, we cannot conclude that when the Legislature extended the protection of the RUS to the state and its municipalities, it intended to relieve the city from any responsibility whatsoever to the many tourists who visit the Cliff Walk. Were we to interpret the statute in the manner that the city suggests, our holding would serve as a disincentive to the state and its subdivisions to make necessary safety repairs to publicly owned and taxpayer-financed recreational facilities, or to warn the unsuspecting and innocent members of the public of known dangerous conditions. We emphasize that it is the number of serious injuries flowing from a known risk that brings us to this conclusion today. Willful or Malicious Failure to Guard or Warn The statutory terminology “willful or malicious failure to guard or warn against a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity” has not previously been addressed by this Court. However, the plain and ordinary meaning of this statute’s language, as well as the persuasive case law from our sister states interpreting their own recreational use statutes, work in tandem to convince us that the law imposes a duty upon the city in this case, and the city is precluded from invoking the RUS as a shield against liability for Simcha’s injuries. The protections afforded by the RUS are not available when there has been a “willful or malicious failure to guard or warn against a dangerous condition.” Section 32-6-5(a)(1). Black’s Law Dictionary defines “willful” as “[v]oluntary and intentional,” Black’s Law Dictionary 1737 (9th ed. 2009) and “malicious” as “[s]ubstantially certain to - 21 - cause injury.” 15 Id. at 1043. The term “guard” means “[t]o protect from harm or danger, esp[ecially] by careful watching; * * * [t]o take precautions[.]” American Heritage Dictionary 580 (2nd ed. 1985). A “warning” is defined as “[t]he pointing out of a danger, esp[ecially] to one who would not otherwise be aware of it.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1722 (9th ed. 2009). In this case, a fact-finder reasonably could find that after learning about the Cliff Walk’s instability, particularly along the area of Ochre Point, the city voluntarily and intentionally failed to guard against the dangerous condition, knowing that there existed a strong likelihood that a visitor to the Cliff Walk would suffer serious injury or death. The statutes and case law from our sister states are consistent with our conclusion. Georgia’s Recreational Property Act’s language mirrors ours in this respect. See Ga. Code Ann. § 51-3-25(1) (West 2009) (limiting liability unless evidence of “willful or malicious failure to guard or warn against a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity”). The Court of Appeals of Georgia in Quick v. Stone Mountain Memorial Association, 420 S.E.2d 36 (Ga. Ct. App. 1992), allowed the landowner to limit its liability even when it did nothing to prevent injuries sustained by the plaintiff who tripped and fell over rocks in a public park. Id. at 38. The court indicated that: “[a] wilful [sic] failure to guard or warn would require actual knowledge * * * that a condition exists involving an unreasonable risk of death or serious bodily harm; that the condition is not apparent to those using the property; and that having this knowledge, the owner chooses not to guard or warn, in disregard of the possible consequences.” Id. (quoting Georgia Marble Co. v. Warren, 360 S.E.2d 286 (Ga. Ct. App. 1987)). 15 We note that the term “malicious” in this context does not relate to the traditional, common law concept of malice or malice aforethought in homicide cases. - 22 - The court concluded that the unpaved area at issue in Quick, although covered in wood chips and hidden rocks, did not constitute a condition involving an unreasonable risk of death or serious bodily injury. Quick, 420 S.E.2d at 38. Importantly, the court noted that the park officials “were unaware of any other accidents that had occurred in this area.” Id. (emphasis added). Similarly, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, applying the Illinois Recreational Use of Land and Water Areas Act, declined to hold the landowner responsible for injuries that occurred when the plaintiffs drove their all-terrain vehicles into a creek bed. Cacia v. Norfolk & Western Railway Co., 290 F.3d 914, 915, 917 (7th Cir. 2002). The court noted that, if the defendant “has been informed of a dangerous condition or was aware of the fact that others had been injured because of the condition, and failed to respond to or otherwise remedy the dangerous condition[,]” liability would attach. Id. at 920. With that in mind, the court noted that the “plaintiffs point to not an iota of evidence that suggests that [the landowner] had any knowledge that the barricade * * * was damaged” (emphasis in original) and that the “evidence is undisputed that [the landowner] had no knowledge of any other complaints or accidents at the site * * *.” Id. (emphasis added). Quite appropriately, Newport jealously guards and promotes the Cliff Walk as a cornerstone of its tourism industry—an attraction that annually lures legions of visitors to the Atlantic coast. Newport has received more than $3.5 million in federal, state, and municipal funding for the Cliff Walk, and, to qualify for this money, the city declared its sovereignty over it. The city assumed control of the Cliff Walk, fully aware of the threatened stability of the walkway. However, at the same time, the city boldly argues - 23 - that it has no duty to maintain the Cliff Walk or warn visitors about its latent dangers, and the city contends that it is immune from suit unless a city employee, by happenstance, is present on the Cliff Walk and fails to warn a visitor whom he sees approaching the unstable cliff edge. We reject these contentions. We recognize that for purposes of tort liability under the RUS, a visitor to the Cliff Walk is accorded the status of a trespasser to whom no duty of care is owed, save to refrain from the conduct set forth in § 32-6-5(a)(1). But we are equally cognizant that if we were to apply the language of § 32-6-5(a)(1) as argued by the city, the throngs of visitors, who, although accorded the status of trespassers, are nonetheless innocent tourists, will continue to face grave danger based on an interpretation of the RUS that is not only absurd, but unjust. We are not persuaded that the Legislature intended the RUS to serve as an invitation to ignore known hazards while profiting from this major tourist attraction where such danger is present. We simply decline to attribute such intent to the Legislature. This Court is not the finder of fact. It is our function to rule on the question of law presented in this case. Having declared that the immunity provided by the RUS is not available to defendant City of Newport, in the context of the Cliff Walk, the question of whether the city is liable in tort is a task that is committed to the fact-finder. 16 Conclusion For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the defendant Preservation Society of Newport did not owe a duty of care to the plaintiffs in this case. Accordingly, we affirm 16 Obviously, the city is free to invoke all traditional tort-based defenses. - 24 - the Superior Court’s grant of summary judgment in its favor; but we do so on grounds other than those relied upon by the trial justice. Additionally, for the reasons stated in this opinion, we hold that the defendant City of Newport may not invoke the limited protections of the RUS because the city had a duty to warn or guard against the Cliff Walk’s latent dangerous condition. Accordingly, we vacate the Superior Court’s grant of summary judgment and remand the case for trial. Flaherty, J., concurring. I completely concur in Justice Goldberg’s well-written opinion that the Recreational Use Statute, G.L. 1956 chapter 6 of title 32, effectively bars suit in this case against the Preservation Society of Newport but does not do so against the City of Newport. To hold otherwise would require this Court to embrace a conclusion that the landowner, saturated with the knowledge that some feature of his land presents a clear and present danger to completely innocent users, simply could adopt a “see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil” attitude and use the statute as a shield from liability. I cannot begin to conceive that the General Assembly had any such intent; to conclude otherwise would be beyond absurd. See Ellis v. Rhode Island Public Transit Authority, 586 A.2d 1055, 1057 (R.I. 1991) (“[E]ven in circumstances in which a statute is clear and unambiguous, a statute will not be interpreted literally when such a construction will lead to an absurd result or one at odds with the legislative intent.”); Sugarman v. Lewis, 488 A.2d 709, 711 (R.I. 1985) (“A statute should not be interpreted literally, however, even though clear and unambiguous, when such a construction will lead to a result at odds with the legislative intent.”); Kingsley v. Miller, 120 R.I. 372, - 25 - 376, 388 A.2d 357, 360 (1978) (“[A] literal reading of a statute may be ignored if it does not convey a sensible meaning or where it defeats an evident legislative purpose.”). A contrary holding in this case would provide an incentive to landowners to be callous and altogether irresponsible with respect to the safety of people entering upon their land for simple recreational pleasure, in the face of danger known to the owner, but of which the recreational user is totally unaware. Suttell, C.J., with whom Robinson, J., joins, concurring in part and dissenting in part. We concur with the majority’s conclusion that the Preservation Society of Newport did not owe a duty of care to the plaintiff in this case, and we join in the majority’s analysis relative thereto. We dissent, however, from Section III of the majority opinion, which holds that, in this case, the City of Newport will not be immune from suit pursuant to the Recreational Use Statute (RUS). While we certainly have genuine sympathy for the plaintiffs, we believe that the majority’s analysis in Section III cannot be squared with the language of the statute or with our settled jurisprudence. As the majority explains, the RUS relegates a nonpaying user of private or public lands for recreational purposes to the status of that of trespasser, to whom a minimal duty of care is owed at common law. See generally Tantimonico v. Allendale Mutual Insurance Co., 637 A.2d 1056, 1057 (R.I. 1994). A landowner’s immunity afforded by the RUS is specifically circumscribed by the provisions of G.L. 1956 § 32-6-5, which state in relevant part: “(a) Nothing in this chapter limits in any way any liability which, but for this chapter, otherwise exists: “(1) For the willful or malicious failure to guard or warn against a dangerous condition, use, structure, or - 26 - activity after discovering the user’s peril * * *.” (Emphasis added.) In commenting on this statutory language, this Court has said that “[t]his rule is simply a legislative codification of the common law that is enunciated in our cases.” Cain v. Johnson, 755 A.2d 156, 164 (R.I. 2000). This Court in Cain explicated the common-law rule: “Under Rhode Island law it is well settled that a landowner owes a trespasser no duty except to refrain from willful or wanton conduct. * * * It is also well settled that such a duty arises only after a trespasser is discovered in a position of danger.” Cain, 755 A.2d at 160. The Court in Cain also discussed Zoubra v. New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad Co., 89 R.I. 41, 150 A.2d 643 (1959), which involved a plaintiff who was injured at a railroad crossing. In Cain, this Court explained, citing Zoubra, 89 R.I. at 45, 150 A.2d at 645, that “the law does not impose upon a landowner any duty toward a trespasser unless it has first discovered him or her in a position of peril, even though there was an allegation that the defendant knew or should have known of the presence of people on the crossing.” Cain, 755 A.2d at 161. The Cain majority additionally noted that this Court has not accepted the “beaten path exception,” available under the common law of some jurisdictions, pursuant to which a landowner is liable to a trespasser injured while using a limited area containing an unreasonable risk of harm. Id. “This theory * * * turns on a landowner’s knowledge of the use of his [or her] land by trespassers” and does not require that the landowner observe the particular trespasser on his or her property. Id. Rather, “this Court has steadfastly held that a landowner owes a trespasser no duty until he or she is actually discovered in a position of peril.” Id. - 27 - In subsequent cases, the Court repeatedly has held that the “willful or malicious” exception to statutory immunity under the RUS applies only after the landowner discovers a particular user in a position of peril. See Smiler v. Napolitano, 911 A.2d 1035, 1041 (R.I. 2006) (recognizing that “the city’s duty would arise at the point when a city employee discovered that Irina was approaching an area where there was a known risk * * *”); Lacey v. Reitsma, 899 A.2d 455, 458 (R.I. 2006) (holding the state to be immune where there was “no evidence that [the] defendants discovered young R.J. in a position of peril and then failed to warn him against the potentially dangerous condition”). We respectfully assert that the majority’s analysis is at odds with the unambiguous language of the statute and our settled jurisprudence. See Lacey, 899 A.2d at 458 (describing the language of the RUS as “unambiguous” and noting the “equally unambiguous nature of the relevant precedent”). In the instant case, a duty on the part of the city would have arisen only if an employee of the city had discovered Mr. Berman approaching an area where there was a known risk of danger and, thereafter, that employee willfully or maliciously failed to guard or warn him against the danger. See Smiler, 911 A.2d at 1041; see also Lacey, 899 A.2d at 458; Cain, 755 A.2d at 164. The plaintiffs allege no such wrongdoing by any agent of the city; and, in our judgment, general knowledge that recreational property has some dangerous element is not enough to give rise to a duty under the statute. See Smiler, 911 A.2d at 1038-39. The gravity of Mr. Berman’s injuries cannot be understated. Further, it is undisputed that the city is aware of other catastrophic injuries that have occurred on the Cliff Walk, yet it has failed to take even the simple expedient of posting warning signs at - 28 - all entrance points to what it actively promotes as a prime tourist attraction. This is likely because the RUS not only protects the city from liability but also acts as a disincentive for the city to implement any safety measures whatsoever. In 1996, the RUS was amended to specifically include the state and municipalities within the definition of a landowner to whom the statute applies. Since that time, we have on several occasions exhorted the General Assembly to revisit the provisions of the RUS, “especially where public parks and similar public recreational areas are concerned.” Lacey, 899 A.2d at 458; see also Smiler, 911 A.2d at 1042. In Lacey, 899 A.2d at 458, we stated “respectfully, but forcefully * * * that we find it troubling (to say the least) to be confronted with a legal regime” in which no duty of care exists for users of state and municipal recreational sites. If ever there was a case to which one could apply the ancient maxim “Dura lex sed lex” (“The law is hard but it is the law”), it surely would be this case. Nevertheless, as this Court unanimously stated in the recent case of DeSantis v. Prelle, 891 A.2d 873, 881 (R.I. 2006), “[i]t is not for this Court to assume a legislative function when the General Assembly chooses to remain silent.” The venerable concepts of tripartite government dictate that “[t]he remedy for a harsh law is not in interpretation, but in amendment or repeal.” State v. Duggan, 15 R.I. 403, 409, 6 A. 787, 788 (1886). 17 We must decline “to substitute our will for that of a body democratically elected by the citizens of this state * * *.” DeSantis, 891 A.2d at 881. Although we are 17 “This Court * * * is not ‘entitled to write into the statute certain provisions of policy which the [L]egislature might have provided but has seen fit to omit * * *. * * * If a change in that respect is desirable, it is for the [L]egislature and not for the [C]ourt.’” Simeone v. Charron, 762 A.2d 442, 448 (R.I. 2000) (quoting Elder v. Elder, 84 R.I. 13, 22, 120 A.2d 815, 820 (1956)). - 29 - sympathetic with the majority’s desire to deny the protections of the RUS to the city in this case, we feel compelled to dissent from the majority’s departure both from what we consider to be clear statutory language and clear precedent. At the same time, we once again urge the General Assembly to address the scope of the statute. - 30 - Supreme Court No. 2008-74-Appeal.

The city has enacted ordinances restricting access to the Cliff Walk and limiting enjoyment thereon to foot traffic. 2 The city also established the Cliff Walk Commission, an organization responsible for raising money and contracting for the repair and improvement on this important coastal attraction. 3 Additionally, the record is replete with evidence of collective efforts by the city and the State of Rhode Island (state) to secure funding for Cliff Walk-related construction and repair. 2', 'Newport City Ordinance § 12.32.010(C) restricts public access, requiring that the Cliff Walk “shall be closed for public use between nine p.m. and six a.m. * * * and no person shall go upon such public areas during the hours of closing * * * except that the Cliff Walk shall remain open for the purpose of access to the water for fishing.” Newport City Ordinance § 12.32.010(F) prohibits the use of “[b]icycles, motorcycles, skateboards, roller blades, and roller skates of all kinds * * *.” 3', 'The Cliff Walk Commission (commission) is charged with raising and expending funds for Cliff Walk repairs, improvements, and maintenance.

They paid admission to tour the mansion and the lavishly landscaped grounds. During the tour, the Society’s guide pointed out the Cliff Walk, which runs along The Breakers’ property, separated by a fence; plaintiffs allege that the guide suggested that, after the tour, the group experience the Cliff Walk. After the tour, plaintiffs first spent some time enjoying the grounds of The Breakers, and then they decided to take an excursion to the Cliff Walk. They exited the fenced-in area of The Breakers through a gate on the north side of the property onto Shepard Avenue, a public street. The plaintiffs followed Shepard Avenue to the portion of the Cliff Walk that runs along the Society’s property—an area known as Ochre Point. The plaintiffs allege that there were no signs warning of the Cliff Walk’s potential hazards at either The Breakers or the Shepard Avenue entrance.', 'According to plaintiffs, after they reached the paved portion of the Cliff Walk, the couple noticed a “beaten path,” which they assumed would guide them toward the water. Simcha took the lead and proceeded down the path with Sarah close behind. Suddenly, the ground beneath Simcha’s feet gave way and he plummeted approximately twenty- nine feet to the rocks below.

See § 32-6-1. 6 To accomplish this salutary purpose, the General Assembly declared in pertinent part as follows:', '“[A]n owner of land who either directly or indirectly', 'invites or permits without charge any person to use that', 'property for recreational purposes does not thereby:', '“(1) Extend any assurance that the premises are safe for any', 'purpose;', '“(2) Confer upon that person the legal status of an invitee', 'or licensee to whom a duty of care is owed; nor', '“(3) Assume responsibility for or incur liability for any', 'injury to any person or property caused by an act of', 'omission of that person.” Section 32-6-3.

Allendale Mutual Insurance Co., 637 A.2d 1056, 1060 (R.I. 1994). Thus, landowners who open their land for recreational activities have no duty to the public other than to refrain from willful or wanton conduct. Id. at 1061.', 'In 1996, the Legislature expanded the term “owners” to include the state and its municipalities. 7 Section 32-6-2(3), as amended by P.L. 1996, ch. 234, §1.

See Morales v. Town of Johnston, 895 A.2d 721, 727-28 (R.I. 2006) (recognizing that some governmental operations should be insulated from tort claims). These operations include, but are not limited to, inspecting buildings, undertaking highway construction work, and maintaining traffic signals. See, e.g., Torres v. Damicis, 853 A.2d 1233, 1239 (R.I. 2004); DeFusco v. Todesca Forte, Inc., 683 A.2d 363, 365 (R.I. 1996); Bierman v. Shookster, 590 A.2d 402, 403 (R.I. 1991). Over the years, this Court has carved out exceptions to the doctrine, which if applicable, deprive the governmental entity of immunity. See, e.g., Adams v. Rhode Island Department of Corrections, 973 A.2d 542,', '-6- determinatively, we conclude that regarding Newport’s duty in this case, the RUS has its limitations. Relevant to our analysis here, § 32-6-5 provides, in relevant part, as follows:', '“(a) Nothing in this chapter limits in any way any liability', 'which, but for this chapter, otherwise exists:', '“(1) For the willful or malicious failure to guard or', 'warn against a dangerous condition, use, structure, or', 'activity after discovering the user’s peril; or', '“(2) For any injury suffered in any case where the', 'owner of land charges the person or persons who', 'enter or go on the land for the recreational use thereof', '* * *.” (Emphases added.) Thus, the Legislature declared that all people who use this state’s public recreational resources are classified as trespassers to whom no duty of care is owed, save to refrain from willful or malicious conduct as defined in the RUS. 8 It is that limitation for willful or malicious conduct that controls the result in this case for Newport. 546 (R.I. 2009) (recognizing exception when the governmental entity acts negligently while performing a proprietary function including acting “as a landowner”); Morales, 895 A.2d at 730 (recognizing exception when the government owes a special duty to an individual plaintiff); Verity v. Danti, 585 A.2d 65, 67 (R.I. 1991) (recognizing exception when the governmental entity acts in an egregious manner). We have declared that a governmental entity engaged in a proprietary activity has a duty to maintain its parks and other lands in a reasonably safe condition for people who are invited onto the land. Brindamour v. City of Warwick, 697 A.2d 1075, 1077 (R.I. 1997). However, we also have recognized that this duty does not extend to trespassers – if a person is on the land after hours or in violation of an ordinance or regulation, that person is classified as a trespasser to whom the governmental entity owes no duty, save to refrain from wanton or willful conduct pertaining to the maintenance of the land. Id. By its enactment of the RUS, the Legislature has abrogated this latter exception to the judicially created public duty doctrine, and, under the RUS as it stands today, everyone who uses public recreational facilities is classified as a trespasser. Although not necessary to this decision, we are of the opinion that the public duty doctrine and its exceptions are not relevant to the case at bar. 8', 'This Court recently had occasion to comment upon the unfortunately harsh consequences that flow from classifying those who use public recreational facilities as trespassers. See Lacey v. Reitsma, 899 A.2d 455, 458 (R.I. 2006) (stating that it is the', '-7-', 'II', 'The Society’s Liability', 'The RUS and the Society', 'The trial justice granted summary judgment in favor of the Society, based on her conclusion that the Society was the fee owner of the property where the incident occurred, but that it did not charge an admission for entrance onto the Cliff Walk. She further found that there was no evidence in the record “that the Society discovered [p]laintiffs in a position of peril,” and therefore the Society was shielded from liability by the RUS. Before this Court, plaintiffs proffer several reasons to support their argument that the RUS does not apply to the facts in this case. As we shall explain in this opinion, it is our conclusion that with or without the protections afforded to landowners by the RUS, the Society does not owe a duty of care to those who enter upon the Cliff Walk. Accordingly, we affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of the Society, but we do so on grounds other than those relied upon by the hearing justice. See Lynch, 770 A.2d at 847 (stating that the Supreme Court may affirm a judgment of the Superior Court on grounds other than those relied upon by the trial court to justify its ruling).', 'However, we shall briefly address the issues that plaintiffs raise to support their contentions that the Society should be answerable in tort in this case. The plaintiffs argue that because the Society charged an admission to The Breakers—which they contend includes a fee to experience the Cliff Walk—the RUS does not apply. The plaintiffs attempt to distinguish the case at bar from the situation in Hanley v. State, in which this view of this Court “that people who use public recreational facilities should not be classified as trespassers”).', '-8- Court held that the state, as landowner, could invoke the protections of the RUS because the fee it charged the injured plaintiff to park her car did not constitute a fee for admission. See Hanley v. State, 837 A.2d 707, 714 (R.I. 2003) (recognizing that the state charged patrons for parking, not admission).', 'The difficulty with this argument becomes clear when one considers the statute’s plain language: a “charge” is defined as “the admission price or fee asked in return for invitation or permission to enter or go upon the land[.]” Section 32-6-2(1) (emphasis added). It is undisputed that plaintiffs paid an admission fee to visit The Breakers mansion and grounds; it is clear that the fee did not include “admission” to the Cliff Walk. If Simcha’s injury occurred while he was inside the mansion or in the gated backyard, both areas that required payment of a fee in exchange for permission to enter, then the RUS would be of no assistance to the Society. Simcha’s injury, however, occurred outside the area for which he paid an admission fee; it occurred on the public easement. If plaintiffs chose not to visit The Breakers, they nonetheless could have entered the Cliff Walk, free of charge, at Shepard Avenue, or they could have gained access from a number of other points, including the area known as Forty Steps. See Cain v. Johnson, 755 A.2d 156, 159 (R.I. 2000) (recognizing the Cliff Walk’s multiple entrance points). Thus, the fee that plaintiffs paid to tour the mansion and enclosed grounds was not a “charge” to get access to the Cliff Walk as contemplated by the statute.', 'Second, plaintiffs argue that the RUS does not apply because they were the Society’s invited guests; this Court previously has determined that the RUS does not apply to a landowner’s invited guests. See Bucki, 914 A.2d at 497-98. The Cliff Walk, however, is free and open to the public; an invitation to visit is not necessary. The', '-9- plaintiffs place great emphasis on the fact that The Breakers’ tour guide “invited” them to experience the Cliff Walk after the tour and argue that this “invitation” places the Society outside the protections afforded by the RUS. The fact remains, however, that plaintiffs did not need an invitation of any kind to visit the Cliff Walk. Unlike the private backyard at issue in Bucki, the Cliff Walk has all of the attributes of public property—it is a public easement over private land and is open to all for recreational purposes. See id. at 498 (recognizing that the backyard was not free and open to the public as evidenced by a “No Trespassing” sign and the landowner’s use of specific invitations for entry).', 'Finally, plaintiffs contend that the Society and the city were engaged in a joint enterprise, sufficient to satisfy the limiting language in the RUS with respect to liability for “the willful or malicious failure to guard or warn against a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity after discovering the user’s peril[.]” Section 32-6-5(a)(1). After careful review of the record before this Court, we are of the opinion that the defendants were not so engaged, such that each is liable for the negligence of the other, or that a duty on the part of one defendant—the city as we ultimately determine in this case—may be imputed to the Society.', 'The record discloses that in 2005, the original hearing justice observed that there was “some sort of joint venture going on” among the Society, city, and state concerning the Cliff Walk.', 'A joint enterprise requires “such circumstances that each has the authority * * * to act for all in respect to the control of the means or agencies employed to execute such common purpose * * *.” Salmeron v. Nava, 694 A.2d 709, 712 (R.I. 1997) (quoting Farrar v. Edgewood Yacht Club, 111 R.I. 376, 380, 302 A.2d 782, 784 (1973)). Despite the hearing justice’s rather loose use of the term “joint venture,” there is', '- 10 - not a scintilla of evidence in this record suggesting that the Society and the city were involved in a joint enterprise; indeed, the evidence points to a contrary conclusion.', 'As far back as 1970, in response to a request from the Army Corps of Engineers, the city passed a resolution, giving assurance that the city “will maintain the public easement of passage along the Cliff Walk.” See Council Resolution No. 12-70; see also Cain, 755 A.2d at 169-71 (Goldberg, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (discussing the city’s maintenance and control over the Cliff Walk). The record also contains evidence of a 1991 letter from the mayor of the City of Newport to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which stated that “[the state] and the City of Newport admit and acknowledge that one or the other, or both, have the responsibility to supervise and maintain the Cliff Walk.” 9', 'The evidence submitted in this case in no way establishes that the landowners whose property abuts the Cliff Walk, including the Society, agreed or even contemplated acting in such a close relationship with the city (or state) that a joint enterprise is a plausible construction of their relationship. “[T]he mere fact that two persons are doing something together does not make each chargeable with the negligence of the other, nor does the mere fact that they have certain plans in common.” Najjar v. Horovitz, 54 R.I. 224, 227, 172 A. 255, 256 (1934) (quoting McGinley v. Winters, 166 A. 166, 167 (N.J. 1933)). 9', 'The letter was also signed by the then-governor of Rhode Island. We note that the state also may share control and thus responsibility for the maintenance of the Cliff Walk; that question, however, is not before us.', '- 11 -', 'Having discussed the issue of the availability of the RUS to the Society, we turn now to the penultimate issue of what, if any, is the duty of care owed by the Society to the multitude of tourists who annually visit the Cliff Walk.', 'Whether the Society owed a Duty of Care to Plaintiffs', 'To prevail on a claim of negligence, it is incumbent upon Simcha to establish that the Society owed him a legal duty, the Society breached that duty of care, and he suffered injury as a result. See Haley v. Town of Lincoln, 611 A.2d 845, 848 (R.I. 1992) (noting that a prima facie case of negligence requires proof of a legal duty owed by defendant, “the breach of which serves as the basis of liability”). The record demonstrates that the Cliff Walk is a public easement over private land; a number of private individuals and entities including the Society and Salve Regina own the land along which the Cliff Walk runs. It is a well established legal principle in this jurisdiction, as well as others, that a landowner whose property abuts a public way has no duty to repair or maintain it. Typically, courts will not impose liability for injuries that occur on land over which the owner has no control, and significantly, no duty to repair. “Whether a duty exists in a particular situation is a question of law to be decided by the court.” Ferreira, 636 A.2d at 685. It is our opinion that because the Society has no control over the public easement, it has no responsibility to those who come upon it.', 'Our decision in Ferreira is instructive; the tragic events in that case occurred on Christmas Eve in 1986, when three church parishioners, returning to their car after Midnight Mass, crossed Broadway, a public street in Newport, to travel from the church to a small parking lot owned by a third party. Ferreira, 636 A.2d at 684. While crossing the street, two of the worshipers were struck by a drunk driver; one parishioner suffered', '- 12 - severe injuries and the other died. Id. The plaintiffs sued the church, but this Court rejected the contention that the church was responsible for their injuries. Id. at 686. We noted that “the protection of the public while on a public way is a duty allocated to the government, not to private individuals who own land abutting public ways.” Id. The plaintiffs additionally argued that, because the church knew that its worshipers customarily crossed the public way to attend services, injuries such as the ones suffered by the plaintiffs were foreseeable. Id. at 688. We declared, however, that because “a landowner neither owns nor controls a public way,” the church could not be liable for failing to prevent the injury, even if such injury was foreseeable. Id. (noting that Rhode Island law consistently recognizes that the foreseeability of an injury does not impose a duty); see also Cornell v. Jan Co. Central, Inc., 671 A.2d 1223, 1224-25 (R.I. 1996) (holding that an abutting corporate landowner did not have a duty to control or manage traffic on an abutting public way).', 'Other jurisdictions are in accord. Recently, the North Dakota Supreme Court declined to hold a landowner responsible for injuries occurring on a public way that ran through his property. Kappenman v. Klipfel, 765 N.W.2d 716, 728 (N.D. 2009). A thirteen-year-old boy died when his all-terrain vehicle fell into a trench that crossed a town section line, 10 which ran through private property. Id. at 718. The defendant owned land on both sides of the line. Id. at 719. The court stated that “[a]lthough the landowner abutting a section line continues to own the land subject to the easement * * * [he] does not owe to the public a duty to keep the [easement] in a safe condition.” Id. at 728. 10', 'Section lines are “considered public roads open for public travel.” Kappenman v. Klipfel, 765 N.W.2d 716, 720 (N.D. 2009) (quoting N.D.C.C. § 24-07-03).', '- 13 -', 'Additionally, the New York Court of Appeals rejected an argument that a baseball stadium was liable for injuries that a fourteen-year-old boy suffered after a drunk driver struck him while he was chasing a foul ball into the public street adjacent to the stadium. Haymon v. Pettit, 880 N.E.2d 416, 417 (N.Y. 2007). The stadium sponsored an incentive program in which members of the public who gathered outside the building would receive free tickets in exchange for retrieving and returning foul balls. Id. The plaintiff argued that since this type of an injury was a consequence of the stadium’s incentive program, it owed the public a duty of protection. Id. The court held that the plaintiff’s argument presupposed that a duty existed, but the court declined to impose such a duty because the stadium “could control neither the public street nor third persons who use it.” Id. at 418; see also Lacey v. Bekaert Steel Wire Corp., 799 F.2d 434, 437 (8th Cir. 1986) (observing that, under Arkansas law, the defendant who owned property under and adjacent to the public highway did not owe a duty to travelers); Davis v. Westwood Group, 652 N.E.2d 567, 571 (Mass. 1995) (noting that the state’s control over the public way undermined the plaintiff’s attempt to impose liability on the abutting private landowner).', 'It is not the function of this Court to declare a duty when none exists. Although the Society owns the land over and along which the public easement runs, it has no control over the Cliff Walk; it cannot restrict or limit access to the easement by the hordes of tourists who visit it each year.', 'The law in this state, as well as in other jurisdictions, is clear: a public easement is the responsibility of the governmental agency that undertakes the control and maintenance of the easement. Whether a private abutter owns the land running under the', '- 14 - easement is of no moment; nor does it matter that the risk of injury from the easement’s use is foreseeable. We are of the opinion that landowners whose property abuts the Cliff Walk, including the Society, do not have a duty of care to maintain the easement. These landowners have no duty to warn, construct fences, or take any other precautions concerning the attraction’s dangers. Because there is no duty owed by the Society, we affirm the grant of summary judgment, but we do so on grounds other than those relied upon by the trial justice. See Lynch, 770 A.2d at 847.', 'III', 'City of Newport’s Liability', 'As previously stated, the RUS accords a member of the public the status of a trespasser, qualified only by the landowner’s responsibility to refrain from “willful or malicious failure to guard or warn against a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity after discovering the user’s peril[.]” Section 32-6-5(a)(1). The city contends that it has no duty to maintain the Cliff Walk or to warn visitors of its known hazards unless a city employee, perhaps by happenstance, is present on the Cliff Walk and fails to warn a visitor—such as plaintiff—who is approaching danger. 11 Although this may be a plausible argument based on our previous cases in which we touched upon § 32-6- 5(a)(1), this argument must fail in the face of the facts and the instrumentality at issue in this case.', 'It is a well settled principle of our law that this Court will not interpret a statute literally when doing so would lead to an absurd result, or one that is at odds with legislative intent. See Raso v. Wall, 884 A.2d 391, 395 n.11 (R.I. 2005) (recognizing that 11', 'The city makes this argument in response to plaintiffs’ contention that the Society’s employees’ alleged negligence could be imputed to the city.', '- 15 - the plain meaning approach to statutory construction is not to be adhered to when it would lead to an absurd result) (citing State v. Santos, 870 A.2d 1029 (R.I. 2005)). This Court always will strive to adopt a construction of a statute that avoids an absurd or unjust result. Id. (citing Berthiaume v. School Committee of Woonsocket, 121 R.I. 243, 247, 397 A.2d 889, 892 (1979)).', 'Under the RUS, a landowner enjoys immunity from ordinary negligence unless the landowner engages in behavior that falls within the exceptions set forth in the statute. It is the exception set forth in § 32-6-5(a)(1) that is relevant to this case; that is, liability is not limited in any way “[f]or the willful or malicious failure to guard or warn against a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity after discovering the user’s peril[.]” Essentially this is a two-part test. It remains for the fact-finder to determine whether the city engaged in a willful or malicious failure to warn or guard against a known danger. However, it is the last phrase—“after discovering the user’s peril”—that requires our analysis and leads us to conclude that applying the term literally is unreasonable and would render the exception meaningless in the context of this case. Accordingly, we shall address the phrases separately, and we shall analyze the more troublesome phrase first.', 'Discovering the User’s Peril', 'The record before us is replete with evidence that the city, for some time, has known about the Cliff Walk’s latent dangers, including the eroding cliff edge, the drainage defects, and the fact that rainwater runoff “creates what seems to be paths along the Cliff Walk.” 12 Additionally, the record indicates that the city knew “most users of the 12', '2001 Annual Report of the Cliff Walk Commission.', '- 16 - Cliff Walk would like to get as close to the water as possible, [and] they might mistake these erosion trails as foot paths.” 13 Tragically, the record suggests that even in the face of several fatal or near fatal incidents, the city has failed to either guard against these dangers or post warnings.', 'According to the record before us, this does not appear to be a case in which a visitor came too close to the edge of a cliff and fell off, as tragic as that would be. As alleged in this case, however, the events leading to Simcha’s tragic injury were caused by latent defects in the structure of the Cliff Walk that are not obvious to the occasional visitor. The alleged facts in this case bear a haunting similarity to the plight of Michael Cain, who died in 1991 from injuries that he suffered during a visit to the Cliff Walk. See Cain, 755 A.2d at 158. The record in that case established that when Cain stepped from the paved area onto a “well-worn spot * * * that appear[ed] to be a perfectly natural area for a stroller to stop * * * and look[ed] out over the Atlantic Ocean,” he fell to his death, “after the ground beneath his feet gave way.” Id. at 158, 168 (Goldberg, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (emphasis added). Nine years later, almost to the day, plaintiffs allege that Simcha stepped off the Cliff Walk’s pavement, onto what appeared to his untrained eye to be a well-worn, grassy path when, as he contends, the “ground gave way” beneath his feet and he plunged to the rocks below.', 'The city contends that it did not have a duty to warn against this danger because neither the city nor the Society observed Simcha before his fateful descent. According to the city, Simcha was not in a perilous position until he ventured off the paved walkway and attempted to walk down to the water over an area that he says he mistook for a path 13', 'See note 12, supra.', '- 17 - and which, allegedly, had been eroded by runoff. The city argues that it has no duty to guard against the latent dangers on the Cliff Walk. The city contends that for a duty to exist in this case would mean that “all visitors to the Cliff Walk * * * would be owed a duty to be free from willful and wanton conduct as soon as they enter upon the land” and that, if that were the case, “the user does not need to be discovered in peril by the owner” because the city’s “mere knowledge that the land has a perilous condition is sufficient.” We are of the opinion that the city’s argument is based on an overly narrow reading of the statutory language and that such a reading would lead to an absurd and blatantly unjust result.', 'The city argues that a user of recreational land cannot be discovered in a position of peril until the owner (in this case, a city employee) actually perceives the person approaching a known danger. The term “discovery” means the “process of finding or learning something that was previously unknown.” Black’s Law Dictionary 533 (9th ed. 2009). However, at the time of Simcha’s injury, the dangers surrounding the Cliff Walk were anything but “unknown,” and tragedies such as this have occurred on multiple occasions. It is beyond dispute that for many years, the city has had actual notice of the dangerous instability of the ground underneath the Cliff Walk and its eroding edge.', 'Indeed, the record before us is replete with evidence demonstrating that long before the Cain tragedy, the city knew that the forces of natural erosion were taking a toll on the Cliff Walk. In 1983, and again in 1987, after Brian Putney, a Salve Regina student, fell to his death from the Cliff Walk, Sister Lucille McKillop, the college’s then- president, wrote to Newport’s city manager expressing her concerns about the attraction. She conveyed her “concern for the safety of travelers because the entire under support', '- 18 - structure of [the] area is so weak.” Sister Lucille twice requested that the city install fencing around Shepard Avenue—the very point where plaintiff at bar accessed the Cliff Walk—“to delineate those points beyond which it is unsafe to pass.” In July 1989, the North Atlantic Regional Office of the National Park Service reported that the Cliff Walk was in desperate need of repair. Cain, 755 A.2d at 167 (Goldberg, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The report suggested that three years before Cain’s death in 1991, the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the USDA Soil Conservation Service “indicated a serious level of hazard to Cliff Walk visitors.” Id. Additionally, a 1991 memorandum from the City of Newport recognized that “[t]he Soil Conservation Service has identified seven critical areas where immediate action is needed to maintain a safe treadway for pedestrians on the Cliff Walk.” Accordingly, the evidence produced in this case demonstrates that the city had actual or constructive knowledge of the perilous circumstances, and, having been afforded a reasonable amount of time to eliminate the dangerous condition, failed to do so. This failure places the members of the public whom the city invites to visit the Cliff Walk in a position of peril.', 'In Smiler, 911 A.2d at 1041, this Court discussed the “discovery” language of the RUS, and we declared that “[i]t would be absurd to conclude that the Legislature would require a landowner to sit idly by and wait until peril arose before a duty to warn the individual attached.” Smiler involved a woman who fell after she was attacked by a swarm of bees at a Providence park. Id. at 1037. We held that the RUS was a bar to liability because Providence did not know of the presence of the bees and thus had not yet discovered the plaintiff’s peril. Id. at 1037-38, 1041. “It is clear to this Court that the city’s duty would arise at the point when a city employee discovered that [the visitor] was', '- 19 - approaching an area where there was a known risk of bees.” Id. at 1041 (emphasis added). We also emphasize that we are not confronted with a single injury in a given location, such as the plaintiff in Smiler, who fell while running from a swarm of bees; or the nine-year-old boy in Lacey v. Reitsma, 899 A.2d 455, 456 (R.I. 2006), who was injured at Fort Adams State Park in Newport, when his bicycle “veered over the cliff and fell to the rocks below, sustaining severe and permanent injuries.” In Lacey, the parents of the injured child filed suit against the state, alleging negligence for failure “to place a guard-rail, wall, fence, or other protective device along the road to prevent people from falling off the cliff.” Id. In both of the aforementioned cases, there was no evidence that the governmental entity knew of the danger and then failed to take any action to guard against it, such that additional tragic injuries continued to occur.', 'It is because of the multiple incidents of death and grievous injury that we conclude that the city may not successfully defend this claim based on an assertion that it had no specific knowledge of Simcha or any peril confronting him.', 'Hundreds of thousands of people annually visit the Cliff Walk, an area in which there is a known risk of death or serious injury to unsuspecting visitors who might innocently venture off the paved path. We reject the city’s argument that it does not have a duty to guard or warn against these known perils simply because a city employee did not literally discover Simcha’s peril. 14 In our opinion, the city had an affirmative duty to take reasonable steps to warn and shield unsuspecting visitors, such as the Bermans, against these known and 14', 'As we shall discuss infra, the term “guard” means to take precautions and “[t]o protect from harm or danger, esp[ecially] by careful watching; * * * [t]o take precautions[.]” American Heritage Dictionary 580 (2nd ed. 1985).', '- 20 - grave dangers in some reasonable manner. To construe the RUS otherwise would not only lead to an absurd result, but it would also render the exception nugatory.', 'Furthermore, and most significantly, in the face of these multiple tragedies, we cannot conclude that when the Legislature extended the protection of the RUS to the state and its municipalities, it intended to relieve the city from any responsibility whatsoever to the many tourists who visit the Cliff Walk. Were we to interpret the statute in the manner that the city suggests, our holding would serve as a disincentive to the state and its subdivisions to make necessary safety repairs to publicly owned and taxpayer-financed recreational facilities, or to warn the unsuspecting and innocent members of the public of known dangerous conditions. We emphasize that it is the number of serious injuries flowing from a known risk that brings us to this conclusion today.', 'Willful or Malicious Failure to Guard or Warn', 'The statutory terminology “willful or malicious failure to guard or warn against a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity” has not previously been addressed by this Court. However, the plain and ordinary meaning of this statute’s language, as well as the persuasive case law from our sister states interpreting their own recreational use statutes, work in tandem to convince us that the law imposes a duty upon the city in this case, and the city is precluded from invoking the RUS as a shield against liability for Simcha’s injuries.', 'The protections afforded by the RUS are not available when there has been a “willful or malicious failure to guard or warn against a dangerous condition.” Section 32-6-5(a)(1). Black’s Law Dictionary defines “willful” as “[v]oluntary and intentional,” Black’s Law Dictionary 1737 (9th ed. 2009) and “malicious” as “[s]ubstantially certain to', '- 21 - cause injury.” 15 Id. at 1043. The term “guard” means “[t]o protect from harm or danger, esp[ecially] by careful watching; * * * [t]o take precautions[.]” American Heritage Dictionary 580 (2nd ed. 1985). A “warning” is defined as “[t]he pointing out of a danger, esp[ecially] to one who would not otherwise be aware of it.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1722 (9th ed. 2009).', 'In this case, a fact-finder reasonably could find that after learning about the Cliff Walk’s instability, particularly along the area of Ochre Point, the city voluntarily and intentionally failed to guard against the dangerous condition, knowing that there existed a strong likelihood that a visitor to the Cliff Walk would suffer serious injury or death. The statutes and case law from our sister states are consistent with our conclusion. Georgia’s Recreational Property Act’s language mirrors ours in this respect. See Ga. Code Ann. § 51-3-25(1) (West 2009) (limiting liability unless evidence of “willful or malicious failure to guard or warn against a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity”). The Court of Appeals of Georgia in Quick v. Stone Mountain Memorial Association, 420 S.E.2d 36 (Ga. Ct. App. 1992), allowed the landowner to limit its liability even when it did nothing to prevent injuries sustained by the plaintiff who tripped and fell over rocks in a public park. Id. at 38. The court indicated that:', '“[a] wilful [sic] failure to guard or warn would require', 'actual knowledge * * * that a condition exists involving an', 'unreasonable risk of death or serious bodily harm; that the', 'condition is not apparent to those using the property; and', 'that having this knowledge, the owner chooses not to guard', 'or warn, in disregard of the possible consequences.” Id.', '(quoting Georgia Marble Co. v.

The court noted that, if the defendant “has been informed of a dangerous condition or was aware of the fact that others had been injured because of the condition, and failed to respond to or otherwise remedy the dangerous condition[,]” liability would attach. Id. at 920. With that in mind, the court noted that the “plaintiffs point to not an iota of evidence that suggests that [the landowner] had any knowledge that the barricade * * * was damaged” (emphasis in original) and that the “evidence is undisputed that [the landowner] had no knowledge of any other complaints or accidents at the site * * *.” Id.

Newport has received more than $3.5 million in federal, state, and municipal funding for the Cliff Walk, and, to qualify for this money, the city declared its sovereignty over it. The city assumed control of the Cliff Walk, fully aware of the threatened stability of the walkway.

But we are equally cognizant that if we were to apply the language of § 32-6-5(a)(1) as argued by the city, the throngs of visitors, who, although accorded the status of trespassers, are nonetheless innocent tourists, will continue to face grave danger based on an interpretation of the RUS that is not only absurd, but unjust. We are not persuaded that the Legislature intended the RUS to serve as an invitation to ignore known hazards while profiting from this major tourist attraction where such danger is present. We simply decline to attribute such intent to the Legislature.', 'This Court is not the finder of fact. It is our function to rule on the question of law presented in this case.

I completely concur in Justice Goldberg’s well-written opinion that the Recreational Use Statute, G.L. 1956 chapter 6 of title 32, effectively bars suit in this case against the Preservation Society of Newport but does not do so against the City of Newport.', 'To hold otherwise would require this Court to embrace a conclusion that the landowner, saturated with the knowledge that some feature of his land presents a clear and present danger to completely innocent users, simply could adopt a “see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil” attitude and use the statute as a shield from liability. I cannot begin to conceive that the General Assembly had any such intent; to conclude otherwise would be beyond absurd. See Ellis v. Rhode Island Public Transit Authority, 586 A.2d 1055, 1057 (R.I. 1991) (“[E]ven in circumstances in which a statute is clear and unambiguous, a statute will not be interpreted literally when such a construction will lead to an absurd result or one at odds with the legislative intent.”); Sugarman v.

We concur with the majority’s conclusion that the Preservation Society of Newport did not owe a duty of care to the plaintiff in this case, and we join in the majority’s analysis relative thereto. We dissent, however, from Section III of the majority opinion, which holds that, in this case, the City of Newport will not be immune from suit pursuant to the Recreational Use Statute (RUS). While we certainly have genuine sympathy for the plaintiffs, we believe that the majority’s analysis in Section III cannot be squared with the language of the statute or with our settled jurisprudence.', 'As the majority explains, the RUS relegates a nonpaying user of private or public lands for recreational purposes to the status of that of trespasser, to whom a minimal duty of care is owed at common law. See generally Tantimonico v. Allendale Mutual Insurance Co., 637 A.2d 1056, 1057 (R.I. 1994). A landowner’s immunity afforded by the RUS is specifically circumscribed by the provisions of G.L. 1956 § 32-6-5, which state in relevant part:', '“(a) Nothing in this chapter limits in any way any liability', 'which, but for this chapter, otherwise exists:', '“(1) For the willful or malicious failure to guard or', 'warn against a dangerous condition, use, structure, or', '- 26 -', 'activity after discovering the user’s peril * * *.” (Emphasis', 'added.) In commenting on this statutory language, this Court has said that “[t]his rule is simply a legislative codification of the common law that is enunciated in our cases.” Cain v. Johnson, 755 A.2d 156, 164 (R.I. 2000).', 'This Court in Cain explicated the common-law rule: “Under Rhode Island law it is well settled that a landowner owes a trespasser no duty except to refrain from willful or wanton conduct. * * * It is also well settled that such a duty arises only after a trespasser is discovered in a position of danger.” Cain, 755 A.2d at 160. The Court in Cain also discussed Zoubra v. New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad Co., 89 R.I. 41, 150 A.2d 643 (1959), which involved a plaintiff who was injured at a railroad crossing. In Cain, this Court explained, citing Zoubra, 89 R.I. at 45, 150 A.2d at 645, that “the law does not impose upon a landowner any duty toward a trespasser unless it has first discovered him or her in a position of peril, even though there was an allegation that the defendant knew or should have known of the presence of people on the crossing.” Cain, 755 A.2d at 161. The Cain majority additionally noted that this Court has not accepted the “beaten path exception,” available under the common law of some jurisdictions, pursuant to which a landowner is liable to a trespasser injured while using a limited area containing an unreasonable risk of harm. Id. “This theory * * * turns on a landowner’s knowledge of the use of his [or her] land by trespassers” and does not require that the landowner observe the particular trespasser on his or her property.

See Lacey, 899 A.2d at 458 (describing the language of the RUS as “unambiguous” and noting the “equally unambiguous nature of the relevant precedent”). In the instant case, a duty on the part of the city would have arisen only if an employee of the city had discovered Mr. Berman approaching an area where there was a known risk of danger and, thereafter, that employee willfully or maliciously failed to guard or warn him against the danger. See Smiler, 911 A.2d at 1041; see also Lacey, 899 A.2d at 458; Cain, 755 A.2d at 164. The plaintiffs allege no such wrongdoing by any agent of the city; and, in our judgment, general knowledge that recreational property has some dangerous element is not enough to give rise to a duty under the statute. See Smiler, 911 A.2d at 1038-39.', 'The gravity of Mr. Berman’s injuries cannot be understated.', 'Further, it is undisputed that the city is aware of other catastrophic injuries that have occurred on the Cliff Walk, yet it has failed to take even the simple expedient of posting warning signs at', '- 28 - all entrance points to what it actively promotes as a prime tourist attraction.

45,"David L. Steinhof et al. : v. : Michelle J. Murphy et al. : Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty, and Robinson, JJ. OPINION Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The plaintiffs, David L. Steinhof, Michael E. Steinhof, Gregory E. Steinhof, Edward J. Steinhof, and Jody Louise Fedele (collectively the Steinhofs), and the defendants, 1 Elizabeth Ferland, Charles Ferland, and Oscar M. Ferland (collectively the Ferlands), as heirs at law of Laura V. Ferland, cross-appeal from the Superior Court’s summary judgment (1) dividing the corpus of the trust established by Robert Steinhof (Robert) 2 into two equal shares: one for Alice Bouchard (Alice) and one for the Steinhofs, as heirs to Edward J. Steinhof (Edward), and (2) directing that a proportional share of federal and state estate taxes be paid out of the trust. For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm in part and vacate in part the summary judgment of the Superior Court. 1 Michelle J. Murphy (Michelle) is also a defendant in this matter, but she did not appeal from entry of summary judgment. In their answers and trial memoranda supporting their respective motions for summary judgment, Michelle and the Ferlands shared positions on both the issue of tax apportionment and the division of trust assets. On appeal, however, Michelle now advocates the Ferlands’ position on the issue of tax apportionment, and the Steinhofs’ position on the division of trust assets. Therefore, Michelle requests that we affirm the decision in both respects. 2 We identify the parties by their first names solely for the sake of clarity. No disrespect is intended. -1- I Facts and Procedural History Robert was predeceased by his wife, Avis Steinhof, and the couple had no children. Robert had four sisters, Eugenia Stoutnar, Josephine Steinhof, Laura, and Alice, and one brother, Edward. This dispute arises, in part, from a will (the 1994 will) and a trust (the trust) that Robert executed and established on December 28, 1994. At the time the trust and the 1994 will were executed, Edward and Alice were Robert’s only living siblings. On February 10, 1999, Robert executed the “First Amendment of the Robert Steinhof Declaration of Trust” (the 1999 amendment). The 1999 amendment reaffirmed most of the terms of the trust, but named Alice and her daughter Michelle Murphy (Michelle) as successor trustees. Robert executed a second will on November 5, 2003 (the 2003 will), which expressly revoked and annulled “all other and former wills” he had made. The trust provided in relevant part: “ARTICLE VII “FINAL DISTRIBUTION “* * * the entire Trust estate upon my death if my wife does not survive me, shall be held in Trust and administered as follows: “Section A. Generation-Skipping Trusts. “(1) Establishment. The portion, or portions, if any, of the Trust Estate to which generation-skipping tax exemption was or is allocated by virtue of my death, or the death of my spouse, shall be divided to provide (a) one equal share for Settlor’s brother, Edward J. Steinhof, and Settlor’s sister, Alice Bouchard, each to be held as a separate trust for their benefit under subsection (2) of this Section A, ARTICLE VII, and (b) one equal share for the issue, collectively, of Settlor’s then deceased brother or sister, also to be administered as a separate trust for the benefit of those issue pursuant to subsection (2) of Section A, ARTICLE VII. In the -2- event Settlor’s brother or Settlor’s sister shall predecease Settlor with no surviving issue, such deceased brother’s or sister’s share shall be distributed equally amongst the then remaining shares established hereunder. “* * * “Section B. Family Trusts. “(1) Establishment. The rest, residue, and remainder of the Trust Estate shall be divided to provide (a) one equal share for Settlor’s brother and Settlor’s sister, each to be held as a separate trust for Settlor’s brother’s and Settlor’s sister’s benefit under subsection (2) of this Section B of this ARTICLE VII, and (b) one equal share for the then living issue, collectively, of each then deceased brother or sister of Settlor, to be administered for the benefit of those issue pursuant to subsection (2) of Section B of this ARTICLE VII. “(2) Administration. “(a) Income. Until the time for termination and liquidation of a separate trust, as prescribed below in subsection (3) of this Section B, ARTICLE VII, Trustee shall distribute only so much of the income of each separate trust, as in its sole discretion is necessary, for the proper health, education, maintenance, and support of Settlor’s brother or Settlor’s sister or, unless otherwise appointed by Settlor’s brother or Settlor’s sister pursuant to subsection (4) of this Section B, ARTICLE VII, per stirpes to the issue of that deceased brother or sister of Settlor. “(b) Principal. Until the time for termination and liquidation of a separate trust, as prescribed below in subsection (3) of this Section B, ARTICLE VII, Trustee shall distribute only so much of the principal from a separate trust, as in its sole discretion is necessary, for the proper health, education, maintenance, and support of Settlor’s brother or Settlor’s sister or, unless otherwise appointed by Settlor’s brother or Settlor’s sister pursuant to subsection (4) of this Section B, ARTICLE VII, for the proper health, education, maintenance, and support of the issue of Settlor’s brother or Settlor’s sister.” -3- On August 27, 2004, Robert passed away, and Alice was his only surviving sibling. Alice subsequently passed away on March 31, 2005, thereby leaving her daughter, Michelle, as trustee of the trust and executrix of Robert’s estate. Michelle was also the sole beneficiary under her mother’s last will and testament. Laura was survived by three children, Elizabeth Ferland, Charles Ferland, and Oscar Ferland. Robert’s other two sisters, Eugenia Stoutnar and Josephine Steinhof, died without issue. On September 18, 2006, the Steinhofs filed an action seeking a declaration, under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, G.L. 1956 § 9-30-1, that they be awarded a one-half share of the trust assets and that Michelle, as executrix of Robert’s estate, be ordered to reimburse the trust for the estate taxes that were charged against it. The Ferlands answered on October 30, 2006. On November 2, 2006, Michelle answered and counterclaimed seeking a declaration that she, the Steinhofs, and the Ferlands each be awarded a one-third share of the trust assets, and an order that a proportional share of estate taxes be paid out of the trust. Thereafter, Michelle and the Ferlands filed motions for summary judgment under Rule 56 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. The Steinhofs subsequently filed an objection and a cross-motion for summary judgment. The motion justice issued a written decision on July 27, 2007, granting plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment in part and denying it in part, and granting defendants’ motion for summary judgment in part and denying it in part. With respect to the division of the trust corpus, the motion justice granted plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment in part, dividing the trust into two equal shares, one share for the benefit of Alice Bouchard and one share for the Steinhofs. With respect to the apportionment of estate taxes, the motion justice granted summary judgment for defendants, declaring that a proportional share of federal and state estate taxes -4- would be paid out of the trust. Summary judgment was entered on August 29, 2007. Thereafter, the Ferlands and the Steinhofs cross-appealed. II Standard of Review In reviewing the Superior Court’s judgment on the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment, “we examine the matter de novo and apply the same standards as those used by the trial court.” Delta Airlines, Inc. v. Neary, 785 A.2d 1123, 1126 (R.I. 2001). “The hearing justice may grant the motion for summary judgment only if * * * he or she determines that ‘no issues of material fact appear and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law * * *.’” Estate of Giuliano v. Giuliano, 949 A.2d 386, 391 (R.I. 2008) (quoting Steinberg v. State, 427 A.2d 338, 340 (R.I. 1981)). Moreover, “in ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the [motion] justice must look for factual issues, not determine them.” Steinberg, 427 A.2d at 340. III Discussion A Division of Trust Assets The Ferlands contend that the motion justice should have granted summary judgment in their favor, rather than for the Steinhofs, because the trust should be construed to divide the trust corpus into three equal shares: one for Alice, one for Edward’s heirs, and one for Laura’s heirs. More specifically, the Ferlands assert that Article VII, Section B of the trust is unambiguous on its face, and thus it was improper for the motion justice to look to other provisions of the trust to ascertain Robert’s intent. The Ferlands also assert that the motion justice incorrectly relied on the absence of any specific reference to Laura in the trust. Such reliance was improper, -5- according to the Ferlands, because the provisions that specifically name Edward and Alice refer to a power of appointment and an interest for Robert’s living siblings, neither of which could have applied to Laura, who was deceased at the time the trust was drafted. Michelle and the Steinhofs counter that the motion justice did not err in granting summary judgment for the Steinhofs because construction of the trust requires its division into two equal shares: one for Alice and one for Edward’s heirs. Specifically, the Steinhofs argue that the trust and the 1999 amendment clearly reflect Robert’s intention for the trust to benefit only Edward, Alice, and their issue. To support their position, the Steinhofs note that every reference in Article VII is to Robert’s brother or sister in the singular, that the trust as a whole never refers to his brothers or sisters in the plural, and that the trust does not refer to any of Robert’s siblings by name other than Edward and Alice. This Court’s “primary objective when construing language in a will or trust is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the testator or settlor as long as that intent is not contrary to law.” Fleet National Bank v. Hunt, 944 A.2d 846, 851 (R.I. 2008) (quoting In re DiBiasio, 705 A.2d 972, 973 (R.I. 1998)). To ascertain the settlor’s intent, donative language should be interpreted with reference to the whole trust. See Chile v. Beck, 452 A.2d 626, 628 (R.I. 1982) (noting that a phrase contained in a will should not be viewed “in a vacuum,” but rather should be read in light of the rest of the will). 3 Moreover, the words of a trust should be “given their primary, ordinary, and common meaning unless it plainly [appears] that they were used in some other sense.” Hunt v. Citizens Trust Co., 519 A.2d 1120, 1122 (R.I. 1987) (quoting Prince v. Roberts, 436 A.2d 1078, 1081 (R.I. 1981)). 3 Here, the rules for the construction of wills are equally applicable to the construction of trusts. See, e.g., Fleet National Bank v. Hunt, 944 A.2d 846, 851 (R.I. 2008). -6- If the language of a trust or a will “expressly states the [settlor or] testator’s intention, resort to the rules of * * * construction is without warrant; it is when the language under consideration is susceptible of being read as disclosing alternate or contrary intentions that the rules of construction properly may be invoked.” In re DiBiasio, 705 A.2d at 973-74 (quoting Goldstein v. Goldstein, 104 R.I. 284, 287, 243 A.2d 914, 916 (1968)). Therefore, our rules of construction should be used only when the meaning of a trust is not apparent from the plain and ordinary meaning of its language or, in other words, when it is ambiguous. Furthermore, when donative intent cannot be determined from within the four corners of a will or a trust, resort to extrinsic evidence may be proper. See Hayden v. Hayden, 925 A.2d 947, 951 (R.I. 2007) (quoting Greater Providence Chapter, R.I. Association of Retarded Citizens v. John E. Fogarty Foundation for the Mentally Retarded, 488 A.2d 1228, 1229 (R.I. 1985) (noting that when determining intent, “this Court adheres to the principle that, when that intent can be determined ‘from within the four corners of the will, resort to extrinsic evidence is unnecessary and improper’”)). This Court has held that “[a]mbiguous language in a will or a trust presents the trial justice with a mixed question of law and fact * * *.” In re DiBiasio, 705 A.2d at 974. In granting summary judgment for Michelle and the Steinhofs, the motion justice summarized the legal standard for the construction of trusts. She also concluded that, “[a]fter reviewing the trust document in its entirety, it is clear that Robert intended to provide for only Edward J. Steinhof and Alice Bouchard and their issue.” Although the motion justice did not explicitly state that she found the trust unambiguous, the motion justice could not have granted the motion for summary judgment in the absence of such a determination. Summary judgment may only be granted when the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and a trust must be unambiguous to -7- construe it as a matter of law. The motion justice in granting summary judgment, therefore, necessarily determined that the trust was unambiguous. It is clear to us, however, that the trust contains ambiguities that cannot be resolved by rules of construction; therefore, it may be necessary to resort to the introduction of extrinsic evidence to ascertain Robert’s intention for the final distribution of the trust corpus, as reflected in the wording of Article VII, Section B of the trust. See Prince, 436 A.2d at 1081 (noting that the trust provision’s patent and latent ambiguities required the introduction of extrinsic evidence for resolution). The trust provision at issue, again, states in pertinent part: “Section B. Family Trusts. “(1) Establishment. The rest, residue, and remainder of the Trust Estate shall be divided to provide (a) one equal share for Settlor’s brother and Settlor’s sister, each to be held as a separate trust for Settlor’s brother’s and Settlor’s sister’s benefit under subsection (2) of this Section B of this ARTICLE VII, and (b) one equal share for the then living issue, collectively, of each then deceased brother or sister of Settlor, to be administered for the benefit of those issue pursuant to subsection (2) of Section B of this ARTICLE VII. In the event Settlor’s brother or Settlor’s sister shall predecease Settlor with no surviving issue, such deceased brother’s or sister’s share shall be distributed equally amongst the then remaining shares established hereunder.” (Emphasis added.) In our opinion, the word “sister” as used throughout the trust created an ambiguity, because it is unclear whether the word was intended to be interpreted broadly to incorporate its plural form. The ambiguity becomes apparent when considering the application of the terms, because Robert had two sisters with issue to whom Robert could have been referring. Namely, at the time of the trust’s creation, Robert had two living siblings, Edward and Alice, and one deceased sister with issue, Laura. It was possible, at that time, that Robert could have predeceased both Edward and Alice. If he had, Edward and Alice each would have received one -8- half of one share of the trust under subsection (1)(a) of Article VII, Section B, and subsection (1)(b) would have either created a share for the Ferlands, under the Ferlands’ reading of the text, or it would have been rendered inoperative, under the Steinhofs’ reading. Therefore, under a reading of the trust that gives every clause effect, it could be possible that Robert intended to provide for the Ferlands. See generally Lewis v. Douglass, 14 R.I. 604 (1884) (construing a will to give effect to each clause). In contrast, an alternative reading of the trust may suggest that Robert intentionally omitted the Ferlands. Specifically, the plain and ordinary meaning of the word “sister” denotes a single sister, and some uses of the word “sister” within the trust further suggest that the term was not intended to incorporate the plural form of the word. 4 We do not highlight these arguments to suggest that any one of them is dispositive in construing the trust, but rather to suggest that when both parties’ arguments are scrutinized it is clear that the trust contains ambiguities that cannot be resolved without introducing extrinsic evidence. Given the ambiguous nature of the trust, we conclude that questions of material fact exist that were not appropriate for summary disposition. Cf. D.T.P., Inc. v. Red Bridge Properties, Inc., 576 A.2d 1377, 1381 (R.I. 1990) (noting that “summary judgment may not be proper when the case involves an ambiguous contract because the ambiguity creates a question of fact”). At oral argument, it became apparent that there are additional material facts that have not been established in the record. The record contains no affidavits attesting to the relationship between Robert and his nieces, nephews, sisters, or brother, the drafting attorney’s understanding 4 Interestingly, Robert included the following language in Article IX of his trust: “For convenience, I refer to my fiduciaries in the singular and neuter gender, and any reference to my fiduciaries shall include the masculine and feminine and plural of them * * *.” He did not, however, include a similar disclosure regarding the use of the word “sister.” -9- of Robert’s intention, or other elucidating facts. See Doar v. Doar, 63 R.I. 18, 23, 6 A.2d 738, 740 (1939) (noting that a will should be construed with “reference to the whole will, to the subject matter relative to which it speaks, and to the circumstances existing at the time of the execution of the will respecting the testator’s family and estate”). Thus, we believe that material issues of fact remain to be established at trial, and we remand this case for trial. B The Assignment of Estate Tax Liability The Steinhofs aver, with respect to the second issue on appeal, that the motion justice erred in granting summary judgment for defendants, thereby apportioning any taxes due between the trust and the residuary estate. The Steinhofs contend that the trust clearly states that all taxes were to be paid entirely by Robert’s estate, unless the taxes exceeded the liquid assets of the estate. The Steinhofs further contend that the motion justice incorrectly concluded that the tax allocation provision in the 2003 will modified the tax assignment provision of the trust, because, under Rhode Island law, the terms of a will cannot modify an inter vivos trust. Here, according to the Steinhofs, the trust reserved powers for its modification, but no such power was reserved to modify the trust by the 2003 will. Moreover, the Steinhofs argue that the language of the 2003 will is ambiguous in providing for tax apportionment because it refers to “other property,” and not to the trust by name. Michelle argues that the motion justice did not err in apportioning taxes between the probate estate and the trust estate, and she disagrees with the Steinhofs about the appropriate analysis in which this Court should engage. She argues that the issue is not whether the trust can be modified by the 2003 will, but rather whether the 2003 will contains language opting out of the default tax apportionment rule, as required by the Uniform Estate Tax Apportionment Act, - 10 - G.L. 1956 chapter 23.1 of title 44 (UETAA). According to Michelle, the UETAA provides that, unless a will states otherwise, taxes are to be apportioned among all persons interested in the estate, with “estate” defined to include trust assets. Therefore, Michelle contends that only explicit language in a will can override the statutory presumption of apportionment between taxes due on trust assets and probate assets passing under a will. The Ferlands did not address the issue of tax apportionment on appeal. Rhode Island has adopted the UETAA. Section 44-23.l-2 states: “Unless the will provides, the tax is apportioned among all persons interested in the estate. The apportionment is made in the proportion that the value of the interest of each person interested in the estate bears to the total value of the interests of all persons interested in the estate. The values used in determining the tax are used for that purpose.” “When interpreting a statute, our ultimate goal is to give effect to the General Assembly’s intent. * * * The best evidence of such intent can be found in the plain language used in the statute. Thus, a clear and unambiguous statute will be literally construed.” State v. Germane, 971 A.2d 555, 574 (R.I. 2009) (quoting Martone v. Johnston School Committee, 824 A.2d 426, 431 (R.I. 2003)). In addition, § 44-23.1-9 of the UETAA states that, “[t]his chapter shall be applied and construed as to effectuate its general purpose to make uniform the law with respect to the subject of this chapter among those states, which enact it.” The plain language of the UETAA clearly requires the apportionment of state and federal estate taxes among all persons interested in the estate, unless the will otherwise provides. Other states agree, in interpreting their statutes modeled after the UETAA, that the statutes are mandatory in nature, thus requiring apportionment unless a testator directs otherwise in his or her will. See, e.g., Bushee v. Bushee, 303 N.W.2d 320, 322 (N.D. 1981) (“The estate taxes will be paid according to the apportionment statute unless the decedent’s will directs in clear and - 11 - unambiguous language a method of apportionment different from that provided by the statute.”); In re Estate of Hilliar, 498 P.2d 1237, 1239 (Wyo. 1972) (“[A] directive against apportionment should be expressed in clear and unambiguous language.”); see also 42 Am. Jur. 2d Inheritance, Estate, and Gift Taxes § 312 (2000) (“[I]n the absence of a clear and unambiguous direction to the contrary in a will, apportionment of estate taxes pursuant to statute will be directed, and if there is any doubt as to what the decedent intended, the statutory direction to apportion is absolute.”). The controlling will 5 —the 2003 will—does not direct against apportionment, but to the contrary, the introductory paragraphs of the 2003 will state: “FIRST: I direct my Executrix hereinafter named to pay all of my just debts and funeral expenses as soon after my death as practicable. “I direct my said Executrix to pay out of the principal of my residuary estate as hereinafter given, devised and bequeathed, any and all estate, inheritance, succession, legacy, transfer or similar death taxes, including any interest or penalties thereon, which may be levied or assessed in respect to any property or interest therein passing under this my Last Will and Testament or any Codicil thereto. “I specifically direct that such taxes which shall become due and payable in respect to any other property required to be included in my gross estate for the purpose of computation of such taxes shall be apportioned against, and paid out of, such other property[.]” Thus, in the 2003 will, Robert assigns tax liability consistent with the UETAA’s default rule, directing that taxes arising from “any other property” included in his gross estate for the purpose of tax computation must be apportioned against and paid out of that property. The trust 5 Although it is undisputed that the 1994 will was revoked in 2003, when Robert executed his 2003 will, we note that Robert’s 1994 will also contained a provision providing for apportionment. This language was reaffirmed in the 1999 amendment. - 12 - certainly falls under the umbrella of “any other property” included in his gross estate, and, as such, the taxes must be apportioned against and paid out of the trust. In short, the will clearly and unequivocally adopts the UETAA’s presumptive estate tax apportionment rule. When, as is the case here, a will provides for the assignment and payment of tax liability, the will controls the tax assignment of the decedent’s estate. See § 44-23.1-2 (providing for tax apportionment “[u]nless the will provides”). The Steinhofs’ argument that the tax obligation should be the liability of the trust rather than the will is without merit. The Steinhofs contend that the only issue here is whether the 2003 will amended or modified the trust.6 The UETAA, however, clearly states that the only language 6 Specifically, the Steinhofs direct our attention to the following provisions of the trust specifying the reserved rights to alter, modify, or amend the trust and addressing tax liability: “ARTICLE III “RIGHTS AND POWERS RESERVED “I hereby reserve the following rights and powers, to be exercised by me at any time, and from time to time, by delivery to Trustee of a written, signed, and acknowledged statement subscribed to by two witnesses, setting forth my intention: “* * * “(3) To alter, modify, or amend this Declaration of Trust in any particular or general respect, provided that the duties and responsibilities of a Trustee other than myself shall not be permitted to be changed without the Trustee’s approval[.]” “ARTICLE IV “POST-DEATH MANAGEMENT “* * * “Section C. Taxes, Tax Allocation. Trustee shall pay to the Personal Representative of my estate, as a cost or expense of administration of my estate, such amounts as are certified in writing by my Personal Representative as due for estate, death, inheritance, transfer, income, and excise taxes (specifically - 13 - that can override the statutory apportionment is that of a will. The parties have provided us with no support for the proposition that a tax provision in an inter vivos trust defeats apportionment provided for in a will. The inquiry, therefore, hinges on the mandatory directive of the UETAA, § 44-23.1-2, and does not depend, as the Steinhofs assert, on whether the will modified or revoked the trust in part. Where, as is the case here, the tax allocation clause of a trust conflicts with the clear language of a will, the language of the will controls and estate taxes should be apportioned and paid in accordance with the will. IV Conclusion For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate in part the summary judgment of the Superior Court as to the division of the trust corpus and affirm in part the summary judgment of the Superior Court as to the apportionment of tax liability. The record shall be remanded to the Superior Court for proceedings consistent with this opinion. excluding generation-skipping taxes), including interest and penalties thereon, if any, which are payable to any state taxing authority or the United States, and which exceed the liquid assets of my estate subject to administration by my Personal Representative.” - 14 - Supreme Court No. 2008-136-Appeal.

More specifically, the Ferlands assert that Article VII, Section B of the trust is unambiguous on its face, and thus it was improper for the motion justice to look to other provisions of the trust to ascertain Robert’s intent. The Ferlands also assert that the motion justice incorrectly relied on the absence of any specific reference to Laura in the trust.', 'Such reliance was improper,', '-5- according to the Ferlands, because the provisions that specifically name Edward and Alice refer to a power of appointment and an interest for Robert’s living siblings, neither of which could have applied to Laura, who was deceased at the time the trust was drafted.', 'Michelle and the Steinhofs counter that the motion justice did not err in granting summary judgment for the Steinhofs because construction of the trust requires its division into two equal shares: one for Alice and one for Edward’s heirs. Specifically, the Steinhofs argue that the trust and the 1999 amendment clearly reflect Robert’s intention for the trust to benefit only Edward, Alice, and their issue. To support their position, the Steinhofs note that every reference in Article VII is to Robert’s brother or sister in the singular, that the trust as a whole never refers to his brothers or sisters in the plural, and that the trust does not refer to any of Robert’s siblings by name other than Edward and Alice.', 'This Court’s “primary objective when construing language in a will or trust is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the testator or settlor as long as that intent is not contrary to law.” Fleet National Bank v. Hunt, 944 A.2d 846, 851 (R.I. 2008) (quoting In re DiBiasio, 705 A.2d 972, 973 (R.I. 1998)). To ascertain the settlor’s intent, donative language should be interpreted with reference to the whole trust. See Chile v. Beck, 452 A.2d 626, 628 (R.I. 1982) (noting that a phrase contained in a will should not be viewed “in a vacuum,” but rather should be read in light of the rest of the will). 3 Moreover, the words of a trust should be “given their primary, ordinary, and common meaning unless it plainly [appears] that they were used in some other sense.” Hunt v. Citizens Trust Co., 519 A.2d 1120, 1122 (R.I. 1987) (quoting Prince v. Roberts, 436 A.2d 1078, 1081 (R.I. 1981)). 3', 'Here, the rules for the construction of wills are equally applicable to the construction of trusts. See, e.g., Fleet National Bank v.

Goldstein, 104 R.I. 284, 287, 243 A.2d 914, 916 (1968)). Therefore, our rules of construction should be used only when the meaning of a trust is not apparent from the plain and ordinary meaning of its language or, in other words, when it is ambiguous. Furthermore, when donative intent cannot be determined from within the four corners of a will or a trust, resort to extrinsic evidence may be proper. See Hayden v. Hayden, 925 A.2d 947, 951 (R.I. 2007) (quoting Greater Providence Chapter, R.I. Association of Retarded Citizens v. John E. Fogarty Foundation for the Mentally Retarded, 488 A.2d 1228, 1229 (R.I. 1985) (noting that when determining intent, “this Court adheres to the principle that, when that intent can be determined ‘from within the four corners of the will, resort to extrinsic evidence is unnecessary and improper’”)).', 'This Court has held that “[a]mbiguous language in a will or a trust presents the trial justice with a mixed question of law and fact * * *.” In re DiBiasio, 705 A.2d at 974. In granting summary judgment for Michelle and the Steinhofs, the motion justice summarized the legal standard for the construction of trusts. She also concluded that, “[a]fter reviewing the trust document in its entirety, it is clear that Robert intended to provide for only Edward J. Steinhof and Alice Bouchard and their issue.” Although the motion justice did not explicitly state that she found the trust unambiguous, the motion justice could not have granted the motion for summary judgment in the absence of such a determination. Summary judgment may only be granted when the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and a trust must be unambiguous to', '-7- construe it as a matter of law. The motion justice in granting summary judgment, therefore, necessarily determined that the trust was unambiguous.', 'It is clear to us, however, that the trust contains ambiguities that cannot be resolved by rules of construction; therefore, it may be necessary to resort to the introduction of extrinsic evidence to ascertain Robert’s intention for the final distribution of the trust corpus, as reflected in the wording of Article VII, Section B of the trust.

The ambiguity becomes apparent when considering the application of the terms, because Robert had two sisters with issue to whom Robert could have been referring. Namely, at the time of the trust’s creation, Robert had two living siblings, Edward and Alice, and one deceased sister with issue, Laura.', 'It was possible, at that time, that Robert could have predeceased both Edward and Alice. If he had, Edward and Alice each would have received one', '-8- half of one share of the trust under subsection (1)(a) of Article VII, Section B, and subsection (1)(b) would have either created a share for the Ferlands, under the Ferlands’ reading of the text, or it would have been rendered inoperative, under the Steinhofs’ reading. Therefore, under a reading of the trust that gives every clause effect, it could be possible that Robert intended to provide for the Ferlands. See generally Lewis v. Douglass, 14 R.I. 604 (1884) (construing a will to give effect to each clause).', 'In contrast, an alternative reading of the trust may suggest that Robert intentionally omitted the Ferlands. Specifically, the plain and ordinary meaning of the word “sister” denotes a single sister, and some uses of the word “sister” within the trust further suggest that the term was not intended to incorporate the plural form of the word. 4', 'We do not highlight these arguments to suggest that any one of them is dispositive in construing the trust, but rather to suggest that when both parties’ arguments are scrutinized it is clear that the trust contains ambiguities that cannot be resolved without introducing extrinsic evidence. Given the ambiguous nature of the trust, we conclude that questions of material fact exist that were not appropriate for summary disposition. Cf. D.T.P., Inc. v. Red Bridge Properties, Inc., 576 A.2d 1377, 1381 (R.I. 1990) (noting that “summary judgment may not be proper when the case involves an ambiguous contract because the ambiguity creates a question of fact”).', 'At oral argument, it became apparent that there are additional material facts that have not been established in the record. The record contains no affidavits attesting to the relationship between Robert and his nieces, nephews, sisters, or brother, the drafting attorney’s understanding 4', 'Interestingly, Robert included the following language in Article IX of his trust: “For convenience, I refer to my fiduciaries in the singular and neuter gender, and any reference to my fiduciaries shall include the masculine and feminine and plural of them * * *.” He did not, however, include a similar disclosure regarding the use of the word “sister.”', '-9- of Robert’s intention, or other elucidating facts. See Doar v. Doar, 63 R.I. 18, 23, 6 A.2d 738, 740 (1939) (noting that a will should be construed with “reference to the whole will, to the subject matter relative to which it speaks, and to the circumstances existing at the time of the execution of the will respecting the testator’s family and estate”). Thus, we believe that material issues of fact remain to be established at trial, and we remand this case for trial.', 'B', 'The Assignment of Estate Tax Liability', 'The Steinhofs aver, with respect to the second issue on appeal, that the motion justice erred in granting summary judgment for defendants, thereby apportioning any taxes due between the trust and the residuary estate. The Steinhofs contend that the trust clearly states that all taxes were to be paid entirely by Robert’s estate, unless the taxes exceeded the liquid assets of the estate. The Steinhofs further contend that the motion justice incorrectly concluded that the tax allocation provision in the 2003 will modified the tax assignment provision of the trust, because, under Rhode Island law, the terms of a will cannot modify an inter vivos trust. Here, according to the Steinhofs, the trust reserved powers for its modification, but no such power was reserved to modify the trust by the 2003 will. Moreover, the Steinhofs argue that the language of the 2003 will is ambiguous in providing for tax apportionment because it refers to “other property,” and not to the trust by name.', 'Michelle argues that the motion justice did not err in apportioning taxes between the probate estate and the trust estate, and she disagrees with the Steinhofs about the appropriate analysis in which this Court should engage. She argues that the issue is not whether the trust can be modified by the 2003 will, but rather whether the 2003 will contains language opting out of the default tax apportionment rule, as required by the Uniform Estate Tax Apportionment Act,', '- 10 - G.L. 1956 chapter 23.1 of title 44 (UETAA). According to Michelle, the UETAA provides that, unless a will states otherwise, taxes are to be apportioned among all persons interested in the estate, with “estate” defined to include trust assets. Therefore, Michelle contends that only explicit language in a will can override the statutory presumption of apportionment between taxes due on trust assets and probate assets passing under a will. The Ferlands did not address the issue of tax apportionment on appeal.', 'Rhode Island has adopted the UETAA. Section 44-23.l-2 states:', '“Unless the will provides, the tax is apportioned among all persons', 'interested in the estate. The apportionment is made in the', 'proportion that the value of the interest of each person interested in', 'the estate bears to the total value of the interests of all persons', 'interested in the estate. The values used in determining the tax are', 'used for that purpose.”', '“When interpreting a statute, our ultimate goal is to give effect to the General Assembly’s intent. * * * The best evidence of such intent can be found in the plain language used in the statute.', 'Thus, a clear and unambiguous statute will be literally construed.” State v. Germane, 971 A.2d 555, 574 (R.I. 2009) (quoting Martone v. Johnston School Committee, 824 A.2d 426, 431 (R.I. 2003)). In addition, § 44-23.1-9 of the UETAA states that, “[t]his chapter shall be applied and construed as to effectuate its general purpose to make uniform the law with respect to the subject of this chapter among those states, which enact it.”', 'The plain language of the UETAA clearly requires the apportionment of state and federal estate taxes among all persons interested in the estate, unless the will otherwise provides. Other states agree, in interpreting their statutes modeled after the UETAA, that the statutes are mandatory in nature, thus requiring apportionment unless a testator directs otherwise in his or her will. See, e.g., Bushee v. Bushee, 303 N.W.2d 320, 322 (N.D. 1981) (“The estate taxes will be paid according to the apportionment statute unless the decedent’s will directs in clear and', '- 11 - unambiguous language a method of apportionment different from that provided by the statute.”); In re Estate of Hilliar, 498 P.2d 1237, 1239 (Wyo. 1972) (“[A] directive against apportionment should be expressed in clear and unambiguous language.”); see also 42 Am. Jur. 2d Inheritance, Estate, and Gift Taxes § 312 (2000) (“[I]n the absence of a clear and unambiguous direction to the contrary in a will, apportionment of estate taxes pursuant to statute will be directed, and if there is any doubt as to what the decedent intended, the statutory direction to apportion is absolute.”).', 'The controlling will 5 —the 2003 will—does not direct against apportionment, but to the contrary, the introductory paragraphs of the 2003 will state:', '“FIRST: I direct my Executrix hereinafter named to pay all', 'of my just debts and funeral expenses as soon after my death as', 'practicable.', '“I direct my said Executrix to pay out of the principal of', 'my residuary estate as hereinafter given, devised and bequeathed,', 'any and all estate, inheritance, succession, legacy, transfer or', 'similar death taxes, including any interest or penalties thereon,', 'which may be levied or assessed in respect to any property or', 'interest therein passing under this my Last Will and Testament or', 'any Codicil thereto.', '“I specifically direct that such taxes which shall become', 'due and payable in respect to any other property required to be', 'included in my gross estate for the purpose of computation of such', 'taxes shall be apportioned against, and paid out of, such other', 'property[.]”', 'Thus, in the 2003 will, Robert assigns tax liability consistent with the UETAA’s default rule, directing that taxes arising from “any other property” included in his gross estate for the purpose of tax computation must be apportioned against and paid out of that property. The trust 5', 'Although it is undisputed that the 1994 will was revoked in 2003, when Robert executed his 2003 will, we note that Robert’s 1994 will also contained a provision providing for apportionment. This language was reaffirmed in the 1999 amendment.', '- 12 - certainly falls under the umbrella of “any other property” included in his gross estate, and, as such, the taxes must be apportioned against and paid out of the trust. In short, the will clearly and unequivocally adopts the UETAA’s presumptive estate tax apportionment rule. When, as is the case here, a will provides for the assignment and payment of tax liability, the will controls the tax assignment of the decedent’s estate. See § 44-23.1-2 (providing for tax apportionment “[u]nless the will provides”).', 'The Steinhofs’ argument that the tax obligation should be the liability of the trust rather than the will is without merit. The Steinhofs contend that the only issue here is whether the 2003 will amended or modified the trust.6 The UETAA, however, clearly states that the only language 6', 'Specifically, the Steinhofs direct our attention to the following provisions of the trust specifying the reserved rights to alter, modify, or amend the trust and addressing tax liability:', '“ARTICLE III', '“RIGHTS AND POWERS RESERVED', '“I hereby reserve the following rights and powers, to be', 'exercised by me at any time, and from time to time, by delivery to', 'Trustee of a written, signed, and acknowledged statement', 'subscribed to by two witnesses, setting forth my intention:', '“* * *', '“(3) To alter, modify, or amend this Declaration of Trust in', 'any particular or general respect, provided that the duties and', 'responsibilities of a Trustee other than myself shall not be', 'permitted to be changed without the Trustee’s approval[.]”', '“ARTICLE IV', '“POST-DEATH MANAGEMENT', '“* * *', '“Section C.

The parties have provided us with no support for the proposition that a tax provision in an inter vivos trust defeats apportionment provided for in a will. The inquiry, therefore, hinges on the mandatory directive of the UETAA, § 44-23.1-2, and does not depend, as the Steinhofs assert, on whether the will modified or revoked the trust in part.

47,"Kathryn Manning et al. : v. : Peter J. Bellafiore, M.D. : Present: Suttell, C.J., Flaherty, and Robinson, JJ. OPINION Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The defendant, Peter J. Bellafiore, M.D., appeals from a Superior Court order granting the motion for a new trial sought by the plaintiff, Kathryn Manning. 1 This wrongful death and medical malpractice action arises out of the tragic and premature death of Michael Manning. After a lengthy trial, a jury found in favor of Dr. Bellafiore. The trial justice granted the plaintiff’s motion for a new trial, both as a sanction for what he considered Dr. Bellafiore’s “flagrant discovery abuse[s]” and because he found the jury’s verdict to be against the fair preponderance of the evidence. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Superior Court. I Facts and Travel 2 On March 4, 1998, Kathryn Manning’s husband fell in his bathroom after losing consciousness. At the time, Mr. Manning was forty years old and the father of four young 1 Mrs. Manning brought suit individually and in her capacity as administratrix of the estate of Michael Manning, and on behalf of her four minor children. 2 Our review of the record indicates that the various expert witnesses may have used different medical terminology to describe the same or similar clinical procedures. Our recitation of the facts attempts to relate as accurately as possible those facts pertinent to this appeal. We recognize, however, that in so doing we may have used medical terminology inartfully. -1- children. When his wife found him, Mr. Manning was unable to sit up or open his eyes, and he had a mild facial droop on his right side. He was taken to South County Hospital where he was treated by emergency-room personnel. An initial computerized tomography (CT) scan revealed normal blood flow. Doctor Bellafiore, a neurologist who was on call at South County Hospital, examined Mr. Manning several hours after his admission to the emergency room. By that time, Mr. Manning’s condition had improved somewhat, and Dr. Bellafiore contacted Donald McNiece, M.D., Mr. Manning’s primary-care physician, to obtain his medical history. Although Dr. McNiece was Mr. Manning’s admitting physician, he deferred to Dr. Bellafiore in providing Mr. Manning’s treatment. Doctor Bellafiore established a differential diagnosis for Mr. Manning, which is essentially a list of considered causes of a given symptom or symptoms. Among the sources of Mr. Manning’s symptoms contemplated by this differential diagnosis were complex migraine, aneurysm, tumor, and stroke. Doctor Bellafiore recommended that Mr. Manning undergo a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the circle of Willis 3 to determine whether Mr. Manning was suffering a stroke and, if so, to locate the blockage of blood flow to the brain. 4 Doctor Bellafiore also prescribed aspirin as an antiplatelet medication. 3 The circle of Willis is “a roughly circular anastomosis that is located at the base of the brain and formed by the anterior communicating artery, the two anterior cerebral, the two internal carotid, the two posterior communicating, and the two posterior cerebral arteries.” The American Heritage Medical Dictionary 158 (2007). 4 Both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) use magnetic fields and radio frequency waves to visualize anatomic structures. Stedman’s Medical Dictionary B13 (28th ed. 2006). An MRA simply uses special magnetic resonance sequences “that enhance the signal of flowing blood and suppress that from other tissues.” Stedman’s Medical Dictionary 86 (28th ed. 2006). According to Dr. McNiece, both an MRI and an MRA are noninvasive tests, the difference being “just the way the magnets spin.” -2- Mr. Manning first attempted to undergo an MRI/MRA the day he was admitted to South County Hospital. Unfortunately, he had a claustrophobic reaction and became nauseous while inside the closed MRI/MRA machine, and he was unable to complete the test. Doctor Bellafiore prescribed the antianxiety medication Ativan and the antinausea medication Compazine for Mr. Manning, but his second attempt to undergo an MRI/MRA later that same day also was unsuccessful. In the hope of mitigating Mr. Manning’s claustrophobia, Dr. Bellafiore attempted to arrange a so-called “open architecture MRI” for Mr. Manning to undergo at Rhode Island Hospital. Doctor Bellafiore’s efforts were frustrated because the MRI machine was being repaired. The radiologist at Rhode Island Hospital initially believed those repairs would be completed by the afternoon of March 5, 1998, but when he called back, Dr. Bellafiore learned that the open MRI machine would be down for repairs indefinitely. At 3 a.m. on March 6, 1998, Mr. Manning began complaining about a severe headache. He also began experiencing a visual impairment resembling a “white veil.” Doctor Bellafiore ordered a second CT scan to determine whether the loss of vision could be attributed to swelling in the brain, and the test results indicated “a new prominent segmental abnormality in the left occipital lobe[.]” This confirmed that Mr. Manning had suffered a stroke two days earlier, but the test did not show any increased cranial pressure. 5 At approximately 9 a.m. on March 7, 1998, Mr. Manning suffered a second, catastrophic stroke. Mr. Manning was airlifted to Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), where he was immediately treated by Christopher Putman, M.D. After examining the results of an advanced 5 Doctor Bellafiore conceded at trial that had he ordered a CT scan a day earlier on March 5, it would have revealed the same information. -3- CT scan, 6 Mr. Manning’s treatment team determined that he had likely suffered a stroke caused by a blockage in the basilar artery in his brain. Doctor Putman performed an angiogram and discovered that Mr. Manning’s left vertebral artery was almost completely blocked. He then used several microcatheter treatment balloons to partially expand the artery. Upon reaching the basilar artery, Dr. Putman discovered a clot, which he identified as the cause of the stroke. Doctor Putman attempted to break apart the clot using the clot-buster Urokinase; and, after that was only minimally effective, he inflated several balloons, which dislodged the clot. The clot traveled into another portion of Mr. Manning’s brain, and Dr. Putman determined that the risks of further treatment in this region were too great. Unfortunately, Mr. Manning steadily lost brain function and on March 9, 1998, life support was withdrawn and he died. Mrs. Manning filed a civil action against Drs. Bellafiore and McNiece, as well as South County Hospital, alleging negligence and wrongful death. After extensive discovery, trial began on January 4, 2004. At trial, plaintiff contended that the standard of care required Mr. Manning’s physicians to conduct an MRI/MRA examination within twenty-four hours of his first stroke. According to plaintiff, Dr. Bellafiore breached this standard of care by failing to accomplish the MRI/MRA examination promptly, and by failing to apprise Mr. Manning of alternative means to accomplish imaging, such as adequate sedation, after it became clear that Mr. Manning’s claustrophobia would otherwise prevent him from completing the test in a closed MRI/MRA machine. Moreover, plaintiff contended that if Dr. Bellafiore was unable to complete the MRI/MRA examination at South County Hospital, Mr. Manning should have been 6 In 1998, MGH had an advanced angiographic CT scan that allowed for imaging of the blood vessels in the head and neck by injecting radiographic dye into the veins. -4- transferred to a tertiary care hospital 7 that performed conventional cerebral angiograms. Additionally, plaintiff argued that Dr. Bellafiore breached the standard of care by failing to administer the clot-buster Heparin after Mr. Manning was admitted. A great deal of the testimony elicited at trial pertained to Dr. Bellafiore’s unsuccessful efforts to obtain an MRI/MRA test for Mr. Manning. 8 Doctor Bellafiore acknowledged that an MRI was an important diagnostic tool for ruling out possible causes of Mr. Manning’s symptoms, as well as for determining whether there was any damage to his brain tissue, which is an indication of an interruption of blood flow. Moreover, an MRA could pinpoint where in the arteries the damage had occurred, which is crucial for determining the cause of a stroke. Doctor Bellafiore testified that he was involved in the initial efforts to obtain a closed MRI/MRA on March 4, 1998, through the Rhode Island Medical Resonance Imaging Network. 9 He testified that after Mr. Manning could not overcome his claustrophobia, he presented Mr. Manning with two options to accomplish the closed MRI/MRA several times on both March 5 and March 6. First, he stated that he offered Mr. Manning additional Ativan “to make him a little sleepier to see if he could tolerate the test.” Additionally, Dr. Bellafiore testified that he offered his patient intravenous conscious sedation, which achieves a significantly deeper level of sedation. 10 He explained that Mr. Manning could accomplish the MRI/MRA examination by general anesthesia, but he testified that he did not present this option because he felt that the risks 7 Although the litigants never defined “tertiary care hospital,” this term generally refers to a major hospital that offers a full spectrum of medical services. 8 We restrict our recitation of the facts to those relevant to plaintiff’s claims against the sole appellant, Dr. Bellafiore. 9 South County Hospital was a participant in the Rhode Island Medical Resonance Imaging Network, which provided hospitals without in-house MRI/MRA machines the use of its portable MRI/MRA machine on certain scheduled days. 10 Conscious sedation must be administered by an anesthesiologist or other qualified provider. -5- outweighed the benefits. 11 Doctor Bellafiore vividly described Mr. Manning’s refusal of these options stating, “What he said to me – and I remember it, because I was struck by it. He told me, ‘I’m sorry, Doc.’ I remember it when people call me Doc. It just makes me feel like a doctor. ‘I know you need me to do this test to figure out what to do, but I just can’t do it.’ This was on the morning of the 5th after I told him all the things that could be possibly wrong. And I told him about conscious sedation. I told him about Ativan. I told him the open MRI may not give us the answer we need. I basically held – and told him he could have a stroke, he could have a tumor. I was holding a neurological gun to his head.” According to Dr. Bellafiore, after Mr. Manning refused to undergo a closed MRI/MRA, he had no choice but to recommend an open MRI, even though he considered a closed MRI/MRA to be the “best choice.” 12 Indeed, he testified that at that time he did not believe that an open MRI machine was sensitive enough to produce MRA-quality images of the blood vessels. 13 On a March 5, 1998 assessment and recommendation form, Dr. Bellafiore noted that Mr. Manning could undergo an “MRA as [an] outpatient.” At trial, he explained that such a test would have been performed at a later date in a closed MRI/MRA machine “if [Mr. Manning] would agree to * * * that.” Despite Dr. Bellafiore’s stated preference for the closed MRI/MRA examination, he characterized Mr. Manning’s purported choice to wait until the open MRI machine was operational as “a rational decision.” He did not document Mr. Manning’s alleged refusal to undergo a closed MRI/MRA examination in his treatment notes, nor did he document 11 General anesthesia is the deepest form of sedation. It renders the patient unconscious and must be performed by an anesthesiologist. 12 Significantly, Dr. McNiece testified that he had no knowledge of Mr. Manning having refused conscious sedation. 13 Doctor Bellafiore testified that some time after writing the open MRI order, he talked to a radiologist at Rhode Island Hospital who informed him that it was possible to “get some information from the [MRA] in the open machine.” Nevertheless, Dr. Bellafiore acknowledged at trial that he was aware that an MRA in an open machine would not produce as detailed an image of Mr. Manning’s brain as would an MRA in a closed machine. -6- his intention to order an open MRI for Mr. Manning. Doctor Bellafiore did, however, add the phrase “in an open architecture” to Dr. McNiece’s March 5, 1998 order for an “MRI head at Rhode Island Hospital.” He also testified that he did not seek the assistance of Mrs. Manning in his attempt to persuade her husband to undergo a closed MRI/MRA with conscious sedation until the evening of March 6, 1998. Doctor Bellafiore testified that Mrs. Manning also was unable to persuade Mr. Manning. Doctor Bellafiore testified that on March 6, 1998, he discussed an additional option for diagnosing Mr. Manning’s condition: a conventional catheter angiogram. 14 South County Hospital did not perform cerebral catheter angiograms in 1998, nor did it perform angioplasties. 15 He recounted explaining to Mr. Manning that an angiogram carried a 1 to 3 percent risk of “significant morbidity,” including clotting, bruising, infection, and, most seriously, stroke; and he further recalled strongly recommending that Mr. Manning undergo the open MRI examination instead. Doctor Bellafiore testified that, after considering the risks, Mr. Manning declined the angiogram because of a bad childhood experience. Dr. Bellafiore characterized this as an “informed, intelligent decision[].” Again, Dr. Bellafiore failed to document Mr. Manning’s refusal to undergo this procedure. Doctor Bellafiore testified that on the morning of March 7, 1998, he finally was able to persuade Mr. Manning to undergo a closed MRI/MRA examination with conscious sedation, but he was aware at that time that a machine would not be available through the network until March 9, 1998. 14 A conventional catheter angiogram is an invasive radiological procedure in which a dye is injected into the blood vessels to get an image of the affected area. Stedman’s Medical Dictionary 86 (28th ed. 2006). This procedure was acknowledged to be the “gold standard” for imaging by both Doctors McNiece and Bellafiore. 15 Angioplasty is a technique for dislodging an obstruction by inflating small balloons inside the blood vessel. Stedman’s Medical Dictionary 88 (28th ed. 2006). -7- The plaintiff vigorously disputed Dr. Bellafiore’s contention that he had frequently offered Mr. Manning conscious sedation as a means of completing the MRI/MRA examination and repeatedly pointed out that, in both his answers to interrogatories and his deposition testimony, Dr. Bellafiore had failed to mention offering this option. 16 For instance, in interrogatory No. 18, plaintiff asked Dr. Bellafiore to reveal “any and all conversations [he] had with any person concerning the care and/or treatment of Michael Manning * * *.” Doctor Bellafiore answered by first referring to an earlier response in which he did not mention conscious sedation and then directing plaintiff to the medical records generally. He also stated obliquely that he “spoke with [Mr. Manning] and his wife during his admission,” without revealing any of the substance of these conversations. Also, when asked in another interrogatory to list the available alternatives to an open MRI for a comparable evaluation of Mr. Manning, Dr. Bellafiore responded only that “[o]n March 5, 1998, after learning that the patient was unable to tolerate the MRI, I called the MRI Network of RI in an attempt to obtain an MRI in an open machine.” Similarly, Dr. Bellafiore failed to disclose at his deposition that he offered Mr. Manning conscious sedation. Indeed, the following colloquy occurred during Dr. Bellafiore’s deposition: “[Counsel]: Well, when you talked to [Mr. Manning] on the 5th in the morning you were asking him whether he’d undergo an MRI if he had more sedation, is that right? “[Dr. Bellafiore]: Right. “[Counsel]: Where was he going to undergo an MRI if he had more sedation? 16 During the trial, plaintiff moved for default judgment, alleging that Dr. Bellafiore deliberately withheld this crucial information during discovery. The trial justice initially reserved judgment on this motion. -8- “[Dr. Bellafiore]: In any closed machine that was available through the MRI network. “[Counsel]: And so what did you tell Mr. Manning about sedation? “[Dr. Bellafiore]: I said we could try giving him more Ativan to make him a little sleepier to see if he could tolerate the test.” When asked “[i]s there any reason why Mr. Manning couldn’t have been sedated with the assistance of anesthesiology on March 4th in order to accomplish the MRI?” Dr. Bellafiore eventually responded that “it’s a dangerous procedure to give someone general anesthesia or anesthetic who is having a potential stroke.” Doctor Bellafiore appeared to buttress this answer later in his deposition when asked, “[W]hat was the risk posed to Mr. Manning in particular if he had undergone sedation short of general anesthesia, what was the risk that his blood pressure would alter to an extent that would be life threatening?” He ultimately responded: “I don’t know a percentage number, but I would say that the chances are great enough that you would want to attempt the open MRI first.” Doctor Bellafiore testified that he “need[ed] to rely on [his] attorney to fill out” his answers to plaintiff’s interrogatories, and he attributed his seemingly incomplete deposition answers to “confusion in my mind at certain points” about the meaning of the term “sedation.” The jury also heard testimony from various expert witnesses. Doctor Putman devoted the majority of his testimony to detailing his care of Mr. Manning at MGH. At trial, Dr. Putman was shown enlarged pictures of the images taken while he performed Mr. Manning’s angiogram. In reviewing those images, Dr. Putman concluded that the clot that triggered Mr. Manning’s stroke was caused by a left arterial dissection rather than atherosclerosis. He also testified, however, that a patient in Mr. Manning’s specific circumstances treated at a tertiary care hospital according to the standard of care would have received imaging of the blood vessels in his brain -9- and neck on March 5, 1998. The imaging would have allowed Mr. Manning’s physicians to locate the blockage, and he believed angioplasty would have been highly successful at dislodging the obstruction. Such treatment, according to Dr. Putman, would have likely prevented Mr. Manning’s second devastating stroke. David Gelber, M.D., a neurologist and professor at Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, testified on behalf of plaintiff. Doctor Gelber stated that the standard of care required Dr. Bellafiore to administer the anticoagulant Heparin, which he testified was more effective than aspirin at breaking up blood clots. Doctor Gelber also testified that “good stroke management requires you to identify what the cause of the stroke was in order to best treat [it] and prevent the next one[.]” Doctor Gelber testified that Dr. Bellafiore’s treatment of Mr. Manning fell below the standard of care because he failed to get a definitive diagnosis by completing the MRI/MRA examination. He also testified that a conventional catheter angiogram would have been an effective alternative means of locating Mr. Manning’s stroke. He acknowledged the slight risk of an allergic reaction to the dye or the dislodging of plaque associated with conducting a conventional angiogram, but he said the need “to know what was going on” far outweighed the minimal risks. Doctor Gelber discounted the open MRI as an option for locating the cause of Mr. Manning’s stroke because it would not allow for a high- quality MRA image, and instead he characterized conscious sedation in a closed MRI/MRA machine as the best option. Moreover, he stated that transferring Mr. Manning by ambulance to another hospital with a closed MRI/MRA machine would have created no additional risk that would have outweighed the urgent need for imaging. He testified that with timely treatment, Mr. Manning’s long-term prognosis would have been good, with possible peripheral visual impairment as the only lasting consequence of his initial stroke. - 10 - Daniel Hanley, M.D., a neurologist at The Johns Hopkins Hospital, also testified on behalf of plaintiff. He first testified that Dr. Bellafiore’s initial differential diagnosis was appropriate. Doctor Hanley then went on to criticize Dr. Bellafiore for failing to obtain high- quality imaging of the vertebral basilar system within twenty-four hours of Mr. Manning’s admission. He stated that this test would have ruled out possible causes listed on the differential diagnosis, and he concluded that Dr. Bellafiore “[chose] the most benign of diagnoses and accept[ed] them without evidence.” He stated that Dr. Bellafiore could have obtained the image by an MRA, a CT scan angiogram, or a conventional cerebral angiogram, the latter of which he characterized as the “gold standard evaluation.” Under the standard of care, Dr. Hanley testified that a physician may persist in seeking an MRA, rather than pursuing other means of imaging, only “if [he or she is] able to obtain the [MRA] * * * within that 24-hour time period.” If the occlusion had been located, prompt treatment would have included administering the clot-buster Heparin, elevating the patient’s blood pressure, and performing an angioplasty to dislodge the obstruction. Instead, Dr. Bellafiore ordered an open MRI examination on March 5, 1998, which Dr. Hanley testified fell below the standard of care because it could not provide a sufficiently detailed image of the affected area to locate the cause of the blockage. Doctor Hanley also testified that a reasonably prudent doctor in Dr. Bellafiore’s position would have documented his efforts to convince a patient to undergo a closed MRI/MRA examination with the assistance of conscious sedation. Theodore Larson, III, M.D., an interventional neuroradiologist and professor at Vanderbilt University, was the first expert to testify on behalf of Dr. Bellafiore. He explained that 15 to 20 percent of patients have claustrophobic reactions in a closed MRI/MRA machine. Doctor Larson opined that Mr. Manning did not have a dissection of the left vertebral artery, but - 11 - rather his stroke was caused by vascular atherosclerotic disease. He indicated that the risk of a second stroke is higher with atherosclerotic disease because the plaque can break off and clot again. For this reason, he testified, transporting Mr. Manning would have been dangerous. He conceded, however, that if Mr. Manning had, in fact, suffered a dissection of the left vertebral artery, then there would have been no risk in transporting him. Doctor Larson also stated that “there is no data that suggests that [H]eparin is better than aspirin for treatment of lesions at the origin of the vertebral artery.” Finally, Dr. Larson admitted that he did not conclude that Mr. Manning had atherosclerosis in his vertebral artery when reviewing the medical records before his deposition. Rather, he arrived at this determination after observing the enlarged trial exhibits of the angiogram images that Dr. Putman took. Daryl Gress, M.D., a neurologist trained in stroke intervention, also testified on behalf of Dr. Bellafiore. He also attributed Mr. Manning’s stroke on March 4, 1998, to a buildup of atherosclerotic plaque. Doctor Gress testified that Dr. Bellafiore met the standard of care by obtaining a CT scan within twenty-four hours of admission and that no other test was necessary. He conceded that if it became clear that his patient’s stroke was caused by a dissection he would prescribe Heparin rather than aspirin. Moreover, he admitted that he would have strongly considered performing a conventional angiogram had no other method of imaging been available. Lawrence Wechsler, M.D., a neurologist at the University of Pittsburgh, was the final expert witness to testify on behalf of Dr. Bellafiore. Doctor Wechsler opined that Mr. Manning’s stroke was the result of a blockage in the vertebral artery caused by atherosclerotic plaque. He indicated that Dr. Bellafiore met the standard of care by prescribing aspirin. Doctor Wechsler testified that it would have made no difference if Mr. Manning had completed an MRI/MRA - 12 - examination because his treatment would have remained limited to antiplatelet treatment. Moreover, he stated that performing a conventional catheter angiogram would not have been appropriate because of the risks. On cross-examination, Dr. Wechsler conceded that he had not reviewed the angiogram images that Dr. Putman took, but he stated that he still disagreed with Dr. Putman’s determination that a dissection was the cause of Mr. Manning’s stroke. At the close of all the evidence, the jury returned a verdict in favor of all the defendants. The plaintiff filed a timely motion for judgment as a matter of law or, in the alternative, a new trial. The plaintiff argued that a new trial was justified both because Dr. Bellafiore had withheld vital information during the discovery process and also because the jury’s verdict was against the weight of the evidence. The trial justice issued a forty-four page ruling on plaintiff’s motions in which he extensively reviewed the evidence against Dr. Bellafiore. The trial justice explained that he had reserved judgment on plaintiff’s initial motion for default judgment because he believed at the time that the jury would not find credible Dr. Bellafiore’s testimony that he had discussed conscious sedation with Mr. Manning and that he had refused treatment. He further explained, “In the midst of a lengthy, hotly contested medical malpractice case, the failure to disclose such an important defense was not only critical, it left the court in the midst of a dilemma for which there was no just resolution (not to mention the disarray to the extensively prepared plaintiffs’ case). At trial, the Court suspected that the credibility of Dr. Bellafiore would be significantly lessened when such an obvious, pivotal fact was not disclosed in sworn answers. Apparently, the jury did not recognize the gravity of this flagrant discovery abuse. In hindsight, the injustice was never cured. The Court only precluded the fact finder in its quest for the truth, when its proper role was to accommodate the fact finder within the confines of the rules and fairness.” In comparing Dr. Bellafiore’s trial testimony with his earlier deposition and written disclosures, the trial justice concluded that the proper remedy was to order a new trial. He also found that a - 13 - new trial was justified because the jury’s verdict was against the fair preponderance of the evidence. 17 On appeal, Dr. Bellafiore argues that the trial justice abused his discretion in granting plaintiff’s motion for a new trial to sanction what the trial justice called Dr. Bellafiore’s “blatant discovery abuse.” Additionally, Dr. Bellafiore contends that the trial justice’s determination that the jury’s verdict was against the weight of the evidence was clearly wrong. II Standard of Review “The role of a trial justice in considering a motion for a new trial is well-established.” Murray v. Bromley, 945 A.2d 330, 333 (R.I. 2008). “When ruling on a motion for a new trial, the trial justice acts as a ‘superjuror’ and ‘should review the evidence and exercise his or her independent judgment in passing upon the weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses.’” Seddon v. Duke, 884 A.2d 413, 413 (R.I. 2005) (mem.) (quoting Franco v. Latina, 840 A.2d 1110, 1111 (R.I. 2004)). “In carrying out the function of ‘superjuror,’ the trial justice should adhere to the following principles: ‘The trial justice may accept some or all of the evidence. [He or she] may reject evidence that is impeached or contradicted by other positive testimony or circumstantial evidence. Or [he or she] may disregard testimony that contains inherent improbabilities or contradictions or which is totally at variance with undisputed physical facts or laws. [He or she] may also add to the evidence by drawing proper inferences.’” Murray, 945 A.2d at 333 (quoting Candido v. University of Rhode Island, 880 A.2d 853, 856 (R.I. 2005)). “The trial justice should allow the verdict to stand if he or she ‘determines that the evidence is evenly balanced or is such that reasonable minds, in considering that same evidence, could come 17 The trial justice, reviewing the testimony, also determined that a reasonable jury could have found in favor of Dr. McNiece and South County Hospital. Accordingly, he denied plaintiff’s motion for a new trial against those parties. - 14 - to different conclusions * * *.’” Seddon, 884 A.2d at 413-14 (quoting Franco, 840 A.2d at 1111). “A trial justice may set aside a verdict ‘when [his or her] judgment tells [him or her] that it is wrong because it fails to respond truly to the merits of the controversy and to administer substantial justice and is against the fair preponderance of the evidence.’” Murray, 945 A.2d at 333 (quoting Candido, 880 A.2d at 856). “On appeal, ‘this Court will affirm a trial justice’s decision on a motion for a new trial as long as the trial justice conducts the appropriate analysis, does not overlook or misconceive material evidence, and is not otherwise clearly wrong.’” Murray, 945 A.2d at 334 (quoting Morrocco v. Piccardi, 674 A.2d 380, 382 (R.I. 1996)). “[W]hen we review a trial justice’s ruling on a motion for new trial, we afford it ‘great weight.’” Bajakian v. Erinakes, 880 A.2d 843, 851- 52 (R.I. 2005) (quoting Sarkisian v. NewPaper, Inc., 512 A.2d 831, 835 (R.I. 1986)). III Discussion In his decision granting plaintiff’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice provided a detailed summary of all the testimony elicited at trial. Moreover, he made specific credibility findings for many of the key expert witnesses. He observed that Dr. Putman was “honest and straightforward[,]” and “thorough in his work, capable, and impressive.” Moreover, after reviewing the testimony of Dr. Hanley, the trial justice found it to be “virtually impenetrable on cross-examination.” Observing that Dr. Hanley was “explanatory and logical” throughout his testimony, the trial justice found him credible. Taking the testimony of Doctors Gelber, Putman, and Hanley together, the trial justice found that they had established a standard of care for Mr. Manning’s treatment. The trial justice found that the standard of care required prompt imaging of the circle of Willis that would have identified the cause of Mr. Manning’s stroke. He further found that such - 15 - prompt imaging, either by an MRI/MRA or a conventional angiogram would have revealed the dissection in Mr. Manning’s left vertebral artery. The trial justice found that a timely diagnosis would have allowed for proper treatment, including Heparin, and a probable transfer to a different hospital so that the patient could undergo angioplasty. The trial justice was convinced that Dr. Bellafiore deviated from this standard of care by failing to obtain an MRI/MRA or conventional angiogram image within twenty-four hours of Mr. Manning’s admission. He also was persuaded that Dr. Bellafiore deviated from the standard of care by administering aspirin instead of Heparin. The trial justice determined that Dr. Bellafiore’s testimony “further and best supports the proposition that he failed to meet the standard of care.” The trial justice noted that Dr. Bellafiore agreed that Mr. Manning required prompt imaging when he was admitted on March 4, 1998. Further, Dr. Bellafiore conceded that South County Hospital did not perform angioplasties in 1998. Most crucially, the trial justice did not find credible Dr. Bellafiore’s testimony that he had offered Mr. Manning the option of conscious sedation to achieve the closed MRI/MRA examination. He noted that Dr. Bellafiore did not document these purported discussions in any of his medical records, nor did he disclose this seemingly essential fact during pretrial discovery despite myriad opportunities. The trial justice concluded that “the jury was significantly challenged in adopting Dr. Bellafiore’s interpretations of the facts.” The trial justice also reviewed the testimony of Dr. Bellafiore’s expert witnesses and found them less credible. Specifically, he characterized Dr. Larson’s assertion that Mr. Manning’s stroke was caused by atherosclerotic plaque buildup rather than a dissection to be “unconvincing.” He noted that Dr. Putman had testified in great detail that Mr. Manning’s stroke was caused by a dissection in his left vertebral artery and not atherosclerotic plaque. The trial - 16 - justice also found that Dr. Gress’s testimony was of little probative value because he refused to articulate a standard of care when discussing Mr. Manning’s treatment. Finally, the trial justice did not find Dr. Wechsler to be credible because he concluded that atherosclerosis was the cause of Mr. Manning’s stroke without ever reviewing the CT angiogram images. Moreover, the trial justice noted that Dr. Wechsler “rarely provid[ed] any basis for his opinions.” Doctor Bellafiore contends that the trial justice relied on several material misconceptions of the evidence that require reversal and reinstatement of the jury’s verdict. First, he argues that the trial justice erred by not making a specific credibility determination concerning Dr. Gelber. Additionally, Dr. Bellafiore avers that the trial justice mistakenly stated that Dr. Gelber testified that Mr. Manning was never definitively diagnosed with a stroke in the days after his admission. We do not discern any material error in the trial justice’s discussion of Dr. Gelber’s testimony. We first note that a trial justice need not make specific credibility determinations for every witness. See State v. Reyes, 984 A.2d 606, 618 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. Tate, 109 R.I. 586, 588-89, 288 A.2d 494, 496 (1972) (“we do not require trial justices to ‘literally tag the testimony of each witness as “credible” or “incredible”’”)). Nevertheless, it is clear from the trial justice’s decision that he viewed Dr. Gelber as credible and even went so far as to state that he relied on Dr. Gelber to determine the standard of care. Moreover, Dr. Gelber did indeed criticize Dr. Bellafiore’s failure to diagnose the cause of Mr. Manning’s stroke and noted that Dr. Bellafiore had failed to rule out alternate diagnoses until March 6, 1998. We therefore find no merit in Dr. Bellafiore’s argument that the trial justice’s discussion of Dr. Gelber’s testimony contained material errors. Next, Dr. Bellafiore contends that the trial justice erred by describing Dr. Hanley as a “neurosurgeon and neurologist” when he was, in fact, a neurologist. Although the trial justice - 17 - clearly mischaracterized Dr. Hanley’s field of medical expertise, we are well satisfied that the trial justice did not misconceive any material aspects of Dr. Hanley’s testimony. More significantly, Dr. Bellafiore argues that the trial justice erroneously accepted Dr. Hanley’s testimony that Dr. Bellafiore breached the standard of care by not discussing with Mrs. Manning the risks and benefits of the various imaging alternatives. A review of the trial justice’s decision in its entirety, however, demonstrates that he found the jury’s verdict flawed because (1) the expert testimony established that the appropriate standard of care required prompt imaging, and (2) Dr. Bellafiore’s testimony that he had discussed sedation alternatives with Mr. Manning himself was of questionable credibility because, among other things, the doctor could provide no documentation. We are satisfied, therefore, that any conversations Dr. Bellafiore may or may not have had with Mrs. Manning did not significantly contribute to the granting of a new trial. Doctor Bellafiore also criticizes the trial justice for mistakenly referring to Dr. Putman as “Dr. Putnam” and describing him as a “neuro-interventional radiologist” rather than an interventional neuro-radiologist. Additionally, Dr. Bellafiore notes that the trial justice favorably discussed Dr. Putman’s purported admission that he mistakenly believed Mr. Manning’s stroke was related to performing heavy lifting at work when, in fact, Dr. Putman denied making such a conclusion. Again, this error was not material to Dr. Putman’s core testimony about Mr. Manning’s treatment at MGH and the standard of care. Doctor Bellafiore also argues that the trial justice materially misconceived the evidence deduced from the expert witnesses for the defense. He notes that the trial justice seemingly erred in believing that Dr. Larson was involved in Mr. Manning’s care. Doctor Bellafiore also points out that the trial justice erroneously characterized Dr. Gress as a neuroradiologist rather than a - 18 - neurologist. We do not believe either of these misstatements by the trial justice is sufficient to require reversal of his new trial order. We have thoroughly reviewed the trial justice’s decision in its entirety and conclude that he adequately discharged his responsibility to “independently weigh, evaluate, and assess the credibility of the trial witnesses and evidence.” Wellborn v. Spurwink/Rhode Island, 873 A.2d 884, 887 (R.I. 2005) (quoting Graff v. Motta, 748 A.2d 249, 255 (R.I. 2000)). He began his analysis by acknowledging the plaintiff’s theories of the case, viz., that Dr. Bellafiore breached the standard of care by failing to obtain prompt medical imaging, failing to administer Heparin as a blood thinner, and failing to apprise Mr. Manning of the options available for accomplishing the imaging. After considering the voluminous evidence, determining the credibility of the witnesses, and weighing the testimony of the various expert witnesses, the trial justice found that “[t]he jury was confronted with substantial information which established that the standard of care for treatment of a potential stroke patient required prompt imaging.” He further found that the plaintiff had “established that prompt imaging did not occur.” Accordingly, he determined that the jury’s verdict concerning Dr. Bellafiore was against the fair preponderance of the evidence and failed to do justice or respond to the merits of the controversy. It is our conclusion that the trial justice conducted the appropriate analysis, did not overlook or misconceive material evidence, and was not otherwise clearly wrong. IV Conclusion For the reasons set forth in this opinion, the order of the Superior Court is affirmed and the papers of the case shall be returned to the Superior Court. Justice Goldberg did not participate. - 19 - Supreme Court No. 2005-320-Appeal. (WC 00-63) Kathryn Manning et al. : v. : Peter J. Bellafiore, M.D. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The defendant, Peter J. Bellafiore, M.D., appeals from a Superior Court order granting the motion for a new trial sought by the plaintiff, Kathryn Manning. 1 This wrongful death and medical malpractice action arises out of the tragic and premature death of Michael Manning. After a lengthy trial, a jury found in favor of Dr. Bellafiore. The trial justice granted the plaintiff’s motion for a new trial, both as a sanction for what he considered Dr. Bellafiore’s “flagrant discovery abuse[s]” and because he found the jury’s verdict to be against the fair preponderance of the evidence. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel 2', 'On March 4, 1998, Kathryn Manning’s husband fell in his bathroom after losing consciousness. At the time, Mr. Manning was forty years old and the father of four young 1', 'Mrs. Manning brought suit individually and in her capacity as administratrix of the estate of Michael Manning, and on behalf of her four minor children. 2', 'Our review of the record indicates that the various expert witnesses may have used different medical terminology to describe the same or similar clinical procedures. Our recitation of the facts attempts to relate as accurately as possible those facts pertinent to this appeal. We recognize, however, that in so doing we may have used medical terminology inartfully.', '-1- children. When his wife found him, Mr. Manning was unable to sit up or open his eyes, and he had a mild facial droop on his right side. He was taken to South County Hospital where he was treated by emergency-room personnel. An initial computerized tomography (CT) scan revealed normal blood flow. Doctor Bellafiore, a neurologist who was on call at South County Hospital, examined Mr. Manning several hours after his admission to the emergency room. By that time, Mr. Manning’s condition had improved somewhat, and Dr. Bellafiore contacted Donald McNiece, M.D., Mr. Manning’s primary-care physician, to obtain his medical history. Although Dr. McNiece was Mr. Manning’s admitting physician, he deferred to Dr. Bellafiore in providing Mr. Manning’s treatment.', 'Doctor Bellafiore established a differential diagnosis for Mr. Manning, which is essentially a list of considered causes of a given symptom or symptoms. Among the sources of Mr. Manning’s symptoms contemplated by this differential diagnosis were complex migraine, aneurysm, tumor, and stroke. Doctor Bellafiore recommended that Mr. Manning undergo a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the circle of Willis 3 to determine whether Mr. Manning was suffering a stroke and, if so, to locate the blockage of blood flow to the brain. 4 Doctor Bellafiore also prescribed aspirin as an antiplatelet medication. 3', 'The circle of Willis is “a roughly circular anastomosis that is located at the base of the brain and formed by the anterior communicating artery, the two anterior cerebral, the two internal carotid, the two posterior communicating, and the two posterior cerebral arteries.” The American Heritage Medical Dictionary 158 (2007). 4', 'Both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) use magnetic fields and radio frequency waves to visualize anatomic structures. Stedman’s Medical Dictionary B13 (28th ed. 2006). An MRA simply uses special magnetic resonance sequences “that enhance the signal of flowing blood and suppress that from other tissues.” Stedman’s Medical Dictionary 86 (28th ed. 2006). According to Dr. McNiece, both an MRI and an MRA are noninvasive tests, the difference being “just the way the magnets spin.”', '-2-', 'Mr. Manning first attempted to undergo an MRI/MRA the day he was admitted to South County Hospital. Unfortunately, he had a claustrophobic reaction and became nauseous while inside the closed MRI/MRA machine, and he was unable to complete the test. Doctor Bellafiore prescribed the antianxiety medication Ativan and the antinausea medication Compazine for Mr. Manning, but his second attempt to undergo an MRI/MRA later that same day also was unsuccessful. In the hope of mitigating Mr. Manning’s claustrophobia, Dr. Bellafiore attempted to arrange a so-called “open architecture MRI” for Mr. Manning to undergo at Rhode Island Hospital.', 'Doctor Bellafiore’s efforts were frustrated because the MRI machine was being repaired. The radiologist at Rhode Island Hospital initially believed those repairs would be completed by the afternoon of March 5, 1998, but when he called back, Dr. Bellafiore learned that the open MRI machine would be down for repairs indefinitely.', 'At 3 a.m. on March 6, 1998, Mr. Manning began complaining about a severe headache. He also began experiencing a visual impairment resembling a “white veil.” Doctor Bellafiore ordered a second CT scan to determine whether the loss of vision could be attributed to swelling in the brain, and the test results indicated “a new prominent segmental abnormality in the left occipital lobe[.]” This confirmed that Mr. Manning had suffered a stroke two days earlier, but the test did not show any increased cranial pressure. 5', 'At approximately 9 a.m. on March 7, 1998, Mr. Manning suffered a second, catastrophic stroke. Mr. Manning was airlifted to Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), where he was immediately treated by Christopher Putman, M.D. After examining the results of an advanced 5', 'Doctor Bellafiore conceded at trial that had he ordered a CT scan a day earlier on March 5, it would have revealed the same information.', '-3- CT scan, 6 Mr. Manning’s treatment team determined that he had likely suffered a stroke caused by a blockage in the basilar artery in his brain. Doctor Putman performed an angiogram and discovered that Mr. Manning’s left vertebral artery was almost completely blocked. He then used several microcatheter treatment balloons to partially expand the artery. Upon reaching the basilar artery, Dr. Putman discovered a clot, which he identified as the cause of the stroke. Doctor Putman attempted to break apart the clot using the clot-buster Urokinase; and, after that was only minimally effective, he inflated several balloons, which dislodged the clot. The clot traveled into another portion of Mr. Manning’s brain, and Dr. Putman determined that the risks of further treatment in this region were too great. Unfortunately, Mr. Manning steadily lost brain function and on March 9, 1998, life support was withdrawn and he died.', 'Mrs. Manning filed a civil action against Drs. Bellafiore and McNiece, as well as South County Hospital, alleging negligence and wrongful death. After extensive discovery, trial began on January 4, 2004.', 'At trial, plaintiff contended that the standard of care required Mr. Manning’s physicians to conduct an MRI/MRA examination within twenty-four hours of his first stroke.', 'According to plaintiff, Dr. Bellafiore breached this standard of care by failing to accomplish the MRI/MRA examination promptly, and by failing to apprise Mr. Manning of alternative means to accomplish imaging, such as adequate sedation, after it became clear that Mr. Manning’s claustrophobia would otherwise prevent him from completing the test in a closed MRI/MRA machine. Moreover, plaintiff contended that if Dr. Bellafiore was unable to complete the MRI/MRA examination at South County Hospital, Mr. Manning should have been 6', 'In 1998, MGH had an advanced angiographic CT scan that allowed for imaging of the blood vessels in the head and neck by injecting radiographic dye into the veins.', '-4- transferred to a tertiary care hospital 7 that performed conventional cerebral angiograms. Additionally, plaintiff argued that Dr. Bellafiore breached the standard of care by failing to administer the clot-buster Heparin after Mr. Manning was admitted.', 'A great deal of the testimony elicited at trial pertained to Dr. Bellafiore’s unsuccessful efforts to obtain an MRI/MRA test for Mr. Manning. 8 Doctor Bellafiore acknowledged that an MRI was an important diagnostic tool for ruling out possible causes of Mr. Manning’s symptoms, as well as for determining whether there was any damage to his brain tissue, which is an indication of an interruption of blood flow. Moreover, an MRA could pinpoint where in the arteries the damage had occurred, which is crucial for determining the cause of a stroke.', 'Doctor Bellafiore testified that he was involved in the initial efforts to obtain a closed MRI/MRA on March 4, 1998, through the Rhode Island Medical Resonance Imaging Network. 9 He testified that after Mr. Manning could not overcome his claustrophobia, he presented Mr. Manning with two options to accomplish the closed MRI/MRA several times on both March 5 and March 6.', 'First, he stated that he offered Mr. Manning additional Ativan “to make him a little sleepier to see if he could tolerate the test.” Additionally, Dr. Bellafiore testified that he offered his patient intravenous conscious sedation, which achieves a significantly deeper level of sedation. 10 He explained that Mr. Manning could accomplish the MRI/MRA examination by general anesthesia, but he testified that he did not present this option because he felt that the risks 7', 'Although the litigants never defined “tertiary care hospital,” this term generally refers to a major hospital that offers a full spectrum of medical services. 8', 'We restrict our recitation of the facts to those relevant to plaintiff’s claims against the sole appellant, Dr. Bellafiore. 9', 'South County Hospital was a participant in the Rhode Island Medical Resonance Imaging Network, which provided hospitals without in-house MRI/MRA machines the use of its portable MRI/MRA machine on certain scheduled days. 10', 'Conscious sedation must be administered by an anesthesiologist or other qualified provider.', '-5- outweighed the benefits. 11 Doctor Bellafiore vividly described Mr. Manning’s refusal of these options stating,', '“What he said to me – and I remember it, because I was struck by', 'it. He told me, ‘I’m sorry, Doc.’ I remember it when people call', 'me Doc. It just makes me feel like a doctor. ‘I know you need me', 'to do this test to figure out what to do, but I just can’t do it.’ This', 'was on the morning of the 5th after I told him all the things that', 'could be possibly wrong. And I told him about conscious sedation.', 'I told him about Ativan. I told him the open MRI may not give us', 'the answer we need. I basically held – and told him he could have', 'a stroke, he could have a tumor. I was holding a neurological gun', 'to his head.”', 'According to Dr. Bellafiore, after Mr. Manning refused to undergo a closed MRI/MRA, he had no choice but to recommend an open MRI, even though he considered a closed MRI/MRA to be the “best choice.” 12 Indeed, he testified that at that time he did not believe that an open MRI machine was sensitive enough to produce MRA-quality images of the blood vessels. 13 On a March 5, 1998 assessment and recommendation form, Dr. Bellafiore noted that Mr. Manning could undergo an “MRA as [an] outpatient.” At trial, he explained that such a test would have been performed at a later date in a closed MRI/MRA machine “if [Mr. Manning] would agree to * * * that.” Despite Dr. Bellafiore’s stated preference for the closed MRI/MRA examination, he characterized Mr. Manning’s purported choice to wait until the open MRI machine was operational as “a rational decision.” He did not document Mr. Manning’s alleged refusal to undergo a closed MRI/MRA examination in his treatment notes, nor did he document 11', 'General anesthesia is the deepest form of sedation. It renders the patient unconscious and must be performed by an anesthesiologist. 12', 'Significantly, Dr. McNiece testified that he had no knowledge of Mr. Manning having refused conscious sedation. 13', 'Doctor Bellafiore testified that some time after writing the open MRI order, he talked to a radiologist at Rhode Island Hospital who informed him that it was possible to “get some information from the [MRA] in the open machine.” Nevertheless, Dr. Bellafiore acknowledged at trial that he was aware that an MRA in an open machine would not produce as detailed an image of Mr. Manning’s brain as would an MRA in a closed machine.', '-6- his intention to order an open MRI for Mr. Manning. Doctor Bellafiore did, however, add the phrase “in an open architecture” to Dr. McNiece’s March 5, 1998 order for an “MRI head at Rhode Island Hospital.” He also testified that he did not seek the assistance of Mrs. Manning in his attempt to persuade her husband to undergo a closed MRI/MRA with conscious sedation until the evening of March 6, 1998. Doctor Bellafiore testified that Mrs. Manning also was unable to persuade Mr. Manning.', 'Doctor Bellafiore testified that on March 6, 1998, he discussed an additional option for diagnosing Mr. Manning’s condition: a conventional catheter angiogram. 14', 'South County Hospital did not perform cerebral catheter angiograms in 1998, nor did it perform angioplasties. 15 He recounted explaining to Mr. Manning that an angiogram carried a 1 to 3 percent risk of “significant morbidity,” including clotting, bruising, infection, and, most seriously, stroke; and he further recalled strongly recommending that Mr. Manning undergo the open MRI examination instead. Doctor Bellafiore testified that, after considering the risks, Mr. Manning declined the angiogram because of a bad childhood experience.', 'Dr. Bellafiore characterized this as an “informed, intelligent decision[].”', 'Again, Dr. Bellafiore failed to document Mr. Manning’s refusal to undergo this procedure. Doctor Bellafiore testified that on the morning of March 7, 1998, he finally was able to persuade Mr. Manning to undergo a closed MRI/MRA examination with conscious sedation, but he was aware at that time that a machine would not be available through the network until March 9, 1998. 14', 'A conventional catheter angiogram is an invasive radiological procedure in which a dye is injected into the blood vessels to get an image of the affected area. Stedman’s Medical Dictionary 86 (28th ed. 2006). This procedure was acknowledged to be the “gold standard” for imaging by both Doctors McNiece and Bellafiore. 15', 'Angioplasty is a technique for dislodging an obstruction by inflating small balloons inside the blood vessel. Stedman’s Medical Dictionary 88 (28th ed. 2006).', '-7-', 'The plaintiff vigorously disputed Dr. Bellafiore’s contention that he had frequently offered Mr. Manning conscious sedation as a means of completing the MRI/MRA examination and repeatedly pointed out that, in both his answers to interrogatories and his deposition testimony, Dr. Bellafiore had failed to mention offering this option. 16', 'For instance, in interrogatory No. 18, plaintiff asked Dr. Bellafiore to reveal “any and all conversations [he] had with any person concerning the care and/or treatment of Michael Manning * * *.” Doctor Bellafiore answered by first referring to an earlier response in which he did not mention conscious sedation and then directing plaintiff to the medical records generally. He also stated obliquely that he “spoke with [Mr. Manning] and his wife during his admission,” without revealing any of the substance of these conversations. Also, when asked in another interrogatory to list the available alternatives to an open MRI for a comparable evaluation of Mr. Manning, Dr. Bellafiore responded only that “[o]n March 5, 1998, after learning that the patient was unable to tolerate the MRI, I called the MRI Network of RI in an attempt to obtain an MRI in an open machine.” Similarly, Dr. Bellafiore failed to disclose at his deposition that he offered Mr. Manning conscious sedation. Indeed, the following colloquy occurred during Dr. Bellafiore’s deposition:', '“[Counsel]: Well, when you talked to [Mr. Manning] on the 5th in', 'the morning you were asking him whether he’d undergo an MRI if', 'he had more sedation, is that right?', '“[Dr. Bellafiore]: Right.', '“[Counsel]: Where was he going to undergo an MRI if he had', 'more sedation? 16', 'During the trial, plaintiff moved for default judgment, alleging that Dr. Bellafiore deliberately withheld this crucial information during discovery. The trial justice initially reserved judgment on this motion.', '-8-', '“[Dr. Bellafiore]: In any closed machine that was available', 'through the MRI network.', '“[Counsel]:', 'And so what did you tell Mr. Manning about', 'sedation?', '“[Dr. Bellafiore]: I said we could try giving him more Ativan to', 'make him a little sleepier to see if he could tolerate the test.”', 'When asked “[i]s there any reason why Mr. Manning couldn’t have been sedated with the assistance of anesthesiology on March 4th in order to accomplish the MRI?” Dr. Bellafiore eventually responded that “it’s a dangerous procedure to give someone general anesthesia or anesthetic who is having a potential stroke.” Doctor Bellafiore appeared to buttress this answer later in his deposition when asked, “[W]hat was the risk posed to Mr. Manning in particular if he had undergone sedation short of general anesthesia, what was the risk that his blood pressure would alter to an extent that would be life threatening?” He ultimately responded: “I don’t know a percentage number, but I would say that the chances are great enough that you would want to attempt the open MRI first.” Doctor Bellafiore testified that he “need[ed] to rely on [his] attorney to fill out” his answers to plaintiff’s interrogatories, and he attributed his seemingly incomplete deposition answers to “confusion in my mind at certain points” about the meaning of the term “sedation.”', 'The jury also heard testimony from various expert witnesses. Doctor Putman devoted the majority of his testimony to detailing his care of Mr. Manning at MGH. At trial, Dr. Putman was shown enlarged pictures of the images taken while he performed Mr. Manning’s angiogram. In reviewing those images, Dr. Putman concluded that the clot that triggered Mr. Manning’s stroke was caused by a left arterial dissection rather than atherosclerosis. He also testified, however, that a patient in Mr. Manning’s specific circumstances treated at a tertiary care hospital according to the standard of care would have received imaging of the blood vessels in his brain', '-9- and neck on March 5, 1998. The imaging would have allowed Mr. Manning’s physicians to locate the blockage, and he believed angioplasty would have been highly successful at dislodging the obstruction. Such treatment, according to Dr. Putman, would have likely prevented Mr. Manning’s second devastating stroke.', 'David Gelber, M.D., a neurologist and professor at Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, testified on behalf of plaintiff. Doctor Gelber stated that the standard of care required Dr. Bellafiore to administer the anticoagulant Heparin, which he testified was more effective than aspirin at breaking up blood clots.', 'Doctor Gelber also testified that “good stroke management requires you to identify what the cause of the stroke was in order to best treat [it] and prevent the next one[.]” Doctor Gelber testified that Dr. Bellafiore’s treatment of Mr. Manning fell below the standard of care because he failed to get a definitive diagnosis by completing the MRI/MRA examination. He also testified that a conventional catheter angiogram would have been an effective alternative means of locating Mr. Manning’s stroke.', 'He acknowledged the slight risk of an allergic reaction to the dye or the dislodging of plaque associated with conducting a conventional angiogram, but he said the need “to know what was going on” far outweighed the minimal risks. Doctor Gelber discounted the open MRI as an option for locating the cause of Mr. Manning’s stroke because it would not allow for a high- quality MRA image, and instead he characterized conscious sedation in a closed MRI/MRA machine as the best option. Moreover, he stated that transferring Mr. Manning by ambulance to another hospital with a closed MRI/MRA machine would have created no additional risk that would have outweighed the urgent need for imaging. He testified that with timely treatment, Mr. Manning’s long-term prognosis would have been good, with possible peripheral visual impairment as the only lasting consequence of his initial stroke.', '- 10 -', 'Daniel Hanley, M.D., a neurologist at The Johns Hopkins Hospital, also testified on behalf of plaintiff.', 'He first testified that Dr. Bellafiore’s initial differential diagnosis was appropriate. Doctor Hanley then went on to criticize Dr. Bellafiore for failing to obtain high- quality imaging of the vertebral basilar system within twenty-four hours of Mr. Manning’s admission. He stated that this test would have ruled out possible causes listed on the differential diagnosis, and he concluded that Dr. Bellafiore “[chose] the most benign of diagnoses and accept[ed] them without evidence.” He stated that Dr. Bellafiore could have obtained the image by an MRA, a CT scan angiogram, or a conventional cerebral angiogram, the latter of which he characterized as the “gold standard evaluation.” Under the standard of care, Dr. Hanley testified that a physician may persist in seeking an MRA, rather than pursuing other means of imaging, only “if [he or she is] able to obtain the [MRA] * * * within that 24-hour time period.” If the occlusion had been located, prompt treatment would have included administering the clot-buster Heparin, elevating the patient’s blood pressure, and performing an angioplasty to dislodge the obstruction. Instead, Dr. Bellafiore ordered an open MRI examination on March 5, 1998, which Dr. Hanley testified fell below the standard of care because it could not provide a sufficiently detailed image of the affected area to locate the cause of the blockage. Doctor Hanley also testified that a reasonably prudent doctor in Dr. Bellafiore’s position would have documented his efforts to convince a patient to undergo a closed MRI/MRA examination with the assistance of conscious sedation.', 'Theodore Larson, III, M.D., an interventional neuroradiologist and professor at Vanderbilt University, was the first expert to testify on behalf of Dr. Bellafiore. He explained that 15 to 20 percent of patients have claustrophobic reactions in a closed MRI/MRA machine. Doctor Larson opined that Mr. Manning did not have a dissection of the left vertebral artery, but', '- 11 - rather his stroke was caused by vascular atherosclerotic disease. He indicated that the risk of a second stroke is higher with atherosclerotic disease because the plaque can break off and clot again. For this reason, he testified, transporting Mr. Manning would have been dangerous. He conceded, however, that if Mr. Manning had, in fact, suffered a dissection of the left vertebral artery, then there would have been no risk in transporting him. Doctor Larson also stated that “there is no data that suggests that [H]eparin is better than aspirin for treatment of lesions at the origin of the vertebral artery.” Finally, Dr. Larson admitted that he did not conclude that Mr. Manning had atherosclerosis in his vertebral artery when reviewing the medical records before his deposition. Rather, he arrived at this determination after observing the enlarged trial exhibits of the angiogram images that Dr. Putman took.', 'Daryl Gress, M.D., a neurologist trained in stroke intervention, also testified on behalf of Dr. Bellafiore. He also attributed Mr. Manning’s stroke on March 4, 1998, to a buildup of atherosclerotic plaque. Doctor Gress testified that Dr. Bellafiore met the standard of care by obtaining a CT scan within twenty-four hours of admission and that no other test was necessary. He conceded that if it became clear that his patient’s stroke was caused by a dissection he would prescribe Heparin rather than aspirin. Moreover, he admitted that he would have strongly considered performing a conventional angiogram had no other method of imaging been available.', 'Lawrence Wechsler, M.D., a neurologist at the University of Pittsburgh, was the final expert witness to testify on behalf of Dr. Bellafiore. Doctor Wechsler opined that Mr. Manning’s stroke was the result of a blockage in the vertebral artery caused by atherosclerotic plaque. He indicated that Dr. Bellafiore met the standard of care by prescribing aspirin. Doctor Wechsler testified that it would have made no difference if Mr. Manning had completed an MRI/MRA', '- 12 - examination because his treatment would have remained limited to antiplatelet treatment. Moreover, he stated that performing a conventional catheter angiogram would not have been appropriate because of the risks. On cross-examination, Dr. Wechsler conceded that he had not reviewed the angiogram images that Dr. Putman took, but he stated that he still disagreed with Dr. Putman’s determination that a dissection was the cause of Mr. Manning’s stroke.', 'At the close of all the evidence, the jury returned a verdict in favor of all the defendants. The plaintiff filed a timely motion for judgment as a matter of law or, in the alternative, a new trial. The plaintiff argued that a new trial was justified both because Dr. Bellafiore had withheld vital information during the discovery process and also because the jury’s verdict was against the weight of the evidence. The trial justice issued a forty-four page ruling on plaintiff’s motions in which he extensively reviewed the evidence against Dr. Bellafiore.', 'The trial justice explained that he had reserved judgment on plaintiff’s initial motion for default judgment because he believed at the time that the jury would not find credible Dr. Bellafiore’s testimony that he had discussed conscious sedation with Mr. Manning and that he had refused treatment. He further explained,', '“In the midst of a lengthy, hotly contested medical malpractice', 'case, the failure to disclose such an important defense was not only', 'critical, it left the court in the midst of a dilemma for which there', 'was no just resolution (not to mention the disarray to the', 'extensively prepared plaintiffs’ case). At trial, the Court suspected', 'that the credibility of Dr. Bellafiore would be significantly', 'lessened when such an obvious, pivotal fact was not disclosed in', 'sworn answers. Apparently, the jury did not recognize the gravity', 'of this flagrant discovery abuse. In hindsight, the injustice was', 'never cured. The Court only precluded the fact finder in its quest', 'for the truth, when its proper role was to accommodate the fact', 'finder within the confines of the rules and fairness.” In comparing Dr. Bellafiore’s trial testimony with his earlier deposition and written disclosures, the trial justice concluded that the proper remedy was to order a new trial. He also found that a', '- 13 - new trial was justified because the jury’s verdict was against the fair preponderance of the evidence. 17', 'On appeal, Dr. Bellafiore argues that the trial justice abused his discretion in granting plaintiff’s motion for a new trial to sanction what the trial justice called Dr. Bellafiore’s “blatant discovery abuse.” Additionally, Dr. Bellafiore contends that the trial justice’s determination that the jury’s verdict was against the weight of the evidence was clearly wrong.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“The role of a trial justice in considering a motion for a new trial is well-established.” Murray v. Bromley, 945 A.2d 330, 333 (R.I. 2008). “When ruling on a motion for a new trial, the trial justice acts as a ‘superjuror’ and ‘should review the evidence and exercise his or her independent judgment in passing upon the weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses.’” Seddon v.

NewPaper, Inc., 512 A.2d 831, 835 (R.I. 1986)).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'In his decision granting plaintiff’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice provided a detailed summary of all the testimony elicited at trial. Moreover, he made specific credibility findings for many of the key expert witnesses. He observed that Dr. Putman was “honest and straightforward[,]” and “thorough in his work, capable, and impressive.”', 'Moreover, after reviewing the testimony of Dr. Hanley, the trial justice found it to be “virtually impenetrable on cross-examination.” Observing that Dr. Hanley was “explanatory and logical” throughout his testimony, the trial justice found him credible. Taking the testimony of Doctors Gelber, Putman, and Hanley together, the trial justice found that they had established a standard of care for Mr. Manning’s treatment.', 'The trial justice found that the standard of care required prompt imaging of the circle of Willis that would have identified the cause of Mr. Manning’s stroke. He further found that such', '- 15 - prompt imaging, either by an MRI/MRA or a conventional angiogram would have revealed the dissection in Mr. Manning’s left vertebral artery. The trial justice found that a timely diagnosis would have allowed for proper treatment, including Heparin, and a probable transfer to a different hospital so that the patient could undergo angioplasty. The trial justice was convinced that Dr. Bellafiore deviated from this standard of care by failing to obtain an MRI/MRA or conventional angiogram image within twenty-four hours of Mr. Manning’s admission. He also was persuaded that Dr. Bellafiore deviated from the standard of care by administering aspirin instead of Heparin.', 'The trial justice determined that Dr. Bellafiore’s testimony “further and best supports the proposition that he failed to meet the standard of care.” The trial justice noted that Dr. Bellafiore agreed that Mr. Manning required prompt imaging when he was admitted on March 4, 1998. Further, Dr. Bellafiore conceded that South County Hospital did not perform angioplasties in 1998. Most crucially, the trial justice did not find credible Dr. Bellafiore’s testimony that he had offered Mr. Manning the option of conscious sedation to achieve the closed MRI/MRA examination. He noted that Dr. Bellafiore did not document these purported discussions in any of his medical records, nor did he disclose this seemingly essential fact during pretrial discovery despite myriad opportunities.', 'The trial justice concluded that “the jury was significantly challenged in adopting Dr. Bellafiore’s interpretations of the facts.”', 'The trial justice also reviewed the testimony of Dr. Bellafiore’s expert witnesses and found them less credible.', 'Specifically, he characterized Dr. Larson’s assertion that Mr. Manning’s stroke was caused by atherosclerotic plaque buildup rather than a dissection to be “unconvincing.” He noted that Dr. Putman had testified in great detail that Mr. Manning’s stroke was caused by a dissection in his left vertebral artery and not atherosclerotic plaque. The trial', '- 16 - justice also found that Dr. Gress’s testimony was of little probative value because he refused to articulate a standard of care when discussing Mr. Manning’s treatment. Finally, the trial justice did not find Dr. Wechsler to be credible because he concluded that atherosclerosis was the cause of Mr. Manning’s stroke without ever reviewing the CT angiogram images. Moreover, the trial justice noted that Dr. Wechsler “rarely provid[ed] any basis for his opinions.”', 'Doctor Bellafiore contends that the trial justice relied on several material misconceptions of the evidence that require reversal and reinstatement of the jury’s verdict. First, he argues that the trial justice erred by not making a specific credibility determination concerning Dr. Gelber. Additionally, Dr. Bellafiore avers that the trial justice mistakenly stated that Dr. Gelber testified that Mr. Manning was never definitively diagnosed with a stroke in the days after his admission. We do not discern any material error in the trial justice’s discussion of Dr. Gelber’s testimony.', 'We first note that a trial justice need not make specific credibility determinations for every witness. See State v. Reyes, 984 A.2d 606, 618 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. Tate, 109 R.I. 586, 588-89, 288 A.2d 494, 496 (1972) (“we do not require trial justices to ‘literally tag the testimony of each witness as “credible” or “incredible”’”)). Nevertheless, it is clear from the trial justice’s decision that he viewed Dr. Gelber as credible and even went so far as to state that he relied on Dr. Gelber to determine the standard of care. Moreover, Dr. Gelber did indeed criticize Dr. Bellafiore’s failure to diagnose the cause of Mr. Manning’s stroke and noted that Dr. Bellafiore had failed to rule out alternate diagnoses until March 6, 1998. We therefore find no merit in Dr. Bellafiore’s argument that the trial justice’s discussion of Dr. Gelber’s testimony contained material errors.', 'Next, Dr. Bellafiore contends that the trial justice erred by describing Dr. Hanley as a “neurosurgeon and neurologist” when he was, in fact, a neurologist. Although the trial justice', '- 17 - clearly mischaracterized Dr. Hanley’s field of medical expertise, we are well satisfied that the trial justice did not misconceive any material aspects of Dr. Hanley’s testimony.', 'More significantly, Dr. Bellafiore argues that the trial justice erroneously accepted Dr. Hanley’s testimony that Dr. Bellafiore breached the standard of care by not discussing with Mrs. Manning the risks and benefits of the various imaging alternatives. A review of the trial justice’s decision in its entirety, however, demonstrates that he found the jury’s verdict flawed because (1) the expert testimony established that the appropriate standard of care required prompt imaging, and (2) Dr. Bellafiore’s testimony that he had discussed sedation alternatives with Mr. Manning himself was of questionable credibility because, among other things, the doctor could provide no documentation. We are satisfied, therefore, that any conversations Dr. Bellafiore may or may not have had with Mrs. Manning did not significantly contribute to the granting of a new trial.', 'Doctor Bellafiore also criticizes the trial justice for mistakenly referring to Dr. Putman as “Dr. Putnam” and describing him as a “neuro-interventional radiologist” rather than an interventional neuro-radiologist. Additionally, Dr. Bellafiore notes that the trial justice favorably discussed Dr. Putman’s purported admission that he mistakenly believed Mr. Manning’s stroke was related to performing heavy lifting at work when, in fact, Dr. Putman denied making such a conclusion.', 'Again, this error was not material to Dr. Putman’s core testimony about Mr. Manning’s treatment at MGH and the standard of care.', 'Doctor Bellafiore also argues that the trial justice materially misconceived the evidence deduced from the expert witnesses for the defense. He notes that the trial justice seemingly erred in believing that Dr. Larson was involved in Mr. Manning’s care. Doctor Bellafiore also points out that the trial justice erroneously characterized Dr. Gress as a neuroradiologist rather than a', '- 18 - neurologist. We do not believe either of these misstatements by the trial justice is sufficient to require reversal of his new trial order.', 'We have thoroughly reviewed the trial justice’s decision in its entirety and conclude that he adequately discharged his responsibility to “independently weigh, evaluate, and assess the credibility of the trial witnesses and evidence.” Wellborn v. Spurwink/Rhode Island, 873 A.2d 884, 887 (R.I. 2005) (quoting Graff v. Motta, 748 A.2d 249, 255 (R.I. 2000)). He began his analysis by acknowledging the plaintiff’s theories of the case, viz., that Dr. Bellafiore breached the standard of care by failing to obtain prompt medical imaging, failing to administer Heparin as a blood thinner, and failing to apprise Mr. Manning of the options available for accomplishing the imaging. After considering the voluminous evidence, determining the credibility of the witnesses, and weighing the testimony of the various expert witnesses, the trial justice found that “[t]he jury was confronted with substantial information which established that the standard of care for treatment of a potential stroke patient required prompt imaging.” He further found that the plaintiff had “established that prompt imaging did not occur.” Accordingly, he determined that the jury’s verdict concerning Dr. Bellafiore was against the fair preponderance of the evidence and failed to do justice or respond to the merits of the controversy. It is our conclusion that the trial justice conducted the appropriate analysis, did not overlook or misconceive material evidence, and was not otherwise clearly wrong.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, the order of the Superior Court is affirmed and the papers of the case shall be returned to the Superior Court.

48,"State : v. : Joseph McManus. : Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty, and Robinson, JJ. OPINION Justice Goldberg, for the Court. The defendant, Joseph McManus (defendant or McManus), is before the Supreme Court on appeal from Superior Court judgments of conviction for criminal solicitation. The defendant was found guilty after a jury trial of soliciting Vincent Arruda (Arruda) to murder Attorney General Jeffrey Pine (Attorney General) and soliciting Robert Smith (Smith) to murder the Attorney General and to feloniously assault Assistant Attorney General Margaret Lynch (Lynch). We affirm. Facts and Travel This case arose in the aftermath of defendant’s horrific murder of his wife on June 29, 1996, in the presence of their children. This Court affirmed his conviction and the sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole that was imposed by the trial justice. See State v. McManus, 941 A.2d 222 (R.I. 2008). While defendant was being held without bail at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI) awaiting trial on the murder charge at the Intake Service Center (Intake), his interaction with four of his fellow inmates are of consequence in this case. The record discloses that Arthur Pine, -1- Mark Pine, 1 Robert Smith, and Vincent Arruda, were approached individually by defendant, who wanted to hire a person or people to commit murder and felony assault against the Attorney General and the prosecutor assigned to the case. The defendant was charged, by way of grand jury indictment, with three counts: 2 criminal solicitation of Arthur Pine to commit murder in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-1-9; criminal solicitation of Vincent Arruda to commit murder in violation of § 11-1-9; criminal solicitation of Robert Smith to commit murder and/or assault with a dangerous weapon in violation of § 11-1- 9. 3 In its case in chief, the state called the four men, all of whom were alleged to have engaged in these conversations with defendant. Arthur testified about meeting defendant at Intake; he explained that the two developed a relationship such that defendant asked Arthur, “how much to take care of [the Attorney General]?” When Arthur inquired of defendant how the murder of the Attorney General would help his case, defendant replied, “It’s going to do me a lot of good * * * [he] is using my kids to testify against me.” The defendant went on to describe in detail how the murder should take place. Specifically, defendant wanted the 1 Mark and Arthur Pine are brothers, but are not related to Attorney General Jeffrey Pine. We will refer to Arthur and Mark by their first names, to avoid confusion with former Attorney General Jeffrey Pine. 2 The grand jury also indicted defendant on two additional counts: threatening a public official with death and threatening a public official with bodily harm. The trial justice granted judgments of acquittal on these counts. 3 General Laws 1956 § 11-1-9 entitled “Soliciting another to commit a crime” provides: “Every person who solicits another to commit or join in the commission of a felony under the laws of this state shall be guilty of a felony and upon conviction shall be subject to the same fine and imprisonment as pertain to the offense which the person did solicit another to commit, provided that imprisonment for the solicitation shall not exceed ten (10) years.” -2- Attorney General to be shot two times – one bullet for each of defendant’s children – because the prosecution intended to call them as trial witnesses in the underlying murder case. Arthur testified that he took copious notes of his various conversations with defendant and eventually went to his correctional officers with this information. An investigation by the state police and the Office of the Attorney General ensued. However, the jury rejected Arthur’s testimony. Mark Pine, Arthur’s brother and fellow inmate, was the second witness to testify about the solicitation. He testified that he met defendant through his brother, while both were at Intake. According to Mark, defendant was aware of the state police investigation and repeatedly asked Mark to tell his attorney that Arthur was lying. Mark testified that defendant, yet again, described in detail how he wanted the Attorney General killed and that he wanted someone to break Lynch’s legs. The crux of this case, however, turns on the testimony, or lack of testimony, of Robert Smith, another jailhouse informant. When Smith was called to testify, he claimed to have suffered an unfortunate and total failure of memory about everything he previously had disclosed to law enforcement, including his police statement and grand jury testimony. The record discloses that Smith was at Intake during the period when defendant actively was recruiting others to carry out his criminal enterprise. During a long discussion with investigators, Smith described his relationship with defendant and disclosed that defendant sought Smith’s help in murdering the Attorney General and assaulting Lynch. According to Smith, defendant offered him $5,000 for his services. Smith also gave detailed testimony before the grand jury. -3- However, when testifying at trial, Smith professed a total failure of memory about everything concerning the incident, including his discussions with the state police. After some initial examination, the prosecutor treated Smith as an adverse witness and began to use leading questions. The trial justice allowed the state’s use of leading questions, over defense counsel’s continuing objection. The prosecutor continued to pose leading questions – an effort that spanned fifty-one pages of trial transcript. Defense counsel objected and argued that continuing this line of inquiry was not only fruitless, but was having a prejudicial effect on the jury. The trial justice responded: “[The prosecutor] hasn’t been through the whole thing yet. I’m prepared to stay here all day while [Smith] either answers ‘yes’ or ‘no’ that he doesn’t remember.” The trial justice allowed the questioning to continue but noted counsel’s objection. Additionally, in yet another attempt to refresh the witness’s recollection, a tape recording of Smith’s testimony before the grand jury was played to the jury. After Smith’s turn on the witness stand, the state called Arruda, another of defendant’s fellow inmates. Arruda testified that while at Intake defendant approached him to murder the Attorney General and offered him $25,000 in exchange “to make a hit on the Attorney General.” The state next called John P. A’Vant (Det. A’Vant) from the state police, the detective who investigated this case. Detective A’Vant testified that he tape-recorded the interview with Smith and that the transcript of that interview consisted of 367 questions and fifty pages of transcript. The state sought to have the transcript of the interview introduced as a prior recorded recollection, under Rule 803(5) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. Although defendant objected, he did so on the ground that the document -4- had not been authenticated and was neither signed nor witnessed. Defense counsel further argued that the prosecutor essentially had read the entire statement into the record through his use of leading questions to Smith. The trial justice allowed it and explained: “* * * I think [the jury has] had the benefit of observing Mr. Smith, they observed the fact that his memory was obviously very poor from what he said and he never denied that he made those statements. As a matter of fact, I think [the prosecutor] followed each one of those questions up with something like, ‘Although you don’t recall making these statements, you do not deny that you made them,’ words to that effect. And he said, ‘oh, yes.’ He agreed that he must have made the statements.” The defendant was acquitted by the jury on count 1, criminal solicitation of Arthur Pine, but was found guilty on the remaining counts. The trial justice sentenced him to ten-year sentences on each of the two convictions, to be served consecutively. 4 He filed a timely notice of appeal. Issues on Appeal On appeal, defendant raises a number of issues which, he contends, amount to an abuse of discretion by the trial justice and warrant reversal of his conviction. The defendant first points to three instances of purported error during Smith’s testimony: the state’s use of leading questions; the introduction of Smith’s grand jury testimony; and error by the trial justice in allowing the transcript of Smith’s interview with the investigators to be introduced as a full exhibit. Next, defendant argues that the trial justice committed error when he allowed Det. A’Vant to testify because the state had failed to list him as a witness in its responses to the defendant’s discovery requests. 4 It should be noted that defendant also received a sentence of life without the possibility of parole for the murder of his wife. See State v. McManus, 941 A.2d 222, 224 (R.I. 2008). -5- The defendant also avers that the trial justice erred in permitting Arruda and Smith to testify, contending that their testimony violated his constitutional right to confrontation and cross-examination and violated Rule 16 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. Finally, defendant contends that his sentence violated both the state and federal constitutions as cruel and unusual punishment. However, as we consistently have held, this Court “will only review those issues that have been properly preserved for appellate review.” State v. Reyes, 984 A.2d 606, 613 (R.I. 2009); State v. Harris, 871 A.2d 341, 345 (R.I. 2005). Standard of Review Before this Court, defendant challenges several rulings that the Superior Court trial justice made with regard to evidence and trial procedures. The applicable standard of review of a trial justice’s admission of evidence is a clear abuse of discretion. Reyes, 984 A.2d at 614-15. Additionally, the standard of review of a challenge to a trial justice’s restriction on cross-examination is clear abuse of discretion. State v. Feole, 748 A.2d 239, 242 (R.I. 2000) (“This Court has previously concluded that the exercise of discretion by the trial justice in limiting the scope of cross-examination will not be disturbed absent a clear abuse of that discretion.”) (quoting State v. Walsh, 731 A.2d 696, 698 (R.I. 1999)). Analysis The Testimony of Robert Smith The defendant challenges evidentiary errors in Smith’s testimony on three grounds. First, he contends that the trial justice abused his discretion by allowing the state to pose leading questions to Smith during its direct examination. Second, he argues -6- that the trial justice abused his discretion in admitting Smith’s police statement. Lastly, defendant contends that the trial justice abused his discretion by permitting the state to introduce Smith’s grand jury testimony. Because our holding with respect to the admission of Smith’s police statement is determinative of the challenge to the use of the leading questions, we shall address these issues in that order. Smith’s Police Statement We first address defendant’s contention that the trial justice erred by allowing Smith’s police statement to be introduced at trial. At issue is the fifty-page transcript of the statement Smith gave to detectives A’Vant and Lamont on March 19, 1997, while at the ACI. Over defense counsel’s objection, the trial justice allowed the statement into evidence, as a recorded recollection under Rule 803(5). Rule 803(5) provides: “A memorandum or record concerning a matter about which a witness once had knowledge but now has insufficient recollection to enable the witness to testify fully and accurately, shown to have been made or adopted by the witness when the matter was fresh in the witness’ memory and to reflect that knowledge correctly. If admitted, the memorandum or record may be read into evidence and received as an exhibit.” We previously have had occasion to consider the use of a recorded recollection under Rule 803(5) and the four prerequisites to admissibility: (1) that the witness whose prior statement is sought to be introduced have firsthand knowledge of the event at issue; (2) that the recorded memoranda was made “at or near the time of the event while the witness had a clear memory;” (3) that the witness is now unable to recall the incident independently; and (4) that the witness can attest “that the recorded recollection was accurate when made.” State v. Gabriau, 696 A.2d 290, 297 (R.I. 1997) (quoting State v. Ricci, 639 A.2d 64, 67 (R.I. 1994)); State v. Vento, 533 A.2d 1161, 1165 (R.I. 1987). -7- The record discloses that Smith never acknowledged, and indeed refused to admit, that the recorded recollection was accurate when made; and thus it was impossible for the proponent to meet the fourth requirement of Rule 803(5), that “the witness can attest that the recorded recollection was accurate when made.” Gabriau, 696 A.2d at 297. “Past recollection recorded has historically been a vehicle for the admission of prior statements when live testimony is not available because of a lack of memory.” Id. Under this reasoning, a prior recorded document is admitted as a substitute “for the current lack of adequate memory of the events.” Id. That is not what transpired in this case because Smith refused to acknowledge the accuracy of the statement. The state conceded this error in its brief and admitted that, “[t]he fourth prerequisite, which requires the witness to attest to the accuracy of the statement sought to be admitted under [Rule] 803(5), is a much closer question.” However, the state urges us to affirm the ruling on other grounds. In State v. Froais, 653 A.2d 735, 738 (R.I. 1995), this Court declared that, “we have long upheld a trial justice’s decision in various contexts even though the specific grounds relied upon by the justice were erroneous.” Indeed, there are numerous examples of our having done just that: State v. Ellis, 619 A.2d 418, 425-26 (R.I. 1993) (decision to allow the defendant’s statement into evidence upheld on different factual findings than were relied upon by the trial justice); State v. Nordstrom, 529 A.2d 107, 111 (R.I. 1987) (“This court on appeal is free to affirm a ruling on grounds other than those stated by the lower-court judge.”). Accordingly, we are satisfied that when an out-of-court statement is admissible under a recognized exception to the hearsay rule, we shall uphold its admission, notwithstanding any error on the trial justice’s ruling. -8- The state suggests, and we agree, that the statement could have been admitted as a prior inconsistent statement in accordance with Rule 801(d)(1)(A) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. Specifically, Rule 801(d)(1)(A) provides: “A statement is not hearsay if: (1) Prior Statement by Witness. The declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement, and the statement is (A) inconsistent with the declarant’s testimony * * *.” The state points to our decision in State v. Jaiman, 850 A.2d 984 (R.I. 2004), as support for its contention that we should affirm the admission of the statement under to Rule 801(d)(1)(A). In Jaiman, the state was faced with a previously cooperative witness who “engaged in a testimonial double-cross of the state” while at trial. Jaiman, 850 A.2d at 985. The state attempted to refresh the witness’s recollection on direct examination by using his prior statement to the police; and a portion of that statement eventually came into evidence under agreement by both parties. Id. at 986. Later in the trial, the state sought to introduce additional portions of the statement through a witness who was present when the statement was made. Id. We upheld its admission and declared: “Accordingly, the touchstone of Rule 801(d)(1)(A) is that the witness testify at trial and be available for cross- examination. Although [the witness] did testify at trial and was, in fact, cross-examined, [the] defendant contends that [the witness’s] comprehensive inability to recall either his previous testimony or some of the events of September 18, 1993, rendered him functionally unavailable for cross- examination. We disagree; the rule against hearsay is not violated by resort to a prior out-of-court statement by a witness who is reneging on his cooperation agreement based on his ostensible belief that truthful testimony was a once-in-a-lifetime proposition.” Jaiman, 850 A.2d at 988. Here, as in Jaiman, Smith testified at trial and was available for cross- examination. Although the witness purported to suffer from jail-house amnesia, a -9- frequent malaise, this circumstance does not negate the underlying rationale for admissibility under Rule 801(d)(1)(A). In fact, this precisely is the reason for the rule: to allow for statements, such as Smith’s statement to the state police, to be introduced as substantive evidence in order for the fact finder to decide which statement, if any, is worthy of belief. We conclude that the introduction of Smith’s statement to the police investigators was proper under Rule 801(d)(1)(A). Leading Questions We next turn to defendant’s argument that the repeated use of leading questions to Smith on direct examination was so pervasive as to create prejudice in the eyes of the jury – an issue we perceive as problematic because of its duration and scope. We note that defense counsel was granted a continuing objection to the use of leading questions, as acknowledged by the trial justice on more than one occasion. Leading questions are questions that suggest the desired answer. State v. Boillard, 789 A.2d 881, 887 (R.I. 2002). As we declared in State v. Girouard, 561 A.2d 882, 888 (R.I. 1989), “[t]he danger of a leading question is that it may suggest to the witness the specific tenor of the reply desired by counsel and such a reply may be given irrespective of actual memory.” Although leading questions generally are prohibited on direct examination, they may be allowed for a limited purpose such as to guide the testimony of a hostile or a purportedly forgetful witness. Boillard, 789 A.2d at 887. Here, it is clear that Smith’s appearance at trial was anything but cooperative; he experienced a failure of memory that could be characterized as hostile and lacking in credibility. A party is entitled to treat a forgetful witness as adverse; and, in an effort to elicit truthful testimony from the witness, the examiner may resort to leading questions. - 10 - It is within the discretion of the trial justice to decide whether to allow the examiner to lead; that discretion, however, is not without limit. See State v. Merced, 933 A.2d 172, 176 (R.I. 2007) (“As our discussion above makes abundantly clear, this scenario is well within the range of those in which a trial justice has discretion to permit the use of leading questions on direct examination.”). However, we are not convinced that the extensive use of leading questions in this case was appropriate based on the length of the examination, and we note that the colloquy between the prosecutor and Smith came dangerously close to a prejudicial abuse of discretion by the trial justice. But we decline to declare it reversible error. Although a trial justice is vested with discretion to decide whether a witness is hostile and, if so, to allow the use of leading questions, the trial justice declared that he was “prepared to stay here all day” while the state posed leading questions to the witness who continued to profess a complete failure of memory. Defense counsel made his objection clear when he said, “I think [the prosecutor’s] continuing line of questioning is fruitless * * * and I think that’s having a prejudicial effect on the jury.” It is evident that the trial justice should have stopped the inquiry when it became obvious that the witness would persist in denying any memory of the events on trial. However, in light of our decision upholding the introduction of Smith’s statement to the police, we deem this harmless error. Smith’s police statement properly was introduced as a prior inconsistent statement of a testifying witness. As such, it was for the jury to decide whether the police statement was credible or whether Smith’s in-court testimony that he suffered a complete failure of memory was worthy of belief. Accordingly, Smith’s response to the prosecutor’s skillful and leading examination was highly probative on this point. Although we are of the - 11 - opinion that the use of leading questions was excessive and should have been brought to a conclusion by the trial justice, we are not convinced that he committed reversible error in refusing to do so. Remaining Issues 1. Grand Jury Testimony We note that defendant’s argument concerning the grand jury recording was not preserved for appellate review. Toward the end of the witness’s direct examination, the prosecutor attempted to refresh Smith’s recollection, yet again, by offering to play a recording of Smith’s testimony before the grand jury. Although defense counsel initially objected and a recorded conference was held outside the presence of the jury, the only objection defendant made was to the secrecy of the grand jury as provided by Rule 6 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. On appeal, however, defendant argues that introducing Smith’s grand jury testimony violated his rights under both the state and federal constitutions. According to our well settled “raise or waive” rule, if an issue was not preserved by specific objection at trial, then it may not be considered on appeal. State v. Pacheco, 763 A.2d 971, 976 (R.I. 2001); State v. Bettencourt, 723 A.2d 1101, 1107 (R.I. 1999). Therefore, unless an allegation of error was brought to the attention of the trial justice, the issue will be deemed waived. 2. The Confrontation Clause We briefly address the constitutional concerns that defendant has raised in this case. The defendant argues that the trial justice violated his constitutional right of confrontation with respect to all aspects of Smith’s testimony: the leading questions, the introduction of his police statement, and the grand jury testimony. - 12 - The United States Supreme Court has declared that the Sixth Amendment is not implicated when the prior statement of a witness who testifies at trial is admitted into evidence, whether or not the witness recalls the statement. See United States v. Owens, 484 U.S. 554, 564 (1988) (holding that the Confrontation Clause is not violated “by admission of an identification statement of a witness who is unable, because of a memory loss, to testify concerning the basis for the identification.”). This Court also has had occasion to review the use of out-of-court statements in light of the Confrontation Clause. In Jaiman, 850 A.2d at 990, we declared: “Even evidence that traditionally would be categorized as hearsay, such as the out-of-court identification at issue in Owens, did not alter the fact that the Confrontation Clause’s requirements are satisfied when a hearsay declarant is present at trial, is placed under oath and is subject to unrestricted cross-examination, thus affording the jury an opportunity to observe the witness’s demeanor.” We note, as did the United States Supreme Court in Owens, 484 U.S. at 563, that it would create a “strange” result indeed if Smith could “avoid introduction of testimony from a prior proceeding that is inconsistent with his trial testimony * * * by simply asserting lack of memory of the facts to which the prior testimony related.” Accordingly, we are satisfied that the introduction of Smith’s police statement and the state’s use of leading questions and the grand jury testimony did not have an impact on defendant’s right to confront his accusers. 5 3. Rule 16 Discovery Violation The defendant argues that because the state failed to list Det. A’Vant as a witness in its discovery response he should have been precluded from testifying at trial. We 5 We also discern no error with Arruda’s testimony at trial. - 13 - reject this contention. Although the state acknowledges that it did not include Det. A’Vant in its witness list, in its answer the state listed as potential witnesses: “Any witnesses and/or testimony before the grand jury not listed above are incorporated herein.” It is evident that this provision addresses the situation before us: when a witness asserts an unexpected failure of memory, it may necessitate calling another witness in order to introduce a prior statement or other inconsistency in the testimony. That precisely is what occurred in this case when Det. A’Vant testified at trial. See State v. Oster, 922 A.2d 151, 165 (R.I. 2007) (In light of its heavy burden of proof, the state may reserve “the right to call witnesses listed in its discovery documents in the event that ‘unforeseen circumstances’ at trial require it to do so[.]”). The record discloses that Det. A’Vant was called to the stand to testify about Smith’s interview and the numerous disclosures he made to the state police, all of which had been made available to defendant before trial. This is not a case of unfair surprise, and there was no showing of bad faith on the part of the prosecutor. Accordingly, we are of the opinion that the trial justice did not err in allowing Det. A’Vant to testify. 4. The Sentence Imposed Finally, the defendant argues that the sentence imposed in this case constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the state and federal constitutions. This issue is not properly before this Court. To challenge a criminal sentence, the defendant must first file a motion to reduce in accordance with Rule 35 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. See State v. Day, 925 A.2d 962, 985 (R.I. 2007) (“It is well settled in this jurisdiction that a challenge to a criminal sentence must begin with the filing of a motion in the Superior Court pursuant to the provisions of Rule 35 of the - 14 - Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.”). Because the defendant has failed to do so, this issue is not ripe for review. Conclusion For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the convictions and remand the record to the Superior Court. - 15 - RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE: State v.

WRITTEN BY: Justice Maureen McKenna Goldberg SOURCE OF APPEAL: Providence County Superior Court JUDGE FROM LOWER COURT: Associate Justice Vincent A. Ragosta ATTORNEYS ON APPEAL: For Plaintiff: Christopher R. Bush Department of Attorney General",criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. The defendant, Joseph McManus (defendant or McManus), is before the Supreme Court on appeal from Superior Court judgments of conviction for criminal solicitation. The defendant was found guilty after a jury trial of soliciting Vincent Arruda (Arruda) to murder Attorney General Jeffrey Pine (Attorney General) and soliciting Robert Smith (Smith) to murder the Attorney General and to feloniously assault Assistant Attorney General Margaret Lynch (Lynch). We affirm.', 'Facts and Travel', 'This case arose in the aftermath of defendant’s horrific murder of his wife on June 29, 1996, in the presence of their children. This Court affirmed his conviction and the sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole that was imposed by the trial justice. See State v. McManus, 941 A.2d 222 (R.I. 2008). While defendant was being held without bail at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI) awaiting trial on the murder charge at the Intake Service Center (Intake), his interaction with four of his fellow inmates are of consequence in this case. The record discloses that Arthur Pine,', '-1- Mark Pine, 1 Robert Smith, and Vincent Arruda, were approached individually by defendant, who wanted to hire a person or people to commit murder and felony assault against the Attorney General and the prosecutor assigned to the case. The defendant was charged, by way of grand jury indictment, with three counts: 2 criminal solicitation of Arthur Pine to commit murder in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-1-9; criminal solicitation of Vincent Arruda to commit murder in violation of § 11-1-9; criminal solicitation of Robert Smith to commit murder and/or assault with a dangerous weapon in violation of § 11-1- 9. 3 In its case in chief, the state called the four men, all of whom were alleged to have engaged in these conversations with defendant.', 'Arthur testified about meeting defendant at Intake; he explained that the two developed a relationship such that defendant asked Arthur, “how much to take care of [the Attorney General]?” When Arthur inquired of defendant how the murder of the Attorney General would help his case, defendant replied, “It’s going to do me a lot of good * * * [he] is using my kids to testify against me.” The defendant went on to describe in detail how the murder should take place. Specifically, defendant wanted the 1', 'Mark and Arthur Pine are brothers, but are not related to Attorney General Jeffrey Pine. We will refer to Arthur and Mark by their first names, to avoid confusion with former Attorney General Jeffrey Pine. 2', 'The grand jury also indicted defendant on two additional counts: threatening a public official with death and threatening a public official with bodily harm. The trial justice granted judgments of acquittal on these counts. 3', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-1-9 entitled “Soliciting another to commit a crime” provides:', '“Every person who solicits another to commit or join in the commission of', 'a felony under the laws of this state shall be guilty of a felony and upon', 'conviction shall be subject to the same fine and imprisonment as pertain to', 'the offense which the person did solicit another to commit, provided that', 'imprisonment for the solicitation shall not exceed ten (10) years.”', '-2- Attorney General to be shot two times – one bullet for each of defendant’s children – because the prosecution intended to call them as trial witnesses in the underlying murder case. Arthur testified that he took copious notes of his various conversations with defendant and eventually went to his correctional officers with this information. An investigation by the state police and the Office of the Attorney General ensued. However, the jury rejected Arthur’s testimony.', 'Mark Pine, Arthur’s brother and fellow inmate, was the second witness to testify about the solicitation. He testified that he met defendant through his brother, while both were at Intake. According to Mark, defendant was aware of the state police investigation and repeatedly asked Mark to tell his attorney that Arthur was lying. Mark testified that defendant, yet again, described in detail how he wanted the Attorney General killed and that he wanted someone to break Lynch’s legs.', 'The crux of this case, however, turns on the testimony, or lack of testimony, of Robert Smith, another jailhouse informant. When Smith was called to testify, he claimed to have suffered an unfortunate and total failure of memory about everything he previously had disclosed to law enforcement, including his police statement and grand jury testimony. The record discloses that Smith was at Intake during the period when defendant actively was recruiting others to carry out his criminal enterprise. During a long discussion with investigators, Smith described his relationship with defendant and disclosed that defendant sought Smith’s help in murdering the Attorney General and assaulting Lynch. According to Smith, defendant offered him $5,000 for his services. Smith also gave detailed testimony before the grand jury.', '-3-', 'However, when testifying at trial, Smith professed a total failure of memory about everything concerning the incident, including his discussions with the state police. After some initial examination, the prosecutor treated Smith as an adverse witness and began to use leading questions. The trial justice allowed the state’s use of leading questions, over defense counsel’s continuing objection.', 'The prosecutor continued to pose leading questions – an effort that spanned fifty-one pages of trial transcript. Defense counsel objected and argued that continuing this line of inquiry was not only fruitless, but was having a prejudicial effect on the jury. The trial justice responded: “[The prosecutor] hasn’t been through the whole thing yet. I’m prepared to stay here all day while [Smith] either answers ‘yes’ or ‘no’ that he doesn’t remember.” The trial justice allowed the questioning to continue but noted counsel’s objection.', 'Additionally, in yet another attempt to refresh the witness’s recollection, a tape recording of Smith’s testimony before the grand jury was played to the jury.', 'After Smith’s turn on the witness stand, the state called Arruda, another of defendant’s fellow inmates. Arruda testified that while at Intake defendant approached him to murder the Attorney General and offered him $25,000 in exchange “to make a hit on the Attorney General.”', 'The state next called John P. A’Vant (Det. A’Vant) from the state police, the detective who investigated this case. Detective A’Vant testified that he tape-recorded the interview with Smith and that the transcript of that interview consisted of 367 questions and fifty pages of transcript. The state sought to have the transcript of the interview introduced as a prior recorded recollection, under Rule 803(5) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. Although defendant objected, he did so on the ground that the document', '-4- had not been authenticated and was neither signed nor witnessed. Defense counsel further argued that the prosecutor essentially had read the entire statement into the record through his use of leading questions to Smith. The trial justice allowed it and explained:', '“* * * I think [the jury has] had the benefit of observing', 'Mr. Smith, they observed the fact that his memory was', 'obviously very poor from what he said and he never denied', 'that he made those statements. As a matter of fact, I think', '[the prosecutor] followed each one of those questions up', 'with something like, ‘Although you don’t recall making', 'these statements, you do not deny that you made them,’', 'words to that effect. And he said, ‘oh, yes.’ He agreed that', 'he must have made the statements.”', 'The defendant was acquitted by the jury on count 1, criminal solicitation of Arthur Pine, but was found guilty on the remaining counts. The trial justice sentenced him to ten-year sentences on each of the two convictions, to be served consecutively. 4 He filed a timely notice of appeal.', 'Issues on Appeal', 'On appeal, defendant raises a number of issues which, he contends, amount to an abuse of discretion by the trial justice and warrant reversal of his conviction. The defendant first points to three instances of purported error during Smith’s testimony: the state’s use of leading questions; the introduction of Smith’s grand jury testimony; and error by the trial justice in allowing the transcript of Smith’s interview with the investigators to be introduced as a full exhibit. Next, defendant argues that the trial justice committed error when he allowed Det. A’Vant to testify because the state had failed to list him as a witness in its responses to the defendant’s discovery requests. 4', 'It should be noted that defendant also received a sentence of life without the possibility of parole for the murder of his wife. See State v. McManus, 941 A.2d 222, 224 (R.I. 2008).', '-5-', 'The defendant also avers that the trial justice erred in permitting Arruda and Smith to testify, contending that their testimony violated his constitutional right to confrontation and cross-examination and violated Rule 16 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. Finally, defendant contends that his sentence violated both the state and federal constitutions as cruel and unusual punishment. However, as we consistently have held, this Court “will only review those issues that have been properly preserved for appellate review.” State v. Reyes, 984 A.2d 606, 613 (R.I. 2009); State v. Harris, 871 A.2d 341, 345 (R.I. 2005).', 'Standard of Review', 'Before this Court, defendant challenges several rulings that the Superior Court trial justice made with regard to evidence and trial procedures. The applicable standard of review of a trial justice’s admission of evidence is a clear abuse of discretion. Reyes, 984 A.2d at 614-15. Additionally, the standard of review of a challenge to a trial justice’s restriction on cross-examination is clear abuse of discretion. State v. Feole, 748 A.2d 239, 242 (R.I. 2000) (“This Court has previously concluded that the exercise of discretion by the trial justice in limiting the scope of cross-examination will not be disturbed absent a clear abuse of that discretion.”) (quoting State v. Walsh, 731 A.2d 696, 698 (R.I. 1999)).', 'Analysis', 'The Testimony of Robert Smith', 'The defendant challenges evidentiary errors in Smith’s testimony on three grounds. First, he contends that the trial justice abused his discretion by allowing the state to pose leading questions to Smith during its direct examination. Second, he argues', '-6- that the trial justice abused his discretion in admitting Smith’s police statement. Lastly, defendant contends that the trial justice abused his discretion by permitting the state to introduce Smith’s grand jury testimony.', 'Because our holding with respect to the admission of Smith’s police statement is determinative of the challenge to the use of the leading questions, we shall address these issues in that order.', 'Smith’s Police Statement', 'We first address defendant’s contention that the trial justice erred by allowing Smith’s police statement to be introduced at trial. At issue is the fifty-page transcript of the statement Smith gave to detectives A’Vant and Lamont on March 19, 1997, while at the ACI. Over defense counsel’s objection, the trial justice allowed the statement into evidence, as a recorded recollection under Rule 803(5). Rule 803(5) provides:', '“A memorandum or record concerning a matter about', 'which a witness once had knowledge but now has', 'insufficient recollection to enable the witness to testify', 'fully and accurately, shown to have been made or adopted', 'by the witness when the matter was fresh in the witness’', 'memory and to reflect that knowledge correctly. If', 'admitted, the memorandum or record may be read into', 'evidence and received as an exhibit.”', 'We previously have had occasion to consider the use of a recorded recollection under Rule 803(5) and the four prerequisites to admissibility: (1) that the witness whose prior statement is sought to be introduced have firsthand knowledge of the event at issue; (2) that the recorded memoranda was made “at or near the time of the event while the witness had a clear memory;” (3) that the witness is now unable to recall the incident independently; and (4) that the witness can attest “that the recorded recollection was accurate when made.” State v. Gabriau, 696 A.2d 290, 297 (R.I. 1997) (quoting State v. Ricci, 639 A.2d 64, 67 (R.I. 1994)); State v. Vento, 533 A.2d 1161, 1165 (R.I. 1987).', '-7-', 'The record discloses that Smith never acknowledged, and indeed refused to admit, that the recorded recollection was accurate when made; and thus it was impossible for the proponent to meet the fourth requirement of Rule 803(5), that “the witness can attest that the recorded recollection was accurate when made.” Gabriau, 696 A.2d at 297. “Past recollection recorded has historically been a vehicle for the admission of prior statements when live testimony is not available because of a lack of memory.” Id. Under this reasoning, a prior recorded document is admitted as a substitute “for the current lack of adequate memory of the events.” Id. That is not what transpired in this case because Smith refused to acknowledge the accuracy of the statement.', 'The state conceded this error in its brief and admitted that, “[t]he fourth prerequisite, which requires the witness to attest to the accuracy of the statement sought to be admitted under [Rule] 803(5), is a much closer question.” However, the state urges us to affirm the ruling on other grounds. In State v. Froais, 653 A.2d 735, 738 (R.I. 1995), this Court declared that, “we have long upheld a trial justice’s decision in various contexts even though the specific grounds relied upon by the justice were erroneous.” Indeed, there are numerous examples of our having done just that: State v. Ellis, 619 A.2d 418, 425-26 (R.I. 1993) (decision to allow the defendant’s statement into evidence upheld on different factual findings than were relied upon by the trial justice); State v. Nordstrom, 529 A.2d 107, 111 (R.I. 1987) (“This court on appeal is free to affirm a ruling on grounds other than those stated by the lower-court judge.”). Accordingly, we are satisfied that when an out-of-court statement is admissible under a recognized exception to the hearsay rule, we shall uphold its admission, notwithstanding any error on the trial justice’s ruling.', '-8-', 'The state suggests, and we agree, that the statement could have been admitted as a prior inconsistent statement in accordance with Rule 801(d)(1)(A) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. Specifically, Rule 801(d)(1)(A) provides:', '“A statement is not hearsay if: (1) Prior Statement by', 'Witness. The declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and', 'is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement,', 'and the statement is (A) inconsistent with the declarant’s', 'testimony * * *.”', 'The state points to our decision in State v. Jaiman, 850 A.2d 984 (R.I. 2004), as support for its contention that we should affirm the admission of the statement under to Rule 801(d)(1)(A). In Jaiman, the state was faced with a previously cooperative witness who “engaged in a testimonial double-cross of the state” while at trial. Jaiman, 850 A.2d at 985. The state attempted to refresh the witness’s recollection on direct examination by using his prior statement to the police; and a portion of that statement eventually came into evidence under agreement by both parties. Id. at 986. Later in the trial, the state sought to introduce additional portions of the statement through a witness who was present when the statement was made. Id. We upheld its admission and declared:', '“Accordingly, the touchstone of Rule 801(d)(1)(A)', 'is that the witness testify at trial and be available for cross-', 'examination. Although [the witness] did testify at trial and', 'was, in fact, cross-examined, [the] defendant contends that', '[the witness’s] comprehensive inability to recall either his', 'previous testimony or some of the events of September 18,', '1993, rendered him functionally unavailable for cross-', 'examination. We disagree; the rule against hearsay is not', 'violated by resort to a prior out-of-court statement by a', 'witness who is reneging on his cooperation agreement', 'based on his ostensible belief that truthful testimony was a', 'once-in-a-lifetime proposition.” Jaiman, 850 A.2d at 988.', 'Here, as in Jaiman, Smith testified at trial and was available for cross- examination.', 'Although the witness purported to suffer from jail-house amnesia, a', '-9- frequent malaise, this circumstance does not negate the underlying rationale for admissibility under Rule 801(d)(1)(A). In fact, this precisely is the reason for the rule: to allow for statements, such as Smith’s statement to the state police, to be introduced as substantive evidence in order for the fact finder to decide which statement, if any, is worthy of belief. We conclude that the introduction of Smith’s statement to the police investigators was proper under Rule 801(d)(1)(A).', 'Leading Questions', 'We next turn to defendant’s argument that the repeated use of leading questions to Smith on direct examination was so pervasive as to create prejudice in the eyes of the jury – an issue we perceive as problematic because of its duration and scope. We note that defense counsel was granted a continuing objection to the use of leading questions, as acknowledged by the trial justice on more than one occasion. Leading questions are questions that suggest the desired answer. State v. Boillard, 789 A.2d 881, 887 (R.I. 2002). As we declared in State v. Girouard, 561 A.2d 882, 888 (R.I. 1989), “[t]he danger of a leading question is that it may suggest to the witness the specific tenor of the reply desired by counsel and such a reply may be given irrespective of actual memory.” Although leading questions generally are prohibited on direct examination, they may be allowed for a limited purpose such as to guide the testimony of a hostile or a purportedly forgetful witness. Boillard, 789 A.2d at 887.', 'Here, it is clear that Smith’s appearance at trial was anything but cooperative; he experienced a failure of memory that could be characterized as hostile and lacking in credibility. A party is entitled to treat a forgetful witness as adverse; and, in an effort to elicit truthful testimony from the witness, the examiner may resort to leading questions.', '- 10 - It is within the discretion of the trial justice to decide whether to allow the examiner to lead; that discretion, however, is not without limit. See State v. Merced, 933 A.2d 172, 176 (R.I. 2007) (“As our discussion above makes abundantly clear, this scenario is well within the range of those in which a trial justice has discretion to permit the use of leading questions on direct examination.”).', 'However, we are not convinced that the extensive use of leading questions in this case was appropriate based on the length of the examination, and we note that the colloquy between the prosecutor and Smith came dangerously close to a prejudicial abuse of discretion by the trial justice. But we decline to declare it reversible error. Although a trial justice is vested with discretion to decide whether a witness is hostile and, if so, to allow the use of leading questions, the trial justice declared that he was “prepared to stay here all day” while the state posed leading questions to the witness who continued to profess a complete failure of memory. Defense counsel made his objection clear when he said, “I think [the prosecutor’s] continuing line of questioning is fruitless * * * and I think that’s having a prejudicial effect on the jury.” It is evident that the trial justice should have stopped the inquiry when it became obvious that the witness would persist in denying any memory of the events on trial. However, in light of our decision upholding the introduction of Smith’s statement to the police, we deem this harmless error.', 'Smith’s police statement properly was introduced as a prior inconsistent statement of a testifying witness. As such, it was for the jury to decide whether the police statement was credible or whether Smith’s in-court testimony that he suffered a complete failure of memory was worthy of belief. Accordingly, Smith’s response to the prosecutor’s skillful and leading examination was highly probative on this point. Although we are of the', '- 11 - opinion that the use of leading questions was excessive and should have been brought to a conclusion by the trial justice, we are not convinced that he committed reversible error in refusing to do so.', 'Remaining Issues', '1. Grand Jury Testimony', 'We note that defendant’s argument concerning the grand jury recording was not preserved for appellate review. Toward the end of the witness’s direct examination, the prosecutor attempted to refresh Smith’s recollection, yet again, by offering to play a recording of Smith’s testimony before the grand jury. Although defense counsel initially objected and a recorded conference was held outside the presence of the jury, the only objection defendant made was to the secrecy of the grand jury as provided by Rule 6 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. On appeal, however, defendant argues that introducing Smith’s grand jury testimony violated his rights under both the state and federal constitutions. According to our well settled “raise or waive” rule, if an issue was not preserved by specific objection at trial, then it may not be considered on appeal. State v. Pacheco, 763 A.2d 971, 976 (R.I. 2001); State v. Bettencourt, 723 A.2d 1101, 1107 (R.I. 1999). Therefore, unless an allegation of error was brought to the attention of the trial justice, the issue will be deemed waived.', '2. The Confrontation Clause', 'We briefly address the constitutional concerns that defendant has raised in this case.

50,"In re Miguel A. : Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty, and Robinson, JJ. OPINION Justice Goldberg, for the Court. This case came before the Supreme Court on March 3, 2010, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. The respondent, Miguel A. (Miguel or respondent), appeals from an adjudication of delinquency entered in the Family Court. The respondent makes numerous contentions on appeal. He argues: (1) that the trial justice erred by precluding two witnesses from testifying; (2) that the trial justice erred by denying his motions for judgment of acquittal; and (3) that his due process right to present a defense was violated because of the vagueness of the state’s accusations against him. After reviewing the memoranda submitted by the parties and hearing counsel’s arguments, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown, and thus the appeal may be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth below, we deny and dismiss the appeal, and affirm the adjudication of delinquency. Facts and Travel In January 2008, the Providence Police Department filed a delinquency petition with the Family Court, alleging that when Miguel was sixteen years old, he committed -1- three offenses which, if committed by an adult, would constitute first-degree child molestation sexual assault, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-37-8.1. 1 During the delinquency hearing, the state called two witnesses. The first witness was the eight-year-old victim, Pablo, 2 who testified that Miguel, whom he had known for many years, was the younger brother of Pablo’s mother’s ex-boyfriend, Christian. Pablo recalled that during the summer of 2007, when he was only seven years old, he and Miguel accompanied his mother and Christian to a supermarket. Miguel and Pablo stayed in the car while Pablo’s mother and Christian went shopping. Pablo said that while they were in the car, Miguel forced him to perform fellatio and then told him not to tell anyone. He testified that during that summer, the same thing happened three additional times, including at Pablo’s home and at Miguel’s home. Pablo remembered details about some of these incidents, including what type of clothing Miguel was wearing; he also described Miguel’s penis. The child testified that he was afraid to tell anyone because Miguel had told him “that something bad was going to happen * * * if I told someone.” Finally, Pablo testified that he ultimately told his great-grandmother, Caroline (Caroline), about the molestation, because he was “tired of hiding it.” Caroline also testified; she described the afternoon when Pablo disclosed what Miguel did to him. She testified that she was on the telephone when Pablo came into her bedroom and told her what happened: “[H]e said to me, ‘I’m not gay, I’m not gay.’ I said to him, what are you have [sic] talking about. He said [Miguel] is trying to make me gay. I said who is that. He said, Christian’s brother.* * * He told me that they were at – his 1 General Laws 1956 § 11-37-8.1 provides that, “[a] person is guilty of first degree child molestation sexual assault if he or she engages in sexual penetration with a person fourteen (14) years of age or under.” 2 We shall use a pseudonym throughout this opinion to protect the victim’s privacy. -2- mother was taking him to the market and left him in the car with the boy.* * * He said when in the car, * * * they were in the back seat and [Miguel] made him [perform fellatio].” Caroline stated that she called the Department of Children, Youth and Families, to report the incident. She also testified that on a separate occasion, Pablo told her about other incidents of abuse by Miguel. After the state rested, Miguel moved for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that the charges were “lacking in specificity, and [are] very difficult to defend for that reason.” He also argued that Pablo’s testimony was vague and inconsistent with Caroline’s testimony. The trial justice denied the motion, stating: “[T]he [c]ourt felt strongly in listening to the victim’s testimony that it was consistent; it was as clear and concise as it could be for an eight year old boy recounting events that occurred about one year ago when he was seven years old. The [c]ourt felt very strongly this boy offered as much detail as was available to his young mind.* * * In addition, the [c]ourt believes that the great-grandmother’s testimony was likewise consistent with the victim’s testimony[.]” The defense proceeded with its case and attempted to call respondent’s mother to the witness stand, but the state objected because the witness had not been listed in the discovery response filed in accordance with Rule 10 of the Family Court Rules of Juvenile Proceedings. 3 Defense counsel proffered that Miguel’s mother would testify about the background history between Miguel’s family and Pablo’s family, and he argued 3 Rule 10(a) of the Family Court Rules of Juvenile Proceedings provides in pertinent part: “Upon written request, the attorney for the State shall deliver promptly to the child or the child’s attorney a list of witnesses intended to be called by the State and a summary of the testimony each is expected to give. Upon compliance with such request, the attorney for the State may similarly request of the child or the child’s attorney a list of witnesses intended to be called on behalf of the child and a summary of the testimony expected of each.” -3- that if the witness testified, there would be no prejudice to the state’s case. Defense counsel admitted that, although he had spoken to the prosecutor previously assigned to the case and had discussed the possibility of calling Miguel’s mother, he had not provided written notice to the state, based on Rule 10(a). The trial justice noted that there had been a number of continuances in this case and concluded that the state would be prejudiced by having the witness testify without an opportunity to prepare for cross- examination. Miguel also testified; he explained, by way of background, where he went to school, and where he worked. He testified that he knew Pablo because Pablo’s mother and Christian had dated for a number of years, but he added that he rarely saw Pablo and was never alone with him. He testified that he had never been to the supermarket parking lot, and he denied that he forced Pablo to perform fellatio. Defense counsel next attempted to call Miguel’s psychiatrist, Dr. James Greer (Dr. Greer), as an expert witness. Because Dr. Greer was unavailable, counsel sought a continuance. Defense counsel proffered that Dr. Greer would testify that Miguel was being treated for stress and depression and that there had “never been any evidence [Miguel] either suffered any sexual or physical abuse or any form of abuse, or a history which suggested he has a history of inappropriate sexual behavior.” Arguing that defense counsel, again, failed to provide written notice of the witness and his expected testimony, the state objected to any continuance for Dr. Greer. Additionally, the state argued that the testimony was irrelevant and inadmissible under Rule 401 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. 4 Defense counsel admitted that he did not provide the state’s attorney with 4 Rule 401 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence provides: -4- written notice about this witness or his proposed testimony. The trial justice found that defense counsel violated Rule 10 and, additionally, that Dr Greer’s testimony would be irrelevant to the issues before the court. After this exchange, Miguel rested, and did not renew his motion for judgment of acquittal. After the two-day hearing, the trial justice found “beyond a reasonable doubt, in fact, beyond any doubt” that Miguel was delinquent on all three charges. In passing on the credibility of the witnesses, the trial justice found that Pablo “was as credible as a witness could possibly be.” On October 2, 2008, Miguel was sentenced to the training school. 5 Additionally, sex offender treatment and registration were made a condition of Miguel’s sentence. This timely appeal followed. Standard of Review This Court previously has declared that “[t]he deferential standard of review we follow when considering an appeal from an adjudication of delinquency is to review the record to determine ‘whether legally competent evidence exists therein to support the findings made by the Family Court trial justice.’” In re Andrey G., 796 A.2d 452, 455- 56 (R.I. 2002) (quoting In re Ryan B., 739 A.2d 232, 235 (R.I. 1999)). Additionally, we give great deference to the findings of fact made by the trial justice, and we will not disturb such findings unless he or she overlooked or misconceived material evidence or otherwise was clearly wrong. In re Vannarith D., 731 A.2d 685, 688-89 (R.I. 1999). “‘Relevant evidence’ means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.” 5 Miguel since has finished his sentence at the training school. -5- Analysis I Evidentiary Rulings Defense Counsel’s Failure to Comply with Rule 10 The respondent first challenges the trial justice’s rulings precluding his mother and Dr. Greer as witnesses, based upon defense counsel’s failure to comply with Rule 10. 6 Rule 10(a) provides that the attorney for the state, by written request, may ask the juvenile’s attorney to provide a list of witnesses expected to be called to testify on behalf of the respondent and to provide a summary of their testimony. Rule 10(c) governs the trial justice’s options when a party or the party’s attorney fails to comply with discovery obligations. Rule 10(c) provides: “If at any time during the course of the proceedings it is brought to the attention of the court that a party has failed to comply with this Rule or with an order issued pursuant to this Rule, it may order such a party to provide the discovery or inspection, grant a continuance, or make such other order as it deems appropriate. Upon finding a willful failure to comply, the court may prohibit the offending party from introducing in evidence the material or the testimony of a witness whose identity or statement was not disclosed.” (Emphasis added.) It is undisputed that defense counsel failed to provide the state with an appropriate discovery response containing the names of Miguel’s mother and Dr. Greer. Miguel argues on appeal, however, that the trial justice failed to find a “willful failure to comply,” and thus, the witnesses should have been permitted to testify. We are mindful that “the admissibility of evidence is placed within the sound discretion of the trial justice whose determination of admissibility will not be disturbed 6 Defense counsel at oral argument analogized this argument as the antithesis to the Na’Vi greeting “I see you” from James Cameron’s popular cinematic epic, “Avatar.” We think that an analogy to “Gone With the Wind” would have been more appropriate. -6- on review ‘unless a clear abuse of that discretion is apparent.’” In re Vannarith D., 731 A.2d at 689 (quoting State ex. rel. Town of Middletown v. Anthony, 713 A.2d 207, 210 (R.I. 1998)); see also State v. Martinez, 824 A.2d 443, 450 (R.I. 2003) (recognizing that the trial justice’s decision to exclude evidence is not reversible error unless there was an abuse of discretion that caused substantial injury to the party seeking to introduce the evidence). Additionally, the trial justice is in the best position to determine whether harm has resulted from an attorney’s failure to comply with discovery. State v. Musumeci, 717 A.2d 56, 60 (R.I. 1998). With respect to Miguel’s mother, the trial justice properly found that defense counsel failed to comply with Rule 10. Defense counsel explained that he discussed with a previous prosecutor that he anticipated calling Miguel’s mother; but he admitted that he did not provide written notice. “[Court] The objection was that you did not provide the State with notice of this witness and a summary of her testimony. Could you respond to that, please? “[Defense Counsel] I don’t feel it would be any prejudice to the State, Your Honor. I discussed this possibility with prior counsel. “[Court] You didn’t provide written notice. “[Defense Counsel] I didn’t provide written notice, no.” The trial justice found that: “the [respondent] had ample opportunity to provide the State with a list of witnesses and the summary of their testimony. That was not done. * * * [T]his matter has been continued a number of times. I believe the State would be prejudiced by hearing this witness’[s] testimony, as they did not have ample opportunity to prepare Cross Examination. They have no idea what this witness is going to testify to * * *.” -7- Additionally, with respect to Dr. Greer, defense counsel again admitted that he did not comply with the discovery rules. The trial justice found that counsel did not comply with Rule 10, and denied respondent’s request for continuance, effectively excluding Dr. Greer’s testimony. Rule 10(c) allows the trial justice to exclude evidence upon finding that there was a “willful failure to comply.” Black’s Law Dictionary defines “willful” as “[v]oluntary and intentional.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1737 (9th ed. 2009). The evidence in the record is clear. Defense counsel admitted that he did not comply with Rule 10 and offered no excuse for this omission. It is our opinion that this was voluntary and intentional, and thus, falls within Rule 10(c). We perceive no basis for holding that the trial justice abused her discretion in enforcing the rule as written. Evidentiary Issues Pertaining to Dr. Greer’s Testimony The respondent next argues that the trial justice abused her discretion when she refused to allow Dr. Greer to testify. He contends that the proffered evidence was material to whether Miguel was likely to commit sexual abuse. According to defense counsel, Dr. Greer would testify that Miguel had no history of being sexually abused, and that “there has never been any evidence he either suffered any sexual or physical abuse or any form of abuse, or a history which suggested he has a history of inappropriate sexual behavior.” The trial justice found that his testimony would be irrelevant, stating that, “[t]his Court [will] not entertain an expert’s testimony that is his belief that [Miguel], or anybody, has not committed any act of sexual inappropriateness. I don’t know how the doctor can say that with a reasonable degree of certainty.” We agree with this ruling. On appeal, respondent argues that the recent decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, Esposito v. Home Depot -8- U.S.A., Inc., 590 F.3d 72 (1st Cir. 2009), is controlling on whether it is reversible error for a trial justice to bar testimony of a key witness in light of the availability of less severe sanctions. The case at bar, however, easily can be distinguished from Esposito. The First Circuit held that the judge’s decision to preclude the expert witness from testifying effectively amounted to a dismissal of the plaintiff’s case because the plaintiff had a great need for the witness. Id. at 78-79 (recognizing that “[b]oth of the parties acknowledge that the decision to exclude the [p]laintiff’s expert as a result of missing the discovery deadlines will, without much doubt, effectively dispose of the case”). In the case at bar, however, the proffered testimony of the expert witness, Dr. Greer, was wholly irrelevant. It would by no means be dispositive to the outcome of the case; in fact, it is our opinion that it would have had no evidentiary value whatsoever. Additionally, we reject respondent’s contention that Dr. Greer’s testimony falls within the provisions of Rule 404(a)(1) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. That rule provides that evidence of a person’s character, in certain circumstances, may be admissible to prove the existence of a pertinent character trait. In State v. Benoit, 697 A.2d 329, 331 (R.I. 1997), this Court held that “excluding evidence of good character in respect to a pertinent trait cannot generally be considered harmless [error].” Here, however, the proffered testimony would not serve to prove a pertinent character trait; it would not serve to prove any character trait. Indeed, it is difficult for this Court to fathom what evidentiary purpose this “opinion” would further. Thus, we cannot state that the trial justice abused her discretion, nor that there would have been a different outcome had the testimony been allowed. -9- Compulsory Process Clause Violation Finally, respondent argues that the trial justice’s refusal to allow Miguel’s mother and Dr. Greer to testify, denied him his fundamental right to present a defense under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution 7 and thus violated the compulsory process clause therein. This Court reviews allegations that constitutional rights have been infringed de novo. State v. Gehrke, 835 A.2d 433, 436 (R.I. 2003). The respondent, however, failed to present this argument to the trial justice. This Court’s “raise-or-waive” rule precludes our consideration of an issue that was not raised or articulated at trial. Resendes v. Brown, 966 A.2d 1249, 1254 (R.I. 2009). We have recognized that an exception to the raise-or-waive rule arises when basic constitutional rights are involved; however, “the alleged error must be more than harmless, and the exception must implicate an issue of constitutional dimension derived from a novel rule of law that could not reasonably have been known to counsel at the time of trial.” State v. Breen, 767 A.2d 50, 57 (R.I. 2001). The respondent does not meet this exception. In the case at bar, the proffered evidence from Miguel’s mother was unnecessary8 and the proposed testimony from Dr. Greer was inadmissible and irrelevant; thus, we are satisfied that the trial justice’s decision to preclude their testimony was not an abuse of discretion. 7 The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that “[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right * * * to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor * * *.” 8 Pablo already had spoken about the family hostilities that Miguel’s mother would have disclosed if she had testified. Defense counsel asked Pablo, “[s]o you knew your mother didn’t like Christian anymore after you went into the second grade; didn’t you?” and Pablo replied, “[y]es.” Then, defense counsel asked Pablo, “it was after you realized your mother didn’t like Christian anymore, that you decided to tell these stories; isn’t that true?” and Pablo responded in the affirmative. - 10 - II Motion for Judgment of Acquittal The respondent’s second argument on appeal concerns the trial justice’s decision to deny Miguel’s motions for acquittal. 9 Although it has not been raised by the state, we are not convinced that this issue properly was preserved. At the conclusion of the state’s case, Miguel moved for judgment of acquittal; this motion was denied. Miguel proceeded to present a defense, but then failed to renew the motion at the close of evidence. “It is well established that the ‘denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal made at the close of the state’s case is preserved for appeal only if the defense has rested its case * * * or renews the motion at the conclusion of the presentation of all the evidence.’” State v. Disla, 874 A.2d 190, 195 (R.I. 2005) (quoting State v. Andreozzi, 798 A.2d 372, 374 (R.I. 2002)). Consequently, if the respondent fails to renew the motion, “any review of the denial of the judgment of acquittal is foreclosed.” State v. Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 569 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. Colbert, 549 A.2d 1021, 1023 (R.I. 1988)). Thus, respondent did not properly preserve this issue for appellate review. Nonetheless, even if the question properly was before us, we would affirm the trial justice’s finding of delinquency. On review of a judgment of acquittal, this Court will apply the same standards as the trial justice. State v. Sivo, 809 A.2d 481, 487 (R.I. 2002). “We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, giving full credibility to its witnesses, and drawing all reasonable inferences consistent with guilt.” State v. Grant, 946 A.2d 818, 826 (R.I. 2008). “If such evidence, ‘viewed in this light, is 9 We note that this is a jury-waived trial. Technically, respondent should have moved for a motion to dismiss rather than a motion for acquittal. See State v. McKone, 673 A.2d 1068, 1072 (R.I. 1996) (recognizing that in a jury-waived trial, “the appropriate motion by which a defendant may challenge the legal sufficiency of the state’s trial evidence at the close of the state’s case is by motion to dismiss”). - 11 - sufficient to support a verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, the motion must be denied.’” Id. (quoting State v. Mondesir, 891 A.2d 856, 861 (R.I. 2006)). With this standard in mind, we are satisfied that the trial justice’s findings were correct. The trial justice found: “This young boy testified before this Court yesterday and was a better witness than most adults I’ve seen.* * * He was young, but bright. He was articulate.* * * He was as credible as a witness could possibly be.” On the other hand, the trial justice found Miguel’s testimony to be wholly lacking: “[The respondent] doesn’t remember anything. His memory was more vague than the eight-year-old child.” We are mindful that “[g]enerally the crime of sexual molestation depends upon the credibility of the complaining witness as opposed to the credibility of the [respondent].” Benoit, 697 A.2d at 331. In this case, Pablo’s testimony was clear and concise, and we discern no evidence of the “pervasive inconsistencies” that respondent insists exist between the state’s two witnesses. 10 Additionally, we note that Miguel’s testimony was lacking, at best. He could not recall basic everyday information, such as the name of his employer. He could not recall how long he worked at a particular after-school job. He could not even recall if there was a supermarket in his neighborhood; nonetheless, he contended that he had never been to the supermarket parking lot with Pablo. It is this Court’s opinion that there was ample foundation for the trial justice to find that Miguel’s testimony lacked credibility, and thus, 10 Pablo testified that during the first incident, he and Miguel were sitting in the back seat and then moved to the front seat when the molestation occurred. Caroline testified that Pablo told her that the molestation occurred in the back seat. Additionally, Pablo testified that when he told Caroline what occurred in the supermarket parking lot, she was in the guest bedroom. Caroline testified that she was in her bedroom. These inconsistencies are hardly pervasive. - 12 - even if respondent properly preserved this argument on appeal, it would not change the result. III Due Process Violation The respondent’s final contention on appeal is that his due process right to present a defense was violated because the state failed to present sufficient information about the charges; specifically, he contends that the state did not provide exact dates when the sexual molestations occurred. The respondent argued to the trial justice that it was difficult to defend the case because the charges were “lacking in specificity and time and place.” We deem this argument without merit. We are mindful that this Court reviews allegations of constitutional infringements de novo. Gehrke, 835 A.2d at 436. We also note that it is well settled in this jurisdiction that the state does not have to prove the exact date a crime occurs, but rather may allege that the acts occurred within a certain timeframe. State v. Pray, 690 A.2d 1338, 1342 (R.I. 1997) (citing State v. Brown, 619 A.2d 828, 832 (R.I. 1993); State v. McKenna, 512 A.2d 113, 114-15 (R.I. 1986)); see also Pierce v. Wall, 941 A.2d 189, 194 (R.I. 2008) (recognizing same). In the case at bar, the trial justice properly indicated that the court would not expect an eight-year-old to remember the specific dates of the incidents, and she recognized that the state was not required to prove the exact dates of the incidents. Additionally, she found that Pablo was a credible witness. Pablo testified that the approximate time period when the events occurred was during the summer of 2007. Further, he testified about the circumstances of the incidents, their nature, and their location. In one instance, he even described the clothing that Miguel was wearing. There - 13 - is nothing in the record before us demonstrating that the respondent was precluded from presenting a defense. Additionally, even if the information or trial testimony referred to specific dates, we note that this would have had no effect on Miguel’s defense. It is clear from the record that Miguel’s defense was based on the contention that Miguel and Pablo never were alone together. Therefore, because the respondent denied that he spent time alone with the victim, whether he did not do so on a specific date was irrelevant. Conclusion For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm the adjudication of delinquency and direct that the record be remanded to the Family Court. - 14 - Supreme Court No. 2009-63-Appeal. (03-468-1) In re Miguel A. :",criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. This case came before the Supreme Court on March 3, 2010, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. The respondent, Miguel A. (Miguel or respondent), appeals from an adjudication of delinquency entered in the Family Court. The respondent makes numerous contentions on appeal. He argues: (1) that the trial justice erred by precluding two witnesses from testifying; (2) that the trial justice erred by denying his motions for judgment of acquittal; and (3) that his due process right to present a defense was violated because of the vagueness of the state’s accusations against him. After reviewing the memoranda submitted by the parties and hearing counsel’s arguments, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown, and thus the appeal may be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth below, we deny and dismiss the appeal, and affirm the adjudication of delinquency.', 'Facts and Travel', 'In January 2008, the Providence Police Department filed a delinquency petition with the Family Court, alleging that when Miguel was sixteen years old, he committed', '-1- three offenses which, if committed by an adult, would constitute first-degree child molestation sexual assault, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-37-8.1. 1', 'During the delinquency hearing, the state called two witnesses. The first witness was the eight-year-old victim, Pablo, 2 who testified that Miguel, whom he had known for many years, was the younger brother of Pablo’s mother’s ex-boyfriend, Christian. Pablo recalled that during the summer of 2007, when he was only seven years old, he and Miguel accompanied his mother and Christian to a supermarket. Miguel and Pablo stayed in the car while Pablo’s mother and Christian went shopping. Pablo said that while they were in the car, Miguel forced him to perform fellatio and then told him not to tell anyone.', 'He testified that during that summer, the same thing happened three additional times, including at Pablo’s home and at Miguel’s home. Pablo remembered details about some of these incidents, including what type of clothing Miguel was wearing; he also described Miguel’s penis. The child testified that he was afraid to tell anyone because Miguel had told him “that something bad was going to happen * * * if I told someone.” Finally, Pablo testified that he ultimately told his great-grandmother, Caroline (Caroline), about the molestation, because he was “tired of hiding it.”', 'Caroline also testified; she described the afternoon when Pablo disclosed what Miguel did to him. She testified that she was on the telephone when Pablo came into her bedroom and told her what happened:', '“[H]e said to me, ‘I’m not gay, I’m not gay.’ I said to him,', 'what are you have [sic] talking about. He said [Miguel] is', 'trying to make me gay. I said who is that. He said,', 'Christian’s brother.* * * He told me that they were at – his 1', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-37-8.1 provides that, “[a] person is guilty of first degree child molestation sexual assault if he or she engages in sexual penetration with a person fourteen (14) years of age or under.” 2', 'We shall use a pseudonym throughout this opinion to protect the victim’s privacy.', '-2-', 'mother was taking him to the market and left him in the car', 'with the boy.* * * He said when in the car, * * * they were', 'in the back seat and [Miguel] made him [perform fellatio].” Caroline stated that she called the Department of Children, Youth and Families, to report the incident. She also testified that on a separate occasion, Pablo told her about other incidents of abuse by Miguel.', 'After the state rested, Miguel moved for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that the charges were “lacking in specificity, and [are] very difficult to defend for that reason.” He also argued that Pablo’s testimony was vague and inconsistent with Caroline’s testimony. The trial justice denied the motion, stating:', '“[T]he [c]ourt felt strongly in listening to the victim’s', 'testimony that it was consistent; it was as clear and concise', 'as it could be for an eight year old boy recounting events', 'that occurred about one year ago when he was seven years', 'old. The [c]ourt felt very strongly this boy offered as much', 'detail as was available to his young mind.* * * In addition,', 'the [c]ourt believes that the great-grandmother’s testimony', 'was likewise consistent with the victim’s testimony[.]”', 'The defense proceeded with its case and attempted to call respondent’s mother to the witness stand, but the state objected because the witness had not been listed in the discovery response filed in accordance with Rule 10 of the Family Court Rules of Juvenile Proceedings. 3 Defense counsel proffered that Miguel’s mother would testify about the background history between Miguel’s family and Pablo’s family, and he argued 3', 'Rule 10(a) of the Family Court Rules of Juvenile Proceedings provides in pertinent part:', '“Upon written request, the attorney for the State shall deliver promptly to', 'the child or the child’s attorney a list of witnesses intended to be called by', 'the State and a summary of the testimony each is expected to give. Upon', 'compliance with such request, the attorney for the State may similarly', 'request of the child or the child’s attorney a list of witnesses intended to be', 'called on behalf of the child and a summary of the testimony expected of', 'each.”', '-3- that if the witness testified, there would be no prejudice to the state’s case. Defense counsel admitted that, although he had spoken to the prosecutor previously assigned to the case and had discussed the possibility of calling Miguel’s mother, he had not provided written notice to the state, based on Rule 10(a). The trial justice noted that there had been a number of continuances in this case and concluded that the state would be prejudiced by having the witness testify without an opportunity to prepare for cross- examination.', 'Miguel also testified; he explained, by way of background, where he went to school, and where he worked. He testified that he knew Pablo because Pablo’s mother and Christian had dated for a number of years, but he added that he rarely saw Pablo and was never alone with him. He testified that he had never been to the supermarket parking lot, and he denied that he forced Pablo to perform fellatio.', 'Defense counsel next attempted to call Miguel’s psychiatrist, Dr. James Greer (Dr. Greer), as an expert witness. Because Dr. Greer was unavailable, counsel sought a continuance. Defense counsel proffered that Dr. Greer would testify that Miguel was being treated for stress and depression and that there had “never been any evidence [Miguel] either suffered any sexual or physical abuse or any form of abuse, or a history which suggested he has a history of inappropriate sexual behavior.” Arguing that defense counsel, again, failed to provide written notice of the witness and his expected testimony, the state objected to any continuance for Dr. Greer. Additionally, the state argued that the testimony was irrelevant and inadmissible under Rule 401 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. 4 Defense counsel admitted that he did not provide the state’s attorney with 4', 'Rule 401 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence provides:', '-4- written notice about this witness or his proposed testimony. The trial justice found that defense counsel violated Rule 10 and, additionally, that Dr Greer’s testimony would be irrelevant to the issues before the court. After this exchange, Miguel rested, and did not renew his motion for judgment of acquittal.', 'After the two-day hearing, the trial justice found “beyond a reasonable doubt, in fact, beyond any doubt” that Miguel was delinquent on all three charges. In passing on the credibility of the witnesses, the trial justice found that Pablo “was as credible as a witness could possibly be.” On October 2, 2008, Miguel was sentenced to the training school. 5 Additionally, sex offender treatment and registration were made a condition of Miguel’s sentence. This timely appeal followed.', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court previously has declared that “[t]he deferential standard of review we follow when considering an appeal from an adjudication of delinquency is to review the record to determine ‘whether legally competent evidence exists therein to support the findings made by the Family Court trial justice.’” In re Andrey G., 796 A.2d 452, 455- 56 (R.I. 2002) (quoting In re Ryan B., 739 A.2d 232, 235 (R.I. 1999)). Additionally, we give great deference to the findings of fact made by the trial justice, and we will not disturb such findings unless he or she overlooked or misconceived material evidence or otherwise was clearly wrong. In re Vannarith D., 731 A.2d 685, 688-89 (R.I. 1999).', '“‘Relevant evidence’ means evidence having any tendency to make the', 'existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the', 'action more probable or less probable than it would be without the', 'evidence.” 5', 'Miguel since has finished his sentence at the training school.', '-5-', 'Analysis', 'I', 'Evidentiary Rulings', 'Defense Counsel’s Failure to Comply with Rule 10', 'The respondent first challenges the trial justice’s rulings precluding his mother and Dr. Greer as witnesses, based upon defense counsel’s failure to comply with Rule 10. 6 Rule 10(a) provides that the attorney for the state, by written request, may ask the juvenile’s attorney to provide a list of witnesses expected to be called to testify on behalf of the respondent and to provide a summary of their testimony. Rule 10(c) governs the trial justice’s options when a party or the party’s attorney fails to comply with discovery obligations. Rule 10(c) provides:', '“If at any time during the course of the proceedings it is', 'brought to the attention of the court that a party has failed', 'to comply with this Rule or with an order issued pursuant', 'to this Rule, it may order such a party to provide the', 'discovery or inspection, grant a continuance, or make such', 'other order as it deems appropriate. Upon finding a willful', 'failure to comply, the court may prohibit the offending', 'party from introducing in evidence the material or the', 'testimony of a witness whose identity or statement was not', 'disclosed.” (Emphasis added.) It is undisputed that defense counsel failed to provide the state with an appropriate discovery response containing the names of Miguel’s mother and Dr. Greer. Miguel argues on appeal, however, that the trial justice failed to find a “willful failure to comply,” and thus, the witnesses should have been permitted to testify.', 'We are mindful that “the admissibility of evidence is placed within the sound discretion of the trial justice whose determination of admissibility will not be disturbed 6', 'Defense counsel at oral argument analogized this argument as the antithesis to the Na’Vi greeting “I see you” from James Cameron’s popular cinematic epic, “Avatar.” We think that an analogy to “Gone With the Wind” would have been more appropriate.', '-6- on review ‘unless a clear abuse of that discretion is apparent.’” In re Vannarith D., 731 A.2d at 689 (quoting State ex. rel. Town of Middletown v. Anthony, 713 A.2d 207, 210 (R.I. 1998)); see also State v. Martinez, 824 A.2d 443, 450 (R.I. 2003) (recognizing that the trial justice’s decision to exclude evidence is not reversible error unless there was an abuse of discretion that caused substantial injury to the party seeking to introduce the evidence). Additionally, the trial justice is in the best position to determine whether harm has resulted from an attorney’s failure to comply with discovery. State v. Musumeci, 717 A.2d 56, 60 (R.I. 1998).', 'With respect to Miguel’s mother, the trial justice properly found that defense counsel failed to comply with Rule 10. Defense counsel explained that he discussed with a previous prosecutor that he anticipated calling Miguel’s mother; but he admitted that he did not provide written notice.', '“[Court] The objection was that you did not provide the', 'State with notice of this witness and a summary of her', 'testimony. Could you respond to that, please?', '“[Defense Counsel] I don’t feel it would be any prejudice', 'to the State, Your Honor. I discussed this possibility with', 'prior counsel.', '“[Court] You didn’t provide written notice.', '“[Defense Counsel] I didn’t provide written notice, no.”', 'The trial justice found that:', '“the [respondent] had ample opportunity to provide the', 'State with a list of witnesses and the summary of their', 'testimony. That was not done. * * * [T]his matter has been', 'continued a number of times. I believe the State would be', 'prejudiced by hearing this witness’[s] testimony, as they', 'did not have ample opportunity to prepare Cross', 'Examination. They have no idea what this witness is going', 'to testify to * * *.”', '-7- Additionally, with respect to Dr. Greer, defense counsel again admitted that he did not comply with the discovery rules. The trial justice found that counsel did not comply with Rule 10, and denied respondent’s request for continuance, effectively excluding Dr. Greer’s testimony.', 'Rule 10(c) allows the trial justice to exclude evidence upon finding that there was a “willful failure to comply.” Black’s Law Dictionary defines “willful” as “[v]oluntary and intentional.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1737 (9th ed. 2009). The evidence in the record is clear. Defense counsel admitted that he did not comply with Rule 10 and offered no excuse for this omission. It is our opinion that this was voluntary and intentional, and thus, falls within Rule 10(c). We perceive no basis for holding that the trial justice abused her discretion in enforcing the rule as written.', 'Evidentiary Issues Pertaining to Dr. Greer’s Testimony', 'The respondent next argues that the trial justice abused her discretion when she refused to allow Dr. Greer to testify. He contends that the proffered evidence was material to whether Miguel was likely to commit sexual abuse. According to defense counsel, Dr. Greer would testify that Miguel had no history of being sexually abused, and that “there has never been any evidence he either suffered any sexual or physical abuse or any form of abuse, or a history which suggested he has a history of inappropriate sexual behavior.” The trial justice found that his testimony would be irrelevant, stating that, “[t]his Court [will] not entertain an expert’s testimony that is his belief that [Miguel], or anybody, has not committed any act of sexual inappropriateness. I don’t know how the doctor can say that with a reasonable degree of certainty.”', 'We agree with this ruling. On appeal, respondent argues that the recent decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, Esposito v. Home Depot', '-8- U.S.A., Inc., 590 F.3d 72 (1st Cir. 2009), is controlling on whether it is reversible error for a trial justice to bar testimony of a key witness in light of the availability of less severe sanctions. The case at bar, however, easily can be distinguished from Esposito. The First Circuit held that the judge’s decision to preclude the expert witness from testifying effectively amounted to a dismissal of the plaintiff’s case because the plaintiff had a great need for the witness. Id. at 78-79 (recognizing that “[b]oth of the parties acknowledge that the decision to exclude the [p]laintiff’s expert as a result of missing the discovery deadlines will, without much doubt, effectively dispose of the case”). In the case at bar, however, the proffered testimony of the expert witness, Dr. Greer, was wholly irrelevant. It would by no means be dispositive to the outcome of the case; in fact, it is our opinion that it would have had no evidentiary value whatsoever.', 'Additionally, we reject respondent’s contention that Dr. Greer’s testimony falls within the provisions of Rule 404(a)(1) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. That rule provides that evidence of a person’s character, in certain circumstances, may be admissible to prove the existence of a pertinent character trait. In State v. Benoit, 697 A.2d 329, 331 (R.I. 1997), this Court held that “excluding evidence of good character in respect to a pertinent trait cannot generally be considered harmless [error].” Here, however, the proffered testimony would not serve to prove a pertinent character trait; it would not serve to prove any character trait. Indeed, it is difficult for this Court to fathom what evidentiary purpose this “opinion” would further. Thus, we cannot state that the trial justice abused her discretion, nor that there would have been a different outcome had the testimony been allowed.', '-9-', 'Compulsory Process Clause Violation', 'Finally, respondent argues that the trial justice’s refusal to allow Miguel’s mother and Dr. Greer to testify, denied him his fundamental right to present a defense under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution 7 and thus violated the compulsory process clause therein. This Court reviews allegations that constitutional rights have been infringed de novo. State v. Gehrke, 835 A.2d 433, 436 (R.I. 2003).', 'The respondent, however, failed to present this argument to the trial justice. This Court’s “raise-or-waive” rule precludes our consideration of an issue that was not raised or articulated at trial. Resendes v. Brown, 966 A.2d 1249, 1254 (R.I. 2009). We have recognized that an exception to the raise-or-waive rule arises when basic constitutional rights are involved; however, “the alleged error must be more than harmless, and the exception must implicate an issue of constitutional dimension derived from a novel rule of law that could not reasonably have been known to counsel at the time of trial.” State v. Breen, 767 A.2d 50, 57 (R.I. 2001). The respondent does not meet this exception.', 'In the case at bar, the proffered evidence from Miguel’s mother was unnecessary8 and the proposed testimony from Dr. Greer was inadmissible and irrelevant; thus, we are satisfied that the trial justice’s decision to preclude their testimony was not an abuse of discretion. 7', 'The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that “[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right * * * to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor * * *.” 8', 'Pablo already had spoken about the family hostilities that Miguel’s mother would have disclosed if she had testified. Defense counsel asked Pablo, “[s]o you knew your mother didn’t like Christian anymore after you went into the second grade; didn’t you?” and Pablo replied, “[y]es.” Then, defense counsel asked Pablo, “it was after you realized your mother didn’t like Christian anymore, that you decided to tell these stories; isn’t that true?” and Pablo responded in the affirmative.', '- 10 -', 'II', 'Motion for Judgment of Acquittal', 'The respondent’s second argument on appeal concerns the trial justice’s decision to deny Miguel’s motions for acquittal. 9 Although it has not been raised by the state, we are not convinced that this issue properly was preserved. At the conclusion of the state’s case, Miguel moved for judgment of acquittal; this motion was denied.', 'Miguel proceeded to present a defense, but then failed to renew the motion at the close of evidence. “It is well established that the ‘denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal made at the close of the state’s case is preserved for appeal only if the defense has rested its case * * * or renews the motion at the conclusion of the presentation of all the evidence.’” State v. Disla, 874 A.2d 190, 195 (R.I. 2005) (quoting State v. Andreozzi, 798 A.2d 372, 374 (R.I. 2002)). Consequently, if the respondent fails to renew the motion, “any review of the denial of the judgment of acquittal is foreclosed.” State v. Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 569 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. Colbert, 549 A.2d 1021, 1023 (R.I. 1988)). Thus, respondent did not properly preserve this issue for appellate review.', 'Nonetheless, even if the question properly was before us, we would affirm the trial justice’s finding of delinquency. On review of a judgment of acquittal, this Court will apply the same standards as the trial justice. State v. Sivo, 809 A.2d 481, 487 (R.I. 2002). “We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, giving full credibility to its witnesses, and drawing all reasonable inferences consistent with guilt.” State v. Grant, 946 A.2d 818, 826 (R.I. 2008). “If such evidence, ‘viewed in this light, is 9', 'We note that this is a jury-waived trial. Technically, respondent should have moved for a motion to dismiss rather than a motion for acquittal. See State v. McKone, 673 A.2d 1068, 1072 (R.I. 1996) (recognizing that in a jury-waived trial, “the appropriate motion by which a defendant may challenge the legal sufficiency of the state’s trial evidence at the close of the state’s case is by motion to dismiss”).', '- 11 - sufficient to support a verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, the motion must be denied.’” Id. (quoting State v. Mondesir, 891 A.2d 856, 861 (R.I. 2006)).', 'With this standard in mind, we are satisfied that the trial justice’s findings were correct. The trial justice found:', '“This young boy testified before this Court yesterday and', 'was a better witness than most adults I’ve seen.* * * He', 'was young, but bright. He was articulate.* * * He was as', 'credible as a witness could possibly be.” On the other hand, the trial justice found Miguel’s testimony to be wholly lacking:', '“[The respondent] doesn’t remember anything.

In this case, Pablo’s testimony was clear and concise, and we discern no evidence of the “pervasive inconsistencies” that respondent insists exist between the state’s two witnesses. 10', 'Additionally, we note that Miguel’s testimony was lacking, at best. He could not recall basic everyday information, such as the name of his employer. He could not recall how long he worked at a particular after-school job. He could not even recall if there was a supermarket in his neighborhood; nonetheless, he contended that he had never been to the supermarket parking lot with Pablo. It is this Court’s opinion that there was ample foundation for the trial justice to find that Miguel’s testimony lacked credibility, and thus, 10', 'Pablo testified that during the first incident, he and Miguel were sitting in the back seat and then moved to the front seat when the molestation occurred. Caroline testified that Pablo told her that the molestation occurred in the back seat. Additionally, Pablo testified that when he told Caroline what occurred in the supermarket parking lot, she was in the guest bedroom. Caroline testified that she was in her bedroom.

51,"H.V. Collins Company : v. : Jerome Williams, et al. : Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty, and Robinson, JJ. OPINION Justice Goldberg, for the Court. In the words of William Shakespeare, “Better three hours too soon than a minute too late.” 1 Unfortunately, the plaintiff in this case did not heed that admonition. After a construction bid was submitted two minutes late, it was opened, announced, and recorded – and then subsequently rejected the next day because it was untimely. This case came before the Supreme Court on March 3, 2010, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the record and the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that the case should be dismissed because it is moot. 1 William Shakespeare (The Merry Wives of Windsor) in Bartlett’s Familiar Quotations 182 (16th ed. 1992). -1- Facts and Travel The facts in this case arise from a bid opening by the State of Rhode Island (state) seeking bids for a general contractor to build a new state police headquarters and E 9-1- 1 facility. The bid procedure was administered by the Department of Administration (department). The original invitation for bids designated November 19, 2008, by 1:45 p.m. for the submission of bids. There were subsequent addenda with respect to the submission time, with a final date and time being set at November 25, 2008, by 2:30 p.m. A number of timely bids were submitted, including the winning bid by A.F. Lusi Construction, Inc. (Lusi) – a contractor also named as a defendant in this case. The plaintiff, H.V. Collins Company (Collins), submitted its bid at 2:32 p.m. – two minutes late. Notwithstanding, an employee of the department publicly opened and recorded Collins’s bid. Collins was the low bidder, with a bid of $20,900,000. Lusi’s bid was $21,397,000. The next day, the purchasing agent for the department notified Collins that, because its bid was deemed untimely it would not be considered by the awarding authority. In what has been referred to as a bid protest, Collins wrote to the department requesting reconsideration of the bid. Collins’s bid protest was unavailing, and on December 23, 2008, the department awarded the contract to Lusi. However, Collins, on December 12, 2008, commenced suit in Superior Court against Jerome Williams, the director of the department, in his capacity as chief purchasing officer for the state. 2 Thereafter, a second amended complaint was filed by Collins that also added Lusi as a defendant. 2 Shortly thereafter, Gary Sasse was substituted as a party defendant. -2- On March 10, 2009, a justice of the Superior Court entertained the parties’ cross- motions for summary judgment. The plaintiff urged the court to grant its motion for summary judgment because, Collins argued, by opening and recording the bid, the state waived the timeliness defect on behalf of the purchasing agent. The trial justice rendered a bench decision on March 30, 2009, and found that the state did not waive its right to insist on compliance with the bid specifications by simply opening and recording Collins’s bid because doing so was a ministerial act. The trial justice’s decision was based on G.L. 1956 § 37-2-51 that provides: “The decision of any official, board, agent, or other person appointed by the state concerning any controversy arising under or in connection with the solicitation or award of a contract shall be entitled to a presumption of correctness. The decision shall not be disturbed unless it was: procured by fraud; in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; in excess of the statutory authority of the agency; made upon unlawful procedure; affected by other error or law; clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record; arbitrary; capricious; characterized by an abuse of discretion; or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.” The trial justice concluded that opening the bid and then subsequently rejecting it as untimely did not constitute an abuse of discretion. The trial justice granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, and a judgment was entered on April 1, 2009. Collins filed a notice of appeal to the Supreme Court on April 3, 2009. The parties thereafter were directed to submit additional memoranda addressing whether this case was moot. The question of mootness arose because construction of the facility has proceeded apace, is near completion, and Collins did not make a claim for monetary damages. 3 3 In a motion filed with the Superior Court on January 6, 2009, Collins withdrew its request for injunctive relief. -3- Standard of Review It is well settled that a necessary predicate to this Court’s exercise of jurisdiction is an actual, justiciable controversy. Sullivan v. Chafee, 703 A.2d 748, 751 (R.I. 1997). The Supreme Court will not entertain an abstract question or render an advisory opinion, id., with the exception for constitutionally mandated advisory opinions found in article 10, section 3, of the Rhode Island Constitution. “For a claim to be justiciable, two elemental components must be present: (1) a plaintiff with the requisite standing and (2) ‘some legal hypothesis which will entitle the plaintiff to real and articulable relief.’” N&M Properties, LLC v. Town of West Warwick, 964 A.2d 1141, 1145 (R.I. 2009) (quoting Bowen v. Mollis, 945 A.2d 314, 317 (R.I. 2008)). As a general rule, the Supreme Court will “only consider cases involving issues in dispute; we shall not address moot, abstract, academic, or hypothetical questions.” Morris v. D’Amario, 416 A.2d 137, 139 (R.I. 1980). This rule, however, is not absolute; an exception to the mootness doctrine lies when the issue or question presented, “while technically moot or deficient in some other respect, involves issues ‘of extreme public importance, which are capable of repetition but which evade review.’” In re Stephanie B., 826 A.2d 985, 989 (R.I. 2003) (quoting Morris, 416 A.2d at 139). Analysis Although we decide this public-bid controversy on mootness grounds, we pause to note that it was unfortunate that the state opened an untimely bid at the bid opening only to reject it later on the ground that it was late. If the bid had been rejected in the first instance rather than the next day, these parties would not be before us. At oral argument, counsel for the department went so far as to declare that the untimely bid was “accepted,” -4- a word of legal significance in the public bidding arena, a suggestion that further denigrates the bidding procedures employed by the department. Unfortunately for Collins, there is no relief available in the context of this case. In its second amended complaint, Collins sought both a judgment declaring the contract award invalid as well as injunctive relief to restrain the department from awarding the contract to Lusi. Subsequently, Collins withdrew its motion for preliminary injunction, thereby leaving only the declaratory relief request. 4 Lusi argues to this Court that the construction for the state police headquarters and E 9-1-1 facility substantially is complete, a fact that is not in dispute. Thus, it is clear to this Court that there is no viable relief available to plaintiff at this point. In arguing against mootness, Collins proposes that should it prevail, it could return to Superior Court and seek to amend its complaint to include monetary damages; that argument, however, will not overcome the mootness bar in this case. This Court will not review a case in which the parties no longer have an articulable stake in the outcome. See In re New England Gas Co., 842 A.2d 545, 553 4 We note the heavy burden that any party seeking to enjoin a putative bid award must bear. In Truk Away of Rhode Island, Inc. v. Macera Bros. of Cranston, Inc., 643 A.2d 811, 816 (R.I. 1994), we declared that: “We reaffirm the principles set forth in Goldman and Gilbane, both supra, and express our firm belief that government by injunction save in the most compelling and unusual circumstances is to be strictly avoided. In the absence of bad faith or corruption, a finding of palpable abuse of discretion should be approached with grave caution and be based upon much more compelling evidence of arbitrariness or capriciousness than may be found in mere complexity.” -5- (R.I. 2004) (deciding the case was moot because the rate-case at issue was settled and the labor dispute had ended). Here, the contract was awarded to Lusi and the construction is nearly complete. This Court will review an otherwise moot case only when the issues are “of extreme public importance, which are capable of repetition but which evade review.” Sullivan, 703 A.2d at 752 (quoting Morris, 416 A.2d at 139). Issues of extreme public importance usually implicate “important constitutional rights, matters concerning a person’s livelihood, or matters concerning citizen voting rights.” In re New England Gas Co., 842 A.2d at 554 (quoting Cicilline v. Almond, 809 A.2d 1101, 1106 (R.I. 2002)). The issues involved in this public bidding case do not implicate these concerns. Conclusion For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm the grant of summary judgment and remand the record to the Superior Court. -6- Supreme Court No. 2009-154-Appeal. (PC 08-7829) H.V.

The bid procedure was administered by the Department of Administration (department). The original invitation for bids designated November 19, 2008, by 1:45 p.m. for the submission of bids. There were subsequent addenda with respect to the submission time, with a final date and time being set at November 25, 2008, by 2:30 p.m. A number of timely bids were submitted, including the winning bid by A.F. Lusi Construction, Inc. (Lusi) – a contractor also named as a defendant in this case. The plaintiff, H.V. Collins Company (Collins), submitted its bid at 2:32 p.m. – two minutes late. Notwithstanding, an employee of the department publicly opened and recorded Collins’s bid. Collins was the low bidder, with a bid of $20,900,000. Lusi’s bid was $21,397,000.', 'The next day, the purchasing agent for the department notified Collins that, because its bid was deemed untimely it would not be considered by the awarding authority. In what has been referred to as a bid protest, Collins wrote to the department requesting reconsideration of the bid.', 'Collins’s bid protest was unavailing, and on December 23, 2008, the department awarded the contract to Lusi. However, Collins, on December 12, 2008, commenced suit in Superior Court against Jerome Williams, the director of the department, in his capacity as chief purchasing officer for the state. 2 Thereafter, a second amended complaint was filed by Collins that also added Lusi as a defendant. 2', 'Shortly thereafter, Gary Sasse was substituted as a party defendant.', '-2-', 'On March 10, 2009, a justice of the Superior Court entertained the parties’ cross- motions for summary judgment.

This case came before the Supreme Court on January 27, 2010, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. The defendant, Angelo Marmolejos (defendant), appeals from a Superior Court conviction of assault with a dangerous weapon and using a firearm while committing a violent crime. Because we are satisfied that cause has not been shown, we shall decide the appeal at this time. We affirm the convictions.', 'At trial, defendant and the complainant offered very different accounts of the events that gave rise to this conviction. According to Jose Lespin (complainant or Lespin), a motor-vehicle repair transaction between defendant and himself was the genesis of this dispute. The complainant testified at trial that defendant had retained him to repair his automobile, with the expectation of payment. Although Lespin granted defendant some time in which to pay, he testified that defendant failed to do so and that he requested of defendant repeatedly that he settle the debt. On December 5, 2006,', '-1- defendant called Lespin and asked him to come to defendant’s home so that he could pay him. According to Lespin, when he arrived at approximately 10 p.m., he asked to use the bathroom; as he was leaving it, he saw defendant standing near him, holding a pillow. Almost immediately, he felt “something electrical.” Realizing that he had been shot, Lespin sought to disarm defendant, and a struggle ensued. Although Lespin managed to point the gun away from himself, he testified that defendant fired another shot. Lespin managed to escape; he ran upstairs and asked the occupant of another apartment – later identified as Lola Sanchez – to call the police.', 'Ms. Sanchez appeared at trial and testified that she heard the gunshot, followed by someone running up the stairs. She did not answer her door however, but called 911. The police arrived shortly thereafter and Lespin told the officers that he had been shot. He testified that although he remembered being placed in an ambulance, he lost consciousness shortly thereafter and remained so for seventeen days.', 'At trial, Lespin testified that he remembered an officer visiting him in the hospital and recalled identifying a photograph of defendant from a photo array.', 'When the prosecution sought to introduce that photograph at trial, defendant objected, arguing that if the jury were informed that the police were in possession of his photograph, it could conclude that he had prior, unsavory contacts with law enforcement. The trial justice admitted the photograph, but cautioned the jury against drawing any adverse inferences, noting that the police collect these types of photographs from many sources, including state driver’s licenses.', 'The defendant testified and recounted a different series of events. He stated that he and Lespin had known each other since they were children in the Dominican Republic.', '-2- The defendant denied that Lespin had done any work on his vehicle; instead, he insisted that he had loaned Lespin $2,000 and was waiting for him to return it. Because he needed to pay rent, defendant asked Lespin to visit him to repay part of the money. The defendant testified that after Lespin arrived at his home, the two of them watched television until Lespin left to test-drive a car that defendant’s neighbor was selling. According to defendant, when Lespin returned from the test-drive, he was accompanied by an individual who was selling a gun. Although he stated he had no use for a gun, defendant began handling it while Lespin excused himself to use the bathroom.', 'The defendant testified that he did not know the gun was loaded; but he grabbed a pillow, placed it over the weapon, and aimed the weapon at Lespin as he left the bathroom. Although defendant testified that he was “fool[ing] around,” Lespin fell back and began screaming. The defendant said that he fled the scene and the state because he was scared and he could not afford a lawyer. He was apprehended in New York.', 'The jury rejected defendant’s testimony and found him guilty of assault with intent to commit murder in a dwelling house, while armed with a dangerous weapon, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-4 and using a firearm while committing a crime of violence, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-47-3.2(a). This timely appeal followed.', 'Before this Court, defendant contends that the photo array introduced at trial was not relevant to the issues in this case, and that its probative value was substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect, in violation of Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. The defendant also argues that with respect to Rule 16 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, the trial justice erred in two respects. Specifically, the first alleged error occurred when Lespin testified that there were two shots fired, rather than', '-3- one, as defendant had testified before the jury.', 'Finally, defendant alleges a second instance of unfair surprise arose from Lespin’s testimony that he was hallucinating when the police interviewed him at the hospital.', 'Standard of Review', 'It is well settled that we review a trial justice’s decision admitting or excluding evidence under an abuse of discretion standard. See State v. Reyes, 984 A.2d 606, 614- 15 (R.I. 2009); State v. Evans, 742 A.2d 715, 719 (R.I. 1999) (“[d]ecisions about the admission or exclusion of evidence based on relevance are left within the trial justice’s discretion”). We will uphold a trial justice’s decision unless “the admission of irrelevant evidence was prejudicial to a defendant’s rights.” Evans, 742 A.2d at 719.', ""Additionally, this Court affords great deference to a trial justice’s determination of whether a violation of Rule 16 has occurred. State v. Diefenderfer, 970 A.2d 12, 23 (R.I. 2009). We have declared that this standard of review is “extremely narrow: we will overturn a trial justice's ruling only if he or she has committed clear error.” State v. Espinal, 943 A.2d 1052, 1062 (R.I. 2008)."", 'Analysis', 'After careful review of the record in this case, we are satisfied that there is no merit to defendant’s contention that the introduction of the photo array was an abuse of discretion. The defendant directs our attention to Rule 403, which provides:', '“Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its', 'probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger', 'of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading', 'the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of', 'time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.”', '-4-', 'In this case, the trial justice cautioned the jury that the police have many sources for compiling photographs and that the jurors should not draw an adverse inference simply because the police had a photograph of defendant. We agree with the cautionary instruction and are satisfied that the trial justice properly allowed the photograph into evidence. The fact that defendant’s identity was not at issue in this case does not persuade us otherwise. As we have held, the state bears the burden of proving every element of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt, even if an element is not in dispute. See State v. Spratt, 742 A.2d 1194, 1198 (R.I. 1999).', 'The defendant in Spratt, 742 A.2d at 198, challenged the introduction of a photograph of the murder victim on relevancy grounds. This Court held that the question of relevance of documentary evidence is left to the sound discretion of the trial justice; and, because the state bears the burden of proving each element of the charge beyond a reasonable doubt, it has the right to present evidence establishing those elements in its case in chief. Id. Accordingly, we discern no abuse of discretion in the record before us, and we affirm the introduction of the photograph in this case.', 'The next issue that defendant raises is the alleged violations of Rule 16. We accord great deference to the trial justice’s decision regarding whether a violation of Rule 16 occurred. See Diefenderfer, 970 A.2d at 23. Absent a showing of clear error, we will not disturb a trial justice’s decision with respect to Rule 16. Diefenderfer, 970 A.2d at 23.', 'According to defendant, defense counsel was surprised when Lespin testified that two shots were fired on the night in question because that fact was not disclosed in discovery. Additionally, defendant also alleges unfair surprise arising from Lespin’s', '-5- testimony that he was hallucinating during a hospital interview with police – another alleged fact that defendant claims was not disclosed in discovery. In the first instance, the trial justice, during a side bar conference, suggested to defense counsel that this testimony would provide “an awful lot of fodder for cross-examination.” In the second instance, the trial justice cited State v. Andrade, 657 A.2d 538, 543 (R.I 1995) noting that the jury would be provided with a curative instruction regarding how police collect photographs from many sources. After reviewing the transcript and the record, we are satisfied that this evidence did not rise to the level of a discovery violation.', 'Although Lespin’s testimony that he heard a second shot was not expected by the defendant, the record does not suggest deliberate failure to disclose by the state, nor does the admission of that evidence rise to the level of clear error on the part of the trial justice. With respect to Lespin’s statement that he was hallucinating during the police interview, again, this was not expected testimony from the complainant. However, we are not convinced that this evidence amounted to a discovery violation because it was undisputed that while hospitalized for a gunshot wound, Lespin was unconscious for an extended period and his ability to recall the events in this case was tested sufficiently on cross-examination.', 'Conclusion', 'Accordingly, we affirm the conviction.

53,State : v. : Kenneth Pitts.,criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson for the Court. On April 23, 2008, a Providence County Superior Court jury convicted the defendant, Kenneth Pitts, of one count of disorderly conduct. He has appealed from the judgment of conviction. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on January 27, 2010, pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the record, the memoranda submitted by the parties, and the oral arguments of counsel, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that the case should be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The defendant was charged with one count of disorderly conduct in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-45-1.1 A jury trial was held from April 21 through April 23, 2008, at the conclusion of which defendant was convicted. The testimony elicited at this trial was substantially similar to that set forth in State v. Pitts, 960 A.2d 240 (R.I. 2008).2 Providence Police Officer Richard Piccirillo was the only witness for the prosecution to testify at trial. In essence, Officer Piccirillo testified that on April 25, 2007 he observed Mr. Pitts sitting in a white van on the East Side of Providence with his penis exposed. He further testified that, after Mr. Pitts’s arrest, the police conducted an inventory search of the white van and found (inter alia) a used condom and a photo 1', 'At the time of Mr. Pitts’s arrest, G.L. 1956 § 11-45-1, as amended by P.L. 2004, ch. 206, § 1, provided in pertinent part as follows:', '“(a) A person commits disorderly conduct if he or she', 'intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly:', '“* * *', '“(7) Exposes his or her genitals to the view of others under', 'circumstances in which his or her conduct is likely to cause', 'affront, distress, or alarm to the other persons.', '“(b) Any person, including a police officer, may be a complainant', 'for the purposes of instituting action for any violation of this', 'section.”', 'In 2008, chapter 11 of title 45 entitled “Disorderly Conduct” was amended by the General Assembly so as to include the requirement that, for there to be a violation, the exposure of genitals must have occurred “for the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification or stimulation * * *.” Section 11-45-2, as amended by P.L. 2008, ch. 183, § 2. It should go without saying that this amendatory language has no bearing on the instant appeal. 2', 'Prior to the criminal trial on the disorderly conduct charge at issue in this case, defendant’s actions were found to have been violative of the terms and conditions of an earlier probationary sentence, and he was sentenced to serve five years of a previously imposed twenty- eight-year suspended sentence.

At the close of the prosecution’s case, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal. The defendant contended that the prosecution had failed to establish each of the elements necessary to convict him of disorderly conduct beyond a reasonable doubt. He argued that the prosecution had not demonstrated that his genitals were exposed to the view of others under circumstances which were “likely to cause affront, distress, or alarm.” See § 11-45-1(a)(7) (quoted at footnote 1, supra). He contended that, given where he was seated in the van, a passerby would not have been able to see him in the vehicle—since he was crouched down in the van “intentionally avoiding the view of others.” The defendant further contended that he had a “reasonable expectation of privacy” within the van.', 'The trial justice observed that, when considering a motion for a judgment of acquittal, he was required to “consider the evidence that has been adduced in the light most favorable to the State” and that he was “not permitted to assess the credibility of the witnesses.” After taking into account the officer’s testimony and the relevant provisions of the disorderly conduct statute,3 the trial justice denied defendant’s mid-trial motion for a judgment of acquittal.', 'Prior to the beginning of the defense’s case, the prosecutor asked the trial justice to rule on the issue of whether the prosecutor could use, during his cross-examination of defendant, photographic evidence of a certain item that had been found in defendant’s van. Specifically, the prosecutor sought to introduce photographs of a photo album whose contents, in whole or in part, consisted of photographs of women posing in the nude and posing in sexually explicit positions.4 3', 'See footnote 1, supra. 4', 'The prosecution requested the introduction of said photographs for identification purposes only and not as a full exhibit.', '-3- The prosecutor represented that the photographs would be used to impeach defendant.5 The prosecutor further contended that evidence that the photo album had been within an “arm’s length or two of the defendant” would be relevant to the charge that defendant had violated § 11- 45-1(a)(7). Defense counsel argued that there had been no testimony indicating that the photo album was opened or that defendant was looking at the photographs while his genitals allegedly were exposed.', 'The trial justice stated that it could be inferred that defendant used the photographs “for purposes of his arousal” during the alleged exposure of his genitals. The trial justice therefore ruled that the prosecution would be allowed to use the photographic evidence in order to impeach defendant during cross-examination if he testified and denied having exposed his genitals as Officer Piccirillo had described.', 'The defendant was the second, and final, witness to testify at trial.', 'The thrust of defendant’s testimony was that his genitals were not exposed at the time in question. During cross-examination, defendant admitted that officers had found a used condom and an album containing photographs of nude women in his van. 6', 'At the close of all the evidence, defendant renewed his motion for a judgment of acquittal, reiterating the same arguments as he had made at the close of the prosecution’s case.

The prosecution therefore sought to use the photographic evidence to impeach defendant’s testimony in that respect if he in fact so testified. 6', 'The trial justice gave the jury a limiting instruction with respect to its consideration of the photographic evidence. He instructed the jury that defendant was not charged with possession of pornographic material. He further instructed the jury that the evidence was not being offered to show that Mr. Pitts “is a bad person or someone who violates the law;” he stated that the evidence was being admitted for the limited purpose of providing context to the charge of disorderly conduct and, specifically, to the allegation that Mr. Pitts had “expos[ed] his genitals.”', '-4-', 'On April 23, 2008, the jury found defendant guilty of one count of disorderly conduct. Thereafter, defendant was sentenced by the trial justice to six months imprisonment, to be served consecutively to his previously imposed sentence of imprisonment.7 The defendant filed a premature, but nonetheless valid, notice of appeal. 8', 'II', 'Analysis', 'On appeal, defendant contends that the alleged exposure of his genitals, which he denies ever took place, would not constitute disorderly conduct under the statute and that, therefore, the trial justice should have granted his motion for a judgment of acquittal. The defendant further contends that the trial justice erred in: (1) allowing the prosecution to admit what he contends was irrelevant evidence in its case in chief (viz., evidence concerning a used condom found in the van);9 and (2) permitting the prosecution to cross-examine him regarding certain other evidence from the van (viz., the photographs of naked women found by the police in the van).', 'A', 'Denial of the Motion for Judgment of Acquittal', 'The defendant’s initial contention is that the alleged exposure (which he denies having committed) would not constitute disorderly conduct, and that, therefore, the trial justice erred in denying his motions for a judgment of acquittal. 7', 'See footnote 2, supra. 8', 'See, e.g., State v. Diefenderfer, 970 A.2d 12, 23 n.24 (R.I. 2009). 9', 'Prior to the start of trial, the trial justice met with counsel in camera and heard arguments by the attorneys on the record as to whether the prosecution could elicit testimony from Officer Piccirillo that, during the search of defendant’s vehicle, a used condom was found. The trial justice decided to allow the prosecution to elicit such testimony, while noting for the record defendant’s objection to the effect that such evidence was irrelevant and prejudicial.', '-5-', 'The defendant argues that, according to Officer Piccirillo’s testimony, he was slumped down in the van with only his head visible until the officer was directly outside the van looking into the driver’s window. The defendant further argues that, because the van was higher than a normal passenger vehicle, “a casual passerby * * * would not have seen any exposed genitalia.” The defendant additionally contends that, despite the officer’s testimony that the area in the vicinity of where defendant was parked has high foot traffic, the officer did not testify to the presence of any pedestrian traffic at the time of the alleged incident or at the time of his arrest. The defendant also points out that there was no evidence of cars parked on the street opposite his vehicle or evidence of the presence of occupants in the nearby houses. The defendant therefore contends that the evidence does not demonstrate that he intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly exposed his genitals. We are unpersuaded by defendant’s contentions.', 'When we review a trial justice’s denial of a motion for a judgment of acquittal, we apply the same standard as the trial court. State v. DeOliveira, 972 A.2d 653, 663 (R.I. 2009). In applying this standard, we “view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, giving full credibility to its witnesses, and drawing all reasonable inferences consistent with guilt.” Id. If we determine that the evidence, viewed in such a light, is “sufficient to support a verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, the motion must be denied.” State v. Mondesir, 891 A.2d 856, 861 (R.I. 2006); see also DeOliveira, 972 A.2d at 663.', 'Having considered the testimony of Officer Piccirillo, we conclude that the trial justice properly denied defendant’s motion for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the prosecution’s case and at the close of all the evidence.', 'The statute under which Mr. Pitts was convicted explicitly states that a police officer may be a complainant. See § 11-45-1(b). Therefore, exposure of defendant’s genitals to the view of', '-6- Officer Piccirillo would undoubtedly establish a violation, even if no other person witnessed the exposure. We are therefore fully satisfied that, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the evidence presented was sufficient for a jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant violated the disorderly conduct statute by exposing his genitals to Officer Piccirillo. Accordingly, it is our conclusion that the trial justice properly denied defendant’s two motions for a judgment of acquittal.', 'B', 'Evidentiary Issues', 'The defendant also contends that the trial justice erred in allowing the prosecution to elicit testimony from Officer Piccirillo with respect to the used condom that was found in the van. He contends that this evidence was unduly prejudicial and that the prosecution failed to proffer evidence connecting the condom to the conduct which was allegedly in violation of the disorderly conduct statute. The defendant’s final contention is that the trial justice erred in permitting the state to cross-examine him with respect to the photo album found in the white van. He contends that this evidence was irrelevant to the conduct of which he stood accused and that it thus constituted improper impeachment evidence.', 'When reviewing the decision of a trial justice to admit certain evidence, this Court has indicated that “questions as to the admissibility vel non of evidence are confided to the sound discretion of the trial justice * * *.” State v.

We will not overturn the ruling of a trial justice with respect to an evidentiary issue unless it constitutes an “abuse of the justice’s discretion” and “prejudices the complaining party.” State v. Johnson, 667 A.2d 523, 530 (R.I. 1995); see also Diefenderfer, 970 A.2d at 24; Merida, 960 A.2d at 234.

The presence of the used condom within defendant’s vehicle could be viewed as reinforcing the officer’s testimony that defendant’s genitals were exposed; it would be for the jury to weigh all the evidence and make decisions as to credibility. We are unable to conclude that the possible prejudice from such evidence outweighs the probative value of the evidence.', 'With respect to the trial justice’s allowing the prosecution, during cross-examination of the defendant, to make use of the above-referenced photographic evidence, we similarly perceive no abuse of his discretion under Rule 403.

54,"State : v. : Alonzo Shelton. : Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty, and Robinson, JJ. OPINION Justice Flaherty, for the Court. Jessica Imran breathed her last on the floor of her Pawtucket home after suffering a gunshot wound to her head and neck in the early hours of July 27, 2006, after two men, one of whom was armed, forced their way into her apartment. With Ms. Imran was childhood friend Julie Lang, who suffered five gunshot wounds. Bleeding profusely and near death herself, Ms. Lang managed to call 911 after the assailants fled. The state argued that the defendant, Alonzo Shelton (defendant or Shelton), and his teenage nephew, Barry Offley, were behind this “planned execution,” as the murderous assault was dubbed by the presiding trial justice. A jury ultimately found Shelton guilty of the murder of Ms. Imran, conspiracy with his nephew to murder Ms. Imran, assault of Ms. Lang in a dwelling with the intent to murder her, conspiracy to murder Ms. Lang, discharge of a firearm while committing a crime of violence that resulted in Ms. Imran’s death, discharge of a firearm while committing a crime of violence that resulted in the injury of Ms. Lang, carrying a pistol without a license, and -1- possession of a firearm after previously having been convicted of a crime of violence. 1 The trial justice, appalled by the particularly violent and cold-hearted nature of the crimes, meted out a hefty sentence to the defendant, a habitual offender who already was serving a suspended sentence. The defendant appeals from the judgment of conviction and sentence, raising several constitutional grounds. After careful review of the record, we are of the opinion that his arguments have no merit, and we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. I Facts and Travel It is not unfair to characterize defendant as a lifelong criminal. Shelton was involved in an on-and-off romantic relationship with Brenda Alvarez for about eight years, even developing a paternal relationship with her children. In July 2006, Shelton resided both at Ms. Alvarez’s apartment in Central Falls and at his sister’s home in Providence. However, Ms. Alvarez was not the only object of Shelton’s affection; earlier in 2006 he also had been involved in an amorous connection with Ms. Lang. In January 2006, while Shelton was riding as a passenger in Ms. Lang’s car, a police officer stopped the vehicle because it had a broken taillight. The officer discovered that there were outstanding warrants for both Shelton and Ms. Lang, and both were placed under arrest. Unbeknownst to Ms. Lang, Shelton surreptitiously deposited cocaine into her purse just prior to their arrests so that he would not be apprehended with the drugs in his possession. Not surprisingly, Ms. Lang was charged with possession of the cocaine, and she was scheduled to appear in court in August. In the meantime, however, Shelton urged the unhappy Ms. Lang “to 1 Shelton and Offley were tried separately by agreement of the parties, with Shelton’s trial taking place first. Because Shelton was serving a suspended sentence when he was charged with the crimes in this case, his trial served as both a violation hearing and a trial on the merits. -2- take the charge” by acknowledging that the drugs were hers because he was on probation and would be violated if he were charged. Because Shelton also was in the midst of a suspended sentence, he knew that he would face jail time, but that Ms. Lang, he reasoned, would not. Ms. Lang refused to go along with this scheme, however, and she prevailed upon him to take responsibility for his own actions. The dispute seriously undermined their relationship, which ended after this incident. Nonetheless, their argument over it continued until July 26, 2006, the last day that Shelton pressed his desire for Ms. Lang to take responsibility for the cocaine possession. Shelton, who again was staying with Ms. Alvarez at her apartment in Central Falls, spent the evening of July 26, 2006, watching television, playing video games, and drinking beer with his nephew, Barry Offley. At 3:35 a.m. the following morning, Shelton and Offley told Ms. Alvarez’s son that they were leaving for a while, but that they would return. Earlier on July 26, Ms. Lang and Ms. Imran had socialized together at Ms. Imran’s apartment in Pawtucket. They left her home to go to Providence, returning at approximately 2 a.m. on July 27, 2006. As they relaxed in Ms. Imran’s apartment, someone knocked on the apartment’s door. Ms. Imran, who believed the visitor to be her boyfriend, asked Ms. Lang to answer the door. But the man on the other side of the door was not Ms. Imran’s boyfriend; according to Ms. Lang, it was Shelton and Offley. Ms. Lang was surprised to see Shelton, and he pushed open the door and stepped inside the apartment. 2 She said that she told him to leave, but she then heard a gunshot; she also heard Ms. Imran say that she almost had been shot. Ms. Lang said that it was then that she saw Offley holding a gun. He fired it again, and she watched as Ms. 2 Cellular-phone records reflect calls between Shelton and Ms. Imran’s phones. Ms. Lang maintains that she did not know that Shelton and Ms. Imran were acquainted and that it was not she who communicated with Shelton on Ms. Imran’s cellular phone. -3- Imran fell to the floor. 3 The next shot was fired at her, but it missed. The gun somehow malfunctioned at that point and, according to Ms. Lang, Shelton grabbed it from Offley and shot Ms. Lang himself. Despite her injuries, Ms. Lang found Ms. Imran’s cellular phone and dialed 911. With her breathing severely labored, she managed to walk out of the apartment building, where she met a responding officer. 4 In his testimony, the officer described her as upset and bleeding. He said that Ms. Lang told him that she had been shot and, in response to his inquiries, she told him that Alonzo Shelton had shot her. She also provided Shelton’s address in Central Falls. While medical personnel transported Ms. Lang to the hospital, police officers from Pawtucket and Central Falls endeavored to locate the individuals who had attacked the women. 5 A number of officers responded to the Central Falls address given to them by Ms. Lang. When the officers arrived to the three-tenement apartment, they noticed that a light was on in the first- floor apartment despite the early hour of approximately 4:30 a.m. The officers also found that the exterior door to the three-tenement apartment was unlocked, and that the doorway to the first- floor apartment was “slightly open.” 3 An autopsy later revealed that Ms. Imran was killed by a single gunshot wound to her neck and head, and the cause of death was deemed to be homicide. 4 The police were able to locate Ms. Lang based on the general location of her emergency call as determined by a global positioning system. 5 According to the attending physician in the emergency room at the hospital, Ms. Lang suffered five gunshot wounds and was in critical condition. While she was receiving treatment, police officers obtained a statement from her, which she later said contained inaccuracies. The Pawtucket detective who attempted to take the statement from her on July 27, 2006, found it difficult to do so, because Ms. Lang was in “grave pain” and “going in and out of consciousness.” Ultimately, he had to terminate the interview. Lang also did not recall giving a tape-recorded statement to the police the next day, July 28, 2006, and again said later that that statement contained inaccuracies, such as her assertion in that statement that she didn’t know who had shot her. -4- Knowing that there had been a shooting and that an armed suspect might be inside, the police entered the apartment. The first officer into the apartment proceeded directly to the lit room, a bedroom, and searched the closet and under and around the bed, looking for a suspect or a victim. While he was in the bedroom, the officer saw a ski mask, black gloves, and on the left of the bed, a backpack with its flap open. Inside the open backpack, the officer also saw what appeared to him to be a black gun box. Through the eye holes of the ski mask, the officer saw a clear plastic bag containing ammunition. Next to the bed, he saw an open safe. However, the police did not find a suspect in the apartment; the only people present were three teenagers and a baby, all asleep. They awoke, and the police learned from them that the apartment belonged to Ms. Alvarez, Shelton’s girlfriend. 6 The police then contacted Ms. Alvarez, who was at work. Understandably concerned about her children’s safety and alarmed about the police presence in her home, Ms. Alvarez requested that the police leave her apartment. The officers complied; they remained in the hallway with the apartment’s door ajar until Ms. Alvarez arrived home at approximately 6:30 a.m. As soon as she got home, police officers informed her that they were investigating a homicide, and that Shelton was a suspect. A detective asked her to sign a consent-to-search form, which was read to her and which she read herself. She agreed to sign the form, indicating her consent to search. After she did so, two detectives accompanied Ms. Alvarez inside, and a search of her bedroom was completed. The items that the police had observed in the bedroom earlier were seized, along with two clips of ammunition that were found after the gun box was searched. Assorted loose ammunition was found in the backpack. Ms. Alvarez then was escorted to the Pawtucket police station so that she could provide a witness statement. 6 Two of the teenagers were Ms. Alvarez’s children. The other teenager, who was the baby’s mother, was Ms. Alvarez’s niece. -5- Meanwhile, the search for Shelton and Offley continued. The United States Marshals eventually found the pair and arrested them in Florida on September 7, 2006, after Shelton’s cellular-phone use revealed his location. On October 4, 2006, a grand jury indicted Shelton and Offley on ten counts. 7 They were charged with (1) first-degree murder of Jessica Imran in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-23-1 and § 11-23-2; (2) conspiracy to commit the crime of murder of Jessica Imran, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-1-6 and § 11-23-1; (3) assault on Julie Lang with a dangerous weapon in a dwelling with the intent to murder her in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-4; (4) conspiracy to murder Julie Lang in violation of § 11-1-6 and § 11-23-1; (5) burglary of the dwelling of Jessica Imran in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-8-1; (6) conspiracy to commit burglary in violation of § 11-1-6 and § 11-8-1; (7) carrying of a pistol without a license in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-47-8(a); (8) possession of a firearm following a previous conviction for a crime of violence in violation of § 11-47-5; (9) discharge of a firearm during a crime of violence, resulting in the death of Jessica Imran, in violation of § 11-47-3.2(b)(3); and (10) discharge of a firearm while in the commission of a crime, resulting in the injury of Julie Lang, in violation of § 11-47-3.2(b)(2). Shelton was tried before a jury in Superior Court in the spring of 2007. Before his trial started, Shelton filed a motion to suppress the evidence that had been seized from Ms. Alvarez’s apartment on the morning of July 27, 2006, after Ms. Alvarez gave the police consent to search the premises. He argued that exigent circumstances did not exist to justify the initial search of the bedroom, and that even if exigent circumstances did exist, the search “was conducted in violation of the scope of the exigent circumstances doctrine.” He further argued that the second search “was conducted without the voluntary consent of Brenda Alvarez.” Hearings on defendant’s motion to suppress were held on April 26 and 27, 2007. 7 All counts were against both Shelton and Offley with the exception of count 8, which was against Shelton alone. -6- After hearing testimony from six witnesses, the trial justice denied the motion. The trial justice found that “there absolutely were exigent circumstances” because there was a “killer[] on the loose,” that there were other tenants in the building, and that the officers did not have the benefit of “leisurely time.” The trial justice ruled that the police “would have been absolutely derelict in their duty not to go in there.” Then, while the police offers were lawfully on the premises, the trial justice found that they discovered certain items in plain view. He also found that Ms. Alvarez voluntarily consented to the search of her apartment. After trial, the jury found defendant guilty of conspiring with Offley to murder Julie Lang, conspiring with Offley to murder Jessica Imran, of the first-degree murder of Jessica Imran, of assaulting Julie Lang with a dangerous weapon in a dwelling with intent to murder her, of discharging a firearm while committing a crime of violence that resulted in Jessica Imran’s death, of discharging a firearm while committing a crime of violence that resulted in the injury of Julie Lang, of illegally carrying a firearm without a license, and of unlawfully possessing a firearm after previously having been convicted of a felony. 8 On July 6, 2007, the trial justice found that Shelton had violated the terms of his probation and sentenced him. The trial justice sentenced Shelton to serve all seventeen years of his previously imposed suspended sentence, with the remaining sentences imposed for his convictions in this case to be served consecutively to those seventeen years. On count 1 (murder of Jessica Imran), he sentenced defendant to life in prison; on count 2 (conspiracy to murder Jessica Imran), he sentenced defendant to serve ten years; on count 3 (assault with a dangerous weapon within a dwelling), he sentenced defendant to life in prison; on count 4 (conspiracy to murder Julie Lang), he sentenced defendant to serve ten years; on count 7 (unlawful possession of a pistol without a license), he sentenced the 8 The two burglary counts were dismissed pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure prior to trial. -7- defendant to serve ten years; on count 8 (unlawful possession of a firearm after previously being convicted of a crime of violence), he sentenced defendant to serve ten years; on count 9 (causing the death of Jessica Imran with a firearm), he sentenced defendant to a life sentence consecutive to that for count 1; and on count 10 (causing injury to Julie Lang with a firearm), he sentenced defendant to a twenty-year sentence to be served consecutively to count 3.9 The trial justice then determined Shelton to be a habitual offender, and he sentenced him to twenty-five nonparolable years to be served consecutive to all other terms of imprisonment. Shelton timely appealed to this Court. II Discussion On appeal, defendant raises three arguments. First, he argues that the trial justice erred when he permitted the introduction of evidence seized from Ms. Alvarez’s bedroom in violation of the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions because Ms. Alvarez’s consent for the search of her apartment was not voluntary. Second, he contends that the trial justice erred when he ruled that the state could inquire as to the length of Shelton’s suspended sentence and that he further erred when he informed the jury of the length of the suspended sentence. Finally, he challenges the term of the sentence imposed in this case as cruel and unusual under the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions, and he argues that several of the counts on which he was convicted should have been merged. 9 The sentences for counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8 were to be served concurrently. -8- A Motion to Suppress At the hearing on the motion to suppress, Ms. Alvarez testified that on July 27, 2006, she received a telephone call from the police, who asked if she could leave work early and return home. She then spoke with her niece on her cellular phone, and her niece told her that there were many police officers at the apartment looking for Shelton. After hearing that, and as soon as she learned that her children were safe, Ms. Alvarez asked the police to leave her apartment until she returned home. 10 When she arrived home, she saw that the officers had complied with her request to leave the apartment. Then, the officers asked her to consent to a search of her apartment and presented her with a consent-to-search form, which she signed. Ms. Alvarez testified at the suppression hearing that she decided not to ask the police to obtain a search warrant because she “just wanted everything to end.” She further testified that she told the police that “they had already been through my home,” but that the detective told her that she would “make it worse” by requiring the police to secure a warrant. According to Ms. Alvarez, she read the consent-to-search form prior to signing it, and the detective told her that she could refuse to consent. She testified, however, that she “really didn’t feel like [she] had any choice.” Finally, according to Ms. Alvarez, the police officers prevented her from contacting her attorney and from answering a call to her cellular phone from her attorney as she later gave her witness statement at the police station. Central Falls Det. Jeffrey K. Araujo, who met Ms. Alvarez when she arrived at her apartment on July 27, 2006, testified that she signed the consent-to-search form “very willingly.” He also testified that she at no point refused to sign the consent-to-search form. Rather, 10 Ms. Alvarez was driven home by a Lincoln police officer because, at the time, Shelton was using her car. -9- according to Det. Araujo, he and another detective read the form to her aloud after she read it herself. He testified that she told them that she understood the form. The detective characterized Ms. Alvarez “before, during, and after” the signing of the consent-to-search form as being “very compliant and very willing.” Detective Araujo said that her primary concern appeared to be the safety of her children. Pawtucket Det. Raymond Doran met Det. Araujo at Ms. Alvarez’s apartment before she arrived home. He testified that upon her arrival, he explained the purpose of their investigation, informed her that the police had observed certain items in her bedroom, and asked for her consent to search. He insisted that he did not threaten her and that she was very cooperative with their investigation. Detective Doran said that he did not recall Ms. Alvarez asking him why he needed her consent to search if the police had already been in the apartment. 11 According to Det. Doran, after Ms. Alvarez signed the consent-to-search form, she accompanied him and Det. Araujo into her bedroom. There, he testified, he removed the gun box from the backpack and opened it; inside he found two ammunition clips for a firearm. He said that he also found loose ammunition in the front pocket of the backpack. Detective Doran testified that he seized these items, in addition to the ski mask, gloves, backpack, and ammunition on the bed. Detective William P. Magill, of the Pawtucket Police Department, testified that he and his partner, Det. Tina Goncalves, brought Ms. Alvarez to the Pawtucket police station to obtain a witness statement from her. He testified that she did not mention a desire to speak with her 11 At first, Det. Doran testified that he did not tell Ms. Alvarez that the evidence found in her apartment could be used against her and that he also did not discuss the possibility of the police obtaining a search warrant. However, after the trial justice directed his attention to the consent- to-search form, the detective acknowledged that the form included language informing her that she could refuse to consent to a search without a search warrant and that incriminating evidence could be used against her in court. - 10 - lawyer before she gave the statement. Further, Det. Magill said that he did not recall Ms. Alvarez’s cellular phone ringing while she was in the interview room, nor did she ever express that her lawyer would be contacting her. Detective Goncalves testified that Ms. Alvarez never indicated to them that she wanted to speak with her lawyer, and the detective did not “recall there being a discussion about an attorney at all.” Ms. Alvarez’s attorney testified that he recalled speaking to Ms. Alvarez in late July, but he could not “remember the specifics” of their conversation. He recalled, “in general,” having a conversation with Ms. Alvarez about the police search of her apartment. The defendant argues that the trial justice erred when he denied defendant’s motion to suppress because the state failed to establish that Ms. Alvarez’s consent to search was voluntary. He contends that the trial justice erroneously disregarded evidence that the police officers “actively discouraged Miss Alvarez from talking to her Attorney” while she provided a witness statement, which, he argues, “is further proof that police used a heavy hand in dealing with Brenda Alvarez and that her consent * * * when she signed the form was not freely given.” 12 Additionally, defendant maintains that the trial justice’s “reliance upon exigent circumstances to justify the search was misplaced” and “the plain view exception based on exigent circumstances was [in]adequate to justify the seizure of the ski mask, gun box, gloves and ammunition.” He argues that the officers improperly “attempted a short cut” around the warrant requirement by 12 The trial justice rejected the assertion that the officers prevented her from speaking with her attorney prior to and while she gave a witness statement to the police. However, because this alleged contact between Ms. Alvarez and her attorney occurred after she gave the police consent to search her apartment and after the search was conducted, we fail to see how it bears any relevance to the question of whether or not Ms. Alvarez’s consent was voluntary. See State v. Humphrey, 715 A.2d 1265, 1273-74 (R.I. 1998) (noting that this Court “need not consider” allegedly harsh police treatment of the defendant in an analysis of the voluntary nature of a confession where the treatment “actually is alleged to have occurred after his confession of guilt had already been made” because it “would not affect the constitutional validity of his voluntary confession”). - 11 - first seeking Ms. Alvarez’s consent to search. Before this Court at oral argument, defendant did not challenge the trial justice’s ruling that exigent circumstances justified the initial warrantless entry and protective sweep of Ms. Alvarez’s apartment. 1 Standard of Review “In reviewing the trial justice’s denial of defendant’s motion to suppress the incriminating * * * evidence, we defer to the factual findings of the trial justice, applying a ‘clearly erroneous’ standard.” State v. Apalakis, 797 A.2d 440, 443 (R.I. 2002) (quoting State v. Page, 709 A.2d 1042, 1044 (R.I. 1998)). “A finding is clearly erroneous when, although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the basis of the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.” State v. Humphrey, 715 A.2d 1265, 1273 (R.I. 1998) (quoting State v. Baton, 488 A.2d 696, 701 (R.I. 1985)). “With respect to questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact involving constitutional issues, however, this Court engages in a de novo review in accordance with Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690 * * * (1996).” Apalakis, 797 A.2d at 443 (citing Page, 709 A.2d at 1044). Therefore, the determination of the voluntariness of an individual’s consent to search is reviewed by this Court de novo. State v. Texter, 923 A.2d 568, 576-77 (R.I. 2007) (citing State v. Dennis, 893 A.2d 250, 261 (R.I. 2006) and State v. Wiggins, 919 A.2d 987, 989 (R.I. 2007)). However, “[n]otwithstanding our de novo review of the ultimate determination of voluntariness, we give deference to the findings of historical fact made by a trial justice in the context of making that determination.” Id. at 577 (citing In re Joseph B., 822 A.2d 172, 174 (R.I. 2003), State v. Lombardi, 727 A.2d 670, 673 (R.I. 1999), and State v. Cline, 122 R.I. 297, 303, 405 A.2d 1192, 1196 (1979)). - 12 - 2 Analysis “It is well settled that ‘a search conducted pursuant to a valid consent is constitutionally permissible.’” Texter, 923 A.2d at 576 (quoting State v. Hightower, 661 A.2d 948, 960 (R.I. 1995)). Nonetheless, to ensure that the requirements of the Fourth Amendment have been fulfilled, “[t]he state bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a defendant has freely and voluntarily given consent to a search.” Id. (citing State v. Casas, 900 A.2d 1120, 1134 (R.I. 2006) and State v. O’Dell, 576 A.2d 425, 427 (R.I. 1990)). The trial justice ruled that the state met this burden. After the hearing, the trial justice found that Ms. Alvarez was “a strong-willed individual,” and he did not “believe for one minute that [her] will was overborne.” He further found that the consent-to-search form, which was read to Ms. Alvarez, gave her “a very clear option” about whether to grant the officers consent to search or, alternatively, to require that they obtain a warrant. He found that she wanted to cooperate with the police, and he “absolutely reject[ed] her allegation that she had no choice but to sign that consent-to-search form.” Finally, the trial justice found that Ms. Alvarez and her lawyer did not attempt to reach each other “until much later,” and thus he rejected her claim that the officers prevented her from speaking with her attorney prior to and while she gave a witness statement to the police. In our view, the officers properly sought Ms. Alvarez’s consent. Exigent circumstances, based on credible information that an armed suspect might be in Ms. Alvarez’s apartment, reasonably justified their initial warrantless entry into her home to effectuate a security sweep. Those circumstances could not justify a more intensive search absent a warrant or some exception to the warrant requirement, such as voluntary consent to search from Ms. Alvarez. See - 13 - Texter, 923 A.2d at 576; State v. Portes, 840 A.2d 1131, 1136 (R.I. 2004); see also State v. Jennings, 461 A.2d 361, 367 (R.I. 1983) (“When the security check has been completed, the area is secured, and there is no longer any danger of the loss or destruction of evidence, the search must cease.”). While he was lawfully on the premises, an officer viewed several items of potential evidentiary value in Ms. Alvarez’s bedroom. That observation legitimately served as the impetus for a request of Ms. Alvarez that she consent to a search of her apartment. 13 Thus, after completing their initial sweep for a suspect or victim, the police correctly recognized that they could search no further under the exigent-circumstances doctrine, and they then properly sought and secured Ms. Alvarez’s consent to search. After careful and independent review of the record, mindful that we must view the trial justice’s findings of fact through a prism of deference, it is our opinion that Ms. Alvarez voluntarily consented to a search of her apartment, and the police’s subsequent search and seizure of evidence from her bedroom easily passes constitutional muster. See Texter, 923 A.2d at 576. Although Ms. Alvarez later testified that she gave the officers consent to search her apartment because she “just wanted everything to end” and further that she was aware that the police had already been in her apartment, particularly her bedroom, when they performed the protective sweep, this merely represents her rationale for providing consent; it does not preclude a determination that her consent was given voluntarily. We give deference to the trial justice’s credibility determinations, his findings that Ms. Alvarez was “strong-willed,” desired to cooperate with the police, and was given a “clear option.” As a result, we hold that the trial 13 We need not determine whether the plain-view doctrine applies because the police officers did not seize evidence on this basis. See State v. Portes, 840 A.2d 1131, 1138 (R.I. 2004) (explaining that “a police officer may seize evidence in plain view when he is lawfully in a position that allows him to see the evidence and it is immediately apparent to the officer that the object is evidence of criminality”). - 14 - justice properly denied defendant’s motion to suppress the items seized from Ms. Alvarez’s bedroom on the basis of her voluntary consent to search. B Disclosure of the Length of Shelton’s Suspended Sentence Prior to trial, the defense and prosecution agreed that Ms. Lang would not be questioned about the length of time Shelton said he would likely be incarcerated if he was charged with possession of cocaine. 14 During the trial, defense counsel played a recording of Ms. Lang’s July 28, 2006, statement to the police and distributed a corresponding transcript to the jury. However, defense counsel inadvertently played and distributed unredacted versions of the statement, which included the portion of Ms. Lang’s statement indicating that Shelton had told her that the drug charge would result in “six to ten years for me.” The defense then requested that there be no further inquiry on that issue. The trial justice ruled that the unredacted statement was relevant and admissible. He said, “Under Rule 403, in my judgment, it is interwoven with the offense on trial and directly supports a finding of guilty knowledge, as well as motive and intent, and it allows the jury to hear a completely coherent story. The mere fact that it might be prejudicial does not render it inadmissible.” In view of counsel’s inadvertence in providing the information to the jury, the trial justice characterized the issue of Shelton’s suspended sentence and his reasons for urging Ms. Lang to take responsibility for possession of the cocaine as “fair game” for the basis of further inquiry by either party. After Ms. Lang testified on the state’s redirect examination about Shelton’s fear of violating his probation and possibly facing jail time if he accepted 14 We agree with the trial justice that the prosecutor was “generous” in making this agreement. - 15 - responsibility for the drug charge, the trial justice interjected to address the jury. He addressed the panel as follows: “testimony that purportedly reflects the defendant’s having been on a suspended or probationary term for a criminal offense is offered to you for a very limited purpose, and that is, to the extent you consider it, * * * for the purpose of a defendant’s motive or his intent or his plan as it may affect the charges before you.” After further discussion between counsel and the trial justice about how the state may proceed on the issue, the defense restated its objection to the disclosure of the length of defendant’s suspended sentence, arguing that it would be “extremely prejudicial” for the jury to learn of it. The trial justice overruled the objection and gave the defense the choice of the jury receiving this information through a stipulation or through the presentment of a certified copy of Shelton’s previous conviction. Defense counsel chose to have the trial justice inform the jury of defendant’s seventeen-year suspended sentence at the time he informed the jury that defendant was convicted of a felony in 2001. The trial justice so notified the jury. The defendant argues on appeal that the trial justice erred when he allowed disclosure of the length of defendant’s suspended sentence for a prior conviction, because this information “was unnecessary and severely prejudicial to him.” In addition, he contends that the trial justice “compound[ed]” this error when he ruled that “the subject is fair game now” for inquiry. The defendant maintains that the admission of the term of the suspended sentence violated Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. 15 15 Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence provides: “Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.” - 16 - 1 Standard of Review “Under Rule 403, relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.” State v. Hak, 963 A.2d 921, 928 (R.I. 2009). The admission or exclusion of evidence “under Rule 403 is within the sound discretion of the trial justice.” Blue Coast, Inc. v. Suarez Corp. Industries, 870 A.2d 997, 1007 (R.I. 2005) (citing State v. Martinez, 824 A.2d 443, 449 (R.I. 2003)). Even so, “this Court has said that ‘the discretion to exclude evidence under Rule 403 must be exercised sparingly.’” Hak, 963 A.2d at 928 (quoting State v. Patel, 949 A.2d 401, 412 (R.I. 2008)). However, “[t]his [C]ourt will not reverse the trial justice’s determination unless it constitutes a clear abuse of discretion.” State v. Tempest, 651 A.2d 1198, 1216 (R.I. 1995) (citing Cuddy v. Schiavonne, 568 A.2d 1387, 1389 (R.I. 1990)). 2 Analysis In our opinion, the trial justice did not abuse his discretion when he ruled that the jury would be informed about the length of Shelton’s suspended sentence, and when he ruled that inquiry would be permitted about his statement to Ms. Lang that his probationary status would result in “jail time” for him. In the first place, as the trial justice noted, the state’s agreement with the defense to keep this information from the jury was “overly generous.” When it was disclosed in the unredacted recording and transcript of Ms. Lang’s statement, occasioned by an error of the defense, the agreement effectively became meaningless. Under Rule 403, “[i]t is only evidence that is marginally relevant and enormously prejudicial that must be excluded.” Hak, 963 A.2d at 928 (quoting Patel, 949 A.2d at 412-13). - 17 - Indeed, “[a]ll evidence tending to prove guilt in a criminal trial is prejudicial to a defendant.” Id. (quoting State v. DeJesus, 947 A.2d 873, 884 (R.I. 2008)). Here, the jury already was going to hear by way of stipulation that Shelton previously had been convicted of a felony. Thus, the evidence of the length of his suspended sentence and probationary period would not be so enormously prejudicial that it would require its exclusion under Rule 403. Additionally, “[e]vidence of other conduct, even of a criminal nature, may be received if it is interwoven with the current charge in a way that tends to establish ‘guilty knowledge, intent, motive, * * * or the like.’” State v. Woodson, 551 A.2d 1187, 1193 (R.I. 1988) (quoting State v. Beaulieu, 116 R.I. 575, 579, 359 A.2d 689, 691 (1976)); see Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence (“Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts * * * may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive * * *.”). The evidence that Shelton was serving a seventeen- year suspended sentence at the time that he urged a reluctant Ms. Lang to “take the drug charge” for him so that he could avoid jail time tended to establish his motive to prevent Ms. Lang from implicating him at her August court date. Importantly, though the prejudicial effect of this evidence was minimal, the trial justice nonetheless undertook “adequate safety measures * * * to protect defendant” from undue prejudice when he instructed the jury about the “very limited purpose” for which the evidence was offered. See Woodson, 551 A.2d at 1193-94. Therefore, we hold that the trial justice’s evidentiary ruling to admit this evidence of defendant’s suspended sentence and probationary period and allow inquiry about Ms. Lang’s unredacted statement was wholly within his discretion under the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, because this evidence was relevant, not unduly prejudicial, and tended to demonstrate motive. - 18 - C Sentence Shelton argues that his “sentencing was cruel and unusual and/or incorrect in violation” of the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions. He asserts that the trial justice erred when he sentenced him to two consecutive life terms, the consecutive nonparolable sentence of twenty- five years as a habitual offender, and the consecutive seventeen years to serve as a violator of his probation. In addition, he contends that his conviction on count 3 (assault of Julie Lang with a dangerous weapon in a dwelling with intent to murder), count 7 (illegally carrying a pistol without a license), and count 8 (unlawful possession of a firearm following conviction of a felony) “result[ed] in an injustice” because the “three counts should merge into the assault with intent to murder.” Further, defendant argues that the counts of conspiracy also should have been merged. 1 Merger The defendant did not preserve for review his argument that several of the counts violated the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions.16 See State v. Scanlon, 982 A.2d 1268, 1277 (R.I. 2009). Such a defense “must be raised in a pretrial motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(2) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.” Scanlon, 982 A.2d at 1277 (citing State v. Day, 925 A.2d 962, 977 (R.I. 2007)). Under Rule 12(b)(2), the failure to raise the defense of double jeopardy or merger “constitutes a waiver thereof.” Although the rule also provides that “the court for cause shown may grant relief from the 16 “We have previously indicated that a merger argument ‘is essentially a double jeopardy argument.’” State v. Day, 925 A.2d 962, 977 (R.I. 2007) (quoting State v. Grayhurst, 852 A.2d 491, 500 (R.I. 2004)). - 19 - waiver,” id., we have held that “the strong policy favoring the pretrial presentation of a double- jeopardy motion bars its use at such a late post-trial date absent some compelling reason * * *.” State v. McGuy, 841 A.2d 1109, 1115 (R.I. 2003) (citing State v. Pearson, 49 R.I. 386, 391, 143 A. 413, 415 (1928)). The defendant has not presented a compelling reason for this Court to grant relief from the waiver of his merger argument occasioned by his failure to raise it in a pretrial motion to dismiss. We acknowledge that Shelton’s trial occurred approximately two months before this Court’s opinion in Day, 925 A.2d at 977, “made the law explicitly clear.” Scanlon, 982 A.2d at 1277. However, although we considered the defendant’s unpreserved double-jeopardy argument in Scanlon, where the trial also occurred before our opinion in Day “focused with maximal explicitness on the necessity of bringing a merger argument to the attention of the trial court through a pretrial Rule 12(b)(2) motion,” we decline to do so here. 17 Day, 925 A.2d at 977; see Scanlon, 982 A.2d at 1277. This is so because here, unlike the situations in Scanlon and Day, the merger issue was not raised before the trial justice at any stage of the proceedings, and the trial justice did not rule on the issue. Cf. Scanlon, 982 A.2d at 1277 (considering unpreserved double-jeopardy argument because “the trial justice nonetheless entertained argument on this issue when he heard defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal and he ruled on the issue”); Day, 925 A.2d at 977 (entertaining untimely merger argument “because the trial justice did address the merger argument when he ruled on defendant’s motion for a judgment of acquittal”); State v. Grullon, 117 R.I. 682, 687-88, 371 A.2d 265, 268 (1977) (reaching merits of 17 Although our opinion in Day fully elucidated the necessity to raise merger and double- jeopardy arguments in a pretrial Rule 12(b)(2) motion, this Court on numerous occasions opined on this requirement prior to the date of defendant’s trial. See, e.g., State v. Feliciano, 901 A.2d 631, 647 (R.I. 2006); Grayhurst, 852 A.2d at 500-01; State v. Haney, 842 A.2d 1083, 1084 (R.I. 2004); State v. McGuy, 841 A.2d 1109, 1115 (R.I. 2003). - 20 - procedurally flawed double-jeopardy argument because the “waiver of procedural deficiencies at the discretion of the trial justice and his hearing on the merits of the motion * * * allows us to review this as if it were a [Rule] 12(b)(2) motion”). Therefore, this case does not “give rise to one of the limited situations wherein this court will address a double jeopardy claim despite its improper assertion.” State v. Thomas, 654 A.2d 327, 330-31 (R.I. 1995) (citing Grullon, 117 R.I. at 687-88, 371 A.2d at 268 and Thornley v. Mullen, 115 R.I. 505, 510-11, 349 A.2d 158, 161 (1975)). Under Rule 35 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, however, the appeal of this issue is dismissed without prejudice, and defendant may seek relief in the Superior Court within 120 days of this opinion. 18 See Thomas, 654 A.2d at 331 (dismissing double- jeopardy argument without prejudice under Rule 35 because of “defendant’s failure to present a procedurally proper double-jeopardy defense”). 2 Length of Sentence The state argues that this Court may not properly consider defendant’s “various constitutional challenges to his sentence” on direct appeal, “but must await review upon any denial of a Rule 35 motion.” We agree with the state because, after review of the record, we 18 Rule 35 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure provides, in relevant part: “(a) Correction or reduction of sentence. The court may correct an illegal sentence at any time. The court may correct a sentence imposed in an illegal manner and it may reduce any sentence when a motion is filed within one hundred and twenty (120) days after the sentence is imposed, or within one hundred and twenty (120) days after receipt by the court of a mandate of the Supreme Court of Rhode Island issued upon affirmance of the judgment or dismissal of the appeal, or within one hundred and twenty (120) days after receipt by the court of a mandate or order of the Supreme Court of the United States issued upon affirmance of the judgment, dismissal of the appeal, or denial of a writ of certiorari.” - 21 - observe that Shelton has not filed a motion to reduce his sentence under Rule 35. It is well settled that: “in the absence of ‘extraordinary circumstances,’ this Court will not consider the validity or the legality of a sentence on direct appeal. * * * Rather, we have repeatedly held that the proper procedure for a review of a sentence begins in the Superior Court under Rule 35 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. * * * In the event that a defendant continues to be aggrieved by the ruling of the Superior Court, this Court then will review the decision on appeal.’” State v. Hesford, 900 A.2d 1194, 1198 (R.I. 2006) (quoting State v. Bettencourt, 723 A.2d 1101, 1114 (R.I. 1999)). We hold that no extraordinary circumstances exist to warrant our consideration of the validity of defendant’s consecutive sentences on direct appeal. See State v. Girard, 799 A.2d 238, 253-54 (R.I. 2002) (holding that no extraordinary circumstances existed to justify considering the premature argument that the trial justice improperly sentenced him to consecutive sentences). Therefore, “[t]he statutory 120-day period in which to seek Superior Court review of the sentence commences on the date of this opinion should the defendant choose to file such a motion * * *.” Bettencourt, 723 A.2d at 1114. IV Conclusion For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of conviction. The record shall be remanded to the Superior Court. - 22 - Supreme Court No. 2009-18-C.A. (P1/06-3227BG) State : v. : Alonzo Shelton. :",criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. Jessica Imran breathed her last on the floor of her Pawtucket home after suffering a gunshot wound to her head and neck in the early hours of July 27, 2006, after two men, one of whom was armed, forced their way into her apartment. With Ms. Imran was childhood friend Julie Lang, who suffered five gunshot wounds. Bleeding profusely and near death herself, Ms. Lang managed to call 911 after the assailants fled. The state argued that the defendant, Alonzo Shelton (defendant or Shelton), and his teenage nephew, Barry Offley, were behind this “planned execution,” as the murderous assault was dubbed by the presiding trial justice. A jury ultimately found Shelton guilty of the murder of Ms. Imran, conspiracy with his nephew to murder Ms. Imran, assault of Ms. Lang in a dwelling with the intent to murder her, conspiracy to murder Ms. Lang, discharge of a firearm while committing a crime of violence that resulted in Ms. Imran’s death, discharge of a firearm while committing a crime of violence that resulted in the injury of Ms. Lang, carrying a pistol without a license, and', '-1- possession of a firearm after previously having been convicted of a crime of violence. 1 The trial justice, appalled by the particularly violent and cold-hearted nature of the crimes, meted out a hefty sentence to the defendant, a habitual offender who already was serving a suspended sentence. The defendant appeals from the judgment of conviction and sentence, raising several constitutional grounds. After careful review of the record, we are of the opinion that his arguments have no merit, and we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'It is not unfair to characterize defendant as a lifelong criminal. Shelton was involved in an on-and-off romantic relationship with Brenda Alvarez for about eight years, even developing a paternal relationship with her children. In July 2006, Shelton resided both at Ms. Alvarez’s apartment in Central Falls and at his sister’s home in Providence. However, Ms. Alvarez was not the only object of Shelton’s affection; earlier in 2006 he also had been involved in an amorous connection with Ms. Lang.', 'In January 2006, while Shelton was riding as a passenger in Ms. Lang’s car, a police officer stopped the vehicle because it had a broken taillight. The officer discovered that there were outstanding warrants for both Shelton and Ms. Lang, and both were placed under arrest. Unbeknownst to Ms. Lang, Shelton surreptitiously deposited cocaine into her purse just prior to their arrests so that he would not be apprehended with the drugs in his possession.', 'Not surprisingly, Ms. Lang was charged with possession of the cocaine, and she was scheduled to appear in court in August. In the meantime, however, Shelton urged the unhappy Ms. Lang “to 1', 'Shelton and Offley were tried separately by agreement of the parties, with Shelton’s trial taking place first. Because Shelton was serving a suspended sentence when he was charged with the crimes in this case, his trial served as both a violation hearing and a trial on the merits.', '-2- take the charge” by acknowledging that the drugs were hers because he was on probation and would be violated if he were charged. Because Shelton also was in the midst of a suspended sentence, he knew that he would face jail time, but that Ms. Lang, he reasoned, would not. Ms. Lang refused to go along with this scheme, however, and she prevailed upon him to take responsibility for his own actions. The dispute seriously undermined their relationship, which ended after this incident. Nonetheless, their argument over it continued until July 26, 2006, the last day that Shelton pressed his desire for Ms. Lang to take responsibility for the cocaine possession.', 'Shelton, who again was staying with Ms. Alvarez at her apartment in Central Falls, spent the evening of July 26, 2006, watching television, playing video games, and drinking beer with his nephew, Barry Offley. At 3:35 a.m. the following morning, Shelton and Offley told Ms. Alvarez’s son that they were leaving for a while, but that they would return. Earlier on July 26, Ms. Lang and Ms. Imran had socialized together at Ms. Imran’s apartment in Pawtucket. They left her home to go to Providence, returning at approximately 2 a.m. on July 27, 2006. As they relaxed in Ms. Imran’s apartment, someone knocked on the apartment’s door. Ms. Imran, who believed the visitor to be her boyfriend, asked Ms. Lang to answer the door.', 'But the man on the other side of the door was not Ms. Imran’s boyfriend; according to Ms. Lang, it was Shelton and Offley. Ms. Lang was surprised to see Shelton, and he pushed open the door and stepped inside the apartment. 2 She said that she told him to leave, but she then heard a gunshot; she also heard Ms. Imran say that she almost had been shot. Ms. Lang said that it was then that she saw Offley holding a gun. He fired it again, and she watched as Ms. 2', 'Cellular-phone records reflect calls between Shelton and Ms. Imran’s phones. Ms. Lang maintains that she did not know that Shelton and Ms. Imran were acquainted and that it was not she who communicated with Shelton on Ms. Imran’s cellular phone.', '-3- Imran fell to the floor. 3 The next shot was fired at her, but it missed. The gun somehow malfunctioned at that point and, according to Ms. Lang, Shelton grabbed it from Offley and shot Ms. Lang himself.', 'Despite her injuries, Ms. Lang found Ms. Imran’s cellular phone and dialed 911. With her breathing severely labored, she managed to walk out of the apartment building, where she met a responding officer. 4 In his testimony, the officer described her as upset and bleeding. He said that Ms. Lang told him that she had been shot and, in response to his inquiries, she told him that Alonzo Shelton had shot her. She also provided Shelton’s address in Central Falls.', 'While medical personnel transported Ms. Lang to the hospital, police officers from Pawtucket and Central Falls endeavored to locate the individuals who had attacked the women. 5 A number of officers responded to the Central Falls address given to them by Ms. Lang. When the officers arrived to the three-tenement apartment, they noticed that a light was on in the first- floor apartment despite the early hour of approximately 4:30 a.m. The officers also found that the exterior door to the three-tenement apartment was unlocked, and that the doorway to the first- floor apartment was “slightly open.” 3', 'An autopsy later revealed that Ms. Imran was killed by a single gunshot wound to her neck and head, and the cause of death was deemed to be homicide. 4', 'The police were able to locate Ms. Lang based on the general location of her emergency call as determined by a global positioning system. 5', 'According to the attending physician in the emergency room at the hospital, Ms. Lang suffered five gunshot wounds and was in critical condition. While she was receiving treatment, police officers obtained a statement from her, which she later said contained inaccuracies. The Pawtucket detective who attempted to take the statement from her on July 27, 2006, found it difficult to do so, because Ms. Lang was in “grave pain” and “going in and out of consciousness.” Ultimately, he had to terminate the interview. Lang also did not recall giving a tape-recorded statement to the police the next day, July 28, 2006, and again said later that that statement contained inaccuracies, such as her assertion in that statement that she didn’t know who had shot her.', '-4-', 'Knowing that there had been a shooting and that an armed suspect might be inside, the police entered the apartment. The first officer into the apartment proceeded directly to the lit room, a bedroom, and searched the closet and under and around the bed, looking for a suspect or a victim. While he was in the bedroom, the officer saw a ski mask, black gloves, and on the left of the bed, a backpack with its flap open. Inside the open backpack, the officer also saw what appeared to him to be a black gun box. Through the eye holes of the ski mask, the officer saw a clear plastic bag containing ammunition. Next to the bed, he saw an open safe.', 'However, the police did not find a suspect in the apartment; the only people present were three teenagers and a baby, all asleep. They awoke, and the police learned from them that the apartment belonged to Ms. Alvarez, Shelton’s girlfriend. 6', 'The police then contacted Ms. Alvarez, who was at work. Understandably concerned about her children’s safety and alarmed about the police presence in her home, Ms. Alvarez requested that the police leave her apartment. The officers complied; they remained in the hallway with the apartment’s door ajar until Ms. Alvarez arrived home at approximately 6:30 a.m.', 'As soon as she got home, police officers informed her that they were investigating a homicide, and that Shelton was a suspect. A detective asked her to sign a consent-to-search form, which was read to her and which she read herself. She agreed to sign the form, indicating her consent to search. After she did so, two detectives accompanied Ms. Alvarez inside, and a search of her bedroom was completed. The items that the police had observed in the bedroom earlier were seized, along with two clips of ammunition that were found after the gun box was searched.

The other teenager, who was the baby’s mother, was Ms. Alvarez’s niece.', '-5-', 'Meanwhile, the search for Shelton and Offley continued. The United States Marshals eventually found the pair and arrested them in Florida on September 7, 2006, after Shelton’s cellular-phone use revealed his location. On October 4, 2006, a grand jury indicted Shelton and Offley on ten counts. 7 They were charged with (1) first-degree murder of Jessica Imran in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-23-1 and § 11-23-2; (2) conspiracy to commit the crime of murder of Jessica Imran, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-1-6 and § 11-23-1; (3) assault on Julie Lang with a dangerous weapon in a dwelling with the intent to murder her in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-4; (4) conspiracy to murder Julie Lang in violation of § 11-1-6 and § 11-23-1; (5) burglary of the dwelling of Jessica Imran in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-8-1; (6) conspiracy to commit burglary in violation of § 11-1-6 and § 11-8-1; (7) carrying of a pistol without a license in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-47-8(a); (8) possession of a firearm following a previous conviction for a crime of violence in violation of § 11-47-5; (9) discharge of a firearm during a crime of violence, resulting in the death of Jessica Imran, in violation of § 11-47-3.2(b)(3); and (10) discharge of a firearm while in the commission of a crime, resulting in the injury of Julie Lang, in violation of § 11-47-3.2(b)(2). Shelton was tried before a jury in Superior Court in the spring of 2007.', 'Before his trial started, Shelton filed a motion to suppress the evidence that had been seized from Ms. Alvarez’s apartment on the morning of July 27, 2006, after Ms. Alvarez gave the police consent to search the premises. He argued that exigent circumstances did not exist to justify the initial search of the bedroom, and that even if exigent circumstances did exist, the search “was conducted in violation of the scope of the exigent circumstances doctrine.” He further argued that the second search “was conducted without the voluntary consent of Brenda Alvarez.” Hearings on defendant’s motion to suppress were held on April 26 and 27, 2007. 7', 'All counts were against both Shelton and Offley with the exception of count 8, which was against Shelton alone.', '-6- After hearing testimony from six witnesses, the trial justice denied the motion. The trial justice found that “there absolutely were exigent circumstances” because there was a “killer[] on the loose,” that there were other tenants in the building, and that the officers did not have the benefit of “leisurely time.” The trial justice ruled that the police “would have been absolutely derelict in their duty not to go in there.” Then, while the police offers were lawfully on the premises, the trial justice found that they discovered certain items in plain view. He also found that Ms. Alvarez voluntarily consented to the search of her apartment.', 'After trial, the jury found defendant guilty of conspiring with Offley to murder Julie Lang, conspiring with Offley to murder Jessica Imran, of the first-degree murder of Jessica Imran, of assaulting Julie Lang with a dangerous weapon in a dwelling with intent to murder her, of discharging a firearm while committing a crime of violence that resulted in Jessica Imran’s death, of discharging a firearm while committing a crime of violence that resulted in the injury of Julie Lang, of illegally carrying a firearm without a license, and of unlawfully possessing a firearm after previously having been convicted of a felony. 8 On July 6, 2007, the trial justice found that Shelton had violated the terms of his probation and sentenced him. The trial justice sentenced Shelton to serve all seventeen years of his previously imposed suspended sentence, with the remaining sentences imposed for his convictions in this case to be served consecutively to those seventeen years. On count 1 (murder of Jessica Imran), he sentenced defendant to life in prison; on count 2 (conspiracy to murder Jessica Imran), he sentenced defendant to serve ten years; on count 3 (assault with a dangerous weapon within a dwelling), he sentenced defendant to life in prison; on count 4 (conspiracy to murder Julie Lang), he sentenced defendant to serve ten years; on count 7 (unlawful possession of a pistol without a license), he sentenced the 8', 'The two burglary counts were dismissed pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure prior to trial.', '-7- defendant to serve ten years; on count 8 (unlawful possession of a firearm after previously being convicted of a crime of violence), he sentenced defendant to serve ten years; on count 9 (causing the death of Jessica Imran with a firearm), he sentenced defendant to a life sentence consecutive to that for count 1; and on count 10 (causing injury to Julie Lang with a firearm), he sentenced defendant to a twenty-year sentence to be served consecutively to count 3.9 The trial justice then determined Shelton to be a habitual offender, and he sentenced him to twenty-five nonparolable years to be served consecutive to all other terms of imprisonment. Shelton timely appealed to this Court.', 'II', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, defendant raises three arguments. First, he argues that the trial justice erred when he permitted the introduction of evidence seized from Ms. Alvarez’s bedroom in violation of the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions because Ms. Alvarez’s consent for the search of her apartment was not voluntary. Second, he contends that the trial justice erred when he ruled that the state could inquire as to the length of Shelton’s suspended sentence and that he further erred when he informed the jury of the length of the suspended sentence. Finally, he challenges the term of the sentence imposed in this case as cruel and unusual under the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions, and he argues that several of the counts on which he was convicted should have been merged. 9', 'The sentences for counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8 were to be served concurrently.', '-8-', 'A', 'Motion to Suppress', 'At the hearing on the motion to suppress, Ms. Alvarez testified that on July 27, 2006, she received a telephone call from the police, who asked if she could leave work early and return home. She then spoke with her niece on her cellular phone, and her niece told her that there were many police officers at the apartment looking for Shelton. After hearing that, and as soon as she learned that her children were safe, Ms. Alvarez asked the police to leave her apartment until she returned home. 10 When she arrived home, she saw that the officers had complied with her request to leave the apartment. Then, the officers asked her to consent to a search of her apartment and presented her with a consent-to-search form, which she signed.', 'Ms. Alvarez testified at the suppression hearing that she decided not to ask the police to obtain a search warrant because she “just wanted everything to end.” She further testified that she told the police that “they had already been through my home,” but that the detective told her that she would “make it worse” by requiring the police to secure a warrant. According to Ms. Alvarez, she read the consent-to-search form prior to signing it, and the detective told her that she could refuse to consent. She testified, however, that she “really didn’t feel like [she] had any choice.” Finally, according to Ms. Alvarez, the police officers prevented her from contacting her attorney and from answering a call to her cellular phone from her attorney as she later gave her witness statement at the police station.', 'Central Falls Det. Jeffrey K. Araujo, who met Ms. Alvarez when she arrived at her apartment on July 27, 2006, testified that she signed the consent-to-search form “very willingly.” He also testified that she at no point refused to sign the consent-to-search form.', 'Rather, 10', 'Ms. Alvarez was driven home by a Lincoln police officer because, at the time, Shelton was using her car.', '-9- according to Det. Araujo, he and another detective read the form to her aloud after she read it herself. He testified that she told them that she understood the form. The detective characterized Ms. Alvarez “before, during, and after” the signing of the consent-to-search form as being “very compliant and very willing.” Detective Araujo said that her primary concern appeared to be the safety of her children.', 'Pawtucket Det. Raymond Doran met Det. Araujo at Ms. Alvarez’s apartment before she arrived home. He testified that upon her arrival, he explained the purpose of their investigation, informed her that the police had observed certain items in her bedroom, and asked for her consent to search. He insisted that he did not threaten her and that she was very cooperative with their investigation. Detective Doran said that he did not recall Ms. Alvarez asking him why he needed her consent to search if the police had already been in the apartment. 11', 'According to Det. Doran, after Ms. Alvarez signed the consent-to-search form, she accompanied him and Det. Araujo into her bedroom. There, he testified, he removed the gun box from the backpack and opened it; inside he found two ammunition clips for a firearm. He said that he also found loose ammunition in the front pocket of the backpack. Detective Doran testified that he seized these items, in addition to the ski mask, gloves, backpack, and ammunition on the bed.', 'Detective William P. Magill, of the Pawtucket Police Department, testified that he and his partner, Det. Tina Goncalves, brought Ms. Alvarez to the Pawtucket police station to obtain a witness statement from her. He testified that she did not mention a desire to speak with her 11', 'At first, Det. Doran testified that he did not tell Ms. Alvarez that the evidence found in her apartment could be used against her and that he also did not discuss the possibility of the police obtaining a search warrant. However, after the trial justice directed his attention to the consent- to-search form, the detective acknowledged that the form included language informing her that she could refuse to consent to a search without a search warrant and that incriminating evidence could be used against her in court.', '- 10 - lawyer before she gave the statement. Further, Det. Magill said that he did not recall Ms. Alvarez’s cellular phone ringing while she was in the interview room, nor did she ever express that her lawyer would be contacting her. Detective Goncalves testified that Ms. Alvarez never indicated to them that she wanted to speak with her lawyer, and the detective did not “recall there being a discussion about an attorney at all.” Ms. Alvarez’s attorney testified that he recalled speaking to Ms. Alvarez in late July, but he could not “remember the specifics” of their conversation. He recalled, “in general,” having a conversation with Ms. Alvarez about the police search of her apartment.', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice erred when he denied defendant’s motion to suppress because the state failed to establish that Ms. Alvarez’s consent to search was voluntary. He contends that the trial justice erroneously disregarded evidence that the police officers “actively discouraged Miss Alvarez from talking to her Attorney” while she provided a witness statement, which, he argues, “is further proof that police used a heavy hand in dealing with Brenda Alvarez and that her consent * * * when she signed the form was not freely given.” 12 Additionally, defendant maintains that the trial justice’s “reliance upon exigent circumstances to justify the search was misplaced” and “the plain view exception based on exigent circumstances was [in]adequate to justify the seizure of the ski mask, gun box, gloves and ammunition.” He argues that the officers improperly “attempted a short cut” around the warrant requirement by 12', 'The trial justice rejected the assertion that the officers prevented her from speaking with her attorney prior to and while she gave a witness statement to the police. However, because this alleged contact between Ms. Alvarez and her attorney occurred after she gave the police consent to search her apartment and after the search was conducted, we fail to see how it bears any relevance to the question of whether or not Ms. Alvarez’s consent was voluntary. See State v. Humphrey, 715 A.2d 1265, 1273-74 (R.I. 1998) (noting that this Court “need not consider” allegedly harsh police treatment of the defendant in an analysis of the voluntary nature of a confession where the treatment “actually is alleged to have occurred after his confession of guilt had already been made” because it “would not affect the constitutional validity of his voluntary confession”).', '- 11 - first seeking Ms. Alvarez’s consent to search.

Page, 709 A.2d 1042, 1044 (R.I. 1998)). “A finding is clearly erroneous when, although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the basis of the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.” State v.

He found that she wanted to cooperate with the police, and he “absolutely reject[ed] her allegation that she had no choice but to sign that consent-to-search form.” Finally, the trial justice found that Ms. Alvarez and her lawyer did not attempt to reach each other “until much later,” and thus he rejected her claim that the officers prevented her from speaking with her attorney prior to and while she gave a witness statement to the police.', 'In our view, the officers properly sought Ms. Alvarez’s consent. Exigent circumstances, based on credible information that an armed suspect might be in Ms. Alvarez’s apartment, reasonably justified their initial warrantless entry into her home to effectuate a security sweep. Those circumstances could not justify a more intensive search absent a warrant or some exception to the warrant requirement, such as voluntary consent to search from Ms. Alvarez.

While he was lawfully on the premises, an officer viewed several items of potential evidentiary value in Ms. Alvarez’s bedroom. That observation legitimately served as the impetus for a request of Ms. Alvarez that she consent to a search of her apartment. 13 Thus, after completing their initial sweep for a suspect or victim, the police correctly recognized that they could search no further under the exigent-circumstances doctrine, and they then properly sought and secured Ms. Alvarez’s consent to search.', 'After careful and independent review of the record, mindful that we must view the trial justice’s findings of fact through a prism of deference, it is our opinion that Ms. Alvarez voluntarily consented to a search of her apartment, and the police’s subsequent search and seizure of evidence from her bedroom easily passes constitutional muster. See Texter, 923 A.2d at 576. Although Ms. Alvarez later testified that she gave the officers consent to search her apartment because she “just wanted everything to end” and further that she was aware that the police had already been in her apartment, particularly her bedroom, when they performed the protective sweep, this merely represents her rationale for providing consent; it does not preclude a determination that her consent was given voluntarily. We give deference to the trial justice’s credibility determinations, his findings that Ms. Alvarez was “strong-willed,” desired to cooperate with the police, and was given a “clear option.” As a result, we hold that the trial 13', 'We need not determine whether the plain-view doctrine applies because the police officers did not seize evidence on this basis.

However, defense counsel inadvertently played and distributed unredacted versions of the statement, which included the portion of Ms. Lang’s statement indicating that Shelton had told her that the drug charge would result in “six to ten years for me.” The defense then requested that there be no further inquiry on that issue.', 'The trial justice ruled that the unredacted statement was relevant and admissible. He said, “Under Rule 403, in my judgment, it is interwoven with the offense on trial and directly supports a finding of guilty knowledge, as well as motive and intent, and it allows the jury to hear a completely coherent story. The mere fact that it might be prejudicial does not render it inadmissible.” In view of counsel’s inadvertence in providing the information to the jury, the trial justice characterized the issue of Shelton’s suspended sentence and his reasons for urging Ms. Lang to take responsibility for possession of the cocaine as “fair game” for the basis of further inquiry by either party. After Ms. Lang testified on the state’s redirect examination about Shelton’s fear of violating his probation and possibly facing jail time if he accepted 14', 'We agree with the trial justice that the prosecutor was “generous” in making this agreement.', '- 15 - responsibility for the drug charge, the trial justice interjected to address the jury.

The trial justice overruled the objection and gave the defense the choice of the jury receiving this information through a stipulation or through the presentment of a certified copy of Shelton’s previous conviction. Defense counsel chose to have the trial justice inform the jury of defendant’s seventeen-year suspended sentence at the time he informed the jury that defendant was convicted of a felony in 2001. The trial justice so notified the jury.', 'The defendant argues on appeal that the trial justice erred when he allowed disclosure of the length of defendant’s suspended sentence for a prior conviction, because this information “was unnecessary and severely prejudicial to him.” In addition, he contends that the trial justice “compound[ed]” this error when he ruled that “the subject is fair game now” for inquiry. The defendant maintains that the admission of the term of the suspended sentence violated Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. 15 15', 'Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence provides: “Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.”', '- 16 -', '1', 'Standard of Review', '“Under Rule 403, relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.” State v.

In the first place, as the trial justice noted, the state’s agreement with the defense to keep this information from the jury was “overly generous.” When it was disclosed in the unredacted recording and transcript of Ms. Lang’s statement, occasioned by an error of the defense, the agreement effectively became meaningless.', 'Under Rule 403, “[i]t is only evidence that is marginally relevant and enormously prejudicial that must be excluded.” Hak, 963 A.2d at 928 (quoting Patel, 949 A.2d at 412-13).', '- 17 - Indeed, “[a]ll evidence tending to prove guilt in a criminal trial is prejudicial to a defendant.” Id. (quoting State v. DeJesus, 947 A.2d 873, 884 (R.I. 2008)). Here, the jury already was going to hear by way of stipulation that Shelton previously had been convicted of a felony. Thus, the evidence of the length of his suspended sentence and probationary period would not be so enormously prejudicial that it would require its exclusion under Rule 403.', 'Additionally, “[e]vidence of other conduct, even of a criminal nature, may be received if it is interwoven with the current charge in a way that tends to establish ‘guilty knowledge, intent, motive, * * * or the like.’” State v.

The evidence that Shelton was serving a seventeen- year suspended sentence at the time that he urged a reluctant Ms. Lang to “take the drug charge” for him so that he could avoid jail time tended to establish his motive to prevent Ms. Lang from implicating him at her August court date. Importantly, though the prejudicial effect of this evidence was minimal, the trial justice nonetheless undertook “adequate safety measures * * * to protect defendant” from undue prejudice when he instructed the jury about the “very limited purpose” for which the evidence was offered. See Woodson, 551 A.2d at 1193-94. Therefore, we hold that the trial justice’s evidentiary ruling to admit this evidence of defendant’s suspended sentence and probationary period and allow inquiry about Ms. Lang’s unredacted statement was wholly within his discretion under the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, because this evidence was relevant, not unduly prejudicial, and tended to demonstrate motive.', '- 18 -', 'C', 'Sentence', 'Shelton argues that his “sentencing was cruel and unusual and/or incorrect in violation” of the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions.

In addition, he contends that his conviction on count 3 (assault of Julie Lang with a dangerous weapon in a dwelling with intent to murder), count 7 (illegally carrying a pistol without a license), and count 8 (unlawful possession of a firearm following conviction of a felony) “result[ed] in an injustice” because the “three counts should merge into the assault with intent to murder.” Further, defendant argues that the counts of conspiracy also should have been merged.', '1', 'Merger', 'The defendant did not preserve for review his argument that several of the counts violated the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions.16 See State v.

55,State : v. : Leroy Robinson. :,criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson for the Court. On February 10, 2006, a Providence County Superior Court jury found the defendant, Leroy Robinson, guilty of two counts of first-degree child molestation sexual assault. On May 23, 2006, the defendant received two concurrent sentences of twenty years imprisonment, with nine years to serve and the remainder suspended, with probation.', 'On appeal, defendant contends that the trial justice erred in (1) denying his motion to suppress the confession that he made to a Providence police detective; (2) allowing into evidence certain testimony of the mother of the complaining witness, which testimony defendant contends violates the hearsay evidence rule; and (3) allowing into evidence certain testimony of the above- referenced Providence police detective concerning uncharged sexual acts, which testimony defendant contends violates two provisions of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence.', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'This case centers around allegations to the effect that defendant sexually molested a young man whom we shall call Steven.1 The defendant was charged with two counts of first- degree child molestation sexual assault and one count of second-degree child molestation sexual assault, which assaults were allegedly committed between August 21 and 31 of 1999. We set forth below the most significant testimony given by various witnesses who testified at defendant’s jury trial or at the suppression hearing that preceded the trial.', 'A', 'The Testimony of Tracey', 'Tracey (Steven’s mother) testified at trial as a witness for the prosecution. She testified that, on the morning of August 10, 2003, she entered Steven’s bedroom.2 She stated that on that occasion she found Steven naked in bed with her stepson, Fred Jr.3 She testified that, when she questioned them, the boys did not admit to having engaged in any inappropriate sexual conduct; she stated that they just said to her that “it was hot” and that “they [had] only touched each other on the stomach.”', 'Tracey further testified that, in the evening of August 10, she told Steven that she wanted to know the truth about what had occurred with Fred Jr. that morning. Tracey stated that, 1', 'We shall refer to the several non-party civilians involved in this case pseudonymously in order to protect their privacy. 2', 'Steven’s date of birth is November 13, 1986. Accordingly, he was sixteen years old in August of 2003. 3', 'Fred Jr.’s date of birth is December 30, 1990. Accordingly, he was twelve years old in August of 2003.', '-2- although Steven did not initially admit to having molested his stepbrother, he eventually made the following statement to her (as she recalled it): “I only did it because Leroy did it to me.”4 Tracey stated that she then called Fred Jr.’s mother (Valerie) to discuss what she had observed.', 'Tracey testified that, on the following day (August 11), she convened a family meeting in order to discuss what had occurred between Steven and Fred Jr. and to discuss how to proceed with regard to Steven’s accusation concerning Leroy Robinson. Present at that meeting in addition to Tracey were her mother, Steven, Fred Sr. (Tracey’s husband and Fred Jr.’s father), Fred Jr., and Valerie. Tracey testified that, at the family meeting, Steven and Fred Jr. admitted to having engaged in some inappropriate touching, but they denied having engaged in any oral sexual contact. She testified that, after discussing the accusation that Steven had made with respect to Leroy Robinson, the whole family group (including Steven) decided to go to Leroy’s apartment in order to confront him with Steven’s allegations of sexual abuse.', 'Tracey testified that, when she initially confronted Leroy, he denied having “violated” Steven; but she added that, when Leroy was face to face with Steven, Leroy admitted to having molested him. Tracey stated that defendant also told her that he himself had been molested in a group home. Tracey testified that defendant began to cry and that she then “smacked” him; she further testified that no one else struck defendant. She stated that soon thereafter her husband asked Valerie to summon the police.', 'B', 'The Testimony of Steven', 'Steven, the complaining witness, testified at trial that defendant is the nephew of his stepmother (Josephine); Josephine is married to Steven’s father. Steven testified that, as a child, 4', 'It is uncontested that the “Leroy” referred to in Steven’s accusatory statement was defendant, Leroy Robinson, who is the nephew of Steven’s stepmother.', '-3- he often visited his father on weekends and that sometimes defendant would be there at the same time. Steven described his relationship with defendant as falling into the “fun” category; he testified that he and defendant would engage in such activities as playing games, wrestling, and riding in defendant’s car. Steven testified that, from time to time while they were engaged in these activities, he and defendant would be joined by Steven’s siblings and other relatives.', 'Steven further testified that his mother and his stepfather (Fred Sr.) were married on August 21, 1999 and that he stayed at his biological father’s home for two or three days after the wedding.5 According to Steven’s testimony, while he and his brothers were staying at his father’s home, defendant came to visit. When that visit was over, defendant drove Steven and his brothers to his own apartment, where he lived with his mother and his sisters.', 'Steven testified that he spent that August night at defendant’s apartment and that he, his two brothers, and defendant all slept in the same bed in the living room. Steven stated that he awoke when he felt someone pulling his boxer shorts. Steven testified that it was defendant who was doing the pulling and that defendant proceeded to “put his mouth on [Steven’s] penis.” Steven further testified that he then performed a similar sexual act on defendant. Steven stated that, after the sexual acts were completed, he went back to sleep. Steven testified that he did not tell anyone what had occurred because he had “liked it.”', 'Steven also testified that the just-described August 1999 sexual conduct was not the first time that defendant had engaged in oral sexual conduct with him; he stated that the first instance had occurred in the living room of his father’s house when he was “about nine” years old. At that point in the trial, the trial justice instructed the jurors that they were not to consider Steven’s testimony with respect to that prior sexual activity with defendant as evidence of defendant’s bad 5', 'In August of 1999, Steven was twelve years of age. See footnote 2, supra.', '-4- character or as evidence that defendant had a propensity to commit such acts. The trial justice further instructed the jury that they could consider the evidence “to establish, if you believe this witness, the nature of the relationship between the witness and the defendant; [and/or] the disposition or intent of the defendant towards this witness, and for no other reason or no other purpose.”', 'The trial justice further instructed the jurors that they could not use Steven’s testimony regarding sexual conduct with defendant when he was nine years old “to find him guilty of the charges that he is on trial for * * * today.” Steven then proceeded to testify that, on that earlier occasion (when he was approximately nine years old), defendant had awakened him and had performed oral sex on him, after which Steven had performed oral sex on defendant; Steven added that defendant then masturbated both himself and Steven.', 'Steven testified that he did not tell anyone about defendant’s conduct until August of 2003, when he told his mother that defendant had previously molested him; Steven was sixteen years old at that time.6 Steven testified that his reason for making the August 2003 disclosure to his mother (Tracey) was because she had (in Steven’s words) “walked in on [him] molesting [his] step-brother” (Fred Jr.). It was further Steven’s testimony that he told his mother that “Leroy did the same thing to me.” 6', 'Steven incorrectly stated during his testimony that he was seventeen years old in August of 2003 when he made the disclosure that is referenced in the text. It is undisputed, however, that Steven’s date of birth is November 13, 1986; it is therefore clear that he was sixteen years old in August of 2003.', '-5-', 'C', 'The Testimony of Detective Miele', 'Detective Robert Miele of the Providence Police Department testified at the hearing on the motion to suppress defendant’s confession.7 According to Detective Miele’s testimony, as of the time of the suppression hearing he had been a member of the Providence police force for twenty-two years and had served in various capacities; he said that, in August of 2003, he was serving in the “special victims unit.” He testified that, on August 11, 2003, he was telephoned by Officer Michael Long, who informed him that he had responded to a call that necessitated an investigation into allegations of child molestation. Officer Long stated to Detective Miele that he had with him the complaining witness as well as the suspected perpetrator and several other people connected with the case. Detective Miele testified that he instructed Officer Long to bring them all to the station.', 'He testified that Officer Long then detained defendant and transported him to the Providence police station;8 he added that Steven and the other witnesses were also transported to the police station.', 'Detective Miele stated that, at the police station, he first spoke briefly with Officer Long and then proceeded to speak with Steven, his mother (Tracey), and his stepfather (Fred Sr.). The 7', 'We shall summarize Detective Miele’s testimony at the suppression hearing in the “Facts and Travel” portion of this opinion, due to the fact that the correctness (vel non) of the trial justice’s denial of that motion is the first issue before us on appeal. A portion of the detective’s trial testimony is the subject of another appellate argument and will be discussed toward the end of this opinion. 8', 'There is a lack of clarity in the record as to whether defendant was in fact under arrest when he was transported to the police station by Officer Long. However, the question of just when defendant was technically placed under arrest (as opposed to merely being detained) is of no moment with respect to the resolution of the legal issues in this case. We shall proceed under the assumption that this was a custodial interrogation.', '-6- detective added that, while he was engaged in conducting the just-referenced interviews, defendant was held in a locked cell in the detention area of the police station. Detective Miele stated that, when he finished conducting those witness interviews (a process which the detective estimated lasted approximately thirty to forty minutes), he proceeded to interview defendant.', 'In describing his August 11, 2003 interview of defendant, Detective Miele testified that he removed defendant from his cell in the detention area and brought him to an interview room, which he described as being a plain room with a window; he said that the room contained a table, several chairs, and a mirror. The detective added that the only exit from the interview room is locked from the outside.', 'Detective Miele testified that, upon bringing defendant into the interview room, he handcuffed him to a bar attached to the wall. He stated that it is his practice to handcuff to the wall every suspect who comes to the interview room. The detective testified that it is standard police procedure (something that he said is “always” done) to leave one hand free and one hand cuffed to the wall. Detective Miele further stated that a suspect is handcuffed at “a comfortable level, pretty much even with the table.” The detective testified that he also offered defendant water and attempted to make him “as comfortable as possible.”', 'Detective Miele stated that he proceeded to interview defendant “solo.” He testified that he sat at the table with defendant and read him his Miranda9 rights from the standard rights form used by the Providence Police Department. Detective Miele stated that defendant informed him of his date of birth and said that he had completed high school; this information was then recorded on the rights form. Detective Miele testified that he stated aloud to defendant that he was suspected of having committed first-degree child molestation; the detective added that he also wrote that fact on the rights form. Detective Miele recalled that defendant “was nodding his 9', 'Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).', '-7- head [indicating that] he understood” as the detective was reading aloud to him the various rights that are printed on the rights form. The detective stated that, after he had read aloud all of the rights set forth on the rights form, he asked defendant if he understood his rights; he testified that defendant replied, “Yes, I do.” The detective said that he then asked defendant to initial each of the statements on the rights form so as to indicate that he understood the statements; he testified that defendant did so.10 He stated that defendant then checked the box on the rights form which indicated that he understood his rights and then proceeded to sign the rights form. Detective Miele estimated that the process of apprising defendant of his rights took approximately ten minutes.', 'Detective Miele testified that he and defendant then began to discuss the allegation that defendant had sexually molested Steven. The detective testified that defendant initially told him that he “only taught him [Steven] how to masturbate;” the detective added that defendant said that the teaching about masturbation had occurred “years ago”—when Steven was “nine or ten years old.” The detective further testified that defendant, after admitting to having taught Steven how to masturbate, also stated that “later on there was some oral sex involved;” it was further the detective’s testimony that defendant then added that he “never penetrated [Steven].” Detective Miele testified that defendant informed him that he and Steven performed oral sex on each other “over a period of years.” Detective Miele testified that, when he asked defendant where those sexual acts had taken place, his reaction was as follows (in the detective’s words):', '“Mr. Robinson started to get very upset, very emotional, crying,', 'sobbing, and it was very, very hard at that point to get anything', 'more out of Mr. Robinson during [that] interview.” 10', 'A copy of the rights form signed by defendant was admitted into evidence as a full exhibit at the suppression hearing.', '-8- The detective further testified that defendant admitted that the above-referenced sexual acts occurred on various occasions and at more than one location.', 'Detective Miele testified that, as the interview proceeded, defendant became “more and more distraught” and eventually asked: “Am I going to need a lawyer?” The detective stated that, in response to that question, he said: “Yes, you are.” He testified that he then asked defendant whether he wanted to make a formal written statement, and defendant responded by asking the detective whether “he really need[ed] a lawyer.” It was Detective Miele’s testimony that he replied: “Yes, you need a lawyer.” The detective stated that, at that point, defendant made it clear that he did not want to give or sign any statement. Detective Miele testified that he then ended the interview and returned defendant to the detention area. The detective said that he also indicated on the rights form that defendant wanted an attorney. Detective Miele testified that the entire interview, including the time required to apprise defendant of his rights, lasted approximately thirty-five minutes.', 'The detective explained that, when he began to read defendant his rights, defendant was “visibly shaken, very distraught” and “was very upset.” Detective Miele stated that, although defendant was upset and crying at times, he was “coherent” and “very loud [and] very clear;” it was his view that defendant appeared to understand the questions that he was being asked. The detective further testified that, although he described defendant as having been “upset,” he “didn’t seem so upset [that] he wasn’t making any sense.” Detective Miele explained that, although defendant was “in pretty good shape” when the detective read him his rights, he “started getting progressively worse” and became “more distraught” as the interview proceeded. Detective Miele further testified that he neither coerced nor threatened defendant in any way. The detective stated that he had treated defendant “like a gentleman;” he added that defendant', '-9- had similarly treated him “like a gentleman” and that the two of them “had a good dialogue going on.”', 'In response to defense counsel’s questioning about the fact that there was no contemporaneous recording of defendant’s statements, Detective Miele testified that both audio and video recorders were available within the police station; he added, however, that he did not make either an audio or video recording of the above-referenced interviews with defendant or the witnesses. The detective further testified that he also did not take any written notes while interviewing defendant or the witnesses. As for his own written statement, Detective Miele testified that approximately twenty-five minutes elapsed between the time when he returned defendant to the detention area and the moment when he began to prepare his own statement. He testified that he did not refer to any notes when he composed his statement, adding that what defendant had said to him “was fresh in [his] mind.”', 'D', 'The Indictment', 'On January 20, 2004, a grand jury charged defendant with two counts of first-degree child molestation sexual assault in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-37-8.1 and one count of second- degree child molestation sexual assault in violation of § 11-37-8.3.11 Each count indicated that the alleged child molestation offenses were committed between August 21 and August 31 of 1999.12 11', 'The single count of second-degree child molestation was ultimately dismissed by the prosecution at the conclusion of the state’s case-in-chief. 12', 'It should be borne in mind that the complaining witness, Steven, was twelve years old when the sexual acts that defendant was charged with having committed allegedly occurred. See footnote 2, supra.', '- 10 -', 'E', 'The Motion to Suppress Defendant’s Confession', 'The defendant having filed a motion to suppress the confession that he made to Detective Miele in August of 2003, a hearing was held in the Superior Court with respect to that motion on February 3, 2006. (The jury had not yet been impaneled.) Detective Miele was the only witness to testify at the hearing. The defendant contended that the prosecution had failed to meet its burden of demonstrating the voluntariness of his confession. At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion.', 'F', 'The Trial', 'A jury trial was held in the Providence County Superior Court from February 6 to February 10, 2006.

The defendant also contends that the following factors cumulatively demonstrate that his confession was not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary: (1) his emotional state when he was interviewed by the detective, which he said was exacerbated by the fact that he was handcuffed to the wall during the interview; and (2) what defendant characterizes as the unreliability of Detective Miele’s testimony due to a lack of contemporaneous electronic recording or note-taking by the detective. The defendant further contends that the question “Am I going to need a lawyer?” that he posed to Detective Miele after he had confessed to criminal conduct demonstrates that he did not understand his rights and that he was emotionally unable “to rationally assess his situation” and to waive his rights in a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary manner. The defendant additionally contends that the trial justice’s failure, in ruling upon the motion to suppress, to mention the absence of a contemporaneous electronic recording or note- taking by the detective during the interrogation constitutes a disregard of a “critical part” of the totality of the circumstances analysis.13', 'The defendant contends that the absence of such recording and/or note-taking should have been given considerable weight in the trial court’s voluntariness analysis.', '1.

The trial justice additionally noted the absence in the record of anything suggesting that “defendant was upset as a result of being handcuffed to the wall.”', 'The trial justice also found that defendant was troubled and tearful from the outset of the interview and that he became increasingly more emotional as the interview continued. The trial justice further found that Detective Miele apprised defendant of his rights before the substantive interview began. The trial justice additionally noted that defendant’s question to the detective as to whether he needed a lawyer reflected the fact that defendant had been apprised of his rights.16 The trial justice also noted that defendant’s question about whether he needed an attorney came after he had confessed to having sexually molested Steven.', 'The trial justice summarized as follows his findings as to the “atmosphere” in which the interview at the police station took place:', '“[T]he overall action here does not appear to be deliberate or', 'coercive, and it doesn’t appear that the defendant was tricked or', 'misled in any way by the officer.

Id. at 1275 (stating, in the course of upholding the voluntary nature of the defendant’s incriminating statements, that the use of restraints during interrogation was “no more confining or inhumane than those that are placed on prisoners from the ACI [Adult Correctional Institutions] who appear before this Court pro se”); see also State v. Hall, 940 A.2d 645, 656 (R.I. 2008). We are unable to perceive any meaningful basis for departing from the rationale of Humphrey, and we consider the holding in that case to be dispositive with respect to the handcuff issue in this case.', 'The defendant also contends that his emotional state, which he describes as being “in the throes of a severe emotional breakdown,” negates the knowing and voluntary nature of his confession.', 'It is his contention that his “highly charged emotions” demonstrate that his confession could not have been the product of his “free and rational choice.”17 Taking into account the trial justice’s careful findings of historical fact, we are not persuaded that 17', 'The words “free and rational choice” appear in this Court’s opinion in Humphrey, 715 A.2d at 1274 (internal quotation marks omitted).', '- 16 - defendant’s emotional state rendered him unable to “knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily”18 waive his right against self-incrimination. The trial justice found that defendant was “to some extent upset and agitated or tearful at times from the time he was brought into the room and that [that condition] gradually seemed to increase as time went on.” The trial justice’s findings were founded upon a plethora of evidence in the record and clearly indicate that defendant’s apparent emotional breakdown occurred both after he had reviewed and waived his Miranda rights and after he had confessed to having engaged in oral sexual acts with Steven.19', 'Detective Miele’s testimony is unrefuted that, although defendant was upset while his rights were read to him, he was nonetheless “coherent.” Detective Miele further testified that defendant was able to provide him with his personal information and also was able to participate in what the detective characterized as “a good dialogue.” According to the detective’s testimony at the suppression hearing, it was only after defendant confessed to having engaged in sexual conduct with Steven that he became increasingly upset emotionally. In view of the trial justice’s findings of historical facts and Detective Miele’s testimony, we are unable to conclude that defendant’s emotional state rendered him unable either to knowingly waive his Miranda rights or to confess in a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary manner.', 'The defendant further contends that his question “Am I going to need a lawyer?” demonstrates that he did not understand his rights and therefore could not have validly waived them. We are unpersuaded by this contention. The defendant was a high school graduate, and 18', 'State v. Bido, 941 A.2d 822, 835 (R.I. 2008) (quoting Dumas, 750 A.2d at 423). 19', 'Cf. State v. LaRosa, 112 R.I. 571, 575-76, 313 A.2d 375, 377-78 (1974) (holding not clearly erroneous the trial justice’s finding of fact that the “defendant was overcome by emotional stress” during the entire interrogation and upholding the trial justice’s conclusion that the defendant’s waiver of her Miranda rights and her subsequent confession were not freely and voluntarily made).', '- 17 - Detective Miele’s testimony was clear that, although defendant was crying at times, he was “coherent” during the reading of his rights. There is no indication in the record that, as the detective reviewed those rights with him, defendant chose to ask the detective any questions or sought to clarify any of his rights.20', 'It is an undisputed fact that, when the interview eventually progressed into terrain that was more problematic for defendant, he chose to ask the detective whether he was going to need a lawyer.21 However, the fact that the seriousness of his predicament dawned on defendant in the midst of the interview process prompting him to inquire of the detective as to his need for legal assistance in no way indicates that he did not understand ab initio (i.e., when his rights were read to him) that he had the “right to the presence of a lawyer * * *.” The fact that defendant chose not to invoke his “right to the presence of a lawyer” at the outset does not mean that he did not understand that he had such a right. Upon reviewing the entire record, we are convinced that defendant at all pertinent times understood his Miranda rights.', 'The defendant’s final contention with respect to the motion to suppress his confession is that the trial justice’s analysis of the voluntariness issue failed to give sufficient weight to the 20', 'Detective Miele further testified that defendant “was nodding his head [to signify that] he understood” while the detective, who was seated right next to him, read defendant his Miranda rights aloud to him. 21', 'It will be recalled that, after having confessed to Detective Miele that he had engaged in inappropriate sexual contact with Steven, defendant asked the detective: “Am I going to need a lawyer?” Detective Miele responded in the affirmative to that question—as he did to the subsequent question by defendant, asking whether “he really need[ed] a lawyer.”', 'Since Detective Miele’s questioning of defendant ceased when these questions were posed, we need not and do not decide whether either or both of said questions constituted an unequivocal request for counsel. See Dumas, 750 A.2d at 424 (holding that a defendant’s “statement ‘Do I need a lawyer?’ [was] a request for advice and not an unequivocal request for counsel”).', '- 18 - fact that Detective Miele did not take notes or use an audio or video recording device while interviewing defendant.22 We consider this argument to be unavailing. It is not a constitutional requirement that, in order for a confession obtained during a custodial interrogation to be deemed voluntary, it must have been contemporaneously recorded.23 Although it is true that the trial justice, in the course of denying the motion to suppress, did not mention the absence of an audio or video recording or contemporaneous note-taking, we are unable to conclude that this lacuna in his articulated rationale undermines his determination that the confession was voluntary. It is our opinion that the trial justice properly considered “the totality of the circumstances surrounding the challenged statement.” See Humphrey, 715 A.2d at 1274. The fact that he did not comment on the absence of a particular not-legally-required aspect of the interview does not render his review of the historical facts (or his conclusion of law based thereon) less than adequate. We have applied those same historical facts in a de novo manner, and we have reached the same conclusion as did the trial justice—viz., that Leroy Robinson’s incriminating 22', 'We recognize that it is not defendant’s contention that the confession should be suppressed solely because it was not contemporaneously recorded. The defendant acknowledges that the police in this jurisdiction are not legally required to record custodial interrogations as a precondition for statements made by suspects during the interrogation to be admissible in court. Instead, defendant contends that, in ruling upon the suppression motion, the trial justice “did not place nearly enough weight on” the lack of recording devices or note-taking by the detective during his interview with defendant. 23', 'It is important to note that neither the United States Supreme Court nor this Court has ever held that due process requires that a custodial interrogation must be contemporaneously recorded. See United States v. Montgomery, 390 F.3d 1013, 1017 (7th Cir. 2004) (“[W]e see no hint that the Supreme Court is ready to take such a major step. We therefore decline [the defendant’s] invitation to enlarge Miranda so as to require the electronic recording of all interrogations.”).', 'The issue of whether or not interrogations should be recorded has been the subject of continuing provocative scholarly commentary. See, e.g., Lisa C. Oliver, Mandatory Recording of Custodial Interrogations Nationwide: Recommending a New Model Code, 39 Suffolk U. L. Rev. 263 (2005).', '- 19 - statements were the product of his “free and rational choice” (Humphrey, 715 A.2d at 1274) and therefore were voluntary. See Taoussi, 973 A.2d at 1147.', 'It is our definite opinion that Detective Miele’s conduct during his interview of defendant respected defendant’s Miranda rights. When the circumstances of that interview are viewed as a whole, it is clear to us that defendant’s confession was voluntary. The detective apprised defendant of his rights; he used no coercive tactics; and, when defendant asked whether he needed a lawyer and then refused to execute a written statement, the detective promptly ended the interview. We therefore conclude that there is clear and convincing evidence in the record to support a determination that defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his Miranda rights and confessed to having sexually molested Steven.', 'B', 'Tracey’s Trial Testimony', 'The defendant contends that the trial justice erred in permitting Steven’s mother, Tracey, to testify (over objection) that, later in the same day on which she had found him and her twelve- year-old stepson (Fred Jr.) unclothed in bed together, Steven stated to her: “I only did it because Leroy did it to me.” The defendant alleges that this testimony by Tracey was inadmissible hearsay evidence because it was offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted; he also contends that the testimony does not fall within any exception to the hearsay rule. In contrast, the prosecution contends that Tracey’s statement was not hearsay because it was not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, but rather was offered to show “the jury how the entire chain of events * * * was set in motion.” The prosecution further contends that, if this Court should find Tracey’s statement to be violative of the hearsay evidence rule, it should deem it to be harmless error and not prejudicial to defendant as being “merely cumulative.”', '- 20 -', 'Even if the quoted statement by Tracey was violative (in whole or in part) of the rule against hearsay evidence24 and the trial justice erred in admitting said statement, we would consider the trial justice’s error in allowing this testimony to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See Perez, 882 A.2d at 590.', 'This Court has stated that “[i]t is well established that the admission of hearsay evidence is not prejudicial when the evidence is merely cumulative and when defendant’s guilt is sufficiently established by proper evidence.” State v. Lynch, 854 A.2d 1022, 1032 (R.I. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Micheli, 656 A.2d 980, 982 (R.I. 1995). We have defined “cumulative evidence” as being that which tends “to prove the same point to which other evidence has been offered.” Lynch, 854 A.2d at 1032 (internal quotation marks omitted). When we seek to determine whether or not a particular piece of evidence is cumulative, “the test is a retrospective one, administered at the close of all the evidence to determine whether the admission of certain evidence was harmless in light of all the evidence admitted on that point.” Id.', 'After careful review of the record, we conclude that Tracey’s testimony was merely cumulative. Tracey’s testimony did not reveal anything other than what Steven himself had already testified to at trial—at which time he was subjected to cross-examination by defendant’s counsel. See Lynch, 854 A.2d at 1032. Accordingly, we conclude that the admission of Tracey’s statement, even if it was inadmissible hearsay, constituted harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt. 24', 'See Rule 801(c) and Rule 802 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence.', '- 21 -', 'C', 'The Testimony of Detective Miele', 'The defendant also contends that the trial justice erred in allowing the following portion of Detective Miele’s trial testimony:', '“[Prosecutor]: What do you recall with respect to the time frame', 'that [Steven] had talked to you about concerning the acts?', '“[Defense Counsel]: I object.', '“The Court: Overruled.', '“[Detective Miele]: He stated they had ended when he was', 'approximately thirteen years old.” The defendant contends that the just-quoted testimony constituted inadmissible hearsay and also violated Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence.', 'We agree with defendant that the testimony constituted inadmissible hearsay.', 'The statement was offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (viz., that the sexual acts between defendant and Steven continued until Steven was approximately thirteen years old), and no exception to the hearsay evidence rule applies. However, just as we have held with respect to Tracey’s testimony, Detective Miele’s testimony was merely cumulative of Steven’s own testimony at trial. Steven expressly testified at trial that, when he was interviewed on August 11, 2003 by Detective Miele, he informed the detective that he and defendant had engaged in sexual acts until he was “thirteen o[r] fourteen.”25 It is clear, therefore, that the above-quoted testimony by Detective Miele did not reveal any information beyond what Steven had already testified to at 25', 'The defendant has not raised as an issue on appeal the admission of Steven’s own testimony at trial to the effect that his sexual encounters with defendant lasted until he was “thirteen o[r] fourteen.”', '- 22 - trial, at which time he was subjected to cross-examination. See Lynch, 854 A.2d at 1032. After taking into consideration the cumulative nature of the detective’s statement, as well as the brevity and lack of specificity of the contested testimony, we conclude that the admission of the quoted hearsay testimony by Detective Miele was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.', 'The defendant further contends that, in addition to being violative of the hearsay evidence rule, the testimony of Detective Miele constituted impermissible Rule 404(b) evidence.26 See State v. Merida, 960 A.2d 228, 236-37 (R.I. 2008). The defendant first points to the principle that evidence of uncharged sexual offenses is inadmissible if it is offered to establish that defendant had a propensity towards engaging in such conduct, and he contends that the detective’s statement does not fall within any of the recognized exceptions to Rule 404(b)’s general exclusionary language. The defendant further contends that, even if the testimony should be deemed admissible, it was improper for the trial justice not to give a limiting instruction to the jury.', 'This Court has repeatedly stated that “[e]vidence of a defendant’s prior sexual misconduct may not be admitted to prove that the defendant has a propensity towards sexual offenses and is, therefore, probably guilty of the crime charged.” Merida, 960 A.2d at 237; see also State v. Quattrocchi, 681 A.2d 879, 886 (R.I. 1996).', 'However, this Court has also 26', 'Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence reads as follows:', '“Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to', 'prove the character of a person in order to show that the person', 'acted in conformity therewith.

In our judgment, Detective Miele’s testimony can properly be characterized as evidence of defendant’s lewd disposition or intent vis-à-vis Steven.', 'We therefore conclude that the admission of the challenged portion of the detective’s testimony did not violate Rule 404(b).', 'The defendant’s final contention with respect to Detective Miele’s testimony is that the trial justice failed to give a proper limiting instruction to the jury.

Hopkins, 698 A.2d 183, 185 (R.I. 1997). However, this Court has further stated that “it is not required that the instruction be given immediately after the pertinent testimony.” Merida, 960 A.2d at 240; see also State v. Cardoza, 649 A.2d 745, 748 (R.I. 1994) (stating that “there is no requirement that this instruction be given immediately after the testimony has been given”).', 'The record reflects that the trial justice gave two limiting instructions with respect to the jury’s consideration of uncharged sexual acts.', 'The first limiting instruction was given immediately after Steven’s testimony regarding his first sexual encounter with defendant when Steven was nine years old. The second limiting instruction was given in the trial justice’s final instructions to the jury; that instruction also addressed only how the jury should deal with the', '- 24 - testimony concerning the just-referenced encounters when Steven was nine years old.27 We are therefore in agreement with defendant that the trial justice erred in failing to give the jury a limiting instruction with respect to the testimony of both Steven and Detective Miele regarding sexual acts allegedly committed subsequent to the dates set forth in the indictment. However, after a careful review of the record, we conclude that the admission of the testimony without a limiting instruction was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because of the presence of ample evidence on the record to support a conviction.28', 'III', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

56,"Keystone Properties and : Development, LLC v. : Steven A. Campo. : Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty, and Robinson, JJ. OPINION Justice Goldberg, for the Court. This case came before the Supreme Court on December 8, 2009, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. The defendant- seller, Steven A. Campo (defendant), appeals from a Superior Court judgment in favor of the plaintiff-buyer, Keystone Properties and Development, LLC (Keystone) granting specific performance of a contract for the sale of real property. Because we are satisfied that cause has not been shown, we shall decide the appeal at this time. We affirm the judgment. Facts and Travel In 2002, Keystone and defendant entered into a written purchase and sales agreement (agreement) in which defendant agreed to sell property located on Douglas Avenue in Providence, Rhode Island for $9,000. The agreement followed the standard Rhode Island realtor’s format and contained language that is dispositive of the issues in -1- this case; including a date for closing on July 15, 2002. Paragraph 9 “title” stated in pertinent part: “Seller covenants and warrants that it is the fee title owner of the Property and has the authority and capacity to enter into this Agreement and consummate the transaction contemplated herein. The Property is to be conveyed by a good and sufficient warranty deed of the Seller, conveying a good, clear, insurable, and marketable title to the Property, free from all encumbrances, except as may be acceptable to Buyer, and Buyer’s Lender[.] * * * If Seller is unable to remove such defects, Buyer shall have the option to: (a) accept such title as Seller is able to convey without abatement or reduction of the Purchase Price, or (b) cancel this Agreement and receive a return of all Deposits.” (Emphasis added.) Notably, although the date for performance was set forth in the agreement and had been postponed several times by agreement of the parties, the contract did not contain a clause declaring that “time was of the essence.” Subsequently, on November 1, 2002, the parties met to close the sale. After the settlement papers and deed were signed, defendant informed Keystone and its representatives that he was indebted to his father and the property served as security for the loan from his father. The record discloses that Keystone’s title attorney previously had completed a title search and discovered an outstanding mortgage to a bank and various liens related to the city, all of which were discharged before the closing but none of which related to a loan from defendant’s father. After defendant alerted the buyer to this unrecorded and undischarged potential encumbrance, the title attorney immediately stopped the closing, contacted the title insurance company, and informed the parties they could not proceed until any lien on the property was released. Although he wrote the word “void” across the closing documents, -2- neither the title attorney nor Keystone declared that the agreement itself was void or otherwise repudiated. Over the next year, efforts to reach defendant proved difficult. In January 2003, the title attorney returned the closing money to Keystone, but defendant’s realtor kept the deposit. When the realtor attempted to return the deposit, Keystone refused to accept it. 1 Keystone retained a new attorney, who wrote to defendant explaining that Keystone was still interested in closing, in accordance with the agreement. In November 2003, approximately one year after the failed closing, Keystone filed a complaint in the Superior Court requesting specific performance and costs. Before trial, Keystone offered to purchase the property “as is” but only if defendant agreed to be responsible for any lien that might exist. After a jury-waived trial in the Superior Court, the trial justice granted judgment for Keystone for partial specific performance on February 20, 2008. 2 In his decision, the trial justice relied upon our decision in Lajayi v. Fafiyebi, 860 A.2d 680 (R.I. 2004), in which we declared that, “[a] grant of specific performance is appropriate when ‘a party to a real estate agreement unjustifiably refuses or fails to perform under the agreement.’” Id. at 686 (quoting Yates v. Hill, 761 A.2d 677, 679 (R.I. 2000)). The trial justice also found that to qualify for specific performance concerning real estate under a written contract, the party must establish that “he or she was at all times ready and willing to perform the contract[.]” Sturbridge Home Builders, Inc. v. Downing Seaport, Inc., 890 A.2d 58, 64 (R.I. 2005) (quoting Fracassa v. Doris, 814 A.2d 1 In April 2004, the realtor issued a check to Keystone in an effort to return the deposit; Keystone, however, did not cash the check. 2 Specifically, the trial justice ordered that a closing take place, at which defendant was to tender a quit claim deed to Keystone and Keystone is to tender the sale price of $9,000. -3- 357, 362 (R.I. 2003) (Fracassa I)). Finally, the trial justice, in light of this Court’s decision in Lajayi, found that Keystone had established a binding, enforceable contract; that plaintiff was ready to purchase the property; that the contract had not been rescinded; and that defendant had breached the agreement. Specifically, the trial justice found that paragraph 9 of the agreement required defendant to deliver “a good, clear, insurable, and marketable title to the Property, free from all encumbrances, except as may be acceptable to Buyer” and that, at the closing, defendant failed to do so. In addition to breaching that express obligation, the trial justice also found that defendant breached the implied covenant of good faith by ceasing to perform, ignoring Keystone’s efforts to contact him, and expecting others to clear the title for him. With regard to the money purportedly owed to his father, the trial justice briefly addressed the relationship between defendant and his father and the efforts (or lack thereof ) to discharge the unrecorded lien: “Mr. Campo’s relationship with his father is somewhat mysterious. He testified that he did not know his father’s current address, and they had not spoken for years. While the family is estranged, the Court is not convinced that Mr. Campo met his contractual obligation or the express commitment he made at the failed closing, to attempt to clear the title promptly. Mr. Campo acknowledged that the attorney who wrote the father’s loan documents may have more information on the mortgage, or whether it was a mortgage, but he never contacted the attorney. He expected other people to clear this lien for him, and to call the attorney. As Mr. Campo admitted that he was still indebted to his father, contacting his father could have opened the door to collection of the debt. Accordingly, Mr. Campo appeared less than candid.” On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice committed a reversible error by finding that the buyer remained ready and willing to perform the contract. The defendant -4- asserts, in the alternative, that Keystone abandoned the contract by returning the deposit money. Finally, defendant contends that the trial justice also committed error when he found that the agreement was not rescinded; he draws our attention to the deposition testimony of the title attorney, in which the attorney testified that after the failed closing he considered the proposed sale to be dead. On the other hand, Keystone argues that the trial justice correctly found that the buyer was ready, willing, and able to perform the contract. Specifically addressing the deposition testimony, Keystone stresses that the testimony did not compel a finding that the agreement was rescinded. Keystone argues, and the trial justice concluded, that this language referred to the closing only, and not the agreement itself. Standard of Review We begin by noting the difficult burden that any appellant has when challenging the grant of specific performance because the remedy rests within the sound discretion of the trial justice. Eastern Motor Inns, Inc. v. Ricci, 565 A.2d 1265, 1269 (R.I. 1989). When reviewing a trial justice’s decision to grant specific performance, we do so under an abuse of discretion standard, and we will not disturb that decision on appeal absent an abuse of discretion or error of law. DePetrillo v. Lepore, 871 A.2d 907, 909 (R.I. 2005); Eastern Motor Inns, Inc., 565 A.2d at 1269. In Fisher v. Applebaum, 947 A.2d 248 (R.I. 2008), we recently had occasion to review the findings of a trial justice in a jury-waived proceeding seeking specific performance, and we said: “[w]e have concluded that, before specific performance of a real estate contract may be granted, the essential contractual provisions ‘must be clear, definite, certain, and complete[.]’” Id. at 251-52 (quoting DePetrillo, 871 A.2d at 909). -5- If the purchaser can demonstrate that he or she was “at all times ready and willing to perform the contract, specific performance is available ‘in the absence of a legitimate and articulable equitable defense.’” Fracassa v. Doris, 876 A.2d 506, 509 (R.I. 2005) (Fracassa II) (quoting Fracassa I, 814 A.2d at 362). Accordingly, our decision today is controlled by this standard of review, and we therefore affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. Upon careful review of the record and after oral argument in this case, we cannot conclude that the trial justice was clearly wrong or that he abused his discretion in granting specific performance in this case. It is not within our judicial province to substitute our own judgment for that of the trial justice in this admittedly close case. Analysis Clearly, this decision turned on the credibility of the parties – buyer (Keystone) and seller (defendant) – and the testimony of the realtor and the title attorney, including the deposition and trial testimony of the title attorney. At trial, the title attorney for Keystone was asked whether he declared that the “deal was dead” after the closing was terminated; he testified as follows: “I may have talked with him a few times about this and I may have, I believe I may have sent him a few letters as well because I did want to allow at least 60 days in which for this thing to work out after which time, after 60 days, I think it would be fair to conclude that the parties were either unable or unwilling to resolve the issue and that the closing at that point would be dead.” (Emphasis added.) We reject defendant’s argument that this language referred to the deal as a whole, rather than the closing. It is also equally clear to us that the trial justice made credibility determinations with respect to Keystone and defendant and found that Keystone did not -6- abandon the agreement and was entitled to specific performance of the contract. We are satisfied that the trial justice made sustainable findings and evaluated the weight of the evidence before him; we decline to disturb these findings on appeal. See Burke-Tarr Co. v. Ferland Corp., 724 A.2d 1014, 1018 (R.I. 1999) (“The findings of fact by a trial justice sitting without a jury are entitled to great weight and shall not be disturbed on appeal unless the record shows that the findings are clearly wrong or unless the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence * * *.”). Although in the context of this case, the length of time that has passed since the agreement was entered into by the parties gives us pause, we decline to hold that the passage of time, standing alone, is sufficient to warrant a conclusion that the agreement was abandoned. The duty to make such a finding rests with the trial justice, and we sustain the finding unless it is clearly erroneous. He declared that, “[t]he record is devoid of any intent on the part of Keystone to abandon the [a]greement. There was never a sign of reluctance, Keystone never backed off.” See Fisher, 947 A.2d at 253 (finding that time was not of the essence in that contract and that any suggestion to the contrary was incorrect). It is not our function to second guess this determination. Finally, the defendant asserts that Keystone was never ready, willing, and able to purchase the property. The record, however, is devoid of any facts that would have led the trial justice to agree with this assertion. The trial justice noted, “[t]here is, of course, no question that Keystone was ready, willing[,] and able to purchase through the date of the failed closing. There is no question that Keystone remains just as committed now.” Again, we decline to disturb this sound finding without record evidence to the contrary. See Fracassa II, 876 A.2d at 509 (stating that “[w]hen a purchaser of real estate under a -7- written contract can demonstrate that he or she was at all times ready and willing to perform the contract, specific performance is available ‘in the absence of a legitimate and articulable equitable defense’”) (quoting Fracassa I, 814 A.2d at 362). Conclusion Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. The record may be remanded to the Superior Court. -8- Supreme Court No. 2008-189-Appeal.

Campo (defendant), appeals from a Superior Court judgment in favor of the plaintiff-buyer, Keystone Properties and Development, LLC (Keystone) granting specific performance of a contract for the sale of real property. Because we are satisfied that cause has not been shown, we shall decide the appeal at this time. We affirm the judgment.', 'Facts and Travel', 'In 2002, Keystone and defendant entered into a written purchase and sales agreement (agreement) in which defendant agreed to sell property located on Douglas Avenue in Providence, Rhode Island for $9,000. The agreement followed the standard Rhode Island realtor’s format and contained language that is dispositive of the issues in', '-1- this case; including a date for closing on July 15, 2002. Paragraph 9 “title” stated in pertinent part:', '“Seller covenants and warrants that it is the fee title', 'owner of the Property and has the authority and capacity to', 'enter into this Agreement and consummate the transaction', 'contemplated herein. The Property is to be conveyed by a', 'good and sufficient warranty deed of the Seller, conveying', 'a good, clear, insurable, and marketable title to the', 'Property, free from all encumbrances, except as may be', 'acceptable to Buyer, and Buyer’s Lender[.] * * * If Seller is', 'unable to remove such defects, Buyer shall have the option', 'to: (a) accept such title as Seller is able to convey without', 'abatement or reduction of the Purchase Price, or (b) cancel', 'this Agreement and receive a return of all Deposits.”', '(Emphasis added.)', 'Notably, although the date for performance was set forth in the agreement and had been postponed several times by agreement of the parties, the contract did not contain a clause declaring that “time was of the essence.” Subsequently, on November 1, 2002, the parties met to close the sale. After the settlement papers and deed were signed, defendant informed Keystone and its representatives that he was indebted to his father and the property served as security for the loan from his father. The record discloses that Keystone’s title attorney previously had completed a title search and discovered an outstanding mortgage to a bank and various liens related to the city, all of which were discharged before the closing but none of which related to a loan from defendant’s father. After defendant alerted the buyer to this unrecorded and undischarged potential encumbrance, the title attorney immediately stopped the closing, contacted the title insurance company, and informed the parties they could not proceed until any lien on the property was released. Although he wrote the word “void” across the closing documents,', '-2- neither the title attorney nor Keystone declared that the agreement itself was void or otherwise repudiated.', 'Over the next year, efforts to reach defendant proved difficult. In January 2003, the title attorney returned the closing money to Keystone, but defendant’s realtor kept the deposit. When the realtor attempted to return the deposit, Keystone refused to accept it. 1 Keystone retained a new attorney, who wrote to defendant explaining that Keystone was still interested in closing, in accordance with the agreement.', 'In November 2003, approximately one year after the failed closing, Keystone filed a complaint in the Superior Court requesting specific performance and costs. Before trial, Keystone offered to purchase the property “as is” but only if defendant agreed to be responsible for any lien that might exist. After a jury-waived trial in the Superior Court, the trial justice granted judgment for Keystone for partial specific performance on February 20, 2008. 2', 'In his decision, the trial justice relied upon our decision in Lajayi v. Fafiyebi, 860 A.2d 680 (R.I. 2004), in which we declared that, “[a] grant of specific performance is appropriate when ‘a party to a real estate agreement unjustifiably refuses or fails to perform under the agreement.’” Id. at 686 (quoting Yates v. Hill, 761 A.2d 677, 679 (R.I. 2000)). The trial justice also found that to qualify for specific performance concerning real estate under a written contract, the party must establish that “he or she was at all times ready and willing to perform the contract[.]” Sturbridge Home Builders, Inc. v. Downing Seaport, Inc., 890 A.2d 58, 64 (R.I. 2005) (quoting Fracassa v. Doris, 814 A.2d 1', 'In April 2004, the realtor issued a check to Keystone in an effort to return the deposit; Keystone, however, did not cash the check. 2', 'Specifically, the trial justice ordered that a closing take place, at which defendant was to tender a quit claim deed to Keystone and Keystone is to tender the sale price of $9,000.', '-3- 357, 362 (R.I. 2003) (Fracassa I)). Finally, the trial justice, in light of this Court’s decision in Lajayi, found that Keystone had established a binding, enforceable contract; that plaintiff was ready to purchase the property; that the contract had not been rescinded; and that defendant had breached the agreement. Specifically, the trial justice found that paragraph 9 of the agreement required defendant to deliver “a good, clear, insurable, and marketable title to the Property, free from all encumbrances, except as may be acceptable to Buyer” and that, at the closing, defendant failed to do so. In addition to breaching that express obligation, the trial justice also found that defendant breached the implied covenant of good faith by ceasing to perform, ignoring Keystone’s efforts to contact him, and expecting others to clear the title for him.', 'With regard to the money purportedly owed to his father, the trial justice briefly addressed the relationship between defendant and his father and the efforts (or lack thereof ) to discharge the unrecorded lien:', '“Mr. Campo’s relationship with his father is somewhat', 'mysterious. He testified that he did not know his father’s', 'current address, and they had not spoken for years. While', 'the family is estranged, the Court is not convinced that Mr.', 'Campo met his contractual obligation or the express', 'commitment he made at the failed closing, to attempt to', 'clear the title promptly. Mr. Campo acknowledged that the', 'attorney who wrote the father’s loan documents may have', 'more information on the mortgage, or whether it was a', 'mortgage, but he never contacted the attorney. He expected', 'other people to clear this lien for him, and to call the', 'attorney. As Mr. Campo admitted that he was still indebted', 'to his father, contacting his father could have opened the', 'door to collection of the debt. Accordingly, Mr. Campo', 'appeared less than candid.”', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice committed a reversible error by finding that the buyer remained ready and willing to perform the contract. The defendant', '-4- asserts, in the alternative, that Keystone abandoned the contract by returning the deposit money. Finally, defendant contends that the trial justice also committed error when he found that the agreement was not rescinded; he draws our attention to the deposition testimony of the title attorney, in which the attorney testified that after the failed closing he considered the proposed sale to be dead. On the other hand, Keystone argues that the trial justice correctly found that the buyer was ready, willing, and able to perform the contract. Specifically addressing the deposition testimony, Keystone stresses that the testimony did not compel a finding that the agreement was rescinded. Keystone argues, and the trial justice concluded, that this language referred to the closing only, and not the agreement itself.', 'Standard of Review', 'We begin by noting the difficult burden that any appellant has when challenging the grant of specific performance because the remedy rests within the sound discretion of the trial justice. Eastern Motor Inns, Inc. v. Ricci, 565 A.2d 1265, 1269 (R.I. 1989). When reviewing a trial justice’s decision to grant specific performance, we do so under an abuse of discretion standard, and we will not disturb that decision on appeal absent an abuse of discretion or error of law. DePetrillo v. Lepore, 871 A.2d 907, 909 (R.I. 2005); Eastern Motor Inns, Inc., 565 A.2d at 1269.', 'In Fisher v. Applebaum, 947 A.2d 248 (R.I. 2008), we recently had occasion to review the findings of a trial justice in a jury-waived proceeding seeking specific performance, and we said: “[w]e have concluded that, before specific performance of a real estate contract may be granted, the essential contractual provisions ‘must be clear, definite, certain, and complete[.]’” Id. at 251-52 (quoting DePetrillo, 871 A.2d at 909).', '-5- If the purchaser can demonstrate that he or she was “at all times ready and willing to perform the contract, specific performance is available ‘in the absence of a legitimate and articulable equitable defense.’” Fracassa v. Doris, 876 A.2d 506, 509 (R.I. 2005) (Fracassa II) (quoting Fracassa I, 814 A.2d at 362).', 'Accordingly, our decision today is controlled by this standard of review, and we therefore affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. Upon careful review of the record and after oral argument in this case, we cannot conclude that the trial justice was clearly wrong or that he abused his discretion in granting specific performance in this case. It is not within our judicial province to substitute our own judgment for that of the trial justice in this admittedly close case.', 'Analysis', 'Clearly, this decision turned on the credibility of the parties – buyer (Keystone) and seller (defendant) – and the testimony of the realtor and the title attorney, including the deposition and trial testimony of the title attorney. At trial, the title attorney for Keystone was asked whether he declared that the “deal was dead” after the closing was terminated; he testified as follows:', '“I may have talked with him a few times about this and I', 'may have, I believe I may have sent him a few letters as', 'well because I did want to allow at least 60 days in which', 'for this thing to work out after which time, after 60 days, I', 'think it would be fair to conclude that the parties were', 'either unable or unwilling to resolve the issue and that the', 'closing at that point would be dead.” (Emphasis added.)', 'We reject defendant’s argument that this language referred to the deal as a whole, rather than the closing. It is also equally clear to us that the trial justice made credibility determinations with respect to Keystone and defendant and found that Keystone did not', '-6- abandon the agreement and was entitled to specific performance of the contract. We are satisfied that the trial justice made sustainable findings and evaluated the weight of the evidence before him; we decline to disturb these findings on appeal. See Burke-Tarr Co. v. Ferland Corp., 724 A.2d 1014, 1018 (R.I. 1999) (“The findings of fact by a trial justice sitting without a jury are entitled to great weight and shall not be disturbed on appeal unless the record shows that the findings are clearly wrong or unless the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence * * *.”).', 'Although in the context of this case, the length of time that has passed since the agreement was entered into by the parties gives us pause, we decline to hold that the passage of time, standing alone, is sufficient to warrant a conclusion that the agreement was abandoned. The duty to make such a finding rests with the trial justice, and we sustain the finding unless it is clearly erroneous. He declared that, “[t]he record is devoid of any intent on the part of Keystone to abandon the [a]greement. There was never a sign of reluctance, Keystone never backed off.” See Fisher, 947 A.2d at 253 (finding that time was not of the essence in that contract and that any suggestion to the contrary was incorrect). It is not our function to second guess this determination.', 'Finally, the defendant asserts that Keystone was never ready, willing, and able to purchase the property. The record, however, is devoid of any facts that would have led the trial justice to agree with this assertion. The trial justice noted, “[t]here is, of course, no question that Keystone was ready, willing[,] and able to purchase through the date of the failed closing. There is no question that Keystone remains just as committed now.” Again, we decline to disturb this sound finding without record evidence to the contrary. See Fracassa II, 876 A.2d at 509 (stating that “[w]hen a purchaser of real estate under a', '-7- written contract can demonstrate that he or she was at all times ready and willing to perform the contract, specific performance is available ‘in the absence of a legitimate and articulable equitable defense’”) (quoting Fracassa I, 814 A.2d at 362).', 'Conclusion', 'Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

57,State : v. : Kevin Adefusika. :,criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson for the Court. The issues before us in this appeal arise from an indictment charging an alleged sexual assault and the trial thereof.', 'The defendant, Kevin Adefusika, appeals from a judgment of conviction entered after a jury trial in the Washington County Superior Court. He alleges that the trial justice committed reversible error on multiple occasions—viz., (1) in refusing to give a certain jury instruction requested by the defendant; (2) in permitting a court reporter to read back a particular portion of the complaining witness’s trial testimony; (3) in allowing a rebuttal witness to comment on the demeanor of two defense witnesses; and (4) in denying the defendant’s motion for a new trial. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On June 9, 2006, a Washington County grand jury indicted Mr. Adefusika on one count of first-degree sexual assault (sexual penetration), in violation of G.L. 1956 §§ 11-37-2 and 11-', '-1- 37-3, and one count of second-degree sexual assault (hand to breast contact), in violation of §§ 11-37-4 and 11-37-5. The charged offenses allegedly took place in the early evening of March 17, 2006. A jury trial was held on November 29, November 30, December 1, and December 4, 2006. We summarize below the most pertinent testimony from that trial.', 'A', 'The Testimony at Trial', 'The prosecution presented three witnesses at trial: the complaining witness, an eighteen- year-old young woman whom we shall call Stephanie;1 Stephanie’s mother whom we shall call Jennifer; and Westerly Police Officer Christopher Peloso.', 'Stephanie testified that, on March 17, 2006, she received a telephone call at her Wakefield home from her friend Lisa. Lisa, a sixteen-year-old high school student, was calling to ask whether Stephanie wanted to “hang out”—something that the two young women did on an almost daily basis. Lisa offered to stop by Stephanie’s home with a friend. Stephanie, who had known Lisa for several months, accepted her invitation and her offer of a ride. At approximately 4 p.m., Lisa arrived at Stephanie’s home accompanied by Mike Adefusika, who was Lisa’s friend and also the brother of defendant, Kevin Adefusika;2 Stephanie had not met Mike before. Stephanie assumed that they would be driving to Lisa’s home in Charlestown. Instead, Mike told Stephanie that they would be driving to his home in Westerly.', 'Once having arrived at the Adefusika home in Westerly, Stephanie, Lisa, and Mike all went to Mike’s bedroom; they were joined there by Mike’s brother, Kevin. Stephanie testified that she introduced herself to Kevin and that the group of four proceeded to talk and play 1', 'We shall refer to most of the several civilians involved in this case pseudonymously in order to protect their privacy. 2', 'For the sake of clarity, we shall refer to the Adefusika brothers by their first names.', '-2- videogames in Mike’s bedroom. Stephanie further testified that, while they were in Mike’s bedroom, everyone except her drank and smoked.', 'After about an hour, Lisa mentioned to the Adefusika brothers that Stephanie liked to dance and indeed had been asked to become a professional dancer. Stephanie testified that defendant then asked her to dance for him; she said that he repeated this request “[a] couple of times” over the course of about twenty minutes.', 'Stephanie testified that she became uncomfortable and that she refused defendant’s repeated requests for her to dance. Stephanie asked Lisa if she wanted to go outside to smoke a cigarette, and Lisa agreed.', 'Once outside, Stephanie told Lisa that she was uncomfortable and was ready to leave. Stephanie testified that Lisa accused her of being a racist3 and also said to Stephanie, “[L]et me do my thing with Mike first.” After Stephanie had finished her cigarette, the two young women went back inside the house. Lisa returned to Mike’s bedroom, shutting the door behind her. Stephanie testified that at that point she heard loud music emanating from Mike’s room.', 'Stephanie walked into the living room, where defendant was sitting on a couch. Stephanie testified that, because she felt uncomfortable in the presence of defendant, she sat on the arm of the couch at the opposite end from where he sat. After the two of them engaged in some small talk, Stephanie moved from the arm to the cushion of the couch (but still at the opposite end from where defendant was sitting). At that point, defendant began professing his admiration for Stephanie. Stephanie testified that defendant told her that she was “the perfect girl” and that he wanted to marry her, all the while continuing to move toward her.', 'Stephanie testified that, once defendant had moved “pretty close” to her, he “forced himself on top of” her, pushing her back on the couch and holding her hands above her head with 3', 'The Adefusikas are black, while Stephanie is Caucasian.', '-3- both of his hands. Stephanie further testified that defendant then started kissing her neck and told her that he wanted to give her a “hickey” because he wanted “everybody to know that [she was] his.” After Stephanie told defendant that she did not want a “hickey,” he stopped trying to give her one.', 'Stephanie testified that defendant then removed one of his hands from hers, but he continued to hold both of her hands with his other hand.', 'Stephanie further testified that defendant put his free hand inside her shirt and touched her breasts over her bra for “a little while.” According to Stephanie, defendant then moved his hand down into the front of her pants; she said that he proceeded to slide his hand under her underwear and to insert his finger inside her vagina for several seconds.', 'Stephanie testified that she had never asked defendant to touch her breasts or vagina and that she did not want him to do so. She further testified that, while defendant was performing the above-described acts, she repeatedly told defendant “no” and asked him to stop. She testified that she also tried “lifting [her] body and moving [her] arms;” she added that she was unable to do so because she was much smaller than he was.', 'Stephanie further testified that, after defendant removed his finger from her vagina, he started moving his hand “toward [her] butt.” She testified that, as defendant did so, he “let go of [her] hands a little bit;” she stated that she then slapped him in the face and climbed out from underneath him. It was Stephanie’s testimony that, at that point, defendant “flipped out” and began to yell and scream and to call her names.', 'Stephanie testified that she then ran toward a nearby hallway, grabbed a cordless phone that she saw sitting on a table, and went into a small closet-like room, positioning her body', '-4- against the door to keep it closed. Stephanie used the phone to call her mother, Jennifer, to ask her to come and pick her up.', 'After speaking with her mother, Stephanie left the room from which she had made the phone call and started to walk outside. By then, Lisa and Mike had moved from Mike’s bedroom to the living room, and defendant was in the kitchen.', 'According to Stephanie (testifying upon refreshed recollection), as she walked past defendant on her way outside, he told her that “he was going to hunt [her] down and rape [her].” Stephanie continued out of the house and walked to the end of the street on which the Adefusika home was located; she waited there for her mother.', 'After Stephanie had waited outside for fifteen to twenty minutes, Lisa and Mike drove up in a car and told her to get in. It was Stephanie’s testimony that she agreed to get in the car because she “just wanted to get out of there.” Stephanie testified that Mike apologized for defendant’s behavior and that he let her use his cell phone to call her mother, who was having a difficult time finding the Adefusika residence. In that phone call, Jennifer (Stephanie’s mother) agreed to meet Stephanie at a nearby restaurant in Westerly, and Lisa and Mike then drove Stephanie there.', 'When Stephanie and her companions arrived at the restaurant, Stephanie quickly exited the vehicle. Jennifer pulled into the parking lot moments later, and Stephanie departed with her. She testified that her mother then drove her to the home of her (Stephanie’s) grandmother in Charlestown. There, Stephanie told her mother what had happened, and Jennifer called the Westerly police.', 'Stephanie eventually called the police herself, and she then went to the Westerly police station to provide a statement.', '-5-', 'Stephanie’s mother, Jennifer, also testified for the prosecution. She stated that she had been home watching television on the evening of the alleged assault when Stephanie called her, crying.', 'Jennifer testified that she picked up Stephanie at the above-referenced Westerly restaurant and then later drove her to the Westerly police station.', 'Westerly Police Officer Christopher Peloso testified that he went to the Adefusika residence at approximately 2 a.m. on March 18 (i.e., the morning immediately after the alleged sexual assault) in order to retrieve Stephanie’s handbag, which she had accidentally left in the car that Mike Adefusika had driven. Officer Peloso testified that he spoke with defendant, who denied that there had been any women at his house on the previous night, although his brother (Mike) had admitted that women had been there.', 'Officer Peloso was also dispatched to Lisa’s home.', 'At approximately 4 a.m., he awakened Lisa and her mother, Victoria. He told the two women that he was investigating a sexual assault, and he questioned them for forty-five minutes.', 'The thrust of Kevin Adefusika’s defense at trial was (1) that the alleged sexual assault did not happen and (2) that Stephanie was emotionally troubled and unstable. In support of the position taken by the defense, three witnesses were presented by Kevin Adefusika’s attorney. (Mr. Adefusika did not testify at trial.)', 'The first of the defense witnesses was Stephanie’s friend, Lisa.', 'Even though her testimony corroborated much of Stephanie’s testimony as to how they ended up at the Adefusika home on March 17, 2006, Lisa also testified about her belief that Stephanie was uncomfortable with the Adefusikas because they were black. She further testified that Stephanie had told her', '-6- and the Adefusikas that a friend of her ex-boyfriend4 had raped her on the night before the March 17 visit to the Adefusika residence. In addition, Lisa testified that Stephanie was never out of her earshot on the night in question.', 'The second defense witness was Victoria (Lisa’s mother). She testified, in pertinent part, that Jennifer had called her on the night of the alleged sexual assault, asking if she knew where Lisa was and saying that Stephanie had called her and was “really scared” and was “freaking out.” Victoria testified that, when she thereafter reached Lisa by telephone, she also spoke with Stephanie, who told her that everything was “okay” and that Jennifer was “crazy” and should be ignored.', 'After Lisa and Victoria testified, the prosecution recalled Officer Peloso as a rebuttal witness to testify as to the manner in which Lisa and Victoria reacted when he interviewed them at their home in the early morning hours after the alleged sexual assault.5 Officer Peloso stated that he found Victoria’s demeanor toward him to be “[v]ery offensive.” He further testified:', '“[Victoria] was very uncooperative of me being there. She', 'continued to be very nasty toward me. She was continuing to tell', 'me that I was not wanted there, that I had no right to ask the', 'questions and things of that nature.” Additionally, Officer Peloso testified that, throughout his conversation with Lisa, he noticed that “there were many inconsistencies in [Lisa’s] statement.” 4', 'Several witnesses referred to this young man as Stephanie’s “ex-boyfriend.” However, Stephanie testified that, although she and her boyfriend had argued, they had not actually broken up prior to the alleged sexual assault. 5', 'Since the final witness for the defense was not available to testify until the day after Victoria testified, defense counsel interposed no objection concerning Officer Peloso’s testifying out of order as a rebuttal witness for the prosecution.', '-7-', 'Finally, the defense called Sue Ann Miner, a nurse at South County Hospital; she testified about a triage note that she had written when Stephanie had visited the hospital several days before the alleged assault. Ms. Miner read to the jury from her triage note as follows:', '“‘Patient is here for South Shore Mental Health eval. Patient', 'recently broke up with boyfriend, as per mom. Patient freaking', 'out, crying, swearing, kicking and punching walls, obsessed with', 'ex-boyfriend. Patient denies SI,’ which is suicidal ideation.', '‘Decreased [oral] intake.’ * * * ‘Alert, oriented x 3, crying slightly,', 'angry affect toward mom. No respiratory distress.’” Stephanie and Jennifer had also testified about that visit to the hospital. On cross-examination, Jennifer stated that she had taken Stephanie for a mental health evaluation because Stephanie was emotionally upset about “issues in our family and her boyfriend.” Stephanie admitted that her mother had taken her to South County Hospital for a mental health evaluation the week before the alleged assault, but she denied that the visit had been prompted by the status of her relationship with her boyfriend.', 'B', 'The Jury Instructions', 'After the trial justice had instructed the jury, defendant took exception to several aspects of the instructions, one of which he has opted to raise on appeal. The defendant’s counsel requested at sidebar that the trial justice re-instruct the jury employing particular language with respect to the meaning of the term “force or coercion” in the context of the first-degree sexual assault charge. Specifically, defendant requested that the trial justice instruct the jury as follows:', '“Force or coercion within the meaning of this provision requires', 'something more than the sexual contact itself: that is, something', 'more than an intentional touching of the victim’s intimate parts', 'done with the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification, or assault', 'and without consent. At a minimum, the alleged victim must', 'demonstrate her lack of consent before the act occurs and then', '-8-', 'must offer such resistance as is reasonable under all the', 'circumstances.” The trial justice denied defendant’s request, and the jury began its deliberations. The defendant repeated his request on the next day of jury deliberations, but the trial justice again denied the request.', 'C', 'The Read-Back', 'While the jury’s deliberations were underway, the trial justice received a note from the jury foreperson, which in relevant part reads as follows:', '“[I]f possible, we would like to read an excerpt of the transcript', 'from [Stephanie’s] testimony. Specifically, we want to review the', 'portion of [Stephanie’s] testimony describing exactly what', 'happened when she and Kevin were on the couch when the alleged', 'sexual assaults occurred.” Thereafter, the trial justice allowed the court reporter to read back from her notes what the trial justice called “the portion of the transcript of [Stephanie’s] testimony describing what happened when she and Kevin were on the couch.”', 'The read-back included portions of the direct examination and of the cross-examination of Stephanie. During the course of the read-back, defendant objected to the inclusion of Stephanie’s testimony about what transpired after “the activity on the couch had terminated.” The trial justice made no ruling on the record regarding that objection; it is clear from the record, however, that the objected-to portion of the transcript was in fact read back.', 'D', 'The Verdict and the Sentence', 'On December 4, 2006, at the conclusion of the four-day trial, the jury convicted Kevin Adefusika of both the first-degree sexual assault charge and the second-degree sexual assault', '-9- charge. On January 12, 2007, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial. On February 2, 2007, defendant was sentenced to forty years at the Adult Correctional Institutions, with twenty years to serve and the balance suspended with probation, in connection with the first-degree sexual assault conviction. He received a concurrent sentence of fifteen years to serve in connection with the second-degree sexual assault conviction. Thereafter, Mr. Adefusika filed a timely notice of appeal.', 'II', 'Standards of Review', 'A', 'The Standard of Review as to the Jury Instruction Issue', 'Our standard of review concerning jury instructions is well settled; we review such instructions in a de novo manner. State v. Palmer, 962 A.2d 758, 764 (R.I. 2009); see also State v. Graham, 941 A.2d 848, 855 (R.I. 2008); State v. Imbruglia, 913 A.2d 1022, 1031 (R.I. 2007); State v. John, 881 A.2d 920, 929 (R.I. 2005); State v. Hurteau, 810 A.2d 222, 224-25 (R.I. 2002). In reviewing challenged jury instructions, “it is our role to examine the instructions in their entirety to ascertain the manner in which a jury of ordinary intelligent lay people would have understood them, * * * and we review challenged portions of jury instructions in the context in which they were rendered.” John, 881 A.2d at 929 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Hurteau, 810 A.2d at 225; State v. Krushnowski, 773 A.2d 243, 246 (R.I. 2001); State v. Gordon, 508 A.2d 1339, 1349 (R.I. 1986). Further, “this Court will not examine a single sentence apart from the rest of the instructions, but rather the challenged portions must be examined in the context in which they were rendered.” State v. Kittell, 847 A.2d 845, 849 (R.I. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Palmer, 962 A.2d at 764; State v. Hanes, 783 A.2d 920, 925', '- 10 - (R.I. 2001). Moreover, even if we conclude that a jury instruction was erroneous, reversal is warranted “only if a jury could have been misled to the prejudice of the complaining party.” Graham, 941 A.2d at 855; see also Palmer, 962 A.2d at 764-65; Hodges v. Brannon, 707 A.2d 1225, 1228 (R.I. 1998); Anter v. Ambeault, 104 R.I. 496, 501, 245 A.2d 137, 139 (1968).', 'B', 'The Standard of Review as to the Read-Back Issue', 'The decision as to whether or not to read back to the jury a particular witness’s trial testimony in response to a jury request is confided to “the sound discretion of the trial justice.” State v. Dumas, 835 A.2d 438, 443 (R.I. 2003); see also State v. Ros, 973 A.2d 1148, 1176 (R.I. 2009); State v. Pierce, 689 A.2d 1030, 1035 (R.I. 1997); State v. Dame, 488 A.2d 418, 422 (R.I. 1985).

The defendant points out that, whereas the jury had requested a read-back of Stephanie’s testimony as to “exactly what happened when she and Kevin were on the couch,” the actual read-back of Stephanie’s direct testimony continued past the point in time when she was on the couch at the Adefusika home; the testimony that was read back included Stephanie’s account of her running from the couch, grabbing a phone, barricading herself in a closet-like room, and calling her mother. The read-back also included Stephanie’s direct testimony that defendant had threatened that “he was going to hunt [her] down and rape [her].”', 'The trial justice stated that, after receiving the jury’s request for a read-back, he had “asked the court reporter to locate that testimony;” and he also conferred with the attorneys 7', 'The defendant also contends that, pursuant to Rule 30 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure and our decision in State v.

While we note that the trial justice expressed his impatience with defense counsel in that regard, we need not reach the issue of whether the trial justice erred in refusing to give defendant’s proposed instructions because he was irked with the timing of defendant’s proffering of his suggested instructions—since we have concluded that the instructions actually given adequately advised the jurors of the relevant legal principle.

On that Monday morning, the trial justice noted on the record that, before the court reporter actually started to read back Stephanie’s testimony, he had attempted to contact defense counsel so that he “could go over what was to be read back.” However, the trial justice was unable to reach defense counsel, and he permitted the court reporter to read to the jury an excerpted portion of Stephanie’s testimony.', 'When a jury makes a request, the trial justice should, if the trial justice deems the request appropriate, conform his or her response to the request.

58,"In re Providence Water Supply Board’s : Application to Change Rate Schedules. Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty, and Robinson, JJ. OPINION Justice Goldberg, for the Court. This case is before the Supreme Court as a statutory petition for certiorari filed by the petitioner, the City of Providence (city), pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 39-5-1. The city is seeking review of a decision by the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission (PUC) 1 denying a rate increase to the Providence Water Supply Board (PWSB or board) for reimbursement of sums paid for the PWSB’s retirees’ health-care coverage and benefits. The city seeks review of the report and order that the PUC issued in Docket No. 3832. After careful review of the record in this case, we affirm the order of the PUC. Facts and Travel Although this case began on March 30, 2007, when the PWSB made a general rate filing with the PUC, the events giving rise to the rate filing date to 1997, when the city began paying for a portion of the PWSB’s retiree health-care costs. Inexplicably, these unreimbursed payments continued until 2005. 2 The 2007 rate filing, as requested, 1 The Attorney General represents the Division of Public Utilities and Carriers on behalf of the PUC. 2 The record discloses that in 2006 the PWSB began paying for retirees’ health-care expenditures by using existing rates. -1- amounted to an overall revenue increase of $9,688,321 or 19.07 percent, and would have resulted in a rate increase for a typical resident in the city of approximately $41.60 or 17 percent. The 2007 rate filing was not solely based on the retirees’ health-care costs; it was included in a general rate filing seeking an increase for several additional operational expenses. 3 The only issue before us, however, is the city’s petition to review that portion of the PUC’s decision denying the reimbursement for the retirees’ health-care costs. It is important to note, however, that in its final report the PUC declared that this was the PWSB’s fourth rate filing since 2000, but was the first time the city sought reimbursement for retiree health-care costs, notwithstanding that such payments commenced in 1997. 4 The PWSB is an entity that is independent of city control; however, it uses the city’s administrative services. According to the record, the PWSB typically prepares a payroll and sends it to the city’s finance department, and the city charges the PWSB budget for allocations made on the PWSB’s behalf. From 1997 through 2005, the city neglected to charge the PWSB for costs associated with the PWSB’s retiree health care. Once this error was discovered, the PWSB sought to reimburse the city for past expenses that it had failed to pay because of the city’s oversight. 3 Those costs included infrastructure replacement; increases in insurance costs; increases in chemical and sludge costs; increased costs associated with post-retirement health care benefits; the instant request to recover past retiree health care benefits paid by the City of Providence; increases in property taxes; an increase in operations revenue allowance; funding for strategic planning; increase in city service expense; wages and benefits; purchase power, and other known and measurable increases. 4 The board made a request for rate filing in 2000, 2002, 2005, and the current request in 2007. -2- Hearings on the PWSB’s rate filing were held on June 19, 21, and 28, 2007 and September 12-13, 2007. The PUC also accepted prefiled testimonies from witnesses and experts representing the PWSB and other interested parties. The most pertinent testimony about the retirees’ health-care costs came from Ms. Jeanne Bondarevskis (Bondarevskis), director of finance for the PWSB, and Mr. Thomas Catlin (Catlin), a consultant on revenue requirements for the Division of Public Utilities and Carriers. Bondarevskis testified that the requested increase was intended to reimburse the city for the costs of retirees’ health care, and she explained how these expenses were calculated. Specifically, Bondarevskis stated that the PWSB had not been reimbursing the city for the cost of its retirees’ health care for several years and that this mistake was not discovered until fiscal year 2006. According to Bondarevskis, “[f]or some time now Providence Water has not reimbursed the [c]ity for [h]ealth care costs for employees in a direct manner,” but Bondarevskis explained that when the payroll is complete, the city then wires the amount needed for payroll and fringe benefits. The PUC explained in its order, “In order to calculate the amount to be paid back, the City Controller’s office started with actual costs for fiscal years 2005 and 2004, discounted the costs back for each fiscal year 2003 through 1997, based on the annual working rate[ 5 ] increase. In Ms. Bondarevskis’ opinion, this was ‘a reasonable method of estimating the outstanding liability.’” 5 The working rate increase was described by Mr. Boyce Spinelli (Spinelli), the deputy general manager for the PWSB and former finance director for the city. In his testimony, Spinelli explained that the working rate is the amount set by an actuary to predict what the city will need to contribute annually to pay for all its employee’s health plans, irrespective of the employee’s status, whether retiree or active. This is so because the city is self-insured, and the working rate is a set-aside. However, if the actuary’s estimate proves to be inadequate, then the city has a stop-loss insurance plan in place. The foregoing becomes important for this case because the city pays for every employee, irrespective of what department they are in – the PWSB is the only entity that pays its -3- In his testimony, Catlin stated that he would not oppose recovery of the retirees’ health-care costs because the PWSB is not investor-owned. He noted that prior to the hearing, PWSB had requested a proposed settlement that would have reduced the amount sought to be recovered and the division proposed to expand the recovery period. However, despite this proposed resolution, the PUC delved further into how the PWSB derived the amount it sought to recover in the rate increase. The hearing focused on the discrepancies arising from Bondarevskis’s calculations for the proposed rate filing. The PUC questioned how the PWSB verified the amount charged by the city to the PWSB for active employees because her testimony indicated that there is no verification required for inactive or retired employees. The PUC was also concerned that the city did not track retiree costs and that it could not confirm the amount spent from 1997 through 2005 for retired PWSB employees. The PUC found that it was not until 2007 that “the [c]ity began tracking retirees separately from active employees for healthcare expenses,” and it concluded that the expenses sought to be recovered, prior to 2004, “are based on estimates.” The PUC noted that before 2004 the city had no figures accurately reflecting the amount it paid for PWSB retirees’ health care, nor could the city’s finance department recall whether, “when the actual claim experience was broken out and provided to the [c]ity, retirees were in a separate category from active employees[.]” own share. In Mr. Spinelli’s words, “[w]e are the anomaly, we are the only ones that pay our share * * *.” -4- The PUC ultimately rejected the PWSB’s request for reimbursement to the city for 1997 through 2005, 6 finding that the prohibition against retroactive ratemaking barred the recovery sought in the case. According to the PUC, the payment sought would be retroactive ratemaking and that none of the exceptions to that prohibition would apply. Additionally, and determinative for our purposes, the PUC declared: “Even if the Commission found that the prohibition against retroactive ratemaking should not apply, it is unclear what amount for retiree health care should be allowed. In order to calculate the amount to be paid back, according to Ms. Bondarevskis, the [c]ity [c]ontroller’s office started with actual costs for fiscal years 2005 and 2004, discounted the costs back for each fiscal year 2003 through 1997, based on the annual working rate increase.” The PUC issued its written order on December 13, 2007, finding that the PWSB’s “request to fund through future rates repayment of the City of Providence $1,489,081 over six years, or $248,180 annually for past retiree health care expense is denied.” On December 18, 2007, the city petitioned this Court for review in accordance with § 39-5- 1. 7 On January 17, 2008, the writ was issued, and thereafter this case was assigned to the 6 It is also of interest to this Court that the PUC included in its findings that the PWSB had numerous opportunities before its current rate filing to remedy this mistake had the city known about it. The board had applied for rate filings in at least three prior instances before 2007: “Providence Water was not billed on an annual basis by the [c]ity, [it] appears to have been in the position where [it] should have been aware of the retiree health care obligation[s], and had multiple rate cases before the Commission during the time in question when it was apparently supposed to be paying these expenses.” 7 General Laws 1956 § 39-5-1 provides for review by certiorari by our Court of all orders made by the PUC: “Any person aggrieved by a decision or order of the commission may, within seven (7) days from the date of the decision or order, petition the -5- Supreme Court’s full briefing calendar. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the PUC denying the reimbursement for the retirees’ health-care costs. Standard of Review The General Assembly has established the standard of review for cases brought before us pursuant to title 39 of the General Laws, entitled “Public Utilities and Carriers.” Specifically, the General Assembly has declared: “The findings of the commission on questions of fact shall be held to be prima facie true, and as found by the commission and the [S]upreme [C]ourt, shall not exercise its independent judgment nor weigh conflicting evidence. An order or judgment of the commission made in the exercise of administrative discretion shall not be reversed unless the commission exceeded its authority or acted illegally, arbitrarily, or unreasonably.” Section 39-5-3. Additionally, we have expounded upon this standard of review in the context of regulatory proceedings, deeming it a limited standard of review. When reviewing such regulatory proceedings, our authority is limited to whether the PUC’s findings are lawful and reasonable, supported by legal evidence and sufficiently specific to allow us to determine if the evidence before the PUC reasonably supports its decision. See Providence Water Supply Board v. Public Utilities Commission, 708 A.2d 537, 541 (R.I. [S]upreme [C]ourt for a writ of certiorari to review the legality and reasonableness of the decision or order. The petition for a writ of certiorari shall fully set forth the specific reasons for which it is claimed that the decision or order is unlawful or unreasonable. Chapter 35 of title 42 shall not be applicable to appeals from the commission. The procedure established by this chapter shall constitute the exclusive remedy for persons and companies aggrieved by any order or judgment of the commission; provided, however, any person aggrieved by a final decision or order of the administrator may appeal therefrom to the [S]uperior [C]ourt pursuant to the provisions of § 42-35-15.” -6- 1998); see also § 39-5-1. As we stated in Providence Water Supply Board v. Malachowski, 624 A.2d 305, 309 (R.I. 1993): “Even though we may reverse, affirm, or remand orders of the commission, we afford ‘great deference to decisions of the Public Utilities Commission in its rate- making regulatory capacity.’ * * * We do so because the Legislature has mandated that we cannot reverse an order of the commission unless it exceeded its authority or acted illegally, arbitrarily, or unreasonably. Section 39-5-3. In our review, a party challenging a rate that the commission approves must overcome the presumption that the commission's conclusions are reasonable unless shown otherwise by clear and convincing evidence.” In applying this standard to the issues before us, we note that in seeking to overturn a finding of the PUC, the city has a difficult burden to overcome. Analysis After a careful review of the record before us, we are satisfied that this case demonstrates a complete failure of proof by the PWSB and by the city as intervenor (and the real party in interest). We note at the outset, that the PUC found that an extrapolation of retiree health-care costs, based on a dubious mathematical formula, is insufficient proof of those costs as a matter of law. We reject the city’s contention that the statute regulating ratemaking for public utilities provides for an extrapolation of costs. The city argues to this Court that the prohibition against retroactive ratemaking does not apply to the rate filing at issue in this case because the debt incurred by the PWSB was a legitimate current obligation, and that the PUC acted arbitrarily when it denied the rate request. On the other hand, the PUC contends that these expenses, dating to 1997, are past expenses, not current costs. The PUC also argues that it acted correctly when it required the PWSB to prove its rate-filing request with accurate and verifiable -7- evidence and; the PUC contends that, when the PWSB failed to meet this burden of proof it was reasonable to deny the rate increase. We begin this discussion by reiterating our well-established jurisprudence surrounding the prohibition against retroactive ratemaking. The central principle is that ratemaking must be prospective and, although subject to narrow exceptions, the PUC may not engage in retroactive ratemaking that results in future payments for past expenses. See In re Island Hi-Speed Ferry, LLC, 852 A.2d 524, 528 (R.I. 2004). As we previously have declared: “We have said in the past that the rule against retroactive ratemaking serves two functions. ‘Initially, it protects the public by ensuring that present consumers will not be required to pay for past deficits of the company in their future payments. * * * The rule also prevents the company from employing future rates as a means of ensuring the investments of its stockholders.’ Narragansett Electric Co. v. Burke, R.I., 415 A.2d 177, 178-79 (1980). In short, the prohibition against retroactive ratemaking is based upon the rationale that future rates may not be designed to recoup past losses.” Providence Gas Co. v. Burke, 475 A.2d 193, 196 (R.I. 1984). This prohibition against retroactive ratemaking generally would prevent the rate increase in this case because public utilities are precluded from requiring current ratepayers to pay for the costs of past expenses. However, there are exceptions to the rule, most notably, that which is found in G.L. 1956 § 39-3-11.1(a): “the commission shall not have the power to suspend the taking effect of any change or changes in the rates, tolls, and charges filed and published in compliance with the requirements of §§ 39-3-10 and 39-3-11 by any public waterworks or water service owned or furnished by a city, town, or any other municipal corporation defined as a public utility in § 39-1-2, when the change or changes are proposed to be made solely for the purpose of making payments or compensation to any city or town for -8- reimbursement of any loans or advances of money previously issued to any public waterworks or water service by any city or town under existing contracts or arrangements; * * *. The public waterworks or water service shall file with the commission the new rate schedule along with the documentary evidence of the indebtedness supporting the new rates.” (Emphases added.) Thus, in certain limited instances, § 39-3-11.1 exempts public utilities from the general rule against retroactive ratemaking. See O’Neil v. Malachowski, 604 A.2d 1268, 1269 (R.I. 1992) (finding that this section exempts a publicly owned water authority or department from the ban on retroactive ratemaking because “the concern relating to privately owned companies does not apply to a publicly owned utility”). This statutory exception to the prohibition against retroactive ratemaking is sound policy because costs “that the water utility cannot recover from the users, the city provides through taxes, not voluntary investors.” In re Woonsocket Water Department, 538 A.2d 1011, 1014-15 (R.I. 1988). The analysis, however, does not end there; it is not enough that the PWSB is a public utility seeking to compensate the city for reimbursements for loans or an advance of money. The city must demonstrate that the reimbursement it seeks is, in fact, repayment of a loan or an advance of money for the city under an existing contract or arrangement. Section 39-3-11.1. The city has failed to do so in the case before us. The statutory exception requires that a rate increase must be proposed “solely for the purpose of making payments or compensation to any city or town for reimbursement of any loans or advances of money previously issued to any public waterworks or water service by any city or town under existing contracts or arrangements.” Section 39-3- 11.1(a)(emphases added). Here, the PUC found that there was no evidence of a loan or advance of money under an existing contract or arrangement. The PUC found that no -9- loan documentation existed in this case and, that the PWSB conceded that there was none. Furthermore, the PUC found that the PWSB “never claimed that this expense constituted repayment of a loan or advance.” We review § 39-3-11.1 in accordance with our long-standing rules of statutory construction. “When the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, we must enforce the statute as written by giving the words of the statute their plain and ordinary meaning.” Gem Plumbing & Heating Co. v. Rossi, 867 A.2d 796, 811 (R.I. 2005) (quoting Harvard Pilgrim Health Care of New England, Inc. v. Gelati, 865 A.2d 1028, 1037 (R.I. 2004)). Thus, in accordance with the plain meaning of the statute, whenever a municipality-owned water company is petitioning for a retroactive rate increase, as allowed by § 39-3-11.1, it must demonstrate to the PUC that there was an actual loan or advance to support the request; it must also demonstrate that the amount the petitioners seek to recoup is capable of proof by documentary evidence. Here, such proof is lacking. Indeed, the city suggested at oral argument that these payments were “like a loan with no paperwork.” Clearly, the city failed to sustain its burden of producing documentary evidence establishing that the expenditures for which it sought reimbursement through retroactive ratemaking were the result of existing contracts or other arrangements. We conclude that the city has not demonstrated that it meets the statutory exception found in § 39-3-11.1. Furthermore, the PUC observed, and we agree, that there was an utter failure of proof about the amount sought to be recovered. The burden of proof necessary to support a general rate filing is set forth in § 39-3-12: “At any hearing involving any proposed increase in any rate, toll, or charge, the burden of proof to show that the - 10 - increase is necessary in order to obtain a reasonable compensation for the service rendered shall be upon the public utility; * * *.” (Emphases added.) Section 39-3-12 unequivocally provides that at “any hearing” requesting a rate increase, the public utility has the burden of proving that the increase is necessary. Therefore, it was incumbent upon the PWSB to demonstrate to the PUC that the general rate filing sought in this case was necessary “in order to obtain a reasonable compensation for the service rendered.” Id. We previously have elaborated upon § 39-3- 12 and the relationship between the PUC and the PWSB in Audubon Society of Rhode Island v. Malachowski, 569 A.2d 1 (R.I. 1990). In that case, we affirmed an order by the PUC in which it granted an increase to the PWSB. Id. at 3. In reviewing the PUC’s order, we concluded that a two-page document separating the claimed costs into seven discrete categories met the statutory threshold found in § 39-3-12 because the documentary proof permitted the PUC to find that the expenses were “based on actual costs incurred by the board as verified by the auditors.” Malachowski, 569 A.2d at 2. In discussing the report at issue in Malachowski, we explained that the PUC’s role with regard to the utility’s burden of proof, noting that, “special regulatory dangers exist in transactions between regulated utilities and unregulated affiliates.” Id. at 3. We recognized that in examining these relationships “the PUC has the right and the duty to scrutinize closely such transactions.” Id. Applying that reasoning to the case at hand, the PUC carefully examined the proposed rate filing by the PWSB and the utility’s relationship with the city and concluded that the board and the city failed to meet its burden of proof to support the rate filing. The PUC found that, in accordance with § 39-3-12, “the burden of proof is on the - 11 - utility to present and prove its expense, but Providence Water objected and refused to provide the information. Therefore, Providence Water failed to prove its case.” In In re Woonsocket Water Department, 538 A.2d at 1014, this Court held that: “It is within the province of the commission to determine the type of information a utility must supply to set specific rates. * * * No particular formula binds the commission in formulating its rate decision; the sole requirement is that the ultimate rate be fair and reasonable. * * * The rate that the commission approves, furthermore, carries a presumption of reasonableness that remains until the contrary is proven.” The record before us indicates that the PUC’s report and order was reasonable given that the PWSB had failed to provide the requisite proof of the actual amount for the retirees’ health-care costs between 1997 and 2005. Neither the PUC nor this Court is required to accept an extrapolation in place of the actual and verifiable proof necessary to sustain a general rate filing; nor will this Court substitute its own judgment for that of the PUC “unless the commission exceeded its authority or acted illegally, arbitrarily, or unreasonably.” Section 39-5-3. Accordingly, we affirm the report and order of the PUC. Conclusion For the reasons stated, we quash the writ and affirm the report and order of the Public Utilities Commission denying the Providence Water Supply Board’s request for reimbursement to the petitioner, the City of Providence. The records certified to this Court are remanded to the Public Utilities Commission with our decision endorsed thereon. - 12 - Supreme Court No. 2007-378-M.P. (3832) In re Providence Water Supply Board’s : Application to Change Rate Schedules.",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. This case is before the Supreme Court as a statutory petition for certiorari filed by the petitioner, the City of Providence (city), pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 39-5-1. The city is seeking review of a decision by the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission (PUC) 1 denying a rate increase to the Providence Water Supply Board (PWSB or board) for reimbursement of sums paid for the PWSB’s retirees’ health-care coverage and benefits. The city seeks review of the report and order that the PUC issued in Docket No. 3832. After careful review of the record in this case, we affirm the order of the PUC.', 'Facts and Travel', 'Although this case began on March 30, 2007, when the PWSB made a general rate filing with the PUC, the events giving rise to the rate filing date to 1997, when the city began paying for a portion of the PWSB’s retiree health-care costs. Inexplicably, these unreimbursed payments continued until 2005. 2 The 2007 rate filing, as requested, 1', 'The Attorney General represents the Division of Public Utilities and Carriers on behalf of the PUC. 2', 'The record discloses that in 2006 the PWSB began paying for retirees’ health-care expenditures by using existing rates.', '-1- amounted to an overall revenue increase of $9,688,321 or 19.07 percent, and would have resulted in a rate increase for a typical resident in the city of approximately $41.60 or 17 percent. The 2007 rate filing was not solely based on the retirees’ health-care costs; it was included in a general rate filing seeking an increase for several additional operational expenses. 3 The only issue before us, however, is the city’s petition to review that portion of the PUC’s decision denying the reimbursement for the retirees’ health-care costs. It is important to note, however, that in its final report the PUC declared that this was the PWSB’s fourth rate filing since 2000, but was the first time the city sought reimbursement for retiree health-care costs, notwithstanding that such payments commenced in 1997. 4', 'The PWSB is an entity that is independent of city control; however, it uses the city’s administrative services. According to the record, the PWSB typically prepares a payroll and sends it to the city’s finance department, and the city charges the PWSB budget for allocations made on the PWSB’s behalf. From 1997 through 2005, the city neglected to charge the PWSB for costs associated with the PWSB’s retiree health care. Once this error was discovered, the PWSB sought to reimburse the city for past expenses that it had failed to pay because of the city’s oversight. 3', 'Those costs included infrastructure replacement; increases in insurance costs; increases in chemical and sludge costs; increased costs associated with post-retirement health care benefits; the instant request to recover past retiree health care benefits paid by the City of Providence; increases in property taxes; an increase in operations revenue allowance; funding for strategic planning; increase in city service expense; wages and benefits; purchase power, and other known and measurable increases. 4', 'The board made a request for rate filing in 2000, 2002, 2005, and the current request in 2007.', '-2-', 'Hearings on the PWSB’s rate filing were held on June 19, 21, and 28, 2007 and September 12-13, 2007. The PUC also accepted prefiled testimonies from witnesses and experts representing the PWSB and other interested parties.', 'The most pertinent testimony about the retirees’ health-care costs came from Ms. Jeanne Bondarevskis (Bondarevskis), director of finance for the PWSB, and Mr. Thomas Catlin (Catlin), a consultant on revenue requirements for the Division of Public Utilities and Carriers.', 'Bondarevskis testified that the requested increase was intended to reimburse the city for the costs of retirees’ health care, and she explained how these expenses were calculated. Specifically, Bondarevskis stated that the PWSB had not been reimbursing the city for the cost of its retirees’ health care for several years and that this mistake was not discovered until fiscal year 2006. According to Bondarevskis, “[f]or some time now Providence Water has not reimbursed the [c]ity for [h]ealth care costs for employees in a direct manner,” but Bondarevskis explained that when the payroll is complete, the city then wires the amount needed for payroll and fringe benefits.', 'The PUC explained in its order,', '“In order to calculate the amount to be paid back, the City', 'Controller’s office started with actual costs for fiscal years', '2005 and 2004, discounted the costs back for each fiscal', 'year 2003 through 1997, based on the annual working', 'rate[ 5 ] increase. In Ms. Bondarevskis’ opinion, this was ‘a', 'reasonable method of estimating the outstanding liability.’” 5', 'The working rate increase was described by Mr. Boyce Spinelli (Spinelli), the deputy general manager for the PWSB and former finance director for the city. In his testimony, Spinelli explained that the working rate is the amount set by an actuary to predict what the city will need to contribute annually to pay for all its employee’s health plans, irrespective of the employee’s status, whether retiree or active. This is so because the city is self-insured, and the working rate is a set-aside. However, if the actuary’s estimate proves to be inadequate, then the city has a stop-loss insurance plan in place. The foregoing becomes important for this case because the city pays for every employee, irrespective of what department they are in – the PWSB is the only entity that pays its', '-3-', 'In his testimony, Catlin stated that he would not oppose recovery of the retirees’ health-care costs because the PWSB is not investor-owned. He noted that prior to the hearing, PWSB had requested a proposed settlement that would have reduced the amount sought to be recovered and the division proposed to expand the recovery period. However, despite this proposed resolution, the PUC delved further into how the PWSB derived the amount it sought to recover in the rate increase.', 'The hearing focused on the discrepancies arising from Bondarevskis’s calculations for the proposed rate filing. The PUC questioned how the PWSB verified the amount charged by the city to the PWSB for active employees because her testimony indicated that there is no verification required for inactive or retired employees. The PUC was also concerned that the city did not track retiree costs and that it could not confirm the amount spent from 1997 through 2005 for retired PWSB employees. The PUC found that it was not until 2007 that “the [c]ity began tracking retirees separately from active employees for healthcare expenses,” and it concluded that the expenses sought to be recovered, prior to 2004, “are based on estimates.” The PUC noted that before 2004 the city had no figures accurately reflecting the amount it paid for PWSB retirees’ health care, nor could the city’s finance department recall whether, “when the actual claim experience was broken out and provided to the [c]ity, retirees were in a separate category from active employees[.]” own share. In Mr. Spinelli’s words, “[w]e are the anomaly, we are the only ones that pay our share * * *.”', '-4-', 'The PUC ultimately rejected the PWSB’s request for reimbursement to the city for 1997 through 2005, 6 finding that the prohibition against retroactive ratemaking barred the recovery sought in the case. According to the PUC, the payment sought would be retroactive ratemaking and that none of the exceptions to that prohibition would apply. Additionally, and determinative for our purposes, the PUC declared:', '“Even if the Commission found that the prohibition against', 'retroactive ratemaking should not apply, it is unclear what', 'amount for retiree health care should be allowed. In order', 'to calculate the amount to be paid back, according to Ms.', 'Bondarevskis, the [c]ity [c]ontroller’s office started with', 'actual costs for fiscal years 2005 and 2004, discounted the', 'costs back for each fiscal year 2003 through 1997, based on', 'the annual working rate increase.”', 'The PUC issued its written order on December 13, 2007, finding that the PWSB’s “request to fund through future rates repayment of the City of Providence $1,489,081 over six years, or $248,180 annually for past retiree health care expense is denied.” On December 18, 2007, the city petitioned this Court for review in accordance with § 39-5- 1. 7 On January 17, 2008, the writ was issued, and thereafter this case was assigned to the 6', 'It is also of interest to this Court that the PUC included in its findings that the PWSB had numerous opportunities before its current rate filing to remedy this mistake had the city known about it.

In discussing the report at issue in Malachowski, we explained that the PUC’s role with regard to the utility’s burden of proof, noting that, “special regulatory dangers exist in transactions between regulated utilities and unregulated affiliates.” Id. at 3.', 'We recognized that in examining these relationships “the PUC has the right and the duty to scrutinize closely such transactions.” Id.', 'Applying that reasoning to the case at hand, the PUC carefully examined the proposed rate filing by the PWSB and the utility’s relationship with the city and concluded that the board and the city failed to meet its burden of proof to support the rate filing. The PUC found that, in accordance with § 39-3-12, “the burden of proof is on the', '- 11 - utility to present and prove its expense, but Providence Water objected and refused to provide the information. Therefore, Providence Water failed to prove its case.”', 'In In re Woonsocket Water Department, 538 A.2d at 1014, this Court held that:', '“It is within the province of the commission to', 'determine the type of information a utility must supply to', 'set specific rates. * * * No particular formula binds the', 'commission in formulating its rate decision; the sole', 'requirement is that the ultimate rate be fair and reasonable.', '* * * The rate that the commission approves, furthermore,', 'carries a presumption of reasonableness that remains until', 'the contrary is proven.”', 'The record before us indicates that the PUC’s report and order was reasonable given that the PWSB had failed to provide the requisite proof of the actual amount for the retirees’ health-care costs between 1997 and 2005. Neither the PUC nor this Court is required to accept an extrapolation in place of the actual and verifiable proof necessary to sustain a general rate filing; nor will this Court substitute its own judgment for that of the PUC “unless the commission exceeded its authority or acted illegally, arbitrarily, or unreasonably.” Section 39-5-3. Accordingly, we affirm the report and order of the PUC.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated, we quash the writ and affirm the report and order of the Public Utilities Commission denying the Providence Water Supply Board’s request for reimbursement to the petitioner, the City of Providence.

59,"International Brotherhood of Police : Officers, Local 569 v. : City of East Providence : Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty, and Robinson, JJ. OPINION Justice Goldberg, for the Court. This case comes before us on the plaintiff’s appeal from a Superior Court decision declaring that the defendant, the City of East Providence and its police department (city or department), acted properly when it discharged Officer Sean Sullivan (Sullivan) for non-disciplinary reasons without employing the hearing procedure required by the Law Enforcement Officers’ Bill of Rights (LEOBOR). 1 The plaintiff, International Brotherhood of Police Officers, Local 569 (union), 2 argues on appeal that Sullivan’s constitutional right of due process was 1 General Laws 1956 § 42-28.6-14(b) provides: “Any law enforcement officer who is denied any right afforded by this subtitle may apply, either individually or through his or her certified or recognized employee organization, to the [S]uperior [C]ourt * * * for any order directing the law enforcement agency to show cause why the right should not be afforded.” 2 At all relevant times in this case, the union was the exclusive bargaining representative for all permanent, full-time police officers employed by the East Providence Police Department, excluding the chief of police. -1- violated when the city failed to comply with the LEOBOR. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the Superior Court’s judgment. Facts and Travel The facts in this case largely are undisputed. Since 2002, Sullivan was employed as a full-time police officer; on October 19, 2005, while on duty, Sullivan experienced chest pain, sweating, dizziness, and pain in his right arm. He was taken to the hospital and diagnosed with malignant hypertension and stress. The city placed Sullivan on injured-on-duty (IOD) status. On February 7, 2006, Sullivan was authorized to return to work; however, he did not do so. On March 23, 2006, a physician opined that although “the actual incident that took him out of work had nothing to do with work at all,” Sullivan remained unfit to return to duty. After a number of additional exchanges of correspondence, Sullivan ultimately was cleared to return to light duty work. Sullivan then expended his unused vacation time until May 19, 2007, at which time he returned to light duty for three days; on the third day he left early, without an explanation. He was placed on leave without pay. When Sullivan still had not returned to work after six months, he was notified that he was permanently discharged. 3 In its letter of termination, the department explained that, “[t]his separation of service is non-disciplinary as it is a consequence of your inability to return to work based on a non-work related illness.” 3 Before Sullivan received this notification, the union filed a grievance on Sullivan’s behalf, contending that the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between the union and the city requires that the department carry Sullivan on IOD status. The grievance went to arbitration, and on October 2, 2007, the arbitrator found that the department did not violate the CBA when it refused to place Sullivan on IOD status because Sullivan already had returned to work from the October 2005 incident. -2- Ten days later, the union filed a complaint seeking declaratory relief in Superior Court, alleging that the department violated Sullivan’s due process rights when it discharged Sullivan without a hearing as mandated by the LEOBOR, G.L. 1956 § 42- 28.6-4. The department filed an answer and counterclaim contending that because the LEOBOR only applies to punitive disciplinary matters, its hearing provision only applies to terminations stemming from police officer misconduct. In a written decision, the then- presiding justice of the Superior Court found that the statute’s terms are clear and unambiguous and that the hearing provisions of § 42-28.6-4 are triggered only when there are allegations of misconduct directed against the police officer. The then-presiding justice held that, because Sullivan was terminated for a non-work related injury and since “there exists not one scintilla of evidence that Officer Sullivan violated any rules or regulations, or * * * the law,” the department was not required to provide Sullivan with a hearing in accordance with the LEOBOR. Standard of Review This Court accords great deference to a trial justice’s decision to grant or deny declaratory relief. Providence Lodge No. 3, Fraternal Order of Police v. Providence External Review Authority, 951 A.2d 497, 502 (R.I. 2008) (Providence Lodge No. 3). “[W]e review a declaratory decree of the Superior Court with an eye to whether the court abused its discretion, misinterpreted the applicable law, overlooked material facts, or otherwise exceeded its authority.” Sullivan v. Chafee, 703 A.2d 748, 751 (R.I. 1997). However, a trial justice’s findings regarding a question of law will be reviewed de novo. Providence Lodge No. 3, 951 A.2d at 502 (citing Casco Indemnity Co. v. O’Connor, 755 A.2d 779, 782 (R.I. 2000)). Additionally, this Court reviews issues of statutory -3- interpretation de novo. Town of North Kingstown v. Albert, 767 A.2d 659, 662 (R.I. 2001). Analysis After careful review of the record before us and mindful of our standard of review, we reject the union’s arguments and affirm the decision of the then-presiding justice. We are satisfied that the terms of the LEOBOR are clear and unambiguous and that the then-presiding justice properly employed its provisions. “If a statutory provision is unambiguous, there is no room for statutory construction and we must apply the statute as written.” In re Denisewich, 643 A.2d 1194, 1197 (R.I. 1994). Because the LEOBOR is limited to instances of alleged police officer misconduct, the statute is wholly inapplicable in the case at bar. The hearing provisions of the LEOBOR refer to circumstances in which permanent, full-time police officers are under investigation or interrogation by department officials and accordingly are protected by its terms. 4 Section 42-28.6-4. The term “hearing committee” is defined as “a committee which is authorized to hold a hearing on a complaint against a law enforcement officer * * *.” Section 42-28.6-1(2)(i) (emphasis added). The term “hearing” is defined as “any meeting in the course of an investigatory proceeding, other than an interrogation * * *.” Section 42-28.6-1(3) (emphasis added). Section 42-28.6-4(a) describes the right to a hearing under the LEOBOR. Section 42-28.6-4(a) provides in pertinent part: “If the investigation or interrogation of a law enforcement officer results in the recommendation of some action, such as demotion, transfer, dismissal, loss of pay, reassignment, 4 We note that § 42-28.6-1(2)(i) refers to a law enforcement officer under investigation or interrogation as “the aggrieved” officer. -4- or similar action which would be considered a punitive measure, then, before taking such action, the law enforcement agency shall give notice to the law enforcement officer that he or she is entitled to a hearing * * *.” (Emphasis added.) This Court previously has held that “the right to a hearing under [the LEOBOR] simply does not vest until the chief or someone in a comparable position indicates that one of the sanctions envisioned by the terms of § 42-28.6-4 will be imposed upon the individual who has been charged with a violation of departmental rules and regulations.” Providence Lodge No. 3, 951 A.2d at 503 (quoting Zincone v. Mancuso, 523 A.2d 1222, 1225 (R.I. 1987)). “Until such a decision is made by a police chief, the hearing provision of [the] LEOBOR and the ensuing procedural steps are not operative.” Id. Additionally, this Court has declared on numerous occasions that the LEOBOR is “‘the exclusive remedy for permanently appointed law enforcement officers who are under investigation and subject to disciplin[ary] action’ by a law enforcement agency for noncriminal allegations of misconduct.” Providence Lodge No. 3, 951 A.2d at 502 (quoting In re Sabetta, 661 A.2d 80, 83 (R.I. 1995)); see, e.g., Town of North Kingstown v. Local 473, International Brotherhood of Police Officers, 819 A.2d 1274, 1276 (R.I. 2003) (recognizing that the Legislature intended that the LEOBOR outline “a comprehensive mode of procedure to govern the investigation of a police officer for misconduct”); In re Denisewich, 643 A.2d at 1196 (recognizing that the LEOBOR is the “exclusive remedy for permanently appointed law enforcement officers who are under investigation and subject to disciplinary action” for alleged improper conduct); City of East Providence v. McLaughlin, 593 A.2d 1345, 1348 (R.I. 1991) (holding that the -5- LEOBOR is the exclusive remedy for permanently appointed police officers “under investigation by a law-enforcement agency”). After Sullivan’s doctors diagnosed him unfit for regular service as a police officer, based on a non-work related ailment, but capable of performing light duty, he left work and never returned. It is undisputed that the department neither investigated Sullivan nor alleged that he was involved in any misconduct. Thus, the procedural protections that permanent, full-time police officers are afforded under the LEOBOR are wholly unavailable to Sullivan in this instance. Sullivan was a public employee whose property interest in continued employment, absent police misconduct, was created and defined by the Revised Ordinances of the City of East Providence § 12-20, 5 and included a right to a pre- termination hearing. 6 Although Sullivan may have had rights stemming from the city’s employment protections and procedures, those issues are not before us; as “we have stated many times, this Court’s ‘raise-or-waive’ rule precludes our consideration of an 5 Section 12-20 of the Revised Ordinances of the City of East Providence provides: “Upon successful completion of the one-year probationary period, the applicant shall be eligible for appointment to permanent status by the appointing authority.” 6 Section 11-69(d) of the Revised Ordinances of the City of East Providence provides: “Discharge. An employee may be discharged by the appointing authority for activities prohibited in the Charter and for insubordination, inefficiency, abuse of sick leave, misconduct, disloyalty or other similar just cause. No discharge of a permanent classified employee shall take effect, unless five days prior to the effective date thereof the appointing authority shall give to such employee a written statement setting forth in detail the reasons therefor and shall file a copy of such statement with the director.

60,"State of Rhode Island. : Jeffrey S. Washington : v. : No. 2008-255-Appeal. (PM 98-1623) State of Rhode Island. : Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty, and Robinson, JJ. OPINION Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The applicant, Jeffery S. Washington, appeals from a Superior Court judgment denying his applications for postconviction relief. His original conviction dates to May 1989, when a jury found him guilty of first-degree felony murder for the rape and resulting death of an elderly woman. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on January 26, 2010, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After hearing the parties’ arguments and considering the memoranda submitted on behalf of each of them, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide this appeal at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. -1- I Facts and Travel This sad story begins on Christmas Day 1987, when Alice Carcieri, an elderly double amputee, died from the trauma precipitated by a brutal sexual assault. 1 On that day, the applicant, who had worked cleaning Ms. Carcieri’s house in the past, snuck into the basement of her house, where he consumed drugs, ate some food, and relieved himself in a bucket. After entertaining friends and family for the holiday, Ms. Carcieri went to bed. Washington proceeded upstairs to her bedroom and found her asleep. After covering her head and tying her hands to the bedposts, he raped her. Washington attempted to make it appear as though a burglary had occurred before he fled. He left Ms. Carcieri in her bed, where she died from heart failure. A horrified family member discovered her there the next morning. The applicant was apprehended and arrested in New York after he attempted to steal a wallet. He implicated himself in the death of Ms. Carcieri, and the New York authorities alerted the Providence police. Officers from that department traveled to New York, where they obtained a full confession from him, in which he expressed his remorse for his treatment of Ms. Carcieri. Washington was charged with murder, and eventually he was tried before a jury in the spring of 1989. 2 The jury returned a verdict of guilty on the charge of first-degree felony murder, and the panel also concluded that the murder involved aggravated battery. The trial justice upheld the jury’s finding of aggravated battery and in addition found that there had been aggravated torture. He sentenced Washington to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The applicant 1 The facts of this case are set forth in detail in this Court’s opinion of State v. Washington, 581 A.2d 1031 (R.I. 1990) in which we denied applicant’s direct appeal. 2 At trial, the applicant was represented by the chief public defender of Rhode Island, who is now deceased. -2- appealed his conviction to this Court; however, we affirmed the judgment of conviction. State v. Washington, 581 A.2d 1031, 1036 (R.I. 1990). On April 2, 1998, Washington began his quest for postconviction relief by filing an incomplete pro se application. Since that time, he has been represented by various appointed counsel, but it was not until January 27, 2004, that applicant submitted a complete application for postconviction relief, which was heard before a hearing justice of the Superior Court on June 28, 2004. A decision denying the application was issued on July 18, 2005. 3 Washington filed a second application for postconviction relief on August 1, 2005, citing documents that he had received from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Hearings on that petition were held before the same hearing justice and he met with the same fate; his second application for postconviction relief was denied. He then filed a premature appeal to this Court. The applicant’s two appeals from the decisions denying his two applications for postconviction relief were consolidated on November 20, 2008.

State, 877 A.2d 625, 628 (R.I. 2005)); see also G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-1(a)(1) (providing statutory right to postconviction relief for constitutional violations). “When this Court reviews a ruling on an application for postconviction relief, we afford great deference to the motion justice’s findings of 3 The applicant filed a premature appeal to this Court on July 26, 2005 before final judgment was entered. Although final judgment was not entered until September 3, 2008, we will treat the premature appeal as if it were timely filed. See Bleau v. State, 968 A.2d 276, 278 n.1 (R.I. 2009) (citing Brown v.

However, “[t]his Court will * * * ‘review de novo any post-conviction relief decision involving questions of fact or mixed questions of law and fact pertaining to an alleged violation of an applicant’s constitutional rights.’” Bustamante v. Wall, 866 A.2d 516, 522 (R.I. 2005) (quoting Taylor v. Wall, 821 A.2d 685, 688 (R.I. 2003)). III Analysis On appeal before this Court, applicant raises four issues.4 First, he argues that his trial attorney provided him with ineffective assistance of counsel because he failed to present a defense of diminished capacity at trial. Second, Washington contends that his trial attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel because of his “broken promise to the jury” that defendant would testify in his own defense. Third, he raises still another argument of ineffective 4 The applicant also argued at his postconviction-relief hearing and before this Court that the state violated discovery rules by failing to disclose evidence that might demonstrate applicant’s diminished capacity, such as the analytical results from the contents of the bucket that applicant left in the victim’s basement around the time that he committed the crime. He further contended at a postconviction-relief hearing on his second application, as he does here, that approximately fifty pages of laboratory documentation were withheld from him during his trial. He alleges that that was the fault of either the FBI or the Rhode Island Attorney General. He also seeks to determine whether additional documentation exists. The hearing justice issued an order that denied those claims for postconviction relief “consistent with the court’s earlier 62-page written decision.” In her decision, the hearing justice ruled that the court could not decide the issue about these alleged discovery violations in accordance with Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963) because defendant failed to provide “any such evidence allegedly withheld by the State at trial.” “This Court affords great deference to a trial justice’s decision with respect to whether or not a violation of * * * Brady v. Maryland * * * has occurred, and it ‘will not disturb that ruling unless he or she has committed clear error.’” State v. Diefenderfer, 970 A.2d 12, 23 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. McManus, 941 A.2d 222, 229 (R.I. 2008)). In our view, the record supports the trial justice’s ruling that Washington did not prove a Brady violation and, therefore, her decision -4- assistance of counsel in which he asserts that his trial attorney refused to allow him to testify in his own defense. Finally, he argues that the trial justice committed reversible error when he did not conduct a hearing and colloquy with him to determine that applicant’s waiver of his right to testify was done knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. A Ineffective Assistance of Counsel “This Court has adopted the standard announced by the United States Supreme Court in Strickland v. Washington, [466 U.S. 668 * * * (1984)] when generally reviewing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.” Rodrigues v. State, 985 A.2d 311, 315 (R.I. 2009) (quoting Powers v. State, 734 A.2d 508, 521-22 (R.I. 1999)). The Strickland standard requires this Court to review allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel by using a two-part test. Moniz, 933 A.2d at 696 (citing Burke v. State, 925 A.2d 890, 893 (R.I. 2007)). “First, the defendant must show that counsel’s performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the ‘counsel’ guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that counsel’s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable. Unless a defendant makes both showings, it cannot be said that the conviction or death sentence resulted from a breakdown in the adversary process that renders the result unreliable.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687. Under the performance prong of the test, “the defendant must show that counsel’s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.” Id. at 688. Under the prejudice prong, the defendant must demonstrate that counsel’s objectively unreasonable performance caused a “reasonable probability that * * * the result of the proceeding would have been different.” Id. at was not clear error. Moreover, applicant repeatedly has conceded that the proper forum for these claims is in the federal court. He indicates that he will pursue those claims in that forum. -5- 694. The Court in Strickland cautioned, however, that “scrutiny of counsel’s performance must be highly deferential.” Id. at 689. Therefore, this Court “will reject an allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel ‘unless a defendant can demonstrate that counsel’s advice was not within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases’ * * *.” Rodrigues, 985 A.2d at 315 (quoting Moniz, 933 A.2d at 697 and Miguel v. State, 774 A.2d 19, 22 (R.I. 2001)). 1 Diminished Capacity Defense In his application for postconviction relief, applicant argued that his attorney furnished ineffective assistance when he failed to present a diminished-capacity defense at trial. He asserts that his attorney did not present evidence of his “inability to form a malicious intent, i.e. his diminished capacity.” Specifically, applicant contended in his application that his attorney neglected to introduce exculpatory evidence about his state of mind on the night of the crime. He urges that his counsel erred when he did not “pursue expert testimony and lab reports and the analysis of bucket contents that would have established that the defendant was under extreme emotional duress, or a drug induced hallucination, at the time of the incident and had very little capacity to conform his conduct to the law.” Moreover, he asserted that his attorney did not challenge the prosecution’s evidence, nor did he present testimony about his propensity to “blackout” when under the influence of drugs and alcohol. The hearing justice rejected this argument. She found “that it was objectively reasonable for Mr. Washington’s defense counsel to [forgo] a defense of diminished capacity at trial given its uselessness in defending against charges of felony murder based on rape and the lesser included charge of rape.” The hearing justice explained that such a defense could not benefit defendant because felony murder is a general-intent crime that does not require the prosecution -6- to prove that defendant had the specific intent to commit murder and, therefore, diminished capacity is not available as a defense. There was a substantial amount of physical evidence tying Washington to this crime including hair and fingerprint evidence. Additionally, the jury was presented with Washington’s confession and other correspondence between him and Ms. Carcieri’s family, in which he expressed his remorse. Further, there was a dearth of evidence in the record that the FBI had preserved or tested the contents of the bucket. Therefore, the hearing justice found that Washington’s attorney’s decision not to present a diminished-capacity defense was an objectively reasonable tactical decision, and also “wise.” She did not afford any weight to applicant’s testimony at the postconviction relief hearing that he was prone to blackouts and that he suffered from one the night of the crime. Thus, the hearing justice concluded that Washington failed to satisfy the initial performance prong of the Strickland test with regard to his allegations that his attorney provided ineffective assistance. In our view, Washington was provided with effective representation. It was objectively reasonable for counsel to decline to present a defense that would be unavailing with regard to the crime charged. This alone eviscerates applicant’s argument that his trial attorney’s performance was deficient under the first Strickland prong. The applicant was charged under G.L. 1956 § 11- 23-1 with the general-intent crime of felony murder.5 “General-intent crimes require only the ‘intention to make the bodily movement which constitutes the act which the crime requires,’ * * * whereas specific intent crimes most commonly involve the designation of ‘a specific mental element * * *.’” State v. Sivo, 925 A.2d 901, 914 (R.I. 2007) (quoting 1 LaFave, 5 General Laws 1965 § 11-23-1 provides that “[e]very murder * * * committed in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate, any * * * rape, any degree of sexual assault * * * is murder in the first degree.” Additionally, the crime of rape “has always been considered a -7- Substantive Criminal Law § 5.2(e) at 354, 355 (2d ed. 2003)). The crime of felony murder does not require “proof of the specific intent to kill or to cause great bodily harm.” State v. Amazeen, 526 A.2d 1268, 1271 (R.I. 1987). Under a diminished-capacity defense, a defendant submits that, although he is responsible for the prohibited act, “his mental capacity may have been diminished by intoxication, trauma, or mental disease so that he did not possess the specific mental state or intent essential to the particular offense charged.” State v. LaCroix, 911 A.2d 674, 679 (R.I. 2006) (quoting State v. Correra, 430 A.2d 1251, 1253 (R.I. 1981)). Accordingly, the defense is available only for crimes of specific intent. See id.; State v. Doyon, 416 A.2d 130, 134 (R.I. 1980) (“The availability of a diminished-capacity defense turns upon whether the offense in question requires proof of a specific intent.”) (citing United States v. Busic, 592 F.2d 13, 21 (2d Cir. 1978)). Thus, Washington’s attorney’s decision not to present evidence that might establish that he suffered from a diminished capacity that prevented him from forming the specific intent to kill was sound. 2 Promise to the Jury The applicant next argues that his counsel was constitutionally deficient because he promised the jury during his opening statement that Washington would testify in his own defense, but because applicant ultimately waived his right to testify, the promise to the jury was left unfulfilled. This, he argues, prejudiced him to such an extent that a new trial is warranted. He contends that his attorney’s breach of this promise was objectively unreasonable and resulted in the violation of his constitutional right to testify. During his opening statement, Washington’s general-intent crime and has never been interpreted by this Court as requiring a mens rea.” State v. Yanez, 716 A.2d 759, 768 (R.I. 1998) (citing State v. Bryant, 670 A.2d 776, 783 (R.I. 1996)). -8- attorney informed the jury that Washington would “take the stand and he is going to tell you how he feels sorry for what he did” and also would relate what his state of mind was throughout the events leading up to and following the commission of the crime. After applicant decided not to testify, his attorney explained the apparent inconsistency to the jury during his closing statement. He said, “During my opening statement, I suggested to you that Jeffrey Washington would testify and tell you his state of mind, and you are probably wondering why he did not * * * he didn’t take the stand because he has already testified in this case * * *.” He then reminded the jury about Washington’s confession and letters to the victim’s family, which told his side of the story and indicated his remorse. The hearing justice rejected Washington’s argument that his attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel as a result of his broken promise to the jury. She concluded that his attorney’s performance was not objectively unreasonable in that he did not actually break a promise to the jury. That was so, she reasoned, because applicant’s remorse and state of mind were presented to the jury through other means that did not expose applicant to a cross- examination that most likely would have been damaging to the defense. She also concluded that Washington had not established the second Strickland prong because “he has failed to demonstrate that his testimony likely would have made a difference in the outcome of his trial.” In reaching her decision on this issue, the hearing justice distinguished this case from Ouber v. Guarino, 293 F.3d 19 (1st Cir. 2002). In Ouber, the petitioner went to trial three times on a drug-trafficking charge. Id. at 22. The first two trials, in which she testified in her own defense, resulted in deadlocked juries. Id. At the beginning of the third trial, her attorney made an opening statement in which he promised the jury four times that the petitioner would take the stand; throughout his opening, he stressed the importance of her testimony. Id. At the third trial, -9- however, unlike the previous two trials, the petitioner was not called as a witness, despite her attorney’s quadrupled pledge in his opening statement that she would take the stand. Id. at 23. The jury found the petitioner guilty. Id. The Ouber court, in accordance with the Strickland standard, analyzed “the attorney’s initial decision to present the petitioner’s testimony as the centerpiece of the defense (and his serial announcement of that fact to the jury in his opening statement)” and juxtaposed it with his ultimate decision to advise the petitioner that she should not testify. Ouber, 293 F.3d at 27. As for the first prong, the court held “that the attorney’s performance was constitutionally deficient under Strickland--and severely so.” Id. at 32. The court reasoned that the performance was deficient because the attorney made an unjustified mid-trial decision to forgo presenting the petitioner as a witness and that there were no unforeseeable events that precipitated his “change of heart.” Id. at 29. Indeed, the same attorney had represented the petitioner in the previous two trials for the same offense. Id. The court in that case also held that “but for” the attorney’s “egregious” error of repeatedly promising the petitioner’s testimony, which he himself characterized as important, and then failing to call the petitioner as a witness, “a different outcome might well have eventuated.” Ouber, 293 F.3d at 34. The court reasoned that “the only salient difference” between the first two trials and the third was the fact that the petitioner did not testify in the third trial, as she had in the first two. Id. at 35. The court characterized this contrast as a “prime example” of how the third trial “likely would have ended” had the petitioner taken the stand in fulfillment of her attorney’s assurances to the jury. Id. Here, the hearing justice differentiated the broken promise of the petitioner’s testimony in Ouber from Washington’s attorney’s unfulfilled assurance of Washington’s testimony on several - 10 - grounds. Unlike Ouber, where the purpose of the petitioner’s testimony was to allow the jury to assess the “truth and veracity” and credibility of the petitioner in contrast to another witness, the stated purpose of Washington’s testimony was to inform the jurors of his remorse and state of mind. Ouber, 293 F.3d at 22. The hearing justice found that “[t]he testimony elicited by defense counsel, the evidence admitted at trial and counsel’s arguments * * * establish[ed] the defendant’s remorse and state of mind, as was promised to the jury.” Therefore, she found that the promise to the jury was not actually broken, but rather that its purpose was accomplished by other means. Moreover, the hearing justice also distinguished the applicant’s attorney’s promise from that of the attorney in Ouber in that the attorney in Ouber changed his mind during the course of the trial, while applicant’s attorney did not. Ouber, 293 F.3d at 23. She found that applicant’s attorney “never wavered in his decision to advise Mr. Washington not to take the stand but, contrary to counsel’s advice, the defendant insisted on testifying in order to fulfill his promise to the family to tell them the truth about what had happened to Alice Carcieri.” Additionally, the attorney in Ouber reneged in the face of his personal experience in the two previous trials. Id. at 29. But here, the hearing justice found that “the evidence does not suggest that counsel could reasonably have expected or counted on a change of heart by the defendant about taking the stand.” Therefore, she ruled that neither prong of the Strickland test had been satisfied because the pledge to the jury was fulfilled (albeit not in the manner anticipated), applicant’s decision not to testify was unforeseeable at the outset of the trial, and, importantly, applicant “failed to demonstrate that his testimony likely would have made a difference in the outcome of his trial.” We agree with the hearing justice’s analysis and, in our opinion, applicant received the benefit of effective representation. Although Ouber and the facts of this case seem similar at - 11 - first blush, upon closer examination, the Ouber case is readily distinguishable. The attorney in Ouber made repeated promises to the jury and stressed the importance of the jury’s hearing the petitioner’s testimony so that the jurors could assess her credibility in comparison to that of the other witnesses. Ouber, 293 F.3d at 22. When this testimony did not materialize, a large portion of the defense’s case was thus missing. Here, in contrast, and as the hearing justice found, the information to be gained from applicant’s promised testimony was furnished through other means, including applicant’s remorseful confession, testimony from other witnesses about applicant’s remorse, and his letters to the victim’s family detailing the events surrounding the crime, which reiterated his contrition. Further, unlike the attorney in Ouber, applicant’s attorney did not make repeated and emphatic promises, and also did not experience a belated epiphany that defendant should not take the stand. In stark contrast, Washington’s attorney persisted in advising him to forgo taking the stand because he believed it was not in his client’s best interest to do so. Moreover, the record cannot support a conclusion that Washington’s testimony would have had a reasonably probable effect on the outcome. Indeed, Washington himself said at the hearing for postconviction relief that his testimony at trial would have been given for the benefit of Ms. Carcieri’s family and would have included his request for the death penalty. After careful review of the record, we cannot say that the hearing justice neglected or misconceived the evidence. Therefore, it is our opinion that applicant failed to “‘demonstrate that counsel’s advice was not within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases’ * * *.” Rodrigues, 985 A.2d at 315 (quoting Moniz, 933 A.2d at 697). Accordingly, his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on the ground that his attorney broke his promise to the jury must fail. - 12 - 3 Alleged Refusal to Allow Applicant to Testify The applicant argues that his counsel also was constitutionally remiss because applicant’s “will and desire to testify was overborne” by his counsel. He argues that the hearing justice’s findings of fact regarding Washington’s attorney’s advice to him that he not testify in his defense “could reasonably be used to meet” the first part of the Strickland test, and, therefore, he claims that the hearing justice’s conclusion that he received effective assistance of counsel when he waived his right to testify at trial “was error or an abuse of discretion.” With respect to the second prong of the Strickland test, applicant contends that “his testimony was essential to the [j]ury’s understanding of his state of mind and his remorse, * * * which only he could present.” The hearing justice rejected applicant’s argument that his waiver of his right to testify was the product of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. In dispatching his argument, she found the applicant’s attorney “vigorously” and “zealously” represented applicant when he counseled him against taking the stand, advice which the hearing justice found that applicant accepted “voluntarily, intelligently, and knowingly.” After reviewing of the record and hearing testimony, the hearing justice found “no credible evidence” to support the argument that applicant’s “will to testify was overborne by counsel.” She also concluded that applicant had “fail[ed] to present evidence that the absence of his testimony prejudiced him at trial.” She found that if applicant had testified, he would not have offered beneficial testimony for his defense and his testimony would not have “produced a different outcome of the proceeding.” Therefore, the hearing justice concluded that Washington had failed to establish that he could overcome either prong of the Strickland test. - 13 - We agree with the hearing justice and are of the opinion that Washington has not shown that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when he took his attorney’s advice and waived his right to testify at trial. Washington argues that the facts here “are similar” to those in United States v. Teague, 953 F.2d 1525, 1534 (11th Cir. 1992), which held that, under the first prong of the Strickland standard, the “essence” of such a claim “is that the action or inaction of the attorney deprived the defendant of the ability to choose whether or not to testify in his own behalf.” After careful review of the record, we disagree with applicant and, like the hearing justice, hold that, as in Teague, 953 F.2d at 1535, the record here “reflects a voluntary waiver by the defendant of his right to testify.” In Teague, 953 F.2d at 1527, the defendant informed his attorney before trial that he wished to testify. His attorney determined that the defendant might encounter difficulty on the witness stand, but decided to “wait and see” whether it would be beneficial for the defendant to testify. Id. at 1528. After a witness gave conflicting testimony, the defendant pulled on his lawyer’s sleeve and inquired about when he could testify himself. Id. However, his attorney told him not to be concerned about the testimony, and the defense rested without the defendant’s testimony. Id. Prior to closing arguments, the defendant asked again when he would have the opportunity to testify. Id. His attorney told him that his testimony was not necessary. Id. Even after receiving a verdict, the defendant called his attorney at home and asked her when he could give his version of the events. Id. The Teague court analyzed the allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland’s two-part test. Teague, 953 F.2d at 1534. It held that “counsel’s performance was not constitutionally deficient” and thus the defendant had not satisfied the first prong of the test. Id. at 1535. The court reasoned that an attorney’s performance is not objectively reasonable if - 14 - the attorney either refuses to accept the defendant’s decision to testify or if the attorney does not inform the defendant of the right to testify. Id. at 1534. Viewing the argument from the perspective of defense counsel, the court concluded that the defendant’s attorney “believed that Teague had assented or acceded to her recommendation” that he refrain from taking the witness stand. Id. at 1535. Therefore, counsel had neither refused to accept her client’s decision to testify nor failed to inform him of his right to do so. Id. In the case before us, the record reveals that applicant’s attorney, like the attorney in Teague, did not refuse to accept his client’s desire to testify, nor did he fail to inform applicant of his right to testify. Indeed, as the hearing justice acknowledged, applicant’s attorney addressed applicant’s desire to testify in his opening statement to the jury. Accordingly, the hearing justice discredited applicant’s testimony that his attorney “always told him that he would not be allowed to take the stand, no matter what.” She noted that his attorney had requested a recess and conferred with Washington for thirty minutes before resting his case. Further, when applicant’s attorney informed the trial court of the defense’s decision to rest without presenting applicant as a witness, the attorney asked him on the record, “Is that correct, Jeffrey?” to which Washington replied, “Yes.” She concluded that “[i]t reasonably can be inferred * * * that defense counsel advised Mr. Washington during the conversation against testifying in response to the State’s case at trial and that Mr. Washington assented voluntarily” during the thirty-minute recess. Based on this evidence, and aware that applicant did not accuse his attorney of violating his right to testify until a year after his attorney’s death, the hearing justice found that applicant’s waiver of his right to testify was knowing and intelligent. Therefore, she ruled that applicant had not shown that his counsel’s actions in vigorously advising applicant to not testify were objectively unreasonable. After a review of the record, we cannot say that the hearing justice - 15 - neglected or misconceived the evidence when she made findings on the performance of applicant’s attorney. Therefore, we are of the opinion that the hearing justice did not err when she concluded that applicant voluntarily waived his right to testify, and that he received effective assistance of counsel. Because we are satisfied that applicant did not establish the first prong of the Strickland test on this issue, we need not discuss whether his defense was prejudiced by the absence of his live testimony before the jury, such that the outcome of the trial would have differed. B Waiver of Right to Testify Finally, applicant argues that the trial justice was required to conduct a hearing and a personal colloquy with him to ensure that his waiver of his right to testify was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. He asserts that the trial justice’s failure to do so amounts to reversible error. As the hearing justice acknowledged, this part of applicant’s postconviction-relief application was likely reviewable in his 1989 direct appeal to this Court, but the issue was not raised at that time. Although such issues may be deemed waived, we may consider them if they implicate constitutional considerations. See State v. Carvalho, 450 A.2d 1102, 1104, 1105 (R.I. 1982) (holding that under limited circumstances, an applicant “may seek postconviction review of alleged errors of basic constitutional proportions even though such issues were available for direct review,” such as when “novel constitutional issues that could not have been appreciated by counsel at the time the direct appeal was brought” are involved). Brennan v. Vose, 764 A.2d 168, 171-72 (R.I. 2001), clearly dispatches any tenable argument that the trial justice erred when he accepted the applicant’s waiver of his right to testify without conducting a colloquy with him to verify that his waiver was knowing, voluntary, and - 16 - intelligent. In Brennan, this Court declined “to adopt a rule providing for a sua sponte inquiry by the trial justice to insure that an applicant has made a knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to testify.” Id. at 171. Consequently, the hearing justice concluded that the trial justice did not err when he did not conduct “a sua sponte inquiry with the defendant regarding his waiver of his right to testify.” We concur with the hearing justice that, in accordance with Brennan, the trial justice was not required to conduct such a colloquy and his failure to do so does not constitute reversible error.

Second, Washington contends that his trial attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel because of his “broken promise to the jury” that defendant would testify in his own defense. Third, he raises still another argument of ineffective 4', 'The applicant also argued at his postconviction-relief hearing and before this Court that the state violated discovery rules by failing to disclose evidence that might demonstrate applicant’s diminished capacity, such as the analytical results from the contents of the bucket that applicant left in the victim’s basement around the time that he committed the crime. He further contended at a postconviction-relief hearing on his second application, as he does here, that approximately fifty pages of laboratory documentation were withheld from him during his trial. He alleges that that was the fault of either the FBI or the Rhode Island Attorney General. He also seeks to determine whether additional documentation exists. The hearing justice issued an order that denied those claims for postconviction relief “consistent with the court’s earlier 62-page written decision.” In her decision, the hearing justice ruled that the court could not decide the issue about these alleged discovery violations in accordance with Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963) because defendant failed to provide “any such evidence allegedly withheld by the State at trial.” “This Court affords great deference to a trial justice’s decision with respect to whether or not a violation of * * * Brady v. Maryland * * * has occurred, and it ‘will not disturb that ruling unless he or she has committed clear error.’” State v. Diefenderfer, 970 A.2d 12, 23 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. McManus, 941 A.2d 222, 229 (R.I. 2008)). In our view, the record supports the trial justice’s ruling that Washington did not prove a Brady violation and, therefore, her decision', '-4- assistance of counsel in which he asserts that his trial attorney refused to allow him to testify in his own defense. Finally, he argues that the trial justice committed reversible error when he did not conduct a hearing and colloquy with him to determine that applicant’s waiver of his right to testify was done knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily.', 'A', 'Ineffective Assistance of Counsel', '“This Court has adopted the standard announced by the United States Supreme Court in Strickland v. Washington, [466 U.S. 668 * * * (1984)] when generally reviewing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.” Rodrigues v. State, 985 A.2d 311, 315 (R.I. 2009) (quoting Powers v. State, 734 A.2d 508, 521-22 (R.I. 1999)). The Strickland standard requires this Court to review allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel by using a two-part test. Moniz, 933 A.2d at 696 (citing Burke v. State, 925 A.2d 890, 893 (R.I. 2007)).', '“First, the defendant must show that counsel’s performance was', 'deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so', 'serious that counsel was not functioning as the ‘counsel’', 'guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the', 'defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the', 'defense. This requires showing that counsel’s errors were so', 'serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose', 'result is reliable. Unless a defendant makes both showings, it', 'cannot be said that the conviction or death sentence resulted from a', 'breakdown in the adversary process that renders the result', 'unreliable.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687. Under the performance prong of the test, “the defendant must show that counsel’s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.” Id. at 688. Under the prejudice prong, the defendant must demonstrate that counsel’s objectively unreasonable performance caused a “reasonable probability that * * * the result of the proceeding would have been different.” Id. at was not clear error. Moreover, applicant repeatedly has conceded that the proper forum for these claims is in the federal court. He indicates that he will pursue those claims in that forum.', '-5- 694. The Court in Strickland cautioned, however, that “scrutiny of counsel’s performance must be highly deferential.” Id. at 689. Therefore, this Court “will reject an allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel ‘unless a defendant can demonstrate that counsel’s advice was not within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases’ * * *.” Rodrigues, 985 A.2d at 315 (quoting Moniz, 933 A.2d at 697 and Miguel v. State, 774 A.2d 19, 22 (R.I. 2001)).', '1', 'Diminished Capacity Defense', 'In his application for postconviction relief, applicant argued that his attorney furnished ineffective assistance when he failed to present a diminished-capacity defense at trial. He asserts that his attorney did not present evidence of his “inability to form a malicious intent, i.e. his diminished capacity.” Specifically, applicant contended in his application that his attorney neglected to introduce exculpatory evidence about his state of mind on the night of the crime. He urges that his counsel erred when he did not “pursue expert testimony and lab reports and the analysis of bucket contents that would have established that the defendant was under extreme emotional duress, or a drug induced hallucination, at the time of the incident and had very little capacity to conform his conduct to the law.” Moreover, he asserted that his attorney did not challenge the prosecution’s evidence, nor did he present testimony about his propensity to “blackout” when under the influence of drugs and alcohol.', 'The hearing justice rejected this argument. She found “that it was objectively reasonable for Mr. Washington’s defense counsel to [forgo] a defense of diminished capacity at trial given its uselessness in defending against charges of felony murder based on rape and the lesser included charge of rape.” The hearing justice explained that such a defense could not benefit defendant because felony murder is a general-intent crime that does not require the prosecution', '-6- to prove that defendant had the specific intent to commit murder and, therefore, diminished capacity is not available as a defense.', 'There was a substantial amount of physical evidence tying Washington to this crime including hair and fingerprint evidence. Additionally, the jury was presented with Washington’s confession and other correspondence between him and Ms. Carcieri’s family, in which he expressed his remorse. Further, there was a dearth of evidence in the record that the FBI had preserved or tested the contents of the bucket.', 'Therefore, the hearing justice found that Washington’s attorney’s decision not to present a diminished-capacity defense was an objectively reasonable tactical decision, and also “wise.” She did not afford any weight to applicant’s testimony at the postconviction relief hearing that he was prone to blackouts and that he suffered from one the night of the crime. Thus, the hearing justice concluded that Washington failed to satisfy the initial performance prong of the Strickland test with regard to his allegations that his attorney provided ineffective assistance.', 'In our view, Washington was provided with effective representation. It was objectively reasonable for counsel to decline to present a defense that would be unavailing with regard to the crime charged. This alone eviscerates applicant’s argument that his trial attorney’s performance was deficient under the first Strickland prong. The applicant was charged under G.L. 1956 § 11- 23-1 with the general-intent crime of felony murder.5 “General-intent crimes require only the ‘intention to make the bodily movement which constitutes the act which the crime requires,’ * * * whereas specific intent crimes most commonly involve the designation of ‘a specific mental element * * *.’” State v. Sivo, 925 A.2d 901, 914 (R.I. 2007) (quoting 1 LaFave, 5', 'General Laws 1965 § 11-23-1 provides that “[e]very murder * * * committed in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate, any * * * rape, any degree of sexual assault * * * is murder in the first degree.” Additionally, the crime of rape “has always been considered a', '-7- Substantive Criminal Law § 5.2(e) at 354, 355 (2d ed. 2003)). The crime of felony murder does not require “proof of the specific intent to kill or to cause great bodily harm.” State v. Amazeen, 526 A.2d 1268, 1271 (R.I. 1987). Under a diminished-capacity defense, a defendant submits that, although he is responsible for the prohibited act, “his mental capacity may have been diminished by intoxication, trauma, or mental disease so that he did not possess the specific mental state or intent essential to the particular offense charged.” State v. LaCroix, 911 A.2d 674, 679 (R.I. 2006) (quoting State v. Correra, 430 A.2d 1251, 1253 (R.I. 1981)). Accordingly, the defense is available only for crimes of specific intent. See id.; State v. Doyon, 416 A.2d 130, 134 (R.I. 1980) (“The availability of a diminished-capacity defense turns upon whether the offense in question requires proof of a specific intent.”) (citing United States v. Busic, 592 F.2d 13, 21 (2d Cir. 1978)).', 'Thus, Washington’s attorney’s decision not to present evidence that might establish that he suffered from a diminished capacity that prevented him from forming the specific intent to kill was sound.', '2', 'Promise to the Jury', 'The applicant next argues that his counsel was constitutionally deficient because he promised the jury during his opening statement that Washington would testify in his own defense, but because applicant ultimately waived his right to testify, the promise to the jury was left unfulfilled. This, he argues, prejudiced him to such an extent that a new trial is warranted. He contends that his attorney’s breach of this promise was objectively unreasonable and resulted in the violation of his constitutional right to testify. During his opening statement, Washington’s general-intent crime and has never been interpreted by this Court as requiring a mens rea.” State v. Yanez, 716 A.2d 759, 768 (R.I. 1998) (citing State v. Bryant, 670 A.2d 776, 783 (R.I. 1996)).', '-8- attorney informed the jury that Washington would “take the stand and he is going to tell you how he feels sorry for what he did” and also would relate what his state of mind was throughout the events leading up to and following the commission of the crime. After applicant decided not to testify, his attorney explained the apparent inconsistency to the jury during his closing statement. He said, “During my opening statement, I suggested to you that Jeffrey Washington would testify and tell you his state of mind, and you are probably wondering why he did not * * * he didn’t take the stand because he has already testified in this case * * *.” He then reminded the jury about Washington’s confession and letters to the victim’s family, which told his side of the story and indicated his remorse.', 'The hearing justice rejected Washington’s argument that his attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel as a result of his broken promise to the jury. She concluded that his attorney’s performance was not objectively unreasonable in that he did not actually break a promise to the jury. That was so, she reasoned, because applicant’s remorse and state of mind were presented to the jury through other means that did not expose applicant to a cross- examination that most likely would have been damaging to the defense. She also concluded that Washington had not established the second Strickland prong because “he has failed to demonstrate that his testimony likely would have made a difference in the outcome of his trial.”', 'In reaching her decision on this issue, the hearing justice distinguished this case from Ouber v. Guarino, 293 F.3d 19 (1st Cir. 2002). In Ouber, the petitioner went to trial three times on a drug-trafficking charge. Id. at 22. The first two trials, in which she testified in her own defense, resulted in deadlocked juries. Id. At the beginning of the third trial, her attorney made an opening statement in which he promised the jury four times that the petitioner would take the stand; throughout his opening, he stressed the importance of her testimony. Id. At the third trial,', '-9- however, unlike the previous two trials, the petitioner was not called as a witness, despite her attorney’s quadrupled pledge in his opening statement that she would take the stand. Id. at 23. The jury found the petitioner guilty. Id.', 'The Ouber court, in accordance with the Strickland standard, analyzed “the attorney’s initial decision to present the petitioner’s testimony as the centerpiece of the defense (and his serial announcement of that fact to the jury in his opening statement)” and juxtaposed it with his ultimate decision to advise the petitioner that she should not testify. Ouber, 293 F.3d at 27. As for the first prong, the court held “that the attorney’s performance was constitutionally deficient under Strickland--and severely so.” Id. at 32. The court reasoned that the performance was deficient because the attorney made an unjustified mid-trial decision to forgo presenting the petitioner as a witness and that there were no unforeseeable events that precipitated his “change of heart.” Id. at 29. Indeed, the same attorney had represented the petitioner in the previous two trials for the same offense. Id.', 'The court in that case also held that “but for” the attorney’s “egregious” error of repeatedly promising the petitioner’s testimony, which he himself characterized as important, and then failing to call the petitioner as a witness, “a different outcome might well have eventuated.” Ouber, 293 F.3d at 34. The court reasoned that “the only salient difference” between the first two trials and the third was the fact that the petitioner did not testify in the third trial, as she had in the first two. Id. at 35. The court characterized this contrast as a “prime example” of how the third trial “likely would have ended” had the petitioner taken the stand in fulfillment of her attorney’s assurances to the jury. Id.', 'Here, the hearing justice differentiated the broken promise of the petitioner’s testimony in Ouber from Washington’s attorney’s unfulfilled assurance of Washington’s testimony on several', '- 10 - grounds. Unlike Ouber, where the purpose of the petitioner’s testimony was to allow the jury to assess the “truth and veracity” and credibility of the petitioner in contrast to another witness, the stated purpose of Washington’s testimony was to inform the jurors of his remorse and state of mind. Ouber, 293 F.3d at 22. The hearing justice found that “[t]he testimony elicited by defense counsel, the evidence admitted at trial and counsel’s arguments * * * establish[ed] the defendant’s remorse and state of mind, as was promised to the jury.” Therefore, she found that the promise to the jury was not actually broken, but rather that its purpose was accomplished by other means.', 'Moreover, the hearing justice also distinguished the applicant’s attorney’s promise from that of the attorney in Ouber in that the attorney in Ouber changed his mind during the course of the trial, while applicant’s attorney did not. Ouber, 293 F.3d at 23. She found that applicant’s attorney “never wavered in his decision to advise Mr. Washington not to take the stand but, contrary to counsel’s advice, the defendant insisted on testifying in order to fulfill his promise to the family to tell them the truth about what had happened to Alice Carcieri.” Additionally, the attorney in Ouber reneged in the face of his personal experience in the two previous trials. Id. at 29. But here, the hearing justice found that “the evidence does not suggest that counsel could reasonably have expected or counted on a change of heart by the defendant about taking the stand.” Therefore, she ruled that neither prong of the Strickland test had been satisfied because the pledge to the jury was fulfilled (albeit not in the manner anticipated), applicant’s decision not to testify was unforeseeable at the outset of the trial, and, importantly, applicant “failed to demonstrate that his testimony likely would have made a difference in the outcome of his trial.”', 'We agree with the hearing justice’s analysis and, in our opinion, applicant received the benefit of effective representation. Although Ouber and the facts of this case seem similar at', '- 11 - first blush, upon closer examination, the Ouber case is readily distinguishable. The attorney in Ouber made repeated promises to the jury and stressed the importance of the jury’s hearing the petitioner’s testimony so that the jurors could assess her credibility in comparison to that of the other witnesses. Ouber, 293 F.3d at 22. When this testimony did not materialize, a large portion of the defense’s case was thus missing. Here, in contrast, and as the hearing justice found, the information to be gained from applicant’s promised testimony was furnished through other means, including applicant’s remorseful confession, testimony from other witnesses about applicant’s remorse, and his letters to the victim’s family detailing the events surrounding the crime, which reiterated his contrition.', 'Further, unlike the attorney in Ouber, applicant’s attorney did not make repeated and emphatic promises, and also did not experience a belated epiphany that defendant should not take the stand. In stark contrast, Washington’s attorney persisted in advising him to forgo taking the stand because he believed it was not in his client’s best interest to do so. Moreover, the record cannot support a conclusion that Washington’s testimony would have had a reasonably probable effect on the outcome.', 'Indeed, Washington himself said at the hearing for postconviction relief that his testimony at trial would have been given for the benefit of Ms. Carcieri’s family and would have included his request for the death penalty.', 'After careful review of the record, we cannot say that the hearing justice neglected or misconceived the evidence. Therefore, it is our opinion that applicant failed to “‘demonstrate that counsel’s advice was not within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases’ * * *.” Rodrigues, 985 A.2d at 315 (quoting Moniz, 933 A.2d at 697). Accordingly, his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on the ground that his attorney broke his promise to the jury must fail.', '- 12 -', '3', 'Alleged Refusal to Allow Applicant to Testify', 'The applicant argues that his counsel also was constitutionally remiss because applicant’s “will and desire to testify was overborne” by his counsel. He argues that the hearing justice’s findings of fact regarding Washington’s attorney’s advice to him that he not testify in his defense “could reasonably be used to meet” the first part of the Strickland test, and, therefore, he claims that the hearing justice’s conclusion that he received effective assistance of counsel when he waived his right to testify at trial “was error or an abuse of discretion.” With respect to the second prong of the Strickland test, applicant contends that “his testimony was essential to the [j]ury’s understanding of his state of mind and his remorse, * * * which only he could present.”', 'The hearing justice rejected applicant’s argument that his waiver of his right to testify was the product of his attorney’s ineffectiveness. In dispatching his argument, she found the applicant’s attorney “vigorously” and “zealously” represented applicant when he counseled him against taking the stand, advice which the hearing justice found that applicant accepted “voluntarily, intelligently, and knowingly.” After reviewing of the record and hearing testimony, the hearing justice found “no credible evidence” to support the argument that applicant’s “will to testify was overborne by counsel.” She also concluded that applicant had “fail[ed] to present evidence that the absence of his testimony prejudiced him at trial.” She found that if applicant had testified, he would not have offered beneficial testimony for his defense and his testimony would not have “produced a different outcome of the proceeding.” Therefore, the hearing justice concluded that Washington had failed to establish that he could overcome either prong of the Strickland test.', '- 13 -', 'We agree with the hearing justice and are of the opinion that Washington has not shown that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when he took his attorney’s advice and waived his right to testify at trial. Washington argues that the facts here “are similar” to those in United States v. Teague, 953 F.2d 1525, 1534 (11th Cir. 1992), which held that, under the first prong of the Strickland standard, the “essence” of such a claim “is that the action or inaction of the attorney deprived the defendant of the ability to choose whether or not to testify in his own behalf.” After careful review of the record, we disagree with applicant and, like the hearing justice, hold that, as in Teague, 953 F.2d at 1535, the record here “reflects a voluntary waiver by the defendant of his right to testify.”', 'In Teague, 953 F.2d at 1527, the defendant informed his attorney before trial that he wished to testify. His attorney determined that the defendant might encounter difficulty on the witness stand, but decided to “wait and see” whether it would be beneficial for the defendant to testify. Id. at 1528. After a witness gave conflicting testimony, the defendant pulled on his lawyer’s sleeve and inquired about when he could testify himself. Id. However, his attorney told him not to be concerned about the testimony, and the defense rested without the defendant’s testimony. Id. Prior to closing arguments, the defendant asked again when he would have the opportunity to testify. Id. His attorney told him that his testimony was not necessary. Id. Even after receiving a verdict, the defendant called his attorney at home and asked her when he could give his version of the events. Id.', 'The Teague court analyzed the allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland’s two-part test. Teague, 953 F.2d at 1534. It held that “counsel’s performance was not constitutionally deficient” and thus the defendant had not satisfied the first prong of the test. Id. at 1535. The court reasoned that an attorney’s performance is not objectively reasonable if', '- 14 - the attorney either refuses to accept the defendant’s decision to testify or if the attorney does not inform the defendant of the right to testify. Id. at 1534. Viewing the argument from the perspective of defense counsel, the court concluded that the defendant’s attorney “believed that Teague had assented or acceded to her recommendation” that he refrain from taking the witness stand. Id. at 1535. Therefore, counsel had neither refused to accept her client’s decision to testify nor failed to inform him of his right to do so. Id.', 'In the case before us, the record reveals that applicant’s attorney, like the attorney in Teague, did not refuse to accept his client’s desire to testify, nor did he fail to inform applicant of his right to testify. Indeed, as the hearing justice acknowledged, applicant’s attorney addressed applicant’s desire to testify in his opening statement to the jury. Accordingly, the hearing justice discredited applicant’s testimony that his attorney “always told him that he would not be allowed to take the stand, no matter what.” She noted that his attorney had requested a recess and conferred with Washington for thirty minutes before resting his case. Further, when applicant’s attorney informed the trial court of the defense’s decision to rest without presenting applicant as a witness, the attorney asked him on the record, “Is that correct, Jeffrey?” to which Washington replied, “Yes.” She concluded that “[i]t reasonably can be inferred * * * that defense counsel advised Mr. Washington during the conversation against testifying in response to the State’s case at trial and that Mr. Washington assented voluntarily” during the thirty-minute recess.', 'Based on this evidence, and aware that applicant did not accuse his attorney of violating his right to testify until a year after his attorney’s death, the hearing justice found that applicant’s waiver of his right to testify was knowing and intelligent. Therefore, she ruled that applicant had not shown that his counsel’s actions in vigorously advising applicant to not testify were objectively unreasonable. After a review of the record, we cannot say that the hearing justice', '- 15 - neglected or misconceived the evidence when she made findings on the performance of applicant’s attorney. Therefore, we are of the opinion that the hearing justice did not err when she concluded that applicant voluntarily waived his right to testify, and that he received effective assistance of counsel. Because we are satisfied that applicant did not establish the first prong of the Strickland test on this issue, we need not discuss whether his defense was prejudiced by the absence of his live testimony before the jury, such that the outcome of the trial would have differed.', 'B', 'Waiver of Right to Testify', 'Finally, applicant argues that the trial justice was required to conduct a hearing and a personal colloquy with him to ensure that his waiver of his right to testify was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. He asserts that the trial justice’s failure to do so amounts to reversible error.', 'As the hearing justice acknowledged, this part of applicant’s postconviction-relief application was likely reviewable in his 1989 direct appeal to this Court, but the issue was not raised at that time. Although such issues may be deemed waived, we may consider them if they implicate constitutional considerations. See State v. Carvalho, 450 A.2d 1102, 1104, 1105 (R.I. 1982) (holding that under limited circumstances, an applicant “may seek postconviction review of alleged errors of basic constitutional proportions even though such issues were available for direct review,” such as when “novel constitutional issues that could not have been appreciated by counsel at the time the direct appeal was brought” are involved).', 'Brennan v. Vose, 764 A.2d 168, 171-72 (R.I. 2001), clearly dispatches any tenable argument that the trial justice erred when he accepted the applicant’s waiver of his right to testify without conducting a colloquy with him to verify that his waiver was knowing, voluntary, and', '- 16 - intelligent. In Brennan, this Court declined “to adopt a rule providing for a sua sponte inquiry by the trial justice to insure that an applicant has made a knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to testify.” Id. at 171. Consequently, the hearing justice concluded that the trial justice did not err when he did not conduct “a sua sponte inquiry with the defendant regarding his waiver of his right to testify.” We concur with the hearing justice that, in accordance with Brennan, the trial justice was not required to conduct such a colloquy and his failure to do so does not constitute reversible error.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

The defendant, Scott Pemberton, appeals pro se from the Providence County Superior Court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff, Classic Entertainment & Sports, Inc. (Classic Entertainment).', 'This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the written and oral submissions of the parties, we are of the opinion that the appeal may be resolved without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'This case arose out of a dispute between Mr. Pemberton, a professional boxer, and the corporate entity that served as his promoter, Classic Entertainment.', 'In its Superior Court complaint, Classic Entertainment alleged that, on March 7, 2002, the parties entered into a', '-1- written contract, wherein they agreed that Classic Entertainment would have “the exclusive right to promote [defendant’s] professional boxing career for three (3) years.” Paragraph 6 of that contract provides that Classic Entertainment reserved the right to extend the contract for an additional three-year period if the company was able to successfully arrange for defendant to take part in any one of eight championship fights listed in the contract. Classic Entertainment’s complaint alleged that, on January 23, 2004, defendant fought in the North American Boxing Federation title fight—one of the eight events specifically listed in the contract. In its complaint, the plaintiff corporation further alleged that, as a result of the fact that it had secured defendant’s participation in that fight, the promotional contract was extended for an additional three-year period.', 'In its complaint, Classic Entertainment further alleged that, on September 15, 2005, Mr. Pemberton and Classic Entertainment entered into a written agreement with Gary Shaw Productions (GSP) with respect to a fight between defendant and Jeff Lacy for the International Boxing Federation Super Middleweight world title. In the complaint, Classic Entertainment alleged that, in the written agreement, GSP agreed to pay plaintiff one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000) “for the delivery of the services of Scott Pemberton * * * to fight Jeff Lacy * * *.” The plaintiff alleged that Classic Entertainment and Mr. Pemberton had orally agreed that Classic Entertainment was to retain twenty percent of Mr. Pemberton’s earnings from the Jeff Lacy fight.1 The plaintiff further alleged that, after the fight, “[p]ursuant to local boxing regulations,”2 GSP issued its check for $150,000 solely to the order of Scott Pemberton. Classic 1', 'A basic arithmetical calculation reveals that twenty percent of Mr. Pemberton’s $150,000 earnings would be $30,000. 2', 'According to the record, the fight in question took place in Nevada.', '-2- Entertainment alleged that it has received no portion of Mr. Pemberton’s $150,000 earnings from the Jeff Lacy fight.', 'Classic Entertainment commenced the instant action in the Providence County Superior Court on August 1, 2006.

62,"(PC 06-3900) Town of New Shoreham : v. : Coastal Resources Management Council. : Present: Suttell, C.J., Flaherty, Robinson, JJ., and Williams, C.J. (ret.) OPINION Justice Flaherty, for the Court. Block Island sits approximately twelve miles off the coast of Rhode Island. Sometimes referred to as the “Bermuda of the North,” it is a place of spectacular beauty. For generations, vacationers have flocked to the island during the short summer months to relax and enjoy the beaches and unspoiled vistas that nature has provided. Although the island is home to a small airport, the vast majority of visitors arrive by boat— including regular ferry service and private vessels. As is the case in many coastal communities, dock and mooring space can be at a premium. Champlin’s Realty Associates (Champlin’s) operates a large marina on Block Island serving the needs of boaters and their craft. Concerned that it lacked the space to meet its -1- business demands, Champlin’s filed an application to expand its operation to a substantial degree. The dispute over that proposed expansion, involving Champlin’s, the Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC or council), the Town of New Shoreham1 (town), and a number of intervening environmental groups, has finally wended its way to this Court. After carefully reviewing the record, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court in part, reverse in part, and remand to the Superior Court with instructions that it remand this matter to the CRMC for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. I Factual Background The CRMC is a state agency charged with protecting and regulating Rhode Island’s coastal resources. General Laws 1956 § 46-23-1(b)(1). Champlin’s Realty Associates, a Rhode Island corporation, filed an application with the CRMC to extend its existing marina 240 feet into the Great Salt Pond in the Town of New Shoreham to accommodate 140 additional boats. The proposed expansion included 2,990 feet of fixed pier and an additional 755 feet of floating docks. Under the proposal, the additional dockage would extend from the existing marina. The CRMC has the statutory authority to grant applications for such expansions of existing marinas. Section 46-23-6(4)(iii). The Town of New Shoreham and intervenors, the Block Island Land Trust, the Conservation Law Foundation, the Committee for the Great Salt Pond, and the Block Island Conservancy, opposed the application. When the CRMC receives a written objection to an application, the proceeding then becomes “contested” under the CRMC Management Procedures. The CRMC Management Procedures further provide that such contested cases be 1 New Shoreham is the only municipality on Block Island. -2- the subject of a public hearing before a “duly authorized and appointed Subcommittee.” 2 Pursuant to his authority and in accordance with the relevant CRMC Management Procedures, the CRMC chairman Michael Tikoian appointed a subcommittee composed of five members: Jerry Sahagian, Thomas Ricci, Gerald P. Zarrella, and Paul E. Lemont as chairman. 3 A Subcommittee Hearings The subcommittee held twenty-three public hearings over the course of two years from the time of Champlin’s application in 2003 until its final hearing on September 16, 2005. Extensive testimony and voluminous exhibits were received during the hearings, which reportedly were the longest and most exhaustive in CRMC history. The protracted hearings were rancorous and hotly disputed, not only among the parties but also among the subcommittee members. Subsequently, the four subcommittee members eligible to vote held a public workshop on October 24, 2005, to make findings of fact based on the evidence that had been presented to them, and to decide upon the recommendation that the subcommittee would make to the full CRMC. Subcommittee member Ricci commented during the public workshop that “clearly, this is an emotional, very difficult issue.” Subcommittee member Zarrella asserted at the public workshop: “I wish Mike Tikoian never put me on this committee, 23 meetings. * * * I don’t want to be here.” It was clear that tension arose in this case because of a conflict involving the implications of the marina expansion into the environmentally sensitive Great Salt 2 The CRMC is authorized to appoint a hearing officer, but the CRMC chairman is also authorized to designate a subcommittee to “act as hearing officers in any contested case” if the hearing officers “are otherwise engaged and unable to hear the matter in a timely fashion.” G.L. 1956 § 46-23-20.1(e). 3 Tikoian also appointed Senator Susan Sosnowski, but she did not participate in the subcommittee’s hearings or its recommendation. -3- Pond and the reality that dockage for watercraft is necessary for the general public to have access to the island. As chairman of the subcommittee, Lemont addressed those present at the workshop and praised “both sides” for their “outstanding presentation.” He noted that after looking at the evidence, “there is no right and there is no wrong. * * * We’re looking at what is the best fitted decision that will impact all of the concerns raised.” Lemont expressed his conclusion that “[t]here has to be compromise,” and he supported neither the grant of the full application nor its outright denial. He was not alone; during the public workshop, all four members of the subcommittee voiced their opinions against the full requested expansion in the application, and three members, Chairman Lemont excluded, indicated that they would support a middle ground of an expansion of 170 feet. Lemont stated at the public workshop that he would “not support anything more than 100 feet.” Sahagian expressed his wish that “the Town or the objectors did try to compromise a little bit more.” He went on to say that “what I am thinking right now is the Town at one point was at 100 feet, the applicant was at 240. [One-hundred and seventy feet] is in the middle.” Ricci commented, “I am not in favor of approving the application as it’s stated, for 240 feet. But, I also agree with my fellow subcommittee members, that I’m not in favor of denying the application outright.” He concluded that “[t]he applicant seeks 240 feet. They’re not going to get my recommendation for that or my vote for that.” Zarrella remarked that he “wished [the town] left that plan in there for 100 feet. It would have been a lot * * * easier if [they] left the plan there, but when they took it out at the public meeting, it’s been difficult for me.” He went on to say, “I can’t say no expansion. I can’t say it. The evidence is not there. The evidence is there for expansion. And, I can’t say 240 feet.” Further, Zarrella concluded that “I’m on the -4- page that the Chairman is, of a compromise, but I think [that] I’m on a page that I’m a little bit more -- I want to give a little bit more.” He lamented, “[the] Town’s hands are tied. The plans for 100 feet came in too late. As far as I was concerned, it should have come in earlier and I think you guys could have negotiated it out a long time ago.” On January 10, 2006, the subcommittee made forty-seven findings of fact and issued a recommendation with the three votes in favor of a scaled-down modification of the proposal to 170 feet, rather than 240 feet, and one vote, Lemont, against. B Full Council Hearing On February 28, 2006, the CRMC met in accordance with § 46-23-20.4(a) and the CRMC Management Procedures 5.3(2) and 5.3(3) to consider the record, evidence, and the subcommittee’s recommendation, as well as Champlin’s argument that the CRMC should adopt the recommendation. The CRMC is vested with the authority, in its discretion, to adopt, modify or reject the subcommittee recommendation, findings of fact, and conclusions of law if the rationale for doing so is provided in writing. Section 46-23-20.4(a). However, before it could take up the subcommittee recommendation, the CRMC first addressed Champlin’s previously filed motions to disqualify both Tikoian and member David Abedon from participating on the basis of public statements made by them after the vote of the subcommittee. After denying those motions, the CRMC proceeded to consider the subcommittee’s recommendation. The transcript reveals that the meeting, like the subcommittee proceedings that preceded it, was rife with tension. Ultimately, five members of the full council, including Zarrella, voted to approve the subcommittee’s recommendation, while five members, including Lemont and Tikoian, voted -5- against adoption. The resulting tie vote constituted a rejection of the recommendation. On July 5, 2006, the CRMC issued its written decision denying Champlin’s application. That same day, the five members who voted in favor of adopting the subcommittee’s recommendation released “Findings of Fact of the CRMC Members in Support of the Subcommittee Recommendation.” II Procedural Background A Administrative Appeal In the midst of an atmosphere of hostility and tension, an appeal to the Superior Court ensued. The Superior Court has jurisdiction to hear appeals from administrative agencies such as the CRMC under the Rhode Island Administrative Procedures Act, G.L. 1956 § 42-35-15. On March 23, 2006, Champlin’s filed a complaint in the Superior Court, in which it sought judicial review of the CRMC’s decision rejecting its application. 4 In count 1 of its complaint, Champlin’s asserted that when the CRMC rejected the subcommittee recommendation and denied its application for expansion the agency (1) affected Champlin’s substantial rights in violation of constitutional or statutory procedure; (2) acted in excess of its statutory authority; (3) made use of unlawful procedure; (4) made a decision that was affected by other error of law, and was arbitrary, capricious, and characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion. In count 2, Champlin’s alleged that the refusal to disqualify Tikoian and Abedon violated Champlin’s right to procedural and substantive due process under the Constitution and laws of Rhode Island, the Constitution of the United States, and the CRMC 4 The town also brought an administrative appeal from the failure of the CRMC to approve the Harbor Management Plan submitted in 1999. This appeal was consolidated with Champlin’s appeal. The trial justice dismissed the town’s appeal without prejudice on the grounds that the -6- management practices. In count 3, Champlin’s averred that Tikoian and Abedon should have recused themselves from considering Champlin’s application. As a remedy, Champlin’s requested that the Superior Court rule that the vote taken with Tikoian’s and Abedon’s participation was void and that it remand the matter to the CRMC with directions to approve the subcommittee’s recommendation and order Tikoian and Abedon to cease participation in proceedings regarding Champlin’s application. Also, after extensive evidentiary hearings before the Superior Court, Champlin’s moved to disqualify Tikoian, Lemont, and members Gray, Sullivan, Gomez, and Dawson from further participation in the application should it be remanded to the CRMC. Champlin’s also moved to disqualify the votes of Tikoian, Lemont, Gray, and Sullivan from the CRMC vote taken on February 28, 2006. B Evidentiary Hearing Pursuant to § 42-35-15(f), Champlin’s filed a motion requesting an evidentiary hearing before the trial justice to determine the existence of any procedural irregularities during the course of the CRMC proceedings. 5 The CRMC objected to the motion for an evidentiary hearing arguing, inter alia, that the evidentiary hearing inevitably would intrude on the mental processes of the agency members as they formulated their opinions, recommendations, and evaluations in violation of quasi-judicial immunity. Even though she granted the motion for an evidentiary hearing, the trial justice assured the parties that “I don’t expect to have council town did not have standing under G.L. 1956 § 42-35-15. This ruling has not been appealed to this Court. 5 Section 42-35-15(f) provides: “The review shall be conducted by the court without a jury and shall be confined to the record. In cases of alleged irregularities in procedure before the agency, not shown in the record, proof -7- members queried on their mental processes, their mental impressions. I will look at whether or not there were outside influences and improper influences that got in it, and those improper influences in and of themselves may or may not give rise to a court decision that they infected whatever determination that the council made.” As a result of the trial justice’s ruling, there followed sixteen hearings from March 19, 2007, until April 13, 2007. i Arnold Show-Cause Hearing Also, it is significant that on January 2, 2008, after the hearings before her were concluded and after this Court issued Arnold v. Lebel, 941 A.2d 813 (R.I. 2007), a case that proscribed ex parte contacts at the agency level, the trial justice issued a show-cause order that asked the parties to “show cause why Plaintiff’s appeal should not be granted” based on the likelihood that Arnold “prohibit[ed] the type of off the record communications” revealed by the evidentiary hearing. The show-cause hearing was held on January 23, 2008. At that hearing, the intervenors requested the opportunity to present evidence concerning the potential disqualification of subcommittee member Zarrella. The trial justice allowed the intervenors to proffer evidence supporting the disqualification of both Zarrella and Sahagian, as well as the propriety of reopening the evidentiary hearing. After considering the intervenors’ arguments, the trial justice permitted a limited hearing as to Zarrella. That hearing was held on April 9, 2008. ii Trial Court’s Findings The trial justice made extensive factual findings and credibility determinations regarding the testimony of the witnesses during the sixteen evidentiary hearings, the show-cause hearing, thereon may be taken in court. The court, upon request, shall hear oral argument and receive written briefs.” -8- and the hearing regarding Zarrella. The trial court concluded, based on the testimony, that the CRMC members “did not appreciate the quasi-judicial nature of their roles or the prohibition against ex parte communications.” Specifically, the trial justice found that Tikoian demonstrated his prejudgment of the application through numerous ex parte contacts. Similarly, the trial justice found that Lemont also revealed his preconceived opinion and resultant bias at the evidentiary hearings because of his comments about his unwavering support for a “compromise plan.” The trial justice also found that Zarrella “failed to appreciate the quasi-judicial nature of his role,” based on statements he made to town officials and his remarks before the full council. As a result, the trial justice found that due to their bias, Lemont and Zarrella should have been disqualified from participating in the workshop and that the two of them, as well as Tikoian, should not have taken part in the CRMC decision. The trial justice also found that Tikoian and Lemont wrongfully collaborated to produce a compromise plan after the subcommittee hearings were completed and that they “made no secret” about their opposition to the application as filed. She found that Lemont requested that Grover Fugate, executive director of the CRMC, create an alternate plan and that Fugate in turn had asked Dan Goulet, a staff engineer, to prepare this plan. The resultant plan, the “Goulet plan,” proposed a compromise of sorts that would extend the marina by 100 feet to the west. Goulet testified at the evidentiary hearing that he reviewed information that was not included in the record of the subcommittee proceedings when he created the alternate plan. As a result, the parties and intervenors were deprived of the opportunity to cross-examine Goulet about the alternate plan during the CRMC proceedings. The trial justice further found that Tikoian “lobbied” the members of the subcommittee to support the Goulet plan through informal meetings at a member’s workplace, at Tikoian’s home, -9- and through telephone calls. Zarrella testified that he, Sahagian, and Ricci were angered by the telephone calls that they received the night before the workshop, which the trial justice inferred were from Tikoian or Lemont. Furthermore, Zarrella, Sahagian, and Ricci objected to the introduction of slides depicting the merits of the Goulet plan and were so incensed that they threatened to walk out of the workshop. As a result, Goulet did not present the slides. The trial justice, however, found that Lemont then took it upon himself “to advocate[] a compromise that was clearly based upon the Goulet plan” because Lemont also “suggested a 100-foot seawall [sic] plan and spoke of expansion to the west.” In finding that Lemont had prejudged the case and become an advocate in favor of what he termed “a compromise,” the trial justice cited Lemont’s testimony at the evidentiary hearing that “I came up with a compromise that I thought would solve the problem, and that’s what I wanted to do. I was chairman of the subcommittee. I had heard the testimony. I had heard the comments of the subcommittee. * * * And I came up with a conclusion that perhaps there might be a compromise that would settle this matter.” The trial justice also made several credibility determinations with regard to testimony about certain comments Tikoian had made expressing his disappointment in the subcommittee recommendation that were published in the Providence Journal and the Block Island Times, as well as Tikoian’s interactions with Governor Carcieri and his staff. The trial justice found that Tikoian had “expressed how he intended to vote” at the CRMC meeting to reporter Peter Lord of the Providence Journal. Additionally, the trial justice found that Tikoian informed the Governor that he predicted a tie vote. Based on these findings, the trial justice held that Champlin’s substantial rights had been prejudiced by consideration of the Goulet plan. Further, the court held that the CRMC decision was made upon unlawful procedure and in excess of the CRMC’s statutory authority. - 10 - Additionally, the trial justice found that Champlin’s substantial and constitutional rights were violated when Tikoian and Lemont voted on the application, despite what she found to be their demonstrated bias against it. iii Remedy Section 42-35-15(g) provides that the trial court “may affirm the decision of the [CRMC] or remand the case for further proceedings, or it may reverse or modify the decision * * *.” The trial justice considered it within her discretion to decide on the appropriate remedy. She declined to remand the case to the CRMC for further proceedings because it was her understanding that the General Assembly would be required to pass legislation to implement our advisory opinion entitled In re Request for Advisory Opinion from the House of Representatives (Coastal Resources Management Council), 961 A.2d 930 (R.I. 2008). We advised in that opinion that proposed legislation permitting lawmakers to sit as members of the CRMC, and allowing the General Assembly to make appointments to the agency, was unconstitutional in light of the separation-of-powers amendments to the Rhode Island Constitution. Id. at 940-41. The trial justice expressed concern that any progress on remand would be delayed by the appointment and confirmation process necessary to create a viable CRMC to hear the matter. Thus, the trial justice was “not inclined to remand this case” because it would result in further delay in Champlin’s efforts to obtain a decision on its application. Rather, in reliance on Acierno v. Folsom, 337 A.2d 309, 317 (Del. 1975), the trial justice simply subtracted the votes of the three disqualified members from the five to five tie vote rendered at the CRMC full council meeting. 6 Accordingly, the trial justice refigured the final 6 The trial justice subtracted the votes of Tikoian, Lemont, and Zarrella. - 11 - vote to four to three in favor of adopting the subcommittee recommendation. She found that the twenty-three subcommittee hearings were unchallenged as to their fairness and that they were untainted by the participation of Zarrella and Lemont. Additionally, the trial justice found that the subcommittee’s recommendation was supported by the record amassed at the twenty-three subcommittee hearings. Ultimately, she “[upheld] the decision of the full Council members supporting the Subcommittee Recommendation” because it was “supported by the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence of record.” 7 The CRMC, Tikoian, and intervenors, the Conservation Law Foundation, the Committee for Great Salt Pond, the Town of New Shoreham, the Block Island Land Trust, and the Block Island Conservancy (petitioners), sought review of the Superior Court’s decision by petition for certiorari on April 20, 2009, which we granted. 8 III Standard of Review The Rhode Island Administrative Procedure Act (RIAPA) chapter 35 of title 42 governs the Superior Court’s review of an administrative appeal. Section 42-35-15(g) of the RIAPA sets forth that: “The court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact. The court may affirm the decision of the agency or remand the case for further proceedings, or it may reverse or modify the decision if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are: “(1) In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; “(2) In excess of the statutory authority of the agency; “(3) Made upon unlawful procedure; “(4) Affected by other error or law; 7 On more than one occasion, the trial justice incorrectly referred to the subcommittee recommendation as a decision. 8 We thank the Nature Conservancy for its amicus curiae brief. - 12 - “(5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record; or “(6) Arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.” The RIAPA also limits this Court’s review of the Superior Court’s judgment in administrative proceedings. Section 42-35-16 (“Review by the [S]upreme [C]ourt”). In conducting such a review, we are restricted to questions of law, which we review de novo. Rossi v. Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island, 895 A.2d 106, 110 (R.I. 2006) (citing Johnston Ambulatory Surgical Associates, Ltd. v. Nolan, 755 A.2d 799, 805 (R.I. 2000)). The factual findings of the administrative agency are entitled to great deference. Id. (citing In re Advisory Opinion to the Governor, 732 A.2d 55, 60 (R.I. 1999)). However, when the review of the trial court’s decision is conducted under a writ of certiorari, as it is here, “this [C]ourt applies the ‘some’ or ‘any’ evidence test and reviews the record to determine whether legally competent evidence exists to support the findings.” Sartor v. Coastal Resources Management Council, 542 A.2d 1077, 1082-83 (R.I. 1988). IV Analysis A Standing As an initial matter, we will address Champlin’s argument that the CRMC, Tikoian, and the intervenors are not aggrieved parties within the meaning of § 42-35-16, the section of the RIAPA that establishes the requirements for petitioning for a writ of certiorari in this Court after a review of an agency decision by the Superior, Family, or District Court. Specifically, § 42-35- 16 requires the petitioner to be “aggrieved by a final judgment of the [S]uperior, [F]amily, or - 13 - [D]istrict [C]ourt.” We are of the opinion that Tikoian, the CRMC, and the intervenors are all aggrieved parties within the statute and, therefore, properly are before this Court. We do not agree with Champlin’s argument that the intervenors are not aggrieved because they have not alleged an environmental injury in fact. The clear language of § 42-35-16 is that the petitioners must establish that they are aggrieved by “a final judgment.” Champlin’s relies on cases defining the aggrievement requirements for a party seeking judicial review of an agency decision under § 42-35-15(a), which requires the party to be “aggrieved by a final order in a contested case.” East Greenwich Yacht Club v. Coastal Resources Management Council, 118 R.I. 559, 564, 376 A.2d 682, 684-85 (1977); see also Blackstone Valley Chamber of Commerce v. Public Utilities Commission, 452 A.2d 931, 933 n.3, 934 (R.I. 1982) (holding petitioner did not have standing because petitioner was not aggrieved by commission’s order). However, it was Champlin’s, and not the intervenors, which sought relief under § 42-35-15. Champlin’s took advantage of that statutory path of review when it appealed to the Superior Court. The court’s substitution of the CRMC decision with the subcommittee recommendation left the intervenors with no avenue of review except through the discretionary writ of certiorari. Therefore, in our view, the intervernors are aggrieved by the Superior Court’s final judgment and properly before this Court. B Evidentiary Hearing The CRMC and Tikoian argue that the Superior Court erred when it granted the evidentiary hearing and that the hearing inevitably delved into the mental processes of the agency members who testified—testimony that the trial justice relied upon in her decision. Conversely, Champlin’s argues that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion in conducting - 14 - the evidentiary hearing and it further contends that the trial justice did not rely on any of the members’ deliberative processes when she made her decision. We are of the opinion that the trial justice did not err when she granted the evidentiary hearing. Pursuant to § 42-35-15(f), in the event of “alleged irregularities in procedure before the agency, not shown in the record, proof thereon may be taken in the court.” Standing alone, allegations of impropriety with respect to the off-the-record Goulet plan are sufficient to support the trial justice’s election to hold an evidentiary hearing to determine whether procedural irregularities occurred at the agency hearings. The trial justice did not abuse her discretion in granting the hearing even in the face of the possibility that the mental processes of the agency members might be divulged during the hearing. Indeed, prior to the evidentiary hearing, the parties discussed at length the danger that the hearing inevitably would delve into the agency members’ mental processes. The trial justice vigorously assured the parties that the hearing would not intrude on the members’ mental processes. Additionally, it is well settled that “a trial justice, unlike a jury, can disregard prejudicial material if and when he or she determines that material to be inadmissible.” State v. Notarantonio, 622 A.2d 457, 458 (R.I. 1993). The trial justice promised that she would “run a tight ship,” and she warned the attorneys that her ability to disregard such information did not give them free rein to make such impermissible inquiries. C Quasi-Judicial Immunity The problem here, as we see it, is that even though the trial justice properly recognized the dangers inherent in this type of hearing, she repeatedly disregarded her own ground rules. The petitioners argue that quasi-judicial officers, like judges, should not be called upon to testify - 15 - about their mental processes in coming to their decisions. 9 In contrast, Champlin’s urges that this issue is a “red herring” because the trial justice did not rely on the agency members’ mental processes when she made her decision. After careful review of the transcripts, it is our opinion that the quasi-judicial immunity of the CRMC members repeatedly was violated over objection by the CRMC. The quasi-judicial nature of the CRMC gives rise to certain protections, akin to those enjoyed by the judiciary, to preserve the integrity of adjudication and final judgment. See In re Request for Advisory Opinion (CRMC), 961 A.2d at 940 (“the CRMC combines functions that must properly be characterized as executive with functions that are * * * quasi-judicial in nature”); Richardson v. Rhode Island Department of Education, 947 A.2d 253, 258 (R.I. 2008). One such protection is immunity from testifying about the judicial or quasi-judicial officer’s mental process in evaluating the evidence and reaching a decision. The United States Supreme Court has held that because a judge could not be subjected to similar inquiry it was improper to question the Secretary of Agriculture at trial and at a deposition with respect to how he considered the evidence before him in his rate-setting responsibilities. United States v. Morgan, 313 U.S. 409, 420-22 (1941). Likewise, the administrative decision makers at the CRMC cannot and should not have been questioned about their mental process in making recommendations to the full council or participating in decision making. See id.; see also Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railway Co. v. Babcock, 204 U.S. 585, 593 (1907) (analogizing state tax assessment board members’ testimony concerning “operation of * * * minds” to prohibition against allowing jury members to testify as to “the motives and 9 Tikoian petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari to review the trial justice’s order granting the evidentiary hearing and the denial of his motion in limine seeking to disallow questioning of all agency members. This Court denied the petition. Champlin’s Realty Associates v. Tikoian, No. 2007-57-M.P. (R.I., filed Mar. 8, 2007) (mem.). - 16 - influences that led to their verdict”). “Only factual matters not reaching the examiner’s bases, reasons, mental processes, analyses or conclusions are fair subjects for inquiry.” Green v. Rich Iron Co., 944 F.2d 852, 854 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (internal quotation marks omitted). This Court has to date recognized quasi-judicial immunity only in terms of immunity from suit. See Richardson, 947 A.2d at 257; Estate of Sherman v. Almeida, 747 A.2d 470, 474 (R.I. 2000); Psilopoulos v. State, 636 A.2d 727, 728 (R.I. 1994) (“a quasi-judicial determination made in good faith * * * would be entitled to immunity on the part of the agents as well as the sovereign entity that employed them”); Calhoun v. City of Providence, 120 R.I. 619, 631, 390 A.2d 350, 356 (1978) (“Certain types of activities, as for example judicial decision-making * * * must be engaged in by these officials freely, independently, and untrammeled by the possibilities of personal liability.”). In our view, however, agency adjudicators also are cloaked with immunity from rendering testimony about their mental processes in reaching decisions just as judicial officers are—lest the compulsion of the testimony of agency adjudicators about their mental process become a favored litigation technique. Five agency members were called to testify at the evidentiary hearing. Although the trial justice assured the parties on the record prior to the evidentiary hearing that mental processes would be off-limits in their questioning, she did not consistently adhere to this crucial pledge. For example, Tikoian testified that “My compromise thinking process at that time was that this was a big project. It’d be best if the town and applicant could work something out or whoever could work it out for you as the authoritative body so it was my thought process you try to work out a compromise and we’ll make life easier for all of us. That was my thought process.” He also testified, - 17 - “There [were] math errors on that recommendation. There were navigational issues with respect to that recommendation, and as a chairperson, burden of proof, your Honor, based on our rules is what the applicant has to display, technically the minimum impact to the environment. * * * In my mind, that burden of proof wasn’t displayed.” Lemont testified that “when we started the hearings, we were at two ends of a pole. There was one group looking for no expansion whatsoever and another looking for 240 feet. When I heard 100 feet, some bells went off and said well, Block Island can live with something.” The following exchange took place during Sahagian’s testimony: “Q: You felt that the Goulet alternative was way off base in size and scope, right? “A: Compared to the evidence and testimony through 23 [hearings], yes. “Q: So you disagreed with it, right? That was your problem with the Goulet plan, you didn’t like the outcome, right? “A: I would disagree. They didn’t have the guts to show it in public. “* * * “Q: You objected because you felt you wanted more than 100 feet? “[COUNSEL]: Objection. “THE COURT: Excuse me -- “A: No. “THE COURT: The answer may stand.” The trial justice improperly allowed this testimony into the record. Accordingly, we will not consider it. The inclusion of and reliance on the mental processes of agency members also is of material significance in our discussion, infra, of the trial justice’s disqualification of Lemont on the basis of her finding of bias. - 18 - D Ex Parte Contacts This Court’s opinion in Arnold reinforced the parameters of § 42-35-13 10 of the RIAPA prohibiting agency hearing officers from engaging in ex parte contacts. In Arnold, we stressed that “no litigious facts should reach the decision maker off the record in an administrative hearing.” Arnold, 941 A.2d at 821. Thus, under § 42-35-9(e) and § 42-35-10(4), if the decision maker “intends to consult any documentary source or person concerning facts or opinions about the merits of an appeal,” he or she must notify the parties so that they may “contest any such evidence” and “cross-examine any people consulted.” Arnold, 941 A.2d at 821. This prohibition extends to the decision maker’s communications with agency staff members, although communication regarding general matters is permissible. Id. Goulet Plan It is clear to us—and the petitioners do not dispute—that Lemont’s and Tikoian’s communications with the CRMC staff members about the Goulet plan and the plan itself represent ex parte contacts under our holding in Arnold. The Goulet plan is an ex parte contact under § 42-35-13 because Lemont, a decision maker, consulted the director of the CRMC, 10 Section 42-35-13 provides: “Unless required for the disposition of ex parte matters authorized by law, members or employees of an agency assigned to render an order or to make findings of fact and conclusions of law in a contested case shall not, directly or indirectly, in connection with any issue of fact, communicate with any person or party, nor, in connection with any issue of law, with any party or his or her representative, except upon notice and opportunity for all parties to participate; but any agency member: “(1) May communicate with other members of the agency, and “(2) May have the aid and advice of one or more personal assistants.” - 19 - Fugate, about facts concerning the merits of an appeal, specifically, whether another feasible plan might be conceived. See Arnold, 941 A.2d at 821. Fugate, in turn, requested that Goulet create such an alternate plan. Thus, as the trial justice ruled, the Goulet plan clearly falls within the ambit of our holding in Arnold, and it should have been included in the administrative record and subject to cross-examination. See id. Tikoian’s Contact with the Governor and His Staff Similarly, we decline to disturb the trial justice’s finding that Tikoian’s contacts with Governor Carcieri and his staff also constituted impermissible ex parte contacts within § 42-35- 13 as interpreted by this Court in Arnold. The petitioners concede that Tikoian’s presence in the Governor’s office during the presentation by the CRMC staff may be considered an ex parte contact under Arnold. However, they maintain that the communications between Tikoian and the Governor’s office pertained solely to procedure, and thus those contacts do not come within the purview of § 42-35-13. The trial justice, after hearing testimony from her ring-side seat at the evidentiary hearing, “reject[ed] [Governor’s aide Mark] Adelman’s effort to back away from” his statement that Tikoian predicted a tie vote.11 Further, the trial court also found that Tikoian “also wanted to obtain the Governor’s input and approval of the course he was taking.” Adelman testified that “the Governor did indicate at that meeting that the alternative plan * * * was a better option than the full plan.” Thus, Tikoian, as a decision maker on the CRMC, sought an off-the-record opinion from a third party about the merits of the application when he took the initiative to engage the Governor and determine the Governor’s feelings about the pending application. But, 11 Mark Adelman was a policy analyst in Governor Carcieri’s office assigned to advise the Governor with regard to the CRMC and Champlin’s application. He communicated with Tikoian about Champlin’s application. - 20 - the parties were not notified of this consultation and it never became part of the record. Therefore, the Governor’s opinion reached the decision maker off the record in violation of Arnold’s interpretation of § 42-35-13. Remedy for Ex Parte Contacts The trial justice correctly noted that although Arnold “clarified illicit ex parte communications in the administrative context in Rhode Island, it did not provide a specific remedy for such improper contact.” The petitioners submit that the trial justice erred because she did not remand the matter to the CRMC. They argue that the trial court misinterpreted the impact of In re Request for Advisory Opinion (CRMC), on the ability of the CRMC to expeditiously hear the matter on remand. They further argue that the failure to remand to the agency deprives the petitioners, including the intervenors, of an appeal as of right to the Superior Court from the CRMC decision and restricts them to seeking the discretionary writ of certiorari from this Court. This, they say, is a violation of their right to due process. Champlin’s submits that the trial justice did not err in declining to remand to the CRMC because the decision whether to remand the matter to the CRMC was within her discretion, and remand was neither required nor feasible. In our opinion, the trial justice erred when she simply subtracted the votes of the members that she held to be biased and when she elevated the subcommittee recommendation to become, in effect, a final decision of the CRMC, because the recommendation was untainted by the Goulet plan. We hold, especially in light of our decision in Arnold, that the only appropriate remedy here is remand to the agency for supplementation of the record with the ex parte communications to be included to allow the parties to appropriately respond and cross-examine. See Arnold, 941 A.2d at 821. - 21 - Under Arnold, Lemont’s contacts with Fugate and Goulet may have been proper had he notified the parties of his intention to seek out an alternate plan, disclosed the request and the resultant plan on the record, and invited the parties to contest the evidence contained in the plan and to cross-examine Goulet concerning his findings. See Arnold, 941 A.2d at 821. But here, the parties were not afforded the opportunity to contest the Goulet plan. Indeed, the Goulet plan was not created until all the evidence had been submitted to the subcommittee and the hearings were concluded. Thus, the Goulet plan represents the very type of “secret evidence” proscribed in Arnold, and the Superior Court should have remanded the matter to the CRMC for supplementation of the record. See Arnold, 941 A.2d at 822. It is the petitioners’ position that the CRMC is constitutionally sound and “able to act.” The parties agreed that, at the time of oral argument before this Court, the CRMC was composed of eight members, all of whom were gubernatorial appointees. In In re Request for Advisory Opinion, this Court advised that, in light of the 2004 separation-of-powers amendments to the Rhode Island Constitution and the CRMC’s exercise of executive power, it was unconstitutional for members of the General Assembly to serve on the council or for the General Assembly to appoint the CRMC members. In re Request for Advisory Opinion (CRMC), 961 A.2d at 933, 941-42. Rather, it is the Governor who has the constitutional authority to appoint CRMC members with the advice and consent of the Senate. Id. at 942. Although the trial justice noted that we acknowledged the de facto validity of the CRMC’s acts since the 2004 amendments, she incorrectly concluded that legislation was required to “accommodate” this Court’s advisory opinion when she declined to remand the matter to the agency. The trial justice was also concerned about further delays that would be occasioned by the legislative process and gubernatorial appointments. Although it is unfortunate that this litigation - 22 - has been stewing for nearly seven years, both parties have contributed to its longevity. Given the serious environmental impact on the Great Salt Pond that the expansion of the marina may engender, a decision on Champlin’s application cannot be made lightly. Thus, we do not accept the Superior Court’s analogy to Sakonnet Rogers, Inc. v. Coastal Resources Management Council, 536 A.2d 893, 897 (R.I. 1988), in which this Court reversed a CRMC decision because of the CRMC’s failure to base its decision on any of the required criteria and declined to remand to the agency in light of the seven years that had elapsed since the application was filed. The issue in Sakonnet revolved around an application for alteration of a shoreline in connection with the relocation of a single small cottage to an empty lot. Id. at 894. There is simply no comparison between the discrete facts in that case and the situation currently before us, to say nothing of the major environmental considerations before the CRMC in this application to expand a substantial marina into an ecologically sensitive coastal feature. Therefore, this Court holds that the trial justice erred as a matter of law in not remanding the case to the CRMC to supplement the record with the Goulet plan and to allow the parties to respond and cross-examine. E Trial Court’s Finding of Bias A finding of bias is a finding of fact. Kelley v. City Council of Cranston, 61 R.I. 472, 484, 1 A.2d 185, 190 (1938). Therefore, we afford great deference to the trial justice’s finding that Tikoian, Lemont, and Zarrella were biased and will overturn her findings of bias only if they are not supported by legally competent evidence. See Sartor, 542 A.2d at 1082-83. When an administrative agency carries out a quasi-judicial function, it has an obligation of impartiality on par with that of judges. See Town of Richmond v. Wawaloam Reservation, - 23 - Inc., 850 A.2d 924, 933 (R.I. 2004). Under the Fourteenth Amendment, administrative tribunals must not be “biased or otherwise indisposed from rendering a fair and impartial decision.” Davis v. Wood, 444 A.2d 190, 192 (R.I. 1982); see also Marshall v. Jerrico, Inc., 446 U.S. 238, 242 (1980) (“The Due Process Clause entitles a person to an impartial and disinterested tribunal * * *.”). At the same time, as the trial justice noted, adjudicators in administrative agencies enjoy a “presumption of honesty and integrity.” Davis, 444 A.2d at 192. This presumption may be overcome through evidence that “the same person(s) involved in building one party’s adversarial case is also adjudicating the determinative issues” or if “other special circumstances render the risk of unfairness intolerably high.” Kent County Water Authority v. State (Department of Health), 723 A.2d 1132, 1137 (R.I. 1999) (citing La Petite Auberge, Inc. v. Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights, 419 A.2d 274, 285 (R.I. 1980)). Significantly, an agency adjudicator must not become an “advocate or participant.” Davis v. Wood, 427 A.2d 332, 337 (R.I. 1981). To maintain public confidence in the fairness of the agency’s decision making, an agency adjudicator also must not prejudge a matter before the agency. See Barbara Realty Co. v. Zoning Board of Review of Cranston, 85 R.I. 152, 156, 128 A.2d 342, 344 (1957). This Court has held that a judge must recuse himself or herself when the judge possesses “a ‘personal bias or prejudice by reason of a preconceived and settled opinion of a character calculated to impair his [or her] impartiality seriously and sway his [or her] judgment.’” Ryan v. Roman Catholic Bishop of Providence, 941 A.2d 174, 185 (R.I.), cert. denied, 129 S.Ct. 422 (2008) (quoting Kelley v. Rhode Island Public Transit Authority, 740 A.2d 1243, 1246 (R.I. 1999)). It is important to note that engaging in ex parte contacts alone does not automatically render a decision maker biased. See Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization v. Federal - 24 - Labor Relations Authority, 685 F.2d 547, 573 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (PATCO). Moreover, the term “ex parte contact” has more than one meaning in the context of this case. 12 In concert with other conduct, however, an agency adjudicator’s ex parte contacts may support a finding of bias. See Eacret v. Bonner County, 86 P.3d 494, 500 (Idaho 2004) (citing Barbara Realty Co., 85 R.I. at 156, 128 A.2d at 344) (characterizing agency adjudicator’s prejudgment of proceeding, as evidenced through public statements along with the same adjudicator’s ex parte communications, as a “cause for concern” and as factually similar to Barbara Realty). As the trial justice correctly stated, Rhode Island’s “standard for disqualification based on bias or prejudice is well-settled.” We are satisfied that the trial justice’s factual findings of bias with respect to Tikoian and Zarrella are supported by legally competent evidence. Michael Tikoian The petitioners all maintain that Tikoian’s contacts with subcommittee members should not be considered ex parte. In addition, the intervenors maintain that those contacts with the Governor and his staff and the statements to the media should not be considered ex parte communications. Also, the CRMC and Tikoian further contend that, even if the communications with the Governor and his staff and his statements to the media are ex parte contacts, they do not support a finding of bias. Not surprisingly, Champlin’s argues that the trial justice had a “sufficient evidentiary basis” to disqualify Tikoian. The trial justice relied on several of what she found to be contraventions of Tikoian’s “role as an agency adjudicator” in concluding that he was biased. First, the trial justice cited 12 An ex parte contact such as was present in Arnold v. Lebel, 941 A.2d 813 (R.I. 2007) may be completely free of any bias, partiality, or prejudgment on behalf of an agency adjudicator who seeks the off-the-record information. These are not ex parte contacts in the traditional sense of the term, that is, an adjudicator’s off-the-record communication with an interested individual. Therefore, the meaning “ex parte” in the context of the bias analysis is distinct from the meaning used in the Arnold analysis. - 25 - Tikoian’s communication with various subcommittee members wherein he promised a “compromise plan” and his subsequent efforts to “lobby” them to support the ultimate Goulet plan. This, she found, violated the statutory prohibition against ex parte contacts with the subcommittee members. The trial justice noted that Tikoian’s attempt to exert influence over the subcommittee went to the extent of threatening one member that he would not be reappointed to his seat on the CRMC if he did not support the Goulet plan. Second, the trial justice relied on Tikoian’s contact with the Governor’s office as evidence that he had “abandoned his role as an impartial adjudicator.” Third, the trial justice pointed to Tikoian’s communications with reporters as an indication of the “degree of his prejudgment.” The trial justice thus found that these contacts, “in the aggregate,” established Tikoian’s bias and necessitated his disqualification. Mindful of our standard of review, we hold that the trial justice’s finding that Tikoian was biased is supported by legally competent evidence. Importantly, the bases for her finding of Tikoian’s bias and resultant disqualification related to his specific actions and not to his mental processes as an agency adjudicator. She found that he settled on a desired outcome long before the full council hearing and that he worked tirelessly to advance it. The trial justice concluded that Tikoian’s efforts to sway the subcommittee and the full CRMC, his statements to the press, and his attempt to divine the position of the Governor’s office, all evinced “‘a preconceived or settled opinion.’” See Ryan, 941 A.2d at 185. She also ruled that he improperly advocated against the grant of Champlin’s application by making no secret to his colleagues or the local media of his support for an alternative plan and his disdain for Champlin’s proposed expansion. See Davis, 427 A.2d at 337. Thus, she held that Tikoian publicly prejudged Champlin’s application and that he was incapable of fulfilling the role of “an impartial trier of fact.” See id. - 26 - In doing so, she made extensive credibility determinations during the evidentiary hearing, to which we defer, and, which we decline to disturb on appeal. Champlin’s is entitled under the guarantees of due process to feel confident that an impartial administrative tribunal is conscientiously considering its application on the basis of “its own circumstances.” See id. It is not our intent to discourage healthy debate among members of a quasi-judicial board. We do, however, accept the trial justice’s holding that Tikoian crossed the line in advocating for one position over another. Further, we recognize that carrying out the functions of state government requires cooperation and the exchange of ideas. The Governor and his staff have an understandable interest in staying abreast of the progress of a high profile matter affecting Rhode Island. However, we are also of the opinion that staying current on important issues moving through agency proceedings can and must be done without engaging in undisclosed ex parte contacts. Particularly in light of the fact that Tikoian was the chairman of the CRMC, it is “in keeping with the high canons of justice and fair play if he is disqualified.” Barbara Realty Co., 85 R.I. at 157, 128 A.2d at 344. We affirm the trial justice’s finding that Tikoian’s bias warranted his disqualification from participation with regard to Champlin’s application. Gerald Zarrella We also hold that the trial justice was not clearly wrong in her finding that Zarrella was biased. The trial justice found that Zarrella displayed a “personal bias against the Town” and in favor of Champlin’s. First, she based this finding on Zarrella’s communications with town officials in which Zarrella said that Champlin’s was “entitled to this expansion” and the islanders were “naïve.” Second, the trial justice relied on Zarrella’s negative comments about the town’s witnesses and its alternate plan following a hearing. Third, she focused on Zarrella’s favorable comments about Champlin’s. - 27 - Like Tikoian, Zarrella demonstrated difficulty in acting as an impartial trier of fact. Rather, he took it upon himself to further the cause of one party over another in his unabashed affinity for Champlin’s position and disdain for that of the town’s. In tandem, his statements to town officials concerning Champlin’s entitlement to expansion and his criticisms of the town and its residents for what he perceived as their naïveté in resisting development effectively rebutted his presumed status as an honest adjudicator. Davis, 444 A.2d at 192. In the hearing process, the town enjoys the same due process guarantees as Champlin’s; it should be assured that it has a fair chance to make its argument before the subcommittee and full council without facing the additional hurdle of convincing an agency adjudicator who has entrenched himself in a contrary position. Barbara Realty Co., 85 R.I. at 156, 128 A.2d at 344. Therefore, Zarrella’s activities during the workshop and the CRMC hearing has constitutional implications as a result of his “‘preconceived and settled opinion’” concerning Champlin’s and his personal feelings toward the parties involved. Ryan, 941 A.2d at 185. When viewed in light of the trial justice’s extensive credibility findings during the evidentiary hearing and through the prism of the deference owed to the trial justice’s factual findings, we will not disturb on appeal the trial justice’s findings that due process demands Zarrella’s disqualification because of demonstrated bias. 13 Paul Lemont The petitioners contend that the trial justice erred when she found that Lemont was biased and when she disqualified him on the basis of his ex parte contacts in connection with the Goulet plan. They contend that the town already had introduced a 100-foot plan into evidence, prior to Lemont’s request for the alternate Goulet plan, and thus Lemont had properly formed an opinion 13 Zarrella is no longer a member of the CRMC. - 28 - on the basis of the proceedings on the record. Additionally, the petitioners argue that the trial justice failed to recognize that, like Lemont, the other subcommittee members also favored a modified expansion that was not independently supported by the record. Although the respondent noted that “it is perfectly appropriate for a judicial officer overseeing a contested hearing to urge the parties to compromise,” Champlin’s argues that Lemont was biased because he became an advocate for the “best interests of the Town” in trying to reach a compromise that was only acceptable by the town rather than Champlin’s. We hold that the trial justice’s finding that Lemont was biased is not supported by legally competent evidence. First, the trial justice premised her conclusion as to Lemont’s bias on the fact that he directed Fugate to recruit Goulet to formulate the alternate plan and his lobbying for the Goulet plan to other subcommittee members. Additionally, the trial justice found bias in Lemont’s effort to “infect” the workshop and full council with a thinly veiled version of the Goulet plan. She described Lemont as “act[ing] in concert with Tikoian.” Also, the trial justice based her finding of Lemont’s bias on his meeting with the Governor “to discuss the status of the case.” Finally, the trial justice relied on Lemont’s admission during the evidentiary hearing “that he was influenced by outside pressures.” As discussed, the evidentiary hearing repeatedly and improperly subjected agency members to questioning that revealed the members’ mental processes as agency adjudicators. Lemont was no exception. Despite her assurances to the contrary, the trial justice clearly relied on Lemont’s testimony as to his mental process when she made her finding that Lemont was biased by virtue of his commitment to a “compromise.” Indeed, the trial court’s decision quotes directly and at length from Lemont’s testimony in which he discussed his mental process that led - 29 - him to decide that a compromise was the only appropriate resolution of the matter after he began reviewing the evidence. The trial justice’s decision states: “Lemont testified that although he did not favor any expansion initially, he later decided to support a compromise to get the matter resolved. * * * He testified that he ‘saw all of the cumulative things that were going on, the editorials, et cetera, et cetera, I came up with the thought that perhaps we could compromise this, that everybody could get something, and the matter would be resolved.” The decision also quoted his testimony that “I came up with a compromise that I thought would solve the problem, and that’s what I wanted to do. I was chairman of the subcommittee. I had heard the testimony. I had heard the comments of the subcommittee. I was looking for something that would be a compromise. There were many people that I heard on Block Island that wanted no expansion. There were later, some of the letters that I did look at, no expansion. I read the editorial in the Block Island paper, the letters to the editor. I listened to your witnesses. I listened to all of the witnesses. And I came up with a conclusion that perhaps there might be a compromise that would settle this matter.” Therefore, in his responses to questions posed to him at the evidentiary hearing, Lemont testified as to “the process by which he reached the conclusion[]” that he would not join in the subcommittee’s recommendation to the CRMC. See Morgan, 313 U.S. at 422. The only proper area of inquiry concerning Lemont was to factual matters, and the trial justice erred when she relied on anything else. See Green, 944 F.2d at 854. The passages of Lemont’s testimony quoted in the Superior Court’s decision are replete with examples of Lemont’s mental process. The trial justice relied on testimony that went beyond factual assertions about what evidence was before Lemont. On the contrary, his testimony discussed his conclusion that a compromise was appropriate and how he reached this conclusion. As Justice Holmes characterized the - 30 - examination of the “operation of [the tax assessment board’s] minds” in Babcock, “[t]his was wholly improper.” Babcock, 204 U.S. at 593. When Lemont’s testimony of his mental process is removed from consideration, we are of the opinion that the trial justice’s finding of bias on the part of Lemont was error because the remaining legally competent evidence is far too flimsy to support such a conclusion. As the trial justice correctly noted, “disqualification is a severe sanction.” Therefore, Lemont’s ex parte communication with Fugate in seeking what became known as the Goulet plan and his communication with the Governor regarding the “status of the case,” while improper, are insufficient to demonstrate the prejudgment and bias necessitating disqualification. Additionally, Lemont’s instruction to Goulet to show the plan to subcommittee members also is insufficient because, as a subcommittee member himself, Lemont’s communication with the other members is not an ex parte contact. We share the trial justice’s disappointment in the lax approach that the CRMC members took toward insulating themselves from improper ex parte contacts. However, the occurrence of ex parte contacts does not require disqualification in every instance. See, e.g., PATCO, 685 F.2d at 573 (disapproving of clearly improper ex parte dinner between agency member and interested labor leader, but holding that the contact did not preclude a fair decision to the parties or the public interest). Thus, once the record is sanitized of any mental processes, Lemont is more like the other agency members who the trial justice found regrettably engaged in ex parte contacts that did not “rise[] to the level that would warrant disqualification” and less like Tikoian or Zarrella. We hold that the trial justice’s finding of Lemont’s bias and her disqualification of him from the workshop and council hearing were not based on legally competent evidence. - 31 - F Remedy Although the trial justice declared that she had the discretion to fashion an equitable remedy, her ruling on a remedy under § 42-35-15 is a question of law that we review de novo. See Johnston Ambulatory Surgical Associates, Ltd., 755 A.2d at 805. The trial justice said that based on the holding in PATCO, she had “equitable discretion” to decide whether to vacate the agency’s decision. PATCO, 685 F.2d at 565. Further, the trial justice quoted Birchwood Realty, Inc. v. Grant, 627 A.2d 827, 834 (R.I. 1993) for the proposition that “[i]t is clear that the Superior Court justice has some discretion in fashioning a remedy when hearing an appeal from an agency decision.” (emphasis added.) We do not agree with the trial justice’s interpretation that Birchwood recognizes this broad authority. Rather, Birchwood supports a trial justice’s discretion to choose among the remedies provided in § 42-35-15(g), that is, affirm, reverse, remand, or modify an agency decision. Indeed, this Court in Birchwood, after recognizing the trial justice’s discretion to remand the case, held that the trial justice’s “order of remand was simply too broad.” Birchwood, 627 A.2d at 834. There, we established that there are real limits to the trial justice’s discretion in “fashioning” a remedy. Id. Section 42-35-15(g) does not permit the trial justice to substitute the agency’s decision with another agency document that is not truly a “decision.” The trial justice purported to “uphold” the “decision” of the CRMC members who voted in favor of the subcommittee’s recommendation. However, there was nothing to “uphold,” because what the members who voted to adopt the recommendation put their signatures to was entitled “Findings of Fact,” not “Decision.” The wholesale replacement of the agency’s decision with a mere recommendation of the subcommittee is not one of the options available to the trial justice under the statute. In - 32 - elevating the subcommittee over the full council, the trial justice clearly erred because the subcommittee simply is not authorized under the CRMC Management Procedures to render a decision for the CRMC. The subcommittee recommendation remained just that, a mere recommendation to the full council. We hold that a remand to the agency is necessary so that the ex parte contacts of the sort found by the trial justice may be placed in the record and the parties be offered the opportunity to respond. Remand to the agency generally is the proper remedy “under a variety of circumstances.” 2 Am. Jur. 2d Administrative Law § 574 at 489, 490 (2004) (listing nine justifications for remand, including unfair agency proceedings and “reversible due process procedural defects” at the agency level); see Florida Power & Light Co. v. Lorion, 470 U.S. 729, 744 (1985) (“If the record before the agency does not support the agency action, if the agency has not considered all relevant factors, or if the reviewing court simply cannot evaluate the challenged agency action on the basis of the record before it, the proper course, except in rare circumstances, is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation.”). Remand is favorable because of “the unique expertise possessed by administrative agencies.” See Sartor, 542 A.2d at 1081. This Court has characterized the authority of the Superior Court to remand for further proceedings under § 42-35-15(g) as “a broad grant of power * * * to remand, in a proper case, to correct deficiencies in the record and thus afford the litigants a meaningful review.” Lemoine v. Department of Mental Health, Retardation and Hospitals, 113 R.I. 285, 290, 320 A.2d 611, 614 (1974) (affirming trial justice’s order remanding the case to the agency “for the taking of additional evidence”). - 33 - We acknowledge that there are instances in which a remand to an administrative agency may not be the most appropriate remedy. For instance, in Easton’s Point Association, Inc. v. Coastal Resources Management Council, 559 A.2d 633, 636 (R.I. 1989), we determined that a trial justice erred when he exceeded the appropriate scope of review upon examination of an agency decision. The matter was before the Superior Court on the appeal of objectors after the CRMC had granted a petition for the construction of a new hotel. Id. at 634. After vacating the Superior Court judgment, we grappled with the issue of remedy. Id. at 636. In deciding not to remand to the agency, we said, “[w]e do not believe that a remand of this case would further the interests of justice. Since the facts and issues have been developed and clarified, further remand would not provide decisive new information.” Id. In this case, however, the record is not complete because the impermissible ex parte information must be made available for the examination of the parties. It is therefore our opinion that the interests of justice are best served by a remand. 14 In our opinion, this case should be returned to the Superior Court with an order that that tribunal remand the matter to the CRMC. That body should be ordered to expeditiously reopen the hearing on the Champlin’s application. The record is to be expanded to include the Goulet plan and all supporting materials. 15 Any party may cross-examine individuals involved in the creation of the Goulet plan. The current composition of the CRMC’s membership may vote on the matter. Each voting member must certify that he or she has read the entire record before the 14 In our view, Arnold anticipates remand to the agency to supplement the record in the case of ex parte contacts, as evidenced by this Court’s holding in that case that the parties “must” have the opportunity contest and cross-examine outside sources consulted on the merits of a matter and, if the final decision is to be based on such information, then it “must be included on the record.” Arnold, 941 A.2d at 821. 15 Although we are of the opinion that Tikoian’s contact with the Governor also constitutes an ex parte contact under Arnold, Tikoian’s continued disqualification from the full council renders it - 34 - council, including the transcripts of the subcommittee hearings and workshop and any accompanying evidence, supporting data, and supplementary material. We emphasize that the Superior Court is to direct that the CRMC is to proceed forthwith in bringing this matter to a close. The epigraph of the trial justice’s decision invokes the inherent link between justice and fairness; however, the decision actually precipitated an unfair result.16 While the trial justice’s departure from the statutory scheme more or less operated in Champlin’s favor, the town and the intervenors were saddled with an adverse decision but were deprived of an opportunity to respond even though they had no hand in the ex parte contacts or the resulting demonstration of bias. Consequently, the town and intervenors were denied the opportunity to appeal a final decision adverse to them, ostensibly made by the CRMC, but actually directed by the trial justice. We are of the opinion that the remedy we order today not only comports with the law, but will preserve the public’s trust in the integrity of the administrative process. V Conclusion For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court in part, reverse in part, and remand to the Superior Court with instructions that it remand this matter to the CRMC for further proceedings, consistent with this opinion, on a supplemented record before the CRMC as it currently is constituted. unnecessary to expend more time and resources supplementing the record with those communications. 16 “Fairness is what justice really is.” The New York Public Library Book of Twentieth-Century American Quotations 130 (1992) (quoting Justice Potter Stewart). - 35 - Robinson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part. I readily concur in virtually every aspect of this Court’s opinion in this difficult and very important case, 17 except with respect to the Court’s affirmance of the Superior Court’s finding of disqualifying bias on the part of Michael Tikoian. 18 I do not lightly dissent (even if only in part) in a case of such obvious importance. Nevertheless, after careful consideration of the facts and the law, I have no choice in good conscience but to dissent; I do so respectfully, but nonetheless quite vigorously. I am fully persuaded of the correctness of most of the holdings that are so well articulated in the Court’s opinion, and I am pleased to concur in those holdings—most especially (1) the holding concerning the necessity of a remand to the Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC); (2) the holding that the Superior Court committed clear error when it found disqualifying bias on the part of Paul Lemont; and (3) the holding relative to the principle of quasi-judicial immunity. (I am greatly concerned about preserving intact the doctrine of quasi- judicial immunity, and I readily and wholeheartedly concur in the scholarly and sensible paragraphs of the Court’s opinion that address that very significant issue.) 19 17 This case is of great importance to those concerned with environmental preservation, to those who seek to engage in construction projects in the coastal areas, and to those interested in the intricacies of administrative law. 18 I express no view whatsoever concerning the Superior Court’s finding of disqualifying bias on the part of Gerald Zarrella, who is no longer a member of the Coastal Resources Management Council. I would prefer not to pass upon such an issue unless it were absolutely necessary to do so. See generally PDK Laboratories Inc. v. United States Drug Enforcement Administration, 362 F.3d 786, 799 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (then-Circuit Judge John Roberts, concurring in part) (stating that “the cardinal principle of judicial restraint” is that “if it is not necessary to decide more, it is necessary not to decide more”). 19 With respect to the quasi-judicial immunity issue, I feel obliged to record in the most emphatic terms my view that any probing of the thought processes of judicial or quasi-judicial officials with respect to their thinking while engaged in decision-making should take place, if ever, only in the most extraordinary of circumstances (which certainly were not present in this case). The probing of the thought processes of such decision-makers is alien to the Anglo-American legal tradition, and I for one could not readily be a party to any liberalization of the law in this domain. If such liberalization were to occur, I think that it is inevitable that the courts would immediately begin to see non-prevailing party after non-prevailing party seek to analyze the thought processes - 36 - While the foregoing words of laudatory endorsement are written in all sincerity, I must with equal sincerity express my disagreement with the majority’s decision to uphold the Superior Court’s finding of disqualifying bias 20 on the part of Michael Tikoian. I acknowledge the thoughtful nature of the majority’s approach to the troubling question of bias (vel non) on the part of Mr. Tikoian, but I nonetheless remain convinced that the Superior Court clearly erred when it found disqualifying bias on the part of that senior governmental official. 21 I acknowledge the long-standing requirement that a finding of fact by a nisi prius court should be overturned only if said finding is clearly erroneous. That is a demanding requirement, but it is certainly not an insuperable one. See, e.g., Tavares v. Beck, 814 A.2d 346, 353 (R.I. 2003) (holding that, in the context of a claim for adverse possession, a “trial justice misconceived and overlooked material evidence”); see also Irving v. United States, 49 F.3d 830, 836 (1st Cir. 1995) (holding that a trial court clearly erred when it had “fundamentally misconstrued the testimony upon which it explicitly and exclusively relied”); Allen v. Johnson, 831 A.2d 282, 288 (Conn. App. Ct. 2003) (holding that the trial court’s finding concerning a title of those decision-makers who reached a result contrary to the wishes of the non-prevailing party. The result would be chaos of the sort that Charles Dickens loved to satirize. 20 A frequently cited legal reference work defines the word “bias” as meaning “a hostile feeling or spirit of ill will on the one hand or undue friendship or favoritism on the other toward one of the litigants or his or her attorney, with a formation of a fixed anticipatory judgment on the part of a judge as distinguished from an open state of mind which will be governed by the law and the facts.” 46 Am. Jur. 2d Judges § 128 (2009) (emphasis added). I believe that the words “fixed anticipatory judgment” in this definition are especially important. 21 Even if one considers the Superior Court’s ruling concerning the disqualifying bias on the part of Mr. Tikoian to be a close call (and I do not), it is my view that the “presumption of integrity” (see discussion of said principle, infra) should militate against a finding of disqualifying bias. See Withrow v. Larkin, 421 U.S. 35, 47 (1975). It is my opinion that that is precisely what the presumption of integrity is meant to do. Employing a “tie goes to the runner” approach in close call situations serves (inter alia) the goal of discouraging the filing of minimally supported motions seeking recusal or disqualification. See footnote 26, infra. - 37 - issue was “clearly erroneous”). 22 With respect to the issue of disqualifying bias on the part of Mr. Tikoian, I have no hesitancy in stating (respectfully) that the Superior Court clearly erred. In all candor, I consider the finding by the Superior Court (and this Court’s affirmance of same) as to the existence of disqualifying bias on the part of Mr. Tikoian to be an unwarranted negative reflection 23 on a man who, based upon my reading of the record, appears to be a conscientious public official—some of whose actions merit criticism in hindsight but who, under settled principles of administrative law, should not be deemed so biased as to be disqualified from further participation in this case. In my mind, disqualifying a judicial or quasi-judicial officer for bias should be a most uncommon occurrence. It should take place only after a careful balancing process. See, e.g., Ryan v. Roman Catholic Bishop of Providence, 941 A.2d 174, 185 (R.I. 2008) (“It is a well-recognized principle that judicial officers are duty-bound to recuse themselves if they are unable to render a fair or an impartial decision in a particular case. * * * At the same time, however, justices have an equally great obligation not to disqualify themselves when there is no sound reason to do so.”) (quotation marks omitted). In my judgment, by upholding the Superior Court’s finding of disqualifying bias on the part of Mr. Tikoian, the majority has wandered off the path outlined by precedent; and I regretfully predict 22 Appellate determinations that a nisi prius court has clearly erred are by no means in the “once in a blue moon” category. Indeed, in this very case the Court holds (and I readily concur in that holding) that the trial justice clearly erred in finding disqualifying bias on the part of Paul Lemont. 23 I wish to emphasize that I very definitively do not read the majority opinion as suggesting that there was any sort of ignoble motivation on Mr. Tikoian’s part. It is my understanding that my colleagues in the majority as to the Tikoian issue simply share the trial justice’s conviction that, at some point during the administrative proceedings relative to this case, Mr. Tikoian’s thought processes became fixed to such an extent that he could no longer render an unbiased decision. It is my view, by contrast, that the record does not support a finding that his thought processes had become fixed to such an extent. See footnote 20, supra. - 38 - that the result will be that those involved in administrative adjudication in this jurisdiction in the future will “reap the whirlwind.” 24 In my view, the trial justice in the Superior Court and the majority of this Court have erred because they have not given sufficient weight to the long-recognized presumption of regularity that attaches to the acts of public officials. A cogent description of that vitally important presumption may be found in the United States Supreme Court’s unanimous opinion in the case of United States v. Chemical Foundation, Inc., 272 U.S. 1 (1926). In that case, the Supreme Court wrote as follows: “The presumption of regularity supports the official acts of public officers, and, in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, courts presume that they have properly discharged their official duties.” Id. at 14-15. 25 As this Court has similarly stated, “[a]ny administrator is presumed to be neutral unless proven to be otherwise.” In re Cross, 617 A.2d 97, 100 (R.I. 1992); see also Nelson v. Dodge, 76 R.I. 1, 11-12, 68 A.2d 51, 56-57 (1949); Kelley v. City Council of Cranston, 61 R.I. 472, 482-83, 1 A.2d 185, 189 (1938). In a similar vein, Justice Byron White, writing for a unanimous Supreme Court in the frequently cited case of Withrow v. Larkin, 421 U.S. 35 (1975), expressly alluded to the principle that a contention of bias in an administrative adjudication “must overcome a presumption of honesty and integrity in those serving as adjudicators.” Id. at 47 (emphasis 24 Hosea 8:7 (King James). 25 See also United States v. Morgan, 313 U.S. 409, 421 (1941); Beverly v. United States, 468 F.2d 732, 743 (5th Cir. 1972) (noting “the well recognized presumption as to the regularity of the acts of public officials”); Chequinn Corp. v. Mullen, 193 A.2d 432, 435 (Me. 1963) (“The good faith of a public official is not lightly to be denied. Proof of prejudice and bias sufficient to overcome the sense of responsibility to office and to community must be heavy.”); see generally 67 C.J.S. Officers § 240 (2002). - 39 - added); see also Larue v. Registrar of Motor Vehicles, 568 A.2d 755, 758-59 (R.I. 1990); Davis v. Wood, 444 A.2d 190, 192 (R.I. 1982). In Gorman v. University of Rhode Island, 837 F.2d 7 (1st Cir. 1988), a significant due process case involving the University of Rhode Island’s University Board on Student Conduct, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit wrote as follows: “It would seem clear that the role of the board before whom the student appears is quasi-judicial, which presupposes the indispensable prerequisites of integrity and objectivity. * * * Generally, in examining administrative proceedings, the presumption favors the administrators, and the burden is upon the party challenging the action to produce evidence sufficient to rebut this presumption.” Id. at 15. After examining the record in the case at bar, it is my conclusion that the party that sought to disqualify Mr. Tikoian failed to produce “evidence sufficient to rebut” the vitally important presumption of “integrity and objectivity” to which the First Circuit made such unequivocal reference in Gorman. See id. Considering the effect of the presumption of integrity on the case at bar, it should be emphasized ab initio that there is not the slightest hint in the record of any self-dealing or similar improper motivation on Mr. Tikoian’s part; 26 in my judgment, this is a consideration of great importance. 27 Instead, the more I scrutinize the record, the clearer it becomes to me that Mr. 26 I think it important to repeat that I do not infer from the majority opinion any suggestion that the majority deems Mr. Tikoian’s conduct to have been unethical or the product of moral turpitude. My understanding of the majority’s viewpoint is that it was inclined to find as not clearly erroneous the trial justice’s position that, in a close case, one should understand the maxim “the tie goes to the runner” as meaning that, when faced with an apparent “tie” or fifty- fifty call as to disqualifying bias vel non, the “tie” should be resolved in favor of recusal— whereas I believe that it should be resolved in favor of non-recusal. 27 I recognize that bias does not necessarily stem from extrajudicial sources. See Ryan v. Roman Catholic Bishop of Providence, 941 A.2d 174, 185-86 n.21 (R.I. 2008); see generally Liteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540, 551 (1994); State v. Nordstrom, 122 R.I. 412, 414, 408 A.2d 601, 602 (1979). With respect to the case at bar, however, I am unable to conclude from the record that there was sufficient evidence of disqualifying bias on the part of Mr. Tikoian—regardless of - 40 - Tikoian’s motivation in the midst of the administrative proceedings was simply to attempt to bring about a compromise solution with respect to a highly controversial application. 28 Mr. Tikoian’s alleged bias was rather a temporary “tilt” of an intellectual and pragmatic sort 29 (as contrasted with a bias stemming from self-interest or from a “fixed judgment”); and there is no evidence in the record that convinces me that, if he were allowed to participate in the further proceedings that will take place at some future date, his views would not further evolve in one direction or the other, as they had in the past. 30 It is apparently undisputed that Mr. Tikoian was not challenged as being biased when the administrative proceedings began. If, during the course of those proceedings, he formed certain tentative intellectual conclusions as to how the issues presented might best be resolved, my view would be that having such tentative viewpoints is entirely appropriate in the decision-making process. What he did is what any responsible decision-maker does: he or she listens to the evidence and formulates or reformulates tentative conclusions—without excluding the possibility whether one takes into account extrajudicial sources or occurrences within the administrative proceedings. 28 In my judgment, it is significant that the record discloses that Mr. Tikoian’s interest in what came to be called “the Goulet plan” was not present at the outset of the CRMC proceedings; it came about only after the administrative proceedings were underway. I can find absolutely no evidence in the record that Mr. Tikoian had a “fixed anticipatory judgment” (see footnote 20, supra) when those proceedings commenced. Moreover, I can perceive no sufficient evidence in the record to support a finding that he had a fixed judgment at any later time as those proceedings went forward. 29 As I discuss further in the next paragraph of the text, it is a basic feature of the human reasoning process that numerous temporary intellectual “conclusions” are reached in the course of an administrative or judicial proceeding before the final conclusion is reached at the end of the proceeding. 30 It is clear from the record that Mr. Tikoian showed an ability to modify his thinking about the proposed project as time went by. Significantly, it appears from the record before us that Mr. Tikoian wished to subject the petition of Champlin’s to an immediate vote of the full CRMC when the petition was initially proposed. Moreover, it was Mr. Tikoian who appointed Mr. Zarrella (who the record reveals to be at all times favorably inclined towards the proposed project) to the subcommittee. In my view, these facts constitute meaningful evidence that Mr. - 41 - that subsequent evidence or argument might sway him or her in another direction. I believe that the following particularly eloquent and perceptive passage from a well-known book written by a very distinguished (and recently deceased) federal judge accurately and succinctly describes the decision-making process: “I see decision-making as neither a process that results in an early conviction based on instant exposure to competing briefs nor one in which the judge keeps an open mind through briefs, discussion in chambers, argument, and conference, and then summons up the will to decide. I see the process, rather, as a series of shifting biases. * * * “One reads a good brief from the appellant; the position seems reasonable. But a good brief from appellee, bolstered perhaps by a trial judge’s opinion, seems incontrovertible. Discussion with the law clerks in chambers casts doubt on any tentative position. Any such doubt may be demolished by oral argument, only to give rise to a new bias, which in turn may be shaken by the postargument conference among the judges. * * * The guarantee of a judge’s impartiality lies not in suspending judgment throughout the process but in recognizing that each successive judgment is tentative, fragile, and likely to be modified or set aside as a consequence of deepened insight.” Frank M. Coffin, The Ways of a Judge: Reflections from the Federal Appellate Bench 63 (1980) (emphasis added). In my judgment, that passage from Judge Coffin’s fine little book deserves multiple re-readings and careful reflection. I am not aware of any more insightful explanation of the manner in which the decision-making process operates; the quoted passage is a profound reflection upon the manner in which the human intellect proceeds (viz., in a halting and tentative way) before it reaches a conclusion with respect to a complex matter. In my view, the above-quoted words of Judge Coffin are fully applicable to Mr. Tikoian’s decision-making process in the case at bar. Tikoian’s initial thinking was far from what it later became. In plain English, Mr. Tikoian’s thinking evolved over time. - 42 - I believe that it is a regrettable error for this Court to uphold the disqualification of Mr. Tikoian with respect to future proceedings 31 on the basis of any past indiscretions in connection with this case. After long and careful consideration, I have been unable to locate in the record sufficient evidence of abiding bias to justify the disqualification of a man whom my reading of the record discloses to be an energetic, innovative, and conscientious public servant. See generally Del Vecchio v. Illinois Department of Corrections, 31 F.3d 1363, 1375 (7th Cir. en banc 1994) (“The question is not whether some possible temptation to be biased exists; instead, the question is, when does a biasing influence require disqualification?”). In my judgment, one can rightly apply to Mr. Tikoian, mutatis mutandis, the following colorful and cogent words written by Justice Felix Frankfurter of the United States Supreme Court with respect to cabinet officers in the often cited case of United States v. Morgan, 313 U.S. 409 (1941): “Cabinet officers charged by Congress with adjudicatory functions are not assumed to be flabby creatures any more than judges are. Both may have an underlying philosophy in approaching a specific case. But both are assumed to be [persons] of conscience and intellectual discipline, capable of judging a particular controversy fairly on the basis of its own circumstances. Nothing in this record disturbs such an assumption.” Id. at 421. I am well aware that it is a basic tenet of due process that every case should be tried before an impartial and independent adjudicator. See, e.g., In re Murchison, 349 U.S. 133, 136 (1955) (“A fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic requirement of due process.”); see also Withrow, 31 It is clear that the trial justice did not foresee the need for any future proceedings when she carried out her virtually unprecedented arithmetical readjustment of the votes cast by certain members of the CRMC (viz., Mr. Tikoian, Mr. Lemont, and Mr. Zarrella) with respect to the application at issue. (It will be recalled that the trial justice carried out her arithmetical readjustment after she had ruled that Mr. Tiokian and the other two just-mentioned members of the CRMC should be disqualified, resulting in their votes not being counted.) However, as a result of today’s holding of the Court as to remedy (in which holding I unequivocally concur), there will now be further administrative proceedings with respect to this - 43 - 421 U.S. at 46-47; Gorman, 837 F.2d at 15; see generally Henry J. Friendly, “Some Kind of Hearing,” 123 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1267, 1269 n.10 (1975). This principle is applicable “to administrative agencies which adjudicate as well as to courts.” Withrow, 421 U.S. at 46; see also Gibson v. Berryhill, 411 U.S. 564, 579 (1973). Yet, as several distinguished jurists have noted, that basic tenet must coexist with the fact that every sentient person has inherent predispositions. For example, Judge Jerome Frank, writing for the Second Circuit in his eloquent and frequently cited opinion in the case of In re J.P. Linahan, Inc., 138 F.2d 650 (2d Cir. 1943), stated: “Democracy must, indeed, fail unless our courts try cases fairly, and there can be no fair trial before a judge lacking in impartiality and disinterestedness. If, however, ‘bias’ and ‘partiality’ be defined to mean the total absence of preconceptions in the mind of the judge, then no one has ever had a fair trial and no one ever will. The human mind, even at infancy, is no blank piece of paper. We are born with predispositions; and the process of education, formal and informal, creates attitudes in all men which affect them in judging situations, attitudes which precede reasoning in particular instances and which, therefore, by definition, are pre-judices. Without acquired ‘slants,’ pre-conceptions, life could not go on.” Id. at 651 (emphasis added). 32 It is self-evident that no judge or administrator should be expected to enter a proceeding with his or her mind being a complete tabula rasa. Such a requirement would be at loggerheads with human nature. It is rather the duty of the decision-maker to be aware of his or her “preconceptions” and “predispositions” 33 and not be controlled by them, but rather be controlled solely by the evidence in the record. 34 case. It is my definite conviction that the majority errs in holding that Mr. Tikoian should be disqualified from participating in those future proceedings. 32 See also Benjamin N. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process 167 (1921). 33 See In re J.P. Linahan, Inc., 138 F.2d 650, 651 (2d Cir. 1943) (Jerome Frank, J.). 34 Undoubtedly, there will be occasions where a decision-maker has so strong an intellectual predisposition as to a particular issue that due process would require recusal or disqualification. See footnote 20, supra. However, I see nothing in the record that in any meaningful way suggests that Mr. Tikoian had such a strong intellectual predisposition as to any material issue in this case. - 44 - For certain, courts have on occasion disqualified adjudicators for bias relating to self- interest. It is the presence of this type of bias, where an adjudicator has some personal stake in the outcome (unlike the above-described “series of shifting biases” 35 of an intellectual and not self-interested sort), that may well constitute a due process violation and require disqualification. See generally 2 Charles H. Koch, Jr., Administrative Law and Practice § 6.10 (2d ed. 1997). For example, in the case of Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U.S. 510 (1927), the United States Supreme Court noted that the adjudicator in question in that case had had “a direct personal pecuniary interest in convicting the defendant who came before him for trial * * *.” Id. at 523. In view of that fact, the Supreme Court held that “it certainly violates the Fourteenth Amendment and deprives a defendant in a criminal case of due process of law to subject his liberty or property to the judgment of a court, the judge of which has a direct, personal, substantial pecuniary interest in reaching a conclusion against him in his case.” Id.; see also Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., 129 S.Ct. 2252, 2265 (2009) (holding that “the probability of actual bias [rose] to an unconstitutional level” where a judge refused to recuse himself in a case involving a major donor to the judge’s election campaign). Likewise, in Ward v. Village of Monroeville, 409 U.S. 57 (1972), the Supreme Court held that, where the revenue derived from judgments rendered in a mayor’s court provided a substantial portion of the municipality’s funds, that mayor could not act in a disinterested fashion when serving in a judicial capacity. Id. at 59. I repeat that there is absolutely no indication in the record of such a pecuniary motivation or other form of self- dealing on Mr. Tikoian’s part. By contrast, it is a well established principle that it is not improper for administrators “to form views about law and policy on the basis of their prior adjudications of similar issues which 35 Frank M. Coffin, The Ways of a Judge: Reflections from the Federal Appellate Bench 63 (1980). - 45 - may influence them in deciding later cases.” Rombough v. Federal Aviation Administration, 594 F.2d 893, 900 (2d Cir. 1979); see also Federal Trade Commission v. Cement Institute, 333 U.S. 683, 702-03 (1948) (holding that the Commission’s public statements regarding its views on a particular pricing system did not merit disqualification); 2 Koch, at § 6.10. Additionally, an adjudicator should not be “disqualified simply because [he or she] has taken a position, even in public, on a policy issue related to the dispute, in the absence of a showing that he is not capable of judging a particular controversy fairly on the basis of its own circumstances.” Hortonville Joint School District No. 1 v. Hortonville Education Association, 426 U.S. 482, 493 (1976) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Morgan, 313 U.S. at 421; see generally 48A C.J.S. Judges § 265 (2004). Nothing in the record of this case indicates that Mr. Tikoian’s views would not have evolved further if he was unsuccessful in his attempt at arriving at a compromise through the Goulet plan. With the sole exception of the trial justice’s finding that Mr. Tikoian threatened a subcommittee member that he would not be reappointed if he did not vote for the Goulet plan, nothing in the record convinces me that there was any disqualifying bias on Mr. Tikoian’s part. I readily concede that, in making such a threat, Mr. Tikoian acted unwisely and improperly; and, while I neither excuse nor minimize the seriousness of that particular activity, common experience educates us to the fact that a certain amount of “arm wrestling” frequently takes place when a decision-making body (including judicial and quasi-judicial bodies) seeks to arrive at a decision. Indeed, I believe that some degree of vigorous interaction 36 within a group charged with rendering a fair decision is often salutary. Mr. Tikoian should undoubtedly be chastised for 36 Let me be clear: permissible “vigorous interaction” within a decision-making body may often include heated rational debate and even a substantial degree of emotional rhetoric, but not an activity such as an actual threat to a fellow member regarding his future on the adjudicative body. - 46 - having acted in such a manner, and he should be admonished not to act similarly in the future. Nevertheless, I do not believe that the threat articulated by Mr. Tikoian, while inappropriate, was indicative of a permanent or abiding bias on his part. My overall impression, after perusing the entire record and considering the presumption of integrity, is that Mr. Tikoian is a sincere and well-meaning public official who, at a particular point in time, endeavored to bring about a “half- a-loaf” compromise outcome. Search as I may, I am unable to perceive sufficient evidence in the record to justify the Superior Court’s finding of disqualifying bias on the part of Mr. Tikoian. As for Mr. Tikoian’s contacts with Governor Carcieri and his staff, they are to me much ado about nothing in terms of a disqualifying bias analysis. 37 I concede that it would have been preferable for Mr. Tikoian to have delegated a subordinate to maintain contact with the Governor’s office. But what is significant is the lack of any finding by the trial justice that the Governor or his staff sought to “lobby” or “pressure” Mr. Tikoian in one direction or another. To the contrary, the trial justice explicitly found that the Governor did not attempt to lobby Mr. Tikoian; such a factual finding is, in my judgment, highly significant. 38 Similarly, I consider Mr. Tikoian’s statements to various news reporters to be of no real import. See generally Cement Institute, 333 U.S. at 702-03. Therefore, it is my conviction that any reliance upon these (concededly ex parte) communications should not be dispositive in the disqualifying bias analysis. Mr. Tikoian may not have acted in all respects exactly as this Court, in recent times, has come to expect quasi-judicial adjudicating officials to act. See, e.g., Arnold v. Lebel, 941 A.2d 813, 820-22 (R.I. 2007) (clarifying the norms concerning the duty of administrative adjudicators 37 Governor Carcieri is not a party to this case, nor is any member of his staff. 38 The Superior Court did note that Governor Carcieri expressed a tentative preference for a plan involving less expansion than that originally proposed by Champlin’s. - 47 - to avoid ex parte contacts in administrative proceedings). That being said, however, I believe that Mr. Tikoian’s actions must be judged in light of the substantially more opaque standards that prevailed in the pre-Arnold era; and I further respectfully maintain that Mr. Tikoian’s various ex parte contacts that are reflected in the record do not overcome the presumption of integrity or demonstrate the presence of disqualifying bias. I take no issue with the more exigent considerations relative to ex parte contacts which are the result of the clarifications that were spelled out in the quite recent 39 Arnold case.40 However, I think that it is fundamentally unfair to apply those more exigent considerations to the pre-Arnold actions of Mr. Tikoian, with the result being that he is held to be disqualified from participating in future administrative proceedings with respect to this case. Now that there has been authoritative clarification of the “ground rules” that should govern administrative proceedings conducted by quasi-judicial officers, I know of no reason not to believe that Mr. Tikoian will henceforth act assiduously in accordance therewith. We as a society expect a great deal of our public officials—including integrity and an acute sensitivity to ethical standards. However, I consider it unwarranted to expect that such officials be clairvoyant as to not yet clearly promulgated expectations and norms. There is something fundamentally unfair in viewing yesterday’s activities through today’s ethical spectacles (viz., the clarifications articulated in Arnold). In my judgment, while remand to the CRMC is an entirely appropriate remedial measure, Mr. Tikoian should not be disqualified from participating in the further proceedings that are to take place. 39 The opinion in Arnold v. Lebel, 941 A.2d 813 (R.I. 2007), was issued on December 24, 2007. 40 The trial justice apparently considered the Arnold opinion to be of moment because, when it came to her attention, she specifically requested that the parties submit legal memoranda addressing the ramifications of that opinion for the case at bar. - 48 - In further support of the view just expressed, I would note that I am of the same mind as was the circuit court in the leading case of Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization v. Federal Labor Relations Authority, 685 F.2d 547 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (PATCO). In the PATCO case, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that ex parte contacts do not inevitably lead to disqualifying bias. Id. at 572-73. In that case, a union leader invited a member of the Federal Labor Relations Authority to dinner. Id. at 559. During their dinner conversation, which lasted approximately an hour and a half, the two gentlemen engaged in a fifteen minute discussion regarding a case that was pending before the Labor Relations Authority. Id. at 559, 571. The Court of Appeals ruled that, while it did not condone that behavior of the two gentlemen, it did not believe that the ex parte dinner conversation “irrevocably tainted the Authority’s decision-making process or resulted in a decision unfair either to the parties or to the public interest.” Id. at 573. 41 While Mr. Tikoian’s actions in the instant case were concededly not fully consistent with the administrative law standards recently clarified by this Court in Arnold, 42 I am entirely unable to conclude that his ability to perform as an impartial decision-maker was irrevocably tainted by what he did. As I view it, there is, with respect to the Tikoian bias issue, an absolutist tone to the Superior Court’s reasoning and to this Court’s affirmance thereof; there is a failure to take into account the manner in which decision-making groups operate in the real world. 43 While I 41 To my mind, the expression “irrevocably tainted” in the PATCO decision quoted in the text is of capital importance. Disqualifying bias and the duty to recuse are present when a decision- maker has been irrevocably tainted by considerations other than the evidence of record. I do not perceive any basis in the record for concluding that Mr. Tikoian was irrevocably tainted. 42 Arnold v. Lebel, 941 A.2d 813 (R.I. 2007). 43 I make this observation without implying any lack of respect for those with whom I disagree concerning the disqualification of Mr. Tikoian. The several bias issues in this case are very difficult, and the opinions of the trial justice and of my colleagues deserve (and have) my genuine respect as being the work product of conscientious adjudicators. - 49 - certainly do not countenance any departure from high ethical standards by those acting in quasi- judicial capacities, the sometimes rough-and-tumble character of group decision-making is a reality; I believe that beneficial light in the end often emerges from such rough-and-tumble proceedings. I often recall the pithy and sagacious admonition of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes: “We must remember that the machinery of government would not work if it were not allowed a little play in its joints.” Bain Peanut Co. of Texas v. Pinson, 282 U.S. 499, 501 (1931) (quoted with approval by this Court in Plantation Legal Defense Services, Inc. v. O’Brien, 121 R.I. 595, 597, 401 A.2d 1277, 1278 (1979)); see also In re Request for Advisory Opinion from the House of Representatives (Coastal Resources Management Council), 961 A.2d 930, 933 n.3 (R.I. 2008) (quoting with approval the same admonition of Justice Holmes). Mistakes were made in this case—undoubtedly. 44 But I find nothing in the record that indicates to me that Mr. Tikoian should be disqualified with respect to future proceedings in this case or that such mistakes cannot be resolved by disclosure of the ex parte contacts upon remand to the CRMC. I repeat that I am convinced, after a careful perusal of the record, that Mr. Tikoian was not acting out of some sort of self-interest or personal animus or fixed judgment; I see no evidence that his actions were the product of any improper purpose. Instead, it is clear to me that Mr. Tikoian eventually became convinced, as the proceedings progressed, 45 that a compromise solution might be the best, considering the interests and goals of all concerned. 46 Thereafter, he became familiar with the compromise plan that was cobbled together at the direction of Mr. 44 In Joseph Conrad’s novel An Outcast of the Islands 154 (1920), one of the characters memorably comments: “It’s only those who do nothing that make no mistakes, I suppose.” 45 See Coffin, footnote 35, supra, at 63 (“[E]ach successive judgment is tentative, fragile, and likely to be modified or set aside as a consequence of deepened insight.”). 46 It should at all times be borne in mind that this Court looks with favor on attempts to compromise or settle disputes. See, e.g., Ryan, 941 A.2d at 186; Greensleeves, Inc. v. Smiley, 942 A.2d 284, 294 n.19 (R.I. 2007). - 50 - Lemont (“the Goulet plan”), and he then did his best to convince other CRMC members of the desirability of such a compromise solution. Except for his regrettable use of overly heavy- handed tactics vis-à-vis a fellow member of the CRMC, I do not perceive his actions as being different in kind from those that can be perceived within any decision-making body on any given day. An intellectually arrived at conviction at one moment in time that a compromise solution might be best does not add up to disqualifying bias; this Court made precisely that point in its unanimous recent decision in Ryan v. Roman Catholic Bishop of Providence, 941 A.2d 174 (R.I. 2008). In that case, this Court lauded the desirability of settlement and compromise, and it ruled that the trial justice’s earnest efforts to bring about same were entirely proper. Id. at 186-87. I consider the following language from the Ryan opinion to be applicable (mutatis mutandis) to Mr. Tikoian’s efforts to have the CRMC arrive at a compromise decision: “In view of the venerable judicial policy of encouraging settlement and endorsing the mediation alternative, it borders on the offensive for a party to claim that a justice should be recused for adhering to this policy. We see no reason why the efforts of a trial justice to encourage settlement is in any way indicative of personal bias or prejudice; by encouraging settlement, a trial justice is not expressing a preconceived view of the case before him or her, but rather is simply promoting this state’s sound policy of favoring settlement and/or mediation of disputes.” Id. at 187. I am deeply concerned that the majority’s opinion with respect to Mr. Tikoian will discourage future compromise and settlement discussions in matters pending before this state’s several adjudicative bodies—and I consider that to be a very regrettable result. When all is said and done, it is my definite view that the presumption of regularity and of integrity has not been overcome with respect to Mr. Tikoian—far from it! I am convinced that the trial justice’s finding of disqualifying bias as to him is clearly erroneous. It is further my - 51 - very respectful conviction that the majority is doing a disservice to a senior public official and to the citizens of this state by upholding the ruling that Mr. Tikoian is so irrevocably biased that he should be disqualified with respect to future proceedings in this case. In my judgment, Mr. Tikoian should be permitted to sit with the other current members of the Coastal Resources Management Council as it considers the additional material that this Court has held it should consider upon remand. For all of these reasons I very respectfully, but most vigorously, dissent from the majority’s affirmance of the Superior Court’s finding of disqualifying bias on the part of Michael Tikoian. I express no view as to the Gerald Zarrella issue. With those two exceptions, I am very pleased to concur in all the rest of the Court’s opinion. Williams, C.J. (ret.), concurring in part and dissenting in part. I concur with my colleagues’ well-reasoned opinion insofar as it (1) affirms the trial justice’s authority to hold an evidentiary hearing pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 42-35-15(f); (2) affirms the trial justice’s findings that Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC) Chairman Michael Tikoian and subcommittee member Gerald Zarrella were biased and should have been disqualified; and (3) reverses the trial justice’s finding that subcommittee Chairman Paul Lemont was biased and should have been disqualified. With regard to my colleague Justice William P. Robinson’s eloquent and passionate dissent from our affirmance of the trial justice’s finding that Chairman Tikoian was biased, I agree with his principal argument that administrative adjudicators enjoy a presumption of honesty and integrity that should not easily be refuted. Where I diverge from my distinguished colleague, however, is his characterization of Chairman Tikoian’s threat as mere administrative - 52 - “arm wrestling,” which, while inappropriate, did not amount to demonstrated bias. It is my view that Chairman Tikoian’s threat to prevent the reappointment of a CRMC member was, ipso facto, enough to disqualify him. For me, Chairman Tikoian’s threat was sufficiently improper to rebut the presumption that he was acting in a neutral and impartial role as an adjudicator. Once Chairman Tikoian threatened a fellow subcommittee member in his campaign to gain support for the so-called “Goulet plan,” he ceased to function as an impartial trier of fact. As for the Court’s decision to reverse the trial justice and remand the matter to the CRMC for consideration of the Goulet plan, I respectfully dissent. I would affirm the trial justice’s decision to reverse the CRMC. In my view, once the trial justice determined that the CRMC decision violated the “substantial rights” of Champlin’s, it was within her authority and discretion under § 42-35-15(g) to reverse the decision of the CRMC. I also diverge from that portion of the majority’s opinion that suggests that our decision in Arnold v. Lebel, 941 A.2d 813 (R.I. 2007), requires the Superior Court to remand a case in which ex parte contacts are found to have occurred to the administrative agency in every instance. In my opinion, the trial justice’s determination that the CRMC decision was based upon unlawful procedure and that it was against the clear weight of the evidence was a sufficient basis for her to reverse the CRMC decision rather than remand the matter back to the agency for further consideration of the Goulet plan. In any event, if reversal of the trial justice were, in fact, warranted, it is my opinion that this Court should remand the matter to the trial justice and not to the CRMC, for the purpose of considering the Goulet plan on the record and allowing the parties to examine the plan. - 53 - I The Trial Justice’s Decision to Reverse the CRMC was Proper Under General Laws 1956 § 42-35-15(g) As an initial matter, it is important to note that the trial justice held sixteen evidentiary hearings and one show-cause hearing, made extensive findings of fact, and concluded that the CRMC had prejudiced the rights of Champlin’s in its application for expansion. We are in no position to, nor should we, challenge those findings because our review of a Superior Court’s judgment of administrative proceedings is statutorily limited to questions of law. Section 42-35- 16; Iselin v. Retirement Board of Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island, 943 A.2d 1045, 1048 (R.I. 2008); Rossi v. Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island, 895 A.2d 106, 110 (R.I. 2006). “We do not weigh the evidence that was before the trial justice, but merely examine the record to determine whether his or her decision was supported by competent evidence.” Johnston Ambulatory Surgical Associates, Ltd. v. Nolan, 755 A.2d 799, 805 (R.I. 2000) (citing Barrington School Committee v. Rhode Island State Labor Relations Board, 608 A.2d 1126, 1138 (R.I. 1992)). Even given this required deference, however, I concur with the majority’s view that, in this case, the trial justice’s finding that subcommittee Chairman Lemont was biased was not supported by competent evidence as it was grounded in her reliance upon Mr. Lemont’s mental processes. The trial justice’s fact-finding efforts in this case are commendable and largely indisputable. After holding a plethora of hearings, she found, inter alia, that: (1) certain CRMC members engaged in ex parte communications while pressing for the Goulet plan; (2) at least some CRMC members demonstrated bias in violation of their quasi-judicial role as administrative adjudicators; (3) Chairman Tikoian threatened another subcommittee member with the loss of his CRMC seat in an attempt to persuade him to vote in favor of the Goulet plan; - 54 - and (4) the CRMC issued a decision that, in light of the evidence presented during the subcommittee hearings, was clearly erroneous. Based upon these findings, the trial justice determined that the CRMC decision (1) violated constitutional and statutory provisions; (2) was based upon unlawful procedure; (3) was in excess of the agency’s authority; and (4) was clearly erroneous, based on the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the record. Once the trial justice made this determination, pursuant to § 42-35-15(g), she had the authority to: (1) reverse the CRMC decision; (2) remand the matter to the CRMC; (3) affirm the decision; or (4) modify the decision. After making her findings of fact, the trial justice determined that the most appropriate resolution of the matter was to reverse the CRMC, rather than remand it with instructions to the CRMC to place the ex parte communications (the Goulet plan) on the record. Although her decision was, to some extent, based on her mistaken belief that our advisory opinion in the case of In re Request for Advisory Opinion from the House of Representatives (Coastal Resources Management Council), 961 A.2d 930 (R.I. 2008), required the General Assembly to pass legislation before the CRMC would be able to reopen the matter, it primarily was grounded in her belief that further delay in the adjudication of Champlin’s application would be an injustice. This determination by the trial justice was appropriate because both this Court and other jurisdictions have recognized that such an applicant is entitled to a decision from the administrative agency within a reasonable period. See Sakonnet Rogers, Inc. v. Coastal Resources Management Council, 536 A.2d 893, 897 (R.I. 1988) (Sakonnet) (recognizing that petitioners have a right to have the adjudication of an administrative matter within a “reasonable period”); see also 2 Am. Jur. 2d Administrative Law § 371 (2004) (administrative agency has an “affirmative duty * * * to act in a timely fashion”). - 55 - Although legislation was not, in fact, required for the CRMC to reopen the matter on remand, at the time the trial justice issued her decision six years had passed since Champlin’s filed its application, in 2003. So then, a remand to the CRMC for consideration of the Goulet plan would have exceeded the seven-year time period we found to be unacceptable in Sakonnet, 536 A.2d at 897. The trial justice’s decision to reverse, therefore, was based on this Court’s principle that any further delay in the adjudication of Champlin’s application would prejudice its right to a final adjudication of its petition “within a reasonable period.” Id. My colleagues’ decision to reverse the trial justice is partially based on the principle that administrative matters generally must be completed by the administrative agency and not the courts. 3 Richard J. Pierce, Jr., Administrative Law Treatise § 18.1 (5th ed. 2010) (most successful appeals of federal agency decisions result in remand back to the agency). Although I generally agree with my colleagues, I recognize that there are limited circumstances in which we have held that a court may order equitable and other relief when agency delays and procedural violations are found. See Easton’s Point Association, Inc. v. Coastal Resources Management Council, 559 A.2d 633, 636 (R.I. 1989) (remand to the agency would be an injustice after trial justice exceeded scope of review, which unreasonably delayed adjudication of petitioner’s application); Sakonnet, 536 A.2d 897 (remand to the agency would prejudice the substantial rights of the party to have its petition adjudicated within a “reasonable” time period). I also must acknowledge that it is incumbent upon the judicial system to devise a remedy that will do justice in consideration of the significant interests of the parties involved. See Easton’s Point Association, Inc., 559 A.2d at 636. This is such a case. Other jurisdictions also have recognized this principle. See Middle Rio Grande Conservance District v. Norton, 294 F.3d 1220, 1230-31 (10th Cir. 2002) (“unique - 56 - circumstances” including, “massive delays”, and significant impact allow for court to order relief); Sierra Pacific Industries v. Lyng, 866 F.2d 1099, 1111 (9th Cir. 1989) (when reviewing agency decision, court “may adjust its relief to the exigencies of the case in accordance with the equitable principles governing judicial action”) (quoting Ford Motor Co. v. NLRB, 305 U.S. 364, 373 (1939)); N.A.A.C.P. v. Secretary of Housing & Urban Development, 817 F.2d 149, 160 (1st Cir. 1987) (“A court, where it finds unlawful agency behavior, may tailor its remedy to the occasion.”); Greene v. Babbitt, 943 F. Supp. 1278, 1287-88 (W.D. Wash. 1996) (remand not required where court loses confidence in agency ability to render impartial and expeditious decision); Benten v. Kessler, 799 F. Supp. 281, 291 (E.D.N.Y. 1992) (if “administrative misuse of procedure has delayed relief,” the court is not limited to “mere remand”). In Greene, 943 F. Supp. at 1288, the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington stated that, “when agency delays or violations of procedural requirements are so extreme that the court has no confidence in the agency’s ability to decide the matter expeditiously and fairly, it is not obligated to remand.” Rather, the court “may put an end to the matter by using its equitable powers to fashion an appropriate remedy.” Id. Furthermore, in Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization v. Federal Labor Relations Authority, 685 F.2d 547, 565 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (PATCO), the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit stated that because “the principal concerns of the court are the integrity of the process and the fairness of the result, mechanical rules have little place in a judicial decision whether to vacate a voidable agency proceeding. Instead, any such decision must of necessity be an exercise of equitable discretion.” In this case, the integrity of the administrative process was irrevocably tainted once a commissioner was threatened in an effort to gain support for the Goulet plan. The procedural - 57 - integrity was even further thwarted when five CRMC members voted to reject the subcommittee recommendation based on ex parte evidence. The six year delay from when Champlin’s filed its application, along with the troubling events that occurred during the administrative proceeding, demonstrate to me that the decision by the trial justice was a most appropriate and equitable resolution of this matter. Additionally, I find it difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish the facts of this case from our holding in Sakonnet, 536 A.2d at 897. There, the CRMC rejected the petitioner’s application to relocate his cottage to a vacant lot without making any findings of fact, a violation of § 42-35- 12. Sakonnet, 536 A.2d at 896. This Court further stated in Sakonnet that an agency decision must be supported by factual findings, its interpretation of the pertinent law, and an application of the law to the facts. Id. In a noteworthy decision by this Court, we granted the petitioner’s application to relocate his cottage based on his right to have his petition adjudicated within a reasonable time period, when, at that point, the adjudication process had taken nearly seven years. Id. My colleagues distinguish Sakonnet on the grounds that the significance of the petitioner’s application to relocate his cottage is of virtually no consequence, compared with the potential environmental impact of Champlin’s proposed expansion of its docks, and therefore, the CRMC is best equipped to adjudicate the matter. I do not disagree with the notion that Champlin’s proposed expansion is a matter of great magnitude. In fact, it is the very significance of this matter that gives me grave doubts that the CRMC will fairly and expeditiously adjudicate it upon this Court’s remand. My concerns are based on the trial justice’s findings that five CRMC members chose to support the not-on-the-record Goulet plan rather than reopen the hearings to allow the parties to address it. My doubts are deepened by Chairman Tikoian’s - 58 - threatening actions towards another commission member. My position is not meant to indicate any diminution of my respect for the CRMC, as I recognize the arduous duties that it must perform. In this particular case, however, the trial justice’s findings suggest to me that the CRMC has been compromised to such an extreme that it should not adjudicate this matter. Finally, with respect to my colleagues’ implicit, but unstated, belief that the trial justice substituted her own judgment for that of the agency in violation of § 42-35-15(g), I do not see any evidence, whatsoever, that supports that conclusion. In the majority’s view, the replacement of the CRMC decision with that of the subcommittee recommendation was unlawful because it was not one of the options available to the trial justice. I believe, however, that it was. In my view, as stated supra, the trial justice had authority to reverse or modify the CRMC decision once she found that the CRMC decision was based upon an unlawful procedure. Whether the trial justice reversed the CRMC decision by simply granting Champlin’s petition outright or modified the CRMC decision by elevating the subcommittee recommendation, she was still well within her authority under § 42-35-15(g). Moreover, the Superior Court record clearly shows that the trial justice went to great lengths to ensure that the outcome of this matter represented the judgment of the non-biased CRMC members. Instead of simply reversing the CRMC decision once she found that Champlin’s rights had been violated, which she was entitled to do, she subtracted the disqualified members’ votes based on the concept of judicial discretion that we endorsed in Birchwood Realty, Inc. v. Grant, 627 A.2d 827, 834 (R.I. 1993) (announcing that trial justice has discretion - 59 - in fashioning a remedy on agency appeals). 47 This arithmetical remedy resulted in the adoption of the subcommittee recommendation by a vote of four to three. Although I applaud her ingenuity in devising such a remedy, once the trial justice found that Champlin’s substantial rights had been prejudiced by unlawful agency procedure, she simply could have reversed the CRMC without an examination or subtraction of the votes. See Sakonnet, 536 A.2d at 897; see also Birchwood, 627 A.2d at 834.0 II Remand A Placing Ex Parte Communications on the Record in Compliance with Arnold I disagree with the majority’s holding that the trial justice erred when she did not remand the case back to the CRMC after she found that certain members had engaged in ex parte communications. Although I agree that ex parte communications in administrative proceedings are prohibited by § 42-35-13 and that parties in agency proceedings must be given notice and an opportunity to be heard, I do not believe that our holding in Arnold, 941 A.2d at 821, impliedly or otherwise requires that the administrative record must be completed with ex parte communications in every case. Here, the trial justice found that the CRMC had not only engaged in ex parte communications, but also that it had rendered a decision that was clearly erroneous based on the evidence in the record and that at least two CRMC members had demonstrated bias. Based on 47 Although my colleagues declare that Birchwood should be read narrowly to require a trial justice to either “affirm” or “remand” an agency decision on appeal, they disregard the fact that G.L. 1956 § 42-35-15(g) explicitly allows for a trial justice to “reverse” or “modify” when the substantial rights of the party have been prejudiced. See § 42-35-15 (providing for Superior Court review of contested agency cases). As stated infra, the RIAPA permits a continuation of the administrative process in the Superior Court. - 60 - these findings, the trial justice had the authority to reverse the CRMC decision under § 42-35- 15(g), as discussed supra. Because the trial justice had other grounds for reversing the CRMC, separate and apart from the fact that certain members had engaged in ex parte communications, it is my opinion that she was not compelled to remand to the CRMC to place those ex parte communications on the record. Once the trial justice reversed the CRMC decision, a remand for the purpose of completing the record with the Goulet plan would only have served to further delay and prejudice the rights of Champlin’s. See Ratcliffe v. Coastal Resources Management Council, 584 A.2d 1107, 1111 (R.I. 1991) (stating that remand would not serve justice because additional delay would be “intolerable”); see also Sakonnet, 536 A.2d at 897. Remand to the CRMC so that the ex parte communications (the Goulet plan) could be placed on the record would have been meaningless as the trial justice’s reversal of the CRMC decision effectively granted Champlin’s application for expansion. See Macera v. Cerra, 789 A.2d 890, 894-95 (R.I. 2002) (agency remand not required when further fact-finding would serve no useful purpose and cause further delay). It is my view, therefore, that when a remand to the administrative agency to complete the record with ex parte communications would serve no meaningful purpose, it is not required under our holding in Arnold. B This Court’s Power to Fashion a More Equitable Remedy Finally, if reversal of the trial justice were warranted in this case, which I strongly believe it is not, it is my view that this Court should exercise its inherent power to devise a more equitable remedy. Given the length of delay in the adjudication of this matter and the improper - 61 - conduct that was engaged in by certain CRMC members during the first proceeding, I believe it would be an injustice to instruct the trial justice to remand the matter back to the CRMC to place evidence of the Goulet plan on the record. Given this Court’s legal and equitable power to fashion an appropriate remedy, I would instead remand this matter to the trial justice so that she could hold a hearing for the limited purpose of considering the Goulet plan, and to allow the parties the opportunity to be heard with respect to the plan. See Moore v. Ballard, 914 A.2d 487, 489 (R.I. 2007) (recognizing this Court has the “inherent power to fashion an appropriate remedy that would serve the ends of justice”) (quoting Vincent v. Musone, 574 A.2d 1234, 1235 (R.I. 1990)). Once the record has been completed, the trial justice should be the final arbiter on the expansion that Champlin’s has proposed because this Court has recognized that such consideration by the Superior Court is a continuation of the administrative process. See Ratcliffe, 584 A.2d at 1111 (granting petitioners’ application without remand to CRMC based on CRMC’s failure to comply with RIAPA and extreme delay); Sakonnet, 536 A.2d at 897 (affirming trial justice’s remedy to reverse CRMC decision and grant petitioner’s application based on improper agency procedure and delay); see also § 42-35-15(g). I believe that in this particular case the trial justice is best suited to render a just and expeditious decision given her extensive knowledge of the administrative and court record. At present, the CRMC consists of three new members who, on remand, would have to read the transcripts of the twenty-three subcommittee hearings held over a period of two years. In addition to that massive undertaking, it is likely that the testimony and cross-examination concerning the Goulet plan could be drawn out for years to come and cause the earlier - 62 - subcommittee hearings to be reopened, creating further financial burdens on all parties in what has now evolved into a seven-year battle. With respect to my colleagues’ concerns that a remand to the trial justice for consideration of the Goulet plan would deny the interested parties their right to appeal, I would note that those parties would have an avenue to review the trial justice’s decision through a petition for writ of certiorari to this Court. A remand to the trial justice would allow the interested parties and intervenors an opportunity to examine the evidence in support of the Goulet plan, which is, ironically, an opportunity which they were denied during the initial proceeding. 48 In essence, the trial justice would simply be replacing the CRMC for the purposes of considering the Goulet plan. Upon entry of final judgment by the trial justice, the aggrieved party would then, if it so desired, be able to seek review of the trial court’s decision to this Court through a petition for writ of certiorari. In consideration of the patently unfair nature of the initial CRMC proceedings and this Court’s power to fashion an appropriate remedy in the interests of justice, the Superior Court would be the proper forum to adjudicate this matter both fairly and expeditiously. I therefore dissent from the majority’s decision to reverse the trial justice’s decision and the majority’s decision to remand the matter back to the CRMC. Justice Goldberg did not participate. 48 It is important to note that the Goulet plan was not conceived nor proposed by the parties or the intervenors; rather, it was created and introduced by members of the CRMC after the subcommittee hearings had closed. The CRMC never reopened the hearings so that the parties could have an opportunity to examine the evidence supporting the Goulet plan. - 63 - RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE: Champlin’s Realty Associates v.

Sometimes referred to as the “Bermuda of the North,” it is a place of spectacular beauty. For generations, vacationers have flocked to the island during the short summer months to relax and enjoy the beaches and unspoiled vistas that nature has provided. Although the island is home to a small airport, the vast majority of visitors arrive by boat— including regular ferry service and private vessels. As is the case in many coastal communities, dock and mooring space can be at a premium.', 'Champlin’s Realty Associates (Champlin’s) operates a large marina on Block Island serving the needs of boaters and their craft. Concerned that it lacked the space to meet its', '-1- business demands, Champlin’s filed an application to expand its operation to a substantial degree. The dispute over that proposed expansion, involving Champlin’s, the Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC or council), the Town of New Shoreham1 (town), and a number of intervening environmental groups, has finally wended its way to this Court. After carefully reviewing the record, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court in part, reverse in part, and remand to the Superior Court with instructions that it remand this matter to the CRMC for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.', 'I', 'Factual Background', 'The CRMC is a state agency charged with protecting and regulating Rhode Island’s coastal resources. General Laws 1956 § 46-23-1(b)(1). Champlin’s Realty Associates, a Rhode Island corporation, filed an application with the CRMC to extend its existing marina 240 feet into the Great Salt Pond in the Town of New Shoreham to accommodate 140 additional boats. The proposed expansion included 2,990 feet of fixed pier and an additional 755 feet of floating docks. Under the proposal, the additional dockage would extend from the existing marina. The CRMC has the statutory authority to grant applications for such expansions of existing marinas. Section 46-23-6(4)(iii).', 'The Town of New Shoreham and intervenors, the Block Island Land Trust, the Conservation Law Foundation, the Committee for the Great Salt Pond, and the Block Island Conservancy, opposed the application. When the CRMC receives a written objection to an application, the proceeding then becomes “contested” under the CRMC Management Procedures. The CRMC Management Procedures further provide that such contested cases be 1', 'New Shoreham is the only municipality on Block Island.', '-2- the subject of a public hearing before a “duly authorized and appointed Subcommittee.” 2 Pursuant to his authority and in accordance with the relevant CRMC Management Procedures, the CRMC chairman Michael Tikoian appointed a subcommittee composed of five members: Jerry Sahagian, Thomas Ricci, Gerald P. Zarrella, and Paul E. Lemont as chairman. 3', 'A', 'Subcommittee Hearings', 'The subcommittee held twenty-three public hearings over the course of two years from the time of Champlin’s application in 2003 until its final hearing on September 16, 2005. Extensive testimony and voluminous exhibits were received during the hearings, which reportedly were the longest and most exhaustive in CRMC history. The protracted hearings were rancorous and hotly disputed, not only among the parties but also among the subcommittee members.', 'Subsequently, the four subcommittee members eligible to vote held a public workshop on October 24, 2005, to make findings of fact based on the evidence that had been presented to them, and to decide upon the recommendation that the subcommittee would make to the full CRMC. Subcommittee member Ricci commented during the public workshop that “clearly, this is an emotional, very difficult issue.” Subcommittee member Zarrella asserted at the public workshop: “I wish Mike Tikoian never put me on this committee, 23 meetings. * * * I don’t want to be here.” It was clear that tension arose in this case because of a conflict involving the implications of the marina expansion into the environmentally sensitive Great Salt 2', 'The CRMC is authorized to appoint a hearing officer, but the CRMC chairman is also authorized to designate a subcommittee to “act as hearing officers in any contested case” if the hearing officers “are otherwise engaged and unable to hear the matter in a timely fashion.” G.L. 1956 § 46-23-20.1(e). 3', 'Tikoian also appointed Senator Susan Sosnowski, but she did not participate in the subcommittee’s hearings or its recommendation.', '-3- Pond and the reality that dockage for watercraft is necessary for the general public to have access to the island.', 'As chairman of the subcommittee, Lemont addressed those present at the workshop and praised “both sides” for their “outstanding presentation.” He noted that after looking at the evidence, “there is no right and there is no wrong. * * * We’re looking at what is the best fitted decision that will impact all of the concerns raised.” Lemont expressed his conclusion that “[t]here has to be compromise,” and he supported neither the grant of the full application nor its outright denial.', 'He was not alone; during the public workshop, all four members of the subcommittee voiced their opinions against the full requested expansion in the application, and three members, Chairman Lemont excluded, indicated that they would support a middle ground of an expansion of 170 feet.', 'Lemont stated at the public workshop that he would “not support anything more than 100 feet.” Sahagian expressed his wish that “the Town or the objectors did try to compromise a little bit more.” He went on to say that “what I am thinking right now is the Town at one point was at 100 feet, the applicant was at 240. [One-hundred and seventy feet] is in the middle.” Ricci commented, “I am not in favor of approving the application as it’s stated, for 240 feet. But, I also agree with my fellow subcommittee members, that I’m not in favor of denying the application outright.” He concluded that “[t]he applicant seeks 240 feet. They’re not going to get my recommendation for that or my vote for that.” Zarrella remarked that he “wished [the town] left that plan in there for 100 feet. It would have been a lot * * * easier if [they] left the plan there, but when they took it out at the public meeting, it’s been difficult for me.” He went on to say, “I can’t say no expansion. I can’t say it. The evidence is not there. The evidence is there for expansion. And, I can’t say 240 feet.” Further, Zarrella concluded that “I’m on the', '-4- page that the Chairman is, of a compromise, but I think [that] I’m on a page that I’m a little bit more -- I want to give a little bit more.” He lamented, “[the] Town’s hands are tied. The plans for 100 feet came in too late. As far as I was concerned, it should have come in earlier and I think you guys could have negotiated it out a long time ago.”', 'On January 10, 2006, the subcommittee made forty-seven findings of fact and issued a recommendation with the three votes in favor of a scaled-down modification of the proposal to 170 feet, rather than 240 feet, and one vote, Lemont, against.', 'B', 'Full Council Hearing', 'On February 28, 2006, the CRMC met in accordance with § 46-23-20.4(a) and the CRMC Management Procedures 5.3(2) and 5.3(3) to consider the record, evidence, and the subcommittee’s recommendation, as well as Champlin’s argument that the CRMC should adopt the recommendation. The CRMC is vested with the authority, in its discretion, to adopt, modify or reject the subcommittee recommendation, findings of fact, and conclusions of law if the rationale for doing so is provided in writing. Section 46-23-20.4(a). However, before it could take up the subcommittee recommendation, the CRMC first addressed Champlin’s previously filed motions to disqualify both Tikoian and member David Abedon from participating on the basis of public statements made by them after the vote of the subcommittee. After denying those motions, the CRMC proceeded to consider the subcommittee’s recommendation. The transcript reveals that the meeting, like the subcommittee proceedings that preceded it, was rife with tension.', 'Ultimately, five members of the full council, including Zarrella, voted to approve the subcommittee’s recommendation, while five members, including Lemont and Tikoian, voted', '-5- against adoption. The resulting tie vote constituted a rejection of the recommendation. On July 5, 2006, the CRMC issued its written decision denying Champlin’s application. That same day, the five members who voted in favor of adopting the subcommittee’s recommendation released “Findings of Fact of the CRMC Members in Support of the Subcommittee Recommendation.”', 'II', 'Procedural Background', 'A', 'Administrative Appeal', 'In the midst of an atmosphere of hostility and tension, an appeal to the Superior Court ensued. The Superior Court has jurisdiction to hear appeals from administrative agencies such as the CRMC under the Rhode Island Administrative Procedures Act, G.L. 1956 § 42-35-15. On March 23, 2006, Champlin’s filed a complaint in the Superior Court, in which it sought judicial review of the CRMC’s decision rejecting its application. 4', 'In count 1 of its complaint, Champlin’s asserted that when the CRMC rejected the subcommittee recommendation and denied its application for expansion the agency (1) affected Champlin’s substantial rights in violation of constitutional or statutory procedure; (2) acted in excess of its statutory authority; (3) made use of unlawful procedure; (4) made a decision that was affected by other error of law, and was arbitrary, capricious, and characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion. In count 2, Champlin’s alleged that the refusal to disqualify Tikoian and Abedon violated Champlin’s right to procedural and substantive due process under the Constitution and laws of Rhode Island, the Constitution of the United States, and the CRMC 4', 'The town also brought an administrative appeal from the failure of the CRMC to approve the Harbor Management Plan submitted in 1999. This appeal was consolidated with Champlin’s appeal. The trial justice dismissed the town’s appeal without prejudice on the grounds that the', '-6- management practices. In count 3, Champlin’s averred that Tikoian and Abedon should have recused themselves from considering Champlin’s application.', 'As a remedy, Champlin’s requested that the Superior Court rule that the vote taken with Tikoian’s and Abedon’s participation was void and that it remand the matter to the CRMC with directions to approve the subcommittee’s recommendation and order Tikoian and Abedon to cease participation in proceedings regarding Champlin’s application.', 'Also, after extensive evidentiary hearings before the Superior Court, Champlin’s moved to disqualify Tikoian, Lemont, and members Gray, Sullivan, Gomez, and Dawson from further participation in the application should it be remanded to the CRMC. Champlin’s also moved to disqualify the votes of Tikoian, Lemont, Gray, and Sullivan from the CRMC vote taken on February 28, 2006.', 'B', 'Evidentiary Hearing', 'Pursuant to § 42-35-15(f), Champlin’s filed a motion requesting an evidentiary hearing before the trial justice to determine the existence of any procedural irregularities during the course of the CRMC proceedings. 5 The CRMC objected to the motion for an evidentiary hearing arguing, inter alia, that the evidentiary hearing inevitably would intrude on the mental processes of the agency members as they formulated their opinions, recommendations, and evaluations in violation of quasi-judicial immunity. Even though she granted the motion for an evidentiary hearing, the trial justice assured the parties that “I don’t expect to have council town did not have standing under G.L. 1956 § 42-35-15. This ruling has not been appealed to this Court. 5', 'Section 42-35-15(f) provides:', '“The review shall be conducted by the court without a jury and', 'shall be confined to the record. In cases of alleged irregularities in', 'procedure before the agency, not shown in the record, proof', '-7- members queried on their mental processes, their mental impressions. I will look at whether or not there were outside influences and improper influences that got in it, and those improper influences in and of themselves may or may not give rise to a court decision that they infected whatever determination that the council made.” As a result of the trial justice’s ruling, there followed sixteen hearings from March 19, 2007, until April 13, 2007.', 'i', 'Arnold Show-Cause Hearing', 'Also, it is significant that on January 2, 2008, after the hearings before her were concluded and after this Court issued Arnold v. Lebel, 941 A.2d 813 (R.I. 2007), a case that proscribed ex parte contacts at the agency level, the trial justice issued a show-cause order that asked the parties to “show cause why Plaintiff’s appeal should not be granted” based on the likelihood that Arnold “prohibit[ed] the type of off the record communications” revealed by the evidentiary hearing. The show-cause hearing was held on January 23, 2008. At that hearing, the intervenors requested the opportunity to present evidence concerning the potential disqualification of subcommittee member Zarrella. The trial justice allowed the intervenors to proffer evidence supporting the disqualification of both Zarrella and Sahagian, as well as the propriety of reopening the evidentiary hearing. After considering the intervenors’ arguments, the trial justice permitted a limited hearing as to Zarrella. That hearing was held on April 9, 2008.', 'ii', 'Trial Court’s Findings', 'The trial justice made extensive factual findings and credibility determinations regarding the testimony of the witnesses during the sixteen evidentiary hearings, the show-cause hearing,', 'thereon may be taken in court. The court, upon request, shall hear', 'oral argument and receive written briefs.”', '-8- and the hearing regarding Zarrella. The trial court concluded, based on the testimony, that the CRMC members “did not appreciate the quasi-judicial nature of their roles or the prohibition against ex parte communications.” Specifically, the trial justice found that Tikoian demonstrated his prejudgment of the application through numerous ex parte contacts. Similarly, the trial justice found that Lemont also revealed his preconceived opinion and resultant bias at the evidentiary hearings because of his comments about his unwavering support for a “compromise plan.” The trial justice also found that Zarrella “failed to appreciate the quasi-judicial nature of his role,” based on statements he made to town officials and his remarks before the full council. As a result, the trial justice found that due to their bias, Lemont and Zarrella should have been disqualified from participating in the workshop and that the two of them, as well as Tikoian, should not have taken part in the CRMC decision.', 'The trial justice also found that Tikoian and Lemont wrongfully collaborated to produce a compromise plan after the subcommittee hearings were completed and that they “made no secret” about their opposition to the application as filed. She found that Lemont requested that Grover Fugate, executive director of the CRMC, create an alternate plan and that Fugate in turn had asked Dan Goulet, a staff engineer, to prepare this plan. The resultant plan, the “Goulet plan,” proposed a compromise of sorts that would extend the marina by 100 feet to the west. Goulet testified at the evidentiary hearing that he reviewed information that was not included in the record of the subcommittee proceedings when he created the alternate plan. As a result, the parties and intervenors were deprived of the opportunity to cross-examine Goulet about the alternate plan during the CRMC proceedings.', 'The trial justice further found that Tikoian “lobbied” the members of the subcommittee to support the Goulet plan through informal meetings at a member’s workplace, at Tikoian’s home,', '-9- and through telephone calls. Zarrella testified that he, Sahagian, and Ricci were angered by the telephone calls that they received the night before the workshop, which the trial justice inferred were from Tikoian or Lemont. Furthermore, Zarrella, Sahagian, and Ricci objected to the introduction of slides depicting the merits of the Goulet plan and were so incensed that they threatened to walk out of the workshop. As a result, Goulet did not present the slides. The trial justice, however, found that Lemont then took it upon himself “to advocate[] a compromise that was clearly based upon the Goulet plan” because Lemont also “suggested a 100-foot seawall [sic] plan and spoke of expansion to the west.” In finding that Lemont had prejudged the case and become an advocate in favor of what he termed “a compromise,” the trial justice cited Lemont’s testimony at the evidentiary hearing that “I came up with a compromise that I thought would solve the problem, and that’s what I wanted to do. I was chairman of the subcommittee. I had heard the testimony. I had heard the comments of the subcommittee. * * * And I came up with a conclusion that perhaps there might be a compromise that would settle this matter.”', 'The trial justice also made several credibility determinations with regard to testimony about certain comments Tikoian had made expressing his disappointment in the subcommittee recommendation that were published in the Providence Journal and the Block Island Times, as well as Tikoian’s interactions with Governor Carcieri and his staff. The trial justice found that Tikoian had “expressed how he intended to vote” at the CRMC meeting to reporter Peter Lord of the Providence Journal. Additionally, the trial justice found that Tikoian informed the Governor that he predicted a tie vote.', 'Based on these findings, the trial justice held that Champlin’s substantial rights had been prejudiced by consideration of the Goulet plan. Further, the court held that the CRMC decision was made upon unlawful procedure and in excess of the CRMC’s statutory authority.', '- 10 - Additionally, the trial justice found that Champlin’s substantial and constitutional rights were violated when Tikoian and Lemont voted on the application, despite what she found to be their demonstrated bias against it.', 'iii', 'Remedy', 'Section 42-35-15(g) provides that the trial court “may affirm the decision of the [CRMC] or remand the case for further proceedings, or it may reverse or modify the decision * * *.” The trial justice considered it within her discretion to decide on the appropriate remedy. She declined to remand the case to the CRMC for further proceedings because it was her understanding that the General Assembly would be required to pass legislation to implement our advisory opinion entitled In re Request for Advisory Opinion from the House of Representatives (Coastal Resources Management Council), 961 A.2d 930 (R.I. 2008). We advised in that opinion that proposed legislation permitting lawmakers to sit as members of the CRMC, and allowing the General Assembly to make appointments to the agency, was unconstitutional in light of the separation-of-powers amendments to the Rhode Island Constitution. Id. at 940-41. The trial justice expressed concern that any progress on remand would be delayed by the appointment and confirmation process necessary to create a viable CRMC to hear the matter. Thus, the trial justice was “not inclined to remand this case” because it would result in further delay in Champlin’s efforts to obtain a decision on its application.', 'Rather, in reliance on Acierno v. Folsom, 337 A.2d 309, 317 (Del. 1975), the trial justice simply subtracted the votes of the three disqualified members from the five to five tie vote rendered at the CRMC full council meeting. 6 Accordingly, the trial justice refigured the final 6', 'The trial justice subtracted the votes of Tikoian, Lemont, and Zarrella.', '- 11 - vote to four to three in favor of adopting the subcommittee recommendation. She found that the twenty-three subcommittee hearings were unchallenged as to their fairness and that they were untainted by the participation of Zarrella and Lemont. Additionally, the trial justice found that the subcommittee’s recommendation was supported by the record amassed at the twenty-three subcommittee hearings. Ultimately, she “[upheld] the decision of the full Council members supporting the Subcommittee Recommendation” because it was “supported by the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence of record.” 7', 'The CRMC, Tikoian, and intervenors, the Conservation Law Foundation, the Committee for Great Salt Pond, the Town of New Shoreham, the Block Island Land Trust, and the Block Island Conservancy (petitioners), sought review of the Superior Court’s decision by petition for certiorari on April 20, 2009, which we granted. 8', 'III', 'Standard of Review', 'The Rhode Island Administrative Procedure Act (RIAPA) chapter 35 of title 42 governs the Superior Court’s review of an administrative appeal. Section 42-35-15(g) of the RIAPA sets forth that:', '“The court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the agency', 'as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.

Rossi v. Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island, 895 A.2d 106, 110 (R.I. 2006) (citing Johnston Ambulatory Surgical Associates, Ltd. v. Nolan, 755 A.2d 799, 805 (R.I. 2000)). The factual findings of the administrative agency are entitled to great deference. Id. (citing In re Advisory Opinion to the Governor, 732 A.2d 55, 60 (R.I. 1999)). However, when the review of the trial court’s decision is conducted under a writ of certiorari, as it is here, “this [C]ourt applies the ‘some’ or ‘any’ evidence test and reviews the record to determine whether legally competent evidence exists to support the findings.” Sartor v. Coastal Resources Management Council, 542 A.2d 1077, 1082-83 (R.I. 1988).', 'IV', 'Analysis', 'A', 'Standing', 'As an initial matter, we will address Champlin’s argument that the CRMC, Tikoian, and the intervenors are not aggrieved parties within the meaning of § 42-35-16, the section of the RIAPA that establishes the requirements for petitioning for a writ of certiorari in this Court after a review of an agency decision by the Superior, Family, or District Court. Specifically, § 42-35- 16 requires the petitioner to be “aggrieved by a final judgment of the [S]uperior, [F]amily, or', '- 13 - [D]istrict [C]ourt.” We are of the opinion that Tikoian, the CRMC, and the intervenors are all aggrieved parties within the statute and, therefore, properly are before this Court.', 'We do not agree with Champlin’s argument that the intervenors are not aggrieved because they have not alleged an environmental injury in fact. The clear language of § 42-35-16 is that the petitioners must establish that they are aggrieved by “a final judgment.” Champlin’s relies on cases defining the aggrievement requirements for a party seeking judicial review of an agency decision under § 42-35-15(a), which requires the party to be “aggrieved by a final order in a contested case.” East Greenwich Yacht Club v. Coastal Resources Management Council, 118 R.I. 559, 564, 376 A.2d 682, 684-85 (1977); see also Blackstone Valley Chamber of Commerce v. Public Utilities Commission, 452 A.2d 931, 933 n.3, 934 (R.I. 1982) (holding petitioner did not have standing because petitioner was not aggrieved by commission’s order). However, it was Champlin’s, and not the intervenors, which sought relief under § 42-35-15. Champlin’s took advantage of that statutory path of review when it appealed to the Superior Court. The court’s substitution of the CRMC decision with the subcommittee recommendation left the intervenors with no avenue of review except through the discretionary writ of certiorari. Therefore, in our view, the intervernors are aggrieved by the Superior Court’s final judgment and properly before this Court.', 'B', 'Evidentiary Hearing', 'The CRMC and Tikoian argue that the Superior Court erred when it granted the evidentiary hearing and that the hearing inevitably delved into the mental processes of the agency members who testified—testimony that the trial justice relied upon in her decision. Conversely, Champlin’s argues that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion in conducting', '- 14 - the evidentiary hearing and it further contends that the trial justice did not rely on any of the members’ deliberative processes when she made her decision.', 'We are of the opinion that the trial justice did not err when she granted the evidentiary hearing. Pursuant to § 42-35-15(f), in the event of “alleged irregularities in procedure before the agency, not shown in the record, proof thereon may be taken in the court.” Standing alone, allegations of impropriety with respect to the off-the-record Goulet plan are sufficient to support the trial justice’s election to hold an evidentiary hearing to determine whether procedural irregularities occurred at the agency hearings.', 'The trial justice did not abuse her discretion in granting the hearing even in the face of the possibility that the mental processes of the agency members might be divulged during the hearing. Indeed, prior to the evidentiary hearing, the parties discussed at length the danger that the hearing inevitably would delve into the agency members’ mental processes. The trial justice vigorously assured the parties that the hearing would not intrude on the members’ mental processes. Additionally, it is well settled that “a trial justice, unlike a jury, can disregard prejudicial material if and when he or she determines that material to be inadmissible.” State v. Notarantonio, 622 A.2d 457, 458 (R.I. 1993). The trial justice promised that she would “run a tight ship,” and she warned the attorneys that her ability to disregard such information did not give them free rein to make such impermissible inquiries.', 'C', 'Quasi-Judicial Immunity', 'The problem here, as we see it, is that even though the trial justice properly recognized the dangers inherent in this type of hearing, she repeatedly disregarded her own ground rules. The petitioners argue that quasi-judicial officers, like judges, should not be called upon to testify', '- 15 - about their mental processes in coming to their decisions. 9 In contrast, Champlin’s urges that this issue is a “red herring” because the trial justice did not rely on the agency members’ mental processes when she made her decision.', 'After careful review of the transcripts, it is our opinion that the quasi-judicial immunity of the CRMC members repeatedly was violated over objection by the CRMC. The quasi-judicial nature of the CRMC gives rise to certain protections, akin to those enjoyed by the judiciary, to preserve the integrity of adjudication and final judgment. See In re Request for Advisory Opinion (CRMC), 961 A.2d at 940 (“the CRMC combines functions that must properly be characterized as executive with functions that are * * * quasi-judicial in nature”); Richardson v.

Although the trial justice assured the parties on the record prior to the evidentiary hearing that mental processes would be off-limits in their questioning, she did not consistently adhere to this crucial pledge. For example, Tikoian testified that', '“My compromise thinking process at that time was that this was a', 'big project. It’d be best if the town and applicant could work', 'something out or whoever could work it out for you as the', 'authoritative body so it was my thought process you try to work', 'out a compromise and we’ll make life easier for all of us.

In Arnold, we stressed that “no litigious facts should reach the decision maker off the record in an administrative hearing.” Arnold, 941 A.2d at 821. Thus, under § 42-35-9(e) and § 42-35-10(4), if the decision maker “intends to consult any documentary source or person concerning facts or opinions about the merits of an appeal,” he or she must notify the parties so that they may “contest any such evidence” and “cross-examine any people consulted.”', 'Arnold, 941 A.2d at 821.', 'This prohibition extends to the decision maker’s communications with agency staff members, although communication regarding general matters is permissible. Id.', 'Goulet Plan', 'It is clear to us—and the petitioners do not dispute—that Lemont’s and Tikoian’s communications with the CRMC staff members about the Goulet plan and the plan itself represent ex parte contacts under our holding in Arnold. The Goulet plan is an ex parte contact under § 42-35-13 because Lemont, a decision maker, consulted the director of the CRMC, 10', 'Section 42-35-13 provides:', '“Unless required for the disposition of ex parte matters authorized', 'by law, members or employees of an agency assigned to render an', 'order or to make findings of fact and conclusions of law in a', 'contested case shall not, directly or indirectly, in connection with', 'any issue of fact, communicate with any person or party, nor, in', 'connection with any issue of law, with any party or his or her', 'representative, except upon notice and opportunity for all parties to', 'participate; but any agency member:', '“(1) May communicate with other members of the agency, and', '“(2) May have the aid and advice of one or more personal assistants.”', '- 19 - Fugate, about facts concerning the merits of an appeal, specifically, whether another feasible plan might be conceived. See Arnold, 941 A.2d at 821. Fugate, in turn, requested that Goulet create such an alternate plan. Thus, as the trial justice ruled, the Goulet plan clearly falls within the ambit of our holding in Arnold, and it should have been included in the administrative record and subject to cross-examination. See id.', 'Tikoian’s Contact with the Governor and His Staff', 'Similarly, we decline to disturb the trial justice’s finding that Tikoian’s contacts with Governor Carcieri and his staff also constituted impermissible ex parte contacts within § 42-35- 13 as interpreted by this Court in Arnold. The petitioners concede that Tikoian’s presence in the Governor’s office during the presentation by the CRMC staff may be considered an ex parte contact under Arnold. However, they maintain that the communications between Tikoian and the Governor’s office pertained solely to procedure, and thus those contacts do not come within the purview of § 42-35-13.', 'The trial justice, after hearing testimony from her ring-side seat at the evidentiary hearing, “reject[ed] [Governor’s aide Mark] Adelman’s effort to back away from” his statement that Tikoian predicted a tie vote.11 Further, the trial court also found that Tikoian “also wanted to obtain the Governor’s input and approval of the course he was taking.” Adelman testified that “the Governor did indicate at that meeting that the alternative plan * * * was a better option than the full plan.” Thus, Tikoian, as a decision maker on the CRMC, sought an off-the-record opinion from a third party about the merits of the application when he took the initiative to engage the Governor and determine the Governor’s feelings about the pending application. But, 11', 'Mark Adelman was a policy analyst in Governor Carcieri’s office assigned to advise the Governor with regard to the CRMC and Champlin’s application. He communicated with Tikoian about Champlin’s application.', '- 20 - the parties were not notified of this consultation and it never became part of the record. Therefore, the Governor’s opinion reached the decision maker off the record in violation of Arnold’s interpretation of § 42-35-13.', 'Remedy for Ex Parte Contacts', 'The trial justice correctly noted that although Arnold “clarified illicit ex parte communications in the administrative context in Rhode Island, it did not provide a specific remedy for such improper contact.” The petitioners submit that the trial justice erred because she did not remand the matter to the CRMC. They argue that the trial court misinterpreted the impact of In re Request for Advisory Opinion (CRMC), on the ability of the CRMC to expeditiously hear the matter on remand. They further argue that the failure to remand to the agency deprives the petitioners, including the intervenors, of an appeal as of right to the Superior Court from the CRMC decision and restricts them to seeking the discretionary writ of certiorari from this Court. This, they say, is a violation of their right to due process. Champlin’s submits that the trial justice did not err in declining to remand to the CRMC because the decision whether to remand the matter to the CRMC was within her discretion, and remand was neither required nor feasible.', 'In our opinion, the trial justice erred when she simply subtracted the votes of the members that she held to be biased and when she elevated the subcommittee recommendation to become, in effect, a final decision of the CRMC, because the recommendation was untainted by the Goulet plan. We hold, especially in light of our decision in Arnold, that the only appropriate remedy here is remand to the agency for supplementation of the record with the ex parte communications to be included to allow the parties to appropriately respond and cross-examine. See Arnold, 941 A.2d at 821.', '- 21 -', 'Under Arnold, Lemont’s contacts with Fugate and Goulet may have been proper had he notified the parties of his intention to seek out an alternate plan, disclosed the request and the resultant plan on the record, and invited the parties to contest the evidence contained in the plan and to cross-examine Goulet concerning his findings. See Arnold, 941 A.2d at 821. But here, the parties were not afforded the opportunity to contest the Goulet plan. Indeed, the Goulet plan was not created until all the evidence had been submitted to the subcommittee and the hearings were concluded. Thus, the Goulet plan represents the very type of “secret evidence” proscribed in Arnold, and the Superior Court should have remanded the matter to the CRMC for supplementation of the record. See Arnold, 941 A.2d at 822.', 'It is the petitioners’ position that the CRMC is constitutionally sound and “able to act.” The parties agreed that, at the time of oral argument before this Court, the CRMC was composed of eight members, all of whom were gubernatorial appointees. In In re Request for Advisory Opinion, this Court advised that, in light of the 2004 separation-of-powers amendments to the Rhode Island Constitution and the CRMC’s exercise of executive power, it was unconstitutional for members of the General Assembly to serve on the council or for the General Assembly to appoint the CRMC members. In re Request for Advisory Opinion (CRMC), 961 A.2d at 933, 941-42. Rather, it is the Governor who has the constitutional authority to appoint CRMC members with the advice and consent of the Senate. Id. at 942. Although the trial justice noted that we acknowledged the de facto validity of the CRMC’s acts since the 2004 amendments, she incorrectly concluded that legislation was required to “accommodate” this Court’s advisory opinion when she declined to remand the matter to the agency.', 'The trial justice was also concerned about further delays that would be occasioned by the legislative process and gubernatorial appointments. Although it is unfortunate that this litigation', '- 22 - has been stewing for nearly seven years, both parties have contributed to its longevity. Given the serious environmental impact on the Great Salt Pond that the expansion of the marina may engender, a decision on Champlin’s application cannot be made lightly. Thus, we do not accept the Superior Court’s analogy to Sakonnet Rogers, Inc. v. Coastal Resources Management Council, 536 A.2d 893, 897 (R.I. 1988), in which this Court reversed a CRMC decision because of the CRMC’s failure to base its decision on any of the required criteria and declined to remand to the agency in light of the seven years that had elapsed since the application was filed. The issue in Sakonnet revolved around an application for alteration of a shoreline in connection with the relocation of a single small cottage to an empty lot. Id. at 894. There is simply no comparison between the discrete facts in that case and the situation currently before us, to say nothing of the major environmental considerations before the CRMC in this application to expand a substantial marina into an ecologically sensitive coastal feature.', 'Therefore, this Court holds that the trial justice erred as a matter of law in not remanding the case to the CRMC to supplement the record with the Goulet plan and to allow the parties to respond and cross-examine.', 'E', 'Trial Court’s Finding of Bias', 'A finding of bias is a finding of fact. Kelley v. City Council of Cranston, 61 R.I. 472, 484, 1 A.2d 185, 190 (1938). Therefore, we afford great deference to the trial justice’s finding that Tikoian, Lemont, and Zarrella were biased and will overturn her findings of bias only if they are not supported by legally competent evidence. See Sartor, 542 A.2d at 1082-83.', 'When an administrative agency carries out a quasi-judicial function, it has an obligation of impartiality on par with that of judges. See Town of Richmond v. Wawaloam Reservation,', '- 23 - Inc., 850 A.2d 924, 933 (R.I. 2004). Under the Fourteenth Amendment, administrative tribunals must not be “biased or otherwise indisposed from rendering a fair and impartial decision.” Davis v. Wood, 444 A.2d 190, 192 (R.I. 1982); see also Marshall v. Jerrico, Inc., 446 U.S. 238, 242 (1980) (“The Due Process Clause entitles a person to an impartial and disinterested tribunal * * *.”). At the same time, as the trial justice noted, adjudicators in administrative agencies enjoy a “presumption of honesty and integrity.” Davis, 444 A.2d at 192. This presumption may be overcome through evidence that “the same person(s) involved in building one party’s adversarial case is also adjudicating the determinative issues” or if “other special circumstances render the risk of unfairness intolerably high.”', 'Kent County Water Authority v. State (Department of Health), 723 A.2d 1132, 1137 (R.I. 1999) (citing La Petite Auberge, Inc. v. Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights, 419 A.2d 274, 285 (R.I. 1980)). Significantly, an agency adjudicator must not become an “advocate or participant.” Davis v. Wood, 427 A.2d 332, 337 (R.I. 1981). To maintain public confidence in the fairness of the agency’s decision making, an agency adjudicator also must not prejudge a matter before the agency. See Barbara Realty Co. v. Zoning Board of Review of Cranston, 85 R.I. 152, 156, 128 A.2d 342, 344 (1957). This Court has held that a judge must recuse himself or herself when the judge possesses “a ‘personal bias or prejudice by reason of a preconceived and settled opinion of a character calculated to impair his [or her] impartiality seriously and sway his [or her] judgment.’” Ryan v. Roman Catholic Bishop of Providence, 941 A.2d 174, 185 (R.I.), cert. denied, 129 S.Ct. 422 (2008) (quoting Kelley v. Rhode Island Public Transit Authority, 740 A.2d 1243, 1246 (R.I. 1999)).', 'It is important to note that engaging in ex parte contacts alone does not automatically render a decision maker biased. See Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization v. Federal', '- 24 - Labor Relations Authority, 685 F.2d 547, 573 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (PATCO). Moreover, the term “ex parte contact” has more than one meaning in the context of this case. 12 In concert with other conduct, however, an agency adjudicator’s ex parte contacts may support a finding of bias. See Eacret v. Bonner County, 86 P.3d 494, 500 (Idaho 2004) (citing Barbara Realty Co., 85 R.I. at 156, 128 A.2d at 344) (characterizing agency adjudicator’s prejudgment of proceeding, as evidenced through public statements along with the same adjudicator’s ex parte communications, as a “cause for concern” and as factually similar to Barbara Realty).', 'As the trial justice correctly stated, Rhode Island’s “standard for disqualification based on bias or prejudice is well-settled.” We are satisfied that the trial justice’s factual findings of bias with respect to Tikoian and Zarrella are supported by legally competent evidence.', 'Michael Tikoian', 'The petitioners all maintain that Tikoian’s contacts with subcommittee members should not be considered ex parte. In addition, the intervenors maintain that those contacts with the Governor and his staff and the statements to the media should not be considered ex parte communications. Also, the CRMC and Tikoian further contend that, even if the communications with the Governor and his staff and his statements to the media are ex parte contacts, they do not support a finding of bias. Not surprisingly, Champlin’s argues that the trial justice had a “sufficient evidentiary basis” to disqualify Tikoian.', 'The trial justice relied on several of what she found to be contraventions of Tikoian’s “role as an agency adjudicator” in concluding that he was biased. First, the trial justice cited 12', 'An ex parte contact such as was present in Arnold v. Lebel, 941 A.2d 813 (R.I. 2007) may be completely free of any bias, partiality, or prejudgment on behalf of an agency adjudicator who seeks the off-the-record information. These are not ex parte contacts in the traditional sense of the term, that is, an adjudicator’s off-the-record communication with an interested individual. Therefore, the meaning “ex parte” in the context of the bias analysis is distinct from the meaning used in the Arnold analysis.', '- 25 - Tikoian’s communication with various subcommittee members wherein he promised a “compromise plan” and his subsequent efforts to “lobby” them to support the ultimate Goulet plan. This, she found, violated the statutory prohibition against ex parte contacts with the subcommittee members. The trial justice noted that Tikoian’s attempt to exert influence over the subcommittee went to the extent of threatening one member that he would not be reappointed to his seat on the CRMC if he did not support the Goulet plan. Second, the trial justice relied on Tikoian’s contact with the Governor’s office as evidence that he had “abandoned his role as an impartial adjudicator.”', 'Third, the trial justice pointed to Tikoian’s communications with reporters as an indication of the “degree of his prejudgment.” The trial justice thus found that these contacts, “in the aggregate,” established Tikoian’s bias and necessitated his disqualification.', 'Mindful of our standard of review, we hold that the trial justice’s finding that Tikoian was biased is supported by legally competent evidence. Importantly, the bases for her finding of Tikoian’s bias and resultant disqualification related to his specific actions and not to his mental processes as an agency adjudicator. She found that he settled on a desired outcome long before the full council hearing and that he worked tirelessly to advance it. The trial justice concluded that Tikoian’s efforts to sway the subcommittee and the full CRMC, his statements to the press, and his attempt to divine the position of the Governor’s office, all evinced “‘a preconceived or settled opinion.’” See Ryan, 941 A.2d at 185. She also ruled that he improperly advocated against the grant of Champlin’s application by making no secret to his colleagues or the local media of his support for an alternative plan and his disdain for Champlin’s proposed expansion. See Davis, 427 A.2d at 337.', 'Thus, she held that Tikoian publicly prejudged Champlin’s application and that he was incapable of fulfilling the role of “an impartial trier of fact.” See id.', '- 26 - In doing so, she made extensive credibility determinations during the evidentiary hearing, to which we defer, and, which we decline to disturb on appeal. Champlin’s is entitled under the guarantees of due process to feel confident that an impartial administrative tribunal is conscientiously considering its application on the basis of “its own circumstances.” See id.', 'It is not our intent to discourage healthy debate among members of a quasi-judicial board. We do, however, accept the trial justice’s holding that Tikoian crossed the line in advocating for one position over another.', 'Further, we recognize that carrying out the functions of state government requires cooperation and the exchange of ideas. The Governor and his staff have an understandable interest in staying abreast of the progress of a high profile matter affecting Rhode Island. However, we are also of the opinion that staying current on important issues moving through agency proceedings can and must be done without engaging in undisclosed ex parte contacts. Particularly in light of the fact that Tikoian was the chairman of the CRMC, it is “in keeping with the high canons of justice and fair play if he is disqualified.” Barbara Realty Co., 85 R.I. at 157, 128 A.2d at 344. We affirm the trial justice’s finding that Tikoian’s bias warranted his disqualification from participation with regard to Champlin’s application.', 'Gerald Zarrella', 'We also hold that the trial justice was not clearly wrong in her finding that Zarrella was biased. The trial justice found that Zarrella displayed a “personal bias against the Town” and in favor of Champlin’s. First, she based this finding on Zarrella’s communications with town officials in which Zarrella said that Champlin’s was “entitled to this expansion” and the islanders were “naïve.” Second, the trial justice relied on Zarrella’s negative comments about the town’s witnesses and its alternate plan following a hearing. Third, she focused on Zarrella’s favorable comments about Champlin’s.', '- 27 -', 'Like Tikoian, Zarrella demonstrated difficulty in acting as an impartial trier of fact. Rather, he took it upon himself to further the cause of one party over another in his unabashed affinity for Champlin’s position and disdain for that of the town’s. In tandem, his statements to town officials concerning Champlin’s entitlement to expansion and his criticisms of the town and its residents for what he perceived as their naïveté in resisting development effectively rebutted his presumed status as an honest adjudicator. Davis, 444 A.2d at 192. In the hearing process, the town enjoys the same due process guarantees as Champlin’s; it should be assured that it has a fair chance to make its argument before the subcommittee and full council without facing the additional hurdle of convincing an agency adjudicator who has entrenched himself in a contrary position. Barbara Realty Co., 85 R.I. at 156, 128 A.2d at 344. Therefore, Zarrella’s activities during the workshop and the CRMC hearing has constitutional implications as a result of his “‘preconceived and settled opinion’” concerning Champlin’s and his personal feelings toward the parties involved.', 'Ryan, 941 A.2d at 185. When viewed in light of the trial justice’s extensive credibility findings during the evidentiary hearing and through the prism of the deference owed to the trial justice’s factual findings, we will not disturb on appeal the trial justice’s findings that due process demands Zarrella’s disqualification because of demonstrated bias. 13', 'Paul Lemont', 'The petitioners contend that the trial justice erred when she found that Lemont was biased and when she disqualified him on the basis of his ex parte contacts in connection with the Goulet plan. They contend that the town already had introduced a 100-foot plan into evidence, prior to Lemont’s request for the alternate Goulet plan, and thus Lemont had properly formed an opinion 13', 'Zarrella is no longer a member of the CRMC.', '- 28 - on the basis of the proceedings on the record. Additionally, the petitioners argue that the trial justice failed to recognize that, like Lemont, the other subcommittee members also favored a modified expansion that was not independently supported by the record.', 'Although the respondent noted that “it is perfectly appropriate for a judicial officer overseeing a contested hearing to urge the parties to compromise,” Champlin’s argues that Lemont was biased because he became an advocate for the “best interests of the Town” in trying to reach a compromise that was only acceptable by the town rather than Champlin’s.', 'We hold that the trial justice’s finding that Lemont was biased is not supported by legally competent evidence. First, the trial justice premised her conclusion as to Lemont’s bias on the fact that he directed Fugate to recruit Goulet to formulate the alternate plan and his lobbying for the Goulet plan to other subcommittee members. Additionally, the trial justice found bias in Lemont’s effort to “infect” the workshop and full council with a thinly veiled version of the Goulet plan. She described Lemont as “act[ing] in concert with Tikoian.” Also, the trial justice based her finding of Lemont’s bias on his meeting with the Governor “to discuss the status of the case.” Finally, the trial justice relied on Lemont’s admission during the evidentiary hearing “that he was influenced by outside pressures.”', 'As discussed, the evidentiary hearing repeatedly and improperly subjected agency members to questioning that revealed the members’ mental processes as agency adjudicators. Lemont was no exception. Despite her assurances to the contrary, the trial justice clearly relied on Lemont’s testimony as to his mental process when she made her finding that Lemont was biased by virtue of his commitment to a “compromise.” Indeed, the trial court’s decision quotes directly and at length from Lemont’s testimony in which he discussed his mental process that led', '- 29 - him to decide that a compromise was the only appropriate resolution of the matter after he began reviewing the evidence. The trial justice’s decision states:', '“Lemont testified that although he did not favor any expansion', 'initially, he later decided to support a compromise to get the matter', 'resolved. * * * He testified that he ‘saw all of the cumulative', 'things that were going on, the editorials, et cetera, et cetera, I came', 'up with the thought that perhaps we could compromise this, that', 'everybody could get something, and the matter would be', 'resolved.” The decision also quoted his testimony that', '“I came up with a compromise that I thought would solve the', 'problem, and that’s what I wanted to do. I was chairman of the', 'subcommittee. I had heard the testimony. I had heard the', 'comments of the subcommittee. I was looking for something that', 'would be a compromise. There were many people that I heard on', 'Block Island that wanted no expansion. There were later, some of', 'the letters that I did look at, no expansion. I read the editorial in', 'the Block Island paper, the letters to the editor. I listened to your', 'witnesses. I listened to all of the witnesses. And I came up with a', 'conclusion that perhaps there might be a compromise that would', 'settle this matter.”', 'Therefore, in his responses to questions posed to him at the evidentiary hearing, Lemont testified as to “the process by which he reached the conclusion[]” that he would not join in the subcommittee’s recommendation to the CRMC. See Morgan, 313 U.S. at 422. The only proper area of inquiry concerning Lemont was to factual matters, and the trial justice erred when she relied on anything else. See Green, 944 F.2d at 854. The passages of Lemont’s testimony quoted in the Superior Court’s decision are replete with examples of Lemont’s mental process. The trial justice relied on testimony that went beyond factual assertions about what evidence was before Lemont. On the contrary, his testimony discussed his conclusion that a compromise was appropriate and how he reached this conclusion.', 'As Justice Holmes characterized the', '- 30 - examination of the “operation of [the tax assessment board’s] minds” in Babcock, “[t]his was wholly improper.” Babcock, 204 U.S. at 593.', 'When Lemont’s testimony of his mental process is removed from consideration, we are of the opinion that the trial justice’s finding of bias on the part of Lemont was error because the remaining legally competent evidence is far too flimsy to support such a conclusion. As the trial justice correctly noted, “disqualification is a severe sanction.” Therefore, Lemont’s ex parte communication with Fugate in seeking what became known as the Goulet plan and his communication with the Governor regarding the “status of the case,” while improper, are insufficient to demonstrate the prejudgment and bias necessitating disqualification. Additionally, Lemont’s instruction to Goulet to show the plan to subcommittee members also is insufficient because, as a subcommittee member himself, Lemont’s communication with the other members is not an ex parte contact.', 'We share the trial justice’s disappointment in the lax approach that the CRMC members took toward insulating themselves from improper ex parte contacts. However, the occurrence of ex parte contacts does not require disqualification in every instance. See, e.g., PATCO, 685 F.2d at 573 (disapproving of clearly improper ex parte dinner between agency member and interested labor leader, but holding that the contact did not preclude a fair decision to the parties or the public interest). Thus, once the record is sanitized of any mental processes, Lemont is more like the other agency members who the trial justice found regrettably engaged in ex parte contacts that did not “rise[] to the level that would warrant disqualification” and less like Tikoian or Zarrella.', 'We hold that the trial justice’s finding of Lemont’s bias and her disqualification of him from the workshop and council hearing were not based on legally competent evidence.', '- 31 -', 'F', 'Remedy', 'Although the trial justice declared that she had the discretion to fashion an equitable remedy, her ruling on a remedy under § 42-35-15 is a question of law that we review de novo. See Johnston Ambulatory Surgical Associates, Ltd., 755 A.2d at 805. The trial justice said that based on the holding in PATCO, she had “equitable discretion” to decide whether to vacate the agency’s decision. PATCO, 685 F.2d at 565. Further, the trial justice quoted Birchwood Realty, Inc. v. Grant, 627 A.2d 827, 834 (R.I. 1993) for the proposition that “[i]t is clear that the Superior Court justice has some discretion in fashioning a remedy when hearing an appeal from an agency decision.” (emphasis added.) We do not agree with the trial justice’s interpretation that Birchwood recognizes this broad authority. Rather, Birchwood supports a trial justice’s discretion to choose among the remedies provided in § 42-35-15(g), that is, affirm, reverse, remand, or modify an agency decision. Indeed, this Court in Birchwood, after recognizing the trial justice’s discretion to remand the case, held that the trial justice’s “order of remand was simply too broad.” Birchwood, 627 A.2d at 834. There, we established that there are real limits to the trial justice’s discretion in “fashioning” a remedy. Id.', 'Section 42-35-15(g) does not permit the trial justice to substitute the agency’s decision with another agency document that is not truly a “decision.” The trial justice purported to “uphold” the “decision” of the CRMC members who voted in favor of the subcommittee’s recommendation. However, there was nothing to “uphold,” because what the members who voted to adopt the recommendation put their signatures to was entitled “Findings of Fact,” not “Decision.” The wholesale replacement of the agency’s decision with a mere recommendation of the subcommittee is not one of the options available to the trial justice under the statute. In', '- 32 - elevating the subcommittee over the full council, the trial justice clearly erred because the subcommittee simply is not authorized under the CRMC Management Procedures to render a decision for the CRMC.', 'The subcommittee recommendation remained just that, a mere recommendation to the full council.', 'We hold that a remand to the agency is necessary so that the ex parte contacts of the sort found by the trial justice may be placed in the record and the parties be offered the opportunity to respond.', 'Remand to the agency generally is the proper remedy “under a variety of circumstances.” 2 Am.

Remand is favorable because of “the unique expertise possessed by administrative agencies.” See Sartor, 542 A.2d at 1081.

Consequently, the town and intervenors were denied the opportunity to appeal a final decision adverse to them, ostensibly made by the CRMC, but actually directed by the trial justice.

The probing of the thought processes of such decision-makers is alien to the Anglo-American legal tradition, and I for one could not readily be a party to any liberalization of the law in this domain. If such liberalization were to occur, I think that it is inevitable that the courts would immediately begin to see non-prevailing party after non-prevailing party seek to analyze the thought processes', '- 36 -', 'While the foregoing words of laudatory endorsement are written in all sincerity, I must with equal sincerity express my disagreement with the majority’s decision to uphold the Superior Court’s finding of disqualifying bias 20 on the part of Michael Tikoian.

United States, 49 F.3d 830, 836 (1st Cir. 1995) (holding that a trial court clearly erred when it had “fundamentally misconstrued the testimony upon which it explicitly and exclusively relied”); Allen v.

I believe that the words “fixed anticipatory judgment” in this definition are especially important. 21', 'Even if one considers the Superior Court’s ruling concerning the disqualifying bias on the part of Mr. Tikoian to be a close call (and I do not), it is my view that the “presumption of integrity” (see discussion of said principle, infra) should militate against a finding of disqualifying bias. See Withrow v. Larkin, 421 U.S. 35, 47 (1975). It is my opinion that that is precisely what the presumption of integrity is meant to do. Employing a “tie goes to the runner” approach in close call situations serves (inter alia) the goal of discouraging the filing of minimally supported motions seeking recusal or disqualification.

In my mind, disqualifying a judicial or quasi-judicial officer for bias should be a most uncommon occurrence. It should take place only after a careful balancing process. See, e.g., Ryan v. Roman Catholic Bishop of Providence, 941 A.2d 174, 185 (R.I. 2008) (“It is a well-recognized principle that judicial officers are duty-bound to recuse themselves if they are unable to render a fair or an impartial decision in a particular case. * * * At the same time, however, justices have an equally great obligation not to disqualify themselves when there is no sound reason to do so.”) (quotation marks omitted).

If, during the course of those proceedings, he formed certain tentative intellectual conclusions as to how the issues presented might best be resolved, my view would be that having such tentative viewpoints is entirely appropriate in the decision-making process. What he did is what any responsible decision-maker does: he or she listens to the evidence and formulates or reformulates tentative conclusions—without excluding the possibility whether one takes into account extrajudicial sources or occurrences within the administrative proceedings. 28', 'In my judgment, it is significant that the record discloses that Mr. Tikoian’s interest in what came to be called “the Goulet plan” was not present at the outset of the CRMC proceedings; it came about only after the administrative proceedings were underway.

Moreover, I can perceive no sufficient evidence in the record to support a finding that he had a fixed judgment at any later time as those proceedings went forward. 29', 'As I discuss further in the next paragraph of the text, it is a basic feature of the human reasoning process that numerous temporary intellectual “conclusions” are reached in the course of an administrative or judicial proceeding before the final conclusion is reached at the end of the proceeding. 30', 'It is clear from the record that Mr. Tikoian showed an ability to modify his thinking about the proposed project as time went by.

In my view, the above-quoted words of Judge Coffin are fully applicable to Mr. Tikoian’s decision-making process in the case at bar. Tikoian’s initial thinking was far from what it later became.

See generally 2 Charles H. Koch, Jr., Administrative Law and Practice § 6.10 (2d ed. 1997). For example, in the case of Tumey v.

In view of that fact, the Supreme Court held that “it certainly violates the Fourteenth Amendment and deprives a defendant in a criminal case of due process of law to subject his liberty or property to the judgment of a court, the judge of which has a direct, personal, substantial pecuniary interest in reaching a conclusion against him in his case.” Id.; see also Caperton v. A.T.

Likewise, in Ward v. Village of Monroeville, 409 U.S. 57 (1972), the Supreme Court held that, where the revenue derived from judgments rendered in a mayor’s court provided a substantial portion of the municipality’s funds, that mayor could not act in a disinterested fashion when serving in a judicial capacity.

Nothing in the record of this case indicates that Mr. Tikoian’s views would not have evolved further if he was unsuccessful in his attempt at arriving at a compromise through the Goulet plan.', 'With the sole exception of the trial justice’s finding that Mr. Tikoian threatened a subcommittee member that he would not be reappointed if he did not vote for the Goulet plan, nothing in the record convinces me that there was any disqualifying bias on Mr. Tikoian’s part. I readily concede that, in making such a threat, Mr. Tikoian acted unwisely and improperly; and, while I neither excuse nor minimize the seriousness of that particular activity, common experience educates us to the fact that a certain amount of “arm wrestling” frequently takes place when a decision-making body (including judicial and quasi-judicial bodies) seeks to arrive at a decision. Indeed, I believe that some degree of vigorous interaction 36 within a group charged with rendering a fair decision is often salutary. Mr. Tikoian should undoubtedly be chastised for 36', 'Let me be clear: permissible “vigorous interaction” within a decision-making body may often include heated rational debate and even a substantial degree of emotional rhetoric, but not an activity such as an actual threat to a fellow member regarding his future on the adjudicative body.', '- 46 - having acted in such a manner, and he should be admonished not to act similarly in the future. Nevertheless, I do not believe that the threat articulated by Mr. Tikoian, while inappropriate, was indicative of a permanent or abiding bias on his part. My overall impression, after perusing the entire record and considering the presumption of integrity, is that Mr. Tikoian is a sincere and well-meaning public official who, at a particular point in time, endeavored to bring about a “half- a-loaf” compromise outcome. Search as I may, I am unable to perceive sufficient evidence in the record to justify the Superior Court’s finding of disqualifying bias on the part of Mr. Tikoian.', 'As for Mr. Tikoian’s contacts with Governor Carcieri and his staff, they are to me much ado about nothing in terms of a disqualifying bias analysis. 37 I concede that it would have been preferable for Mr. Tikoian to have delegated a subordinate to maintain contact with the Governor’s office. But what is significant is the lack of any finding by the trial justice that the Governor or his staff sought to “lobby” or “pressure” Mr. Tikoian in one direction or another. To the contrary, the trial justice explicitly found that the Governor did not attempt to lobby Mr. Tikoian; such a factual finding is, in my judgment, highly significant. 38 Similarly, I consider Mr. Tikoian’s statements to various news reporters to be of no real import.

Therefore, it is my conviction that any reliance upon these (concededly ex parte) communications should not be dispositive in the disqualifying bias analysis.', 'Mr. Tikoian may not have acted in all respects exactly as this Court, in recent times, has come to expect quasi-judicial adjudicating officials to act. See, e.g., Arnold v. Lebel, 941 A.2d 813, 820-22 (R.I. 2007) (clarifying the norms concerning the duty of administrative adjudicators 37', 'Governor Carcieri is not a party to this case, nor is any member of his staff. 38', 'The Superior Court did note that Governor Carcieri expressed a tentative preference for a plan involving less expansion than that originally proposed by Champlin’s.', '- 47 - to avoid ex parte contacts in administrative proceedings). That being said, however, I believe that Mr. Tikoian’s actions must be judged in light of the substantially more opaque standards that prevailed in the pre-Arnold era; and I further respectfully maintain that Mr. Tikoian’s various ex parte contacts that are reflected in the record do not overcome the presumption of integrity or demonstrate the presence of disqualifying bias.', 'I take no issue with the more exigent considerations relative to ex parte contacts which are the result of the clarifications that were spelled out in the quite recent 39 Arnold case.40 However, I think that it is fundamentally unfair to apply those more exigent considerations to the pre-Arnold actions of Mr. Tikoian, with the result being that he is held to be disqualified from participating in future administrative proceedings with respect to this case. Now that there has been authoritative clarification of the “ground rules” that should govern administrative proceedings conducted by quasi-judicial officers, I know of no reason not to believe that Mr. Tikoian will henceforth act assiduously in accordance therewith. We as a society expect a great deal of our public officials—including integrity and an acute sensitivity to ethical standards. However, I consider it unwarranted to expect that such officials be clairvoyant as to not yet clearly promulgated expectations and norms.', 'There is something fundamentally unfair in viewing yesterday’s activities through today’s ethical spectacles (viz., the clarifications articulated in Arnold).

In the PATCO case, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that ex parte contacts do not inevitably lead to disqualifying bias. Id. at 572-73. In that case, a union leader invited a member of the Federal Labor Relations Authority to dinner. Id. at 559. During their dinner conversation, which lasted approximately an hour and a half, the two gentlemen engaged in a fifteen minute discussion regarding a case that was pending before the Labor Relations Authority. Id. at 559, 571. The Court of Appeals ruled that, while it did not condone that behavior of the two gentlemen, it did not believe that the ex parte dinner conversation “irrevocably tainted the Authority’s decision-making process or resulted in a decision unfair either to the parties or to the public interest.” Id. at 573. 41 While Mr. Tikoian’s actions in the instant case were concededly not fully consistent with the administrative law standards recently clarified by this Court in Arnold, 42 I am entirely unable to conclude that his ability to perform as an impartial decision-maker was irrevocably tainted by what he did.', 'As I view it, there is, with respect to the Tikoian bias issue, an absolutist tone to the Superior Court’s reasoning and to this Court’s affirmance thereof; there is a failure to take into account the manner in which decision-making groups operate in the real world. 43 While I 41', 'To my mind, the expression “irrevocably tainted” in the PATCO decision quoted in the text is of capital importance.

I repeat that I am convinced, after a careful perusal of the record, that Mr. Tikoian was not acting out of some sort of self-interest or personal animus or fixed judgment; I see no evidence that his actions were the product of any improper purpose. Instead, it is clear to me that Mr. Tikoian eventually became convinced, as the proceedings progressed, 45 that a compromise solution might be the best, considering the interests and goals of all concerned. 46 Thereafter, he became familiar with the compromise plan that was cobbled together at the direction of Mr. 44', 'In Joseph Conrad’s novel An Outcast of the Islands 154 (1920), one of the characters memorably comments: “It’s only those who do nothing that make no mistakes, I suppose.” 45', 'See Coffin, footnote 35, supra, at 63 (“[E]ach successive judgment is tentative, fragile, and likely to be modified or set aside as a consequence of deepened insight.”). 46', 'It should at all times be borne in mind that this Court looks with favor on attempts to compromise or settle disputes.

In that case, this Court lauded the desirability of settlement and compromise, and it ruled that the trial justice’s earnest efforts to bring about same were entirely proper. Id. at 186-87.

Robinson’s eloquent and passionate dissent from our affirmance of the trial justice’s finding that Chairman Tikoian was biased, I agree with his principal argument that administrative adjudicators enjoy a presumption of honesty and integrity that should not easily be refuted.

It is my view that Chairman Tikoian’s threat to prevent the reappointment of a CRMC member was, ipso facto, enough to disqualify him. For me, Chairman Tikoian’s threat was sufficiently improper to rebut the presumption that he was acting in a neutral and impartial role as an adjudicator. Once Chairman Tikoian threatened a fellow subcommittee member in his campaign to gain support for the so-called “Goulet plan,” he ceased to function as an impartial trier of fact.', 'As for the Court’s decision to reverse the trial justice and remand the matter to the CRMC for consideration of the Goulet plan, I respectfully dissent. I would affirm the trial justice’s decision to reverse the CRMC. In my view, once the trial justice determined that the CRMC decision violated the “substantial rights” of Champlin’s, it was within her authority and discretion under § 42-35-15(g) to reverse the decision of the CRMC.', 'I also diverge from that portion of the majority’s opinion that suggests that our decision in Arnold v. Lebel, 941 A.2d 813 (R.I. 2007), requires the Superior Court to remand a case in which ex parte contacts are found to have occurred to the administrative agency in every instance. In my opinion, the trial justice’s determination that the CRMC decision was based upon unlawful procedure and that it was against the clear weight of the evidence was a sufficient basis for her to reverse the CRMC decision rather than remand the matter back to the agency for further consideration of the Goulet plan.', 'In any event, if reversal of the trial justice were, in fact, warranted, it is my opinion that this Court should remand the matter to the trial justice and not to the CRMC, for the purpose of considering the Goulet plan on the record and allowing the parties to examine the plan.', '- 53 -', 'I', 'The Trial Justice’s Decision to Reverse the CRMC was Proper', 'Under General Laws 1956 § 42-35-15(g)', 'As an initial matter, it is important to note that the trial justice held sixteen evidentiary hearings and one show-cause hearing, made extensive findings of fact, and concluded that the CRMC had prejudiced the rights of Champlin’s in its application for expansion.

Even given this required deference, however, I concur with the majority’s view that, in this case, the trial justice’s finding that subcommittee Chairman Lemont was biased was not supported by competent evidence as it was grounded in her reliance upon Mr. Lemont’s mental processes.', 'The trial justice’s fact-finding efforts in this case are commendable and largely indisputable. After holding a plethora of hearings, she found, inter alia, that: (1) certain CRMC members engaged in ex parte communications while pressing for the Goulet plan; (2) at least some CRMC members demonstrated bias in violation of their quasi-judicial role as administrative adjudicators; (3) Chairman Tikoian threatened another subcommittee member with the loss of his CRMC seat in an attempt to persuade him to vote in favor of the Goulet plan;', '- 54 - and (4) the CRMC issued a decision that, in light of the evidence presented during the subcommittee hearings, was clearly erroneous.', 'Based upon these findings, the trial justice determined that the CRMC decision (1) violated constitutional and statutory provisions; (2) was based upon unlawful procedure; (3) was in excess of the agency’s authority; and (4) was clearly erroneous, based on the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the record. Once the trial justice made this determination, pursuant to § 42-35-15(g), she had the authority to: (1) reverse the CRMC decision; (2) remand the matter to the CRMC; (3) affirm the decision; or (4) modify the decision.', 'After making her findings of fact, the trial justice determined that the most appropriate resolution of the matter was to reverse the CRMC, rather than remand it with instructions to the CRMC to place the ex parte communications (the Goulet plan) on the record.

See Sakonnet Rogers, Inc. v.

The trial justice’s decision to reverse, therefore, was based on this Court’s principle that any further delay in the adjudication of Champlin’s application would prejudice its right to a final adjudication of its petition “within a reasonable period.” Id.', 'My colleagues’ decision to reverse the trial justice is partially based on the principle that administrative matters generally must be completed by the administrative agency and not the courts. 3 Richard J.

Coastal Resources Management Council, 559 A.2d 633, 636 (R.I. 1989) (remand to the agency would be an injustice after trial justice exceeded scope of review, which unreasonably delayed adjudication of petitioner’s application); Sakonnet, 536 A.2d 897 (remand to the agency would prejudice the substantial rights of the party to have its petition adjudicated within a “reasonable” time period). I also must acknowledge that it is incumbent upon the judicial system to devise a remedy that will do justice in consideration of the significant interests of the parties involved.

This Court further stated in Sakonnet that an agency decision must be supported by factual findings, its interpretation of the pertinent law, and an application of the law to the facts. Id. In a noteworthy decision by this Court, we granted the petitioner’s application to relocate his cottage based on his right to have his petition adjudicated within a reasonable time period, when, at that point, the adjudication process had taken nearly seven years.

In fact, it is the very significance of this matter that gives me grave doubts that the CRMC will fairly and expeditiously adjudicate it upon this Court’s remand.

In the majority’s view, the replacement of the CRMC decision with that of the subcommittee recommendation was unlawful because it was not one of the options available to the trial justice. I believe, however, that it was. In my view, as stated supra, the trial justice had authority to reverse or modify the CRMC decision once she found that the CRMC decision was based upon an unlawful procedure. Whether the trial justice reversed the CRMC decision by simply granting Champlin’s petition outright or modified the CRMC decision by elevating the subcommittee recommendation, she was still well within her authority under § 42-35-15(g).', 'Moreover, the Superior Court record clearly shows that the trial justice went to great lengths to ensure that the outcome of this matter represented the judgment of the non-biased CRMC members.', 'Instead of simply reversing the CRMC decision once she found that Champlin’s rights had been violated, which she was entitled to do, she subtracted the disqualified members’ votes based on the concept of judicial discretion that we endorsed in Birchwood Realty, Inc. v.

63,"The People’s Credit Union : v. : Pauline Berube. : Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty, and Robinson, JJ. OPINION Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The defendant, Pauline Berube, appeals pro se from a Superior Court grant of partial summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff, The People’s Credit Union (credit union). The partial summary judgment invalidated a recorded deed from Berube to the credit union for real property in Tiverton on the ground that the credit union had refused to accept the deed. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on January 26, 2010, pursuant to this Court’s order that the parties show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided without further briefing or argument. After considering the record, the memoranda submitted by the parties, and the points advanced by each at oral argument, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that the case should be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. -1- Facts and Travel On or about March 29, 2005, Pauline Berube executed a promissory note to the credit union for the principal sum of $468,000. Security for this note was a mortgage deed on Berube’s real estate in Tiverton. Subsequently, the credit union claimed that Berube defaulted on her note, and the credit union initiated foreclosure proceedings on the Tiverton property.1 On June 28, 2006, Berube executed a deed (deed No. 1) purporting to convey her Tiverton real estate to the credit union for $10. That deed was recorded in the land evidence records on July 5, 2006. On July 1, 2006, Berube executed another deed (deed No. 2), in which she purported to convey the same real estate to the credit union. Deed No. 2 cites the sum of $468,000 as consideration. The credit union alleged that on July 5, 2006, Berube furnished a copy of deed No. 2 to it, apparently by leaving the document at one of its branches. On July 6, 2006, counsel for the credit union informed Berube by letter that it refused to accept deed No. 2. Later, the credit union learned that deed No. 1 had been recorded in the land evidence records. On August 7, 2006, the credit union filed a complaint in Superior Court seeking declaratory relief pursuant to G.L. 1956 chapter 30 of title 9. In its complaint, the credit union claimed that it had the right to recover the balance on Berube’s promissory note to the credit union. The credit union’s action for declaratory relief also asked that deed No. 1 be declared invalid because the conveyance was without consideration, and had been executed without the knowledge of the credit union, and also because the credit union had refused to accept delivery of the instrument. On August 30, 2006, Berube filed an answer, as well as numerous counterclaims, in which she alleged that deed No. 1 had been recorded properly and accepted, and also that deed No. 2 had been delivered properly to the credit union. 1 Berube claimed that the foundation on the property was severely cracked. She further alleged that representatives of the credit union had assured her that the foundation was in good condition. -2- On September 19, 2006, the credit union moved for partial summary judgment, pursuant to Rule 56 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, on its claim for declaratory relief to invalidate deed No. 1. The credit union argued that it was entitled to summary judgment as to this claim because, under Rhode Island law, a deed is not properly delivered in the absence of delivery of the instrument by the grantor to the grantee. The credit union asserted that it had refused to accept delivery of either deed. To support its motion, the credit union attached an affidavit from Paul Levitre, an employee of the credit union, in which Levitre swore that the credit union refused and continued to refuse to accept the recorded deed, deed No. 1. A hearing on the credit union’s partial summary-judgment motion was held on October 2, 2006. At the hearing, Berube claimed that she had spoken with the credit union’s president and its vice president of lending, who she said agreed to accept a deed to her Tiverton property. Berube did not support her argument with any affidavits or other supporting documentation. The motion justice allowed Berube additional time to obtain affidavits from employees of the credit union. However, at a subsequent hearing on November 6, 2006, Berube filed only her own affidavit. In it, she swore that she believed that certain credit union employees had agreed to accept deed No. 1, and she further alleged that Paul Levitre lacked personal knowledge of whether deed No. 1 had been accepted. The motion justice granted the credit union’s motion for partial summary judgment. In doing so, the motion justice concluded that Berube had failed to rebut the affidavit filed by the credit union, wherein the credit union asserted that it had refused to accept delivery of deed No. 1. Further, the motion justice concluded that in the absence of a genuine issue of fact, the credit union was entitled to summary judgment on its declaratory-relief claim to invalidate deed No. 1, because valid delivery of a deed requires the grantee’s acceptance, and the credit union had -3- refused to accept it. The motion justice entered an order based on Rule 54(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, from which Berube appeals.2 On appeal, Berube reiterates her contention that the credit union accepted delivery of the deed. Because we agree with the motion justice’s analysis and conclusions, we affirm the judgment. Analysis This Court reviews the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo. Brito v. Capone, 819 A.2d 663, 665 (R.I. 2003) (citing McKinnon v. Rhode Island Hospital Trust National Bank, 713 A.2d 245, 247 (R.I. 1998)). We apply the same standard as the motion justice: we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and if we conclude that no genuine issue of material fact exists, then the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law and we affirm the grant of summary judgment. Id. at 665-66. The “party opposing a summary judgment motion may not simply rest on the allegations and denials in his or her pleadings, but must prove by competent evidence the existence of a disputed material issue of fact.” Id. at 666 (citing Accent Store Design, Inc. v. Marathon House, Inc., 674 A.2d 1223, 1225 (R.I. 1996)). Although we have not had an opportunity to address this precise question in the past, in our opinion, the motion justice correctly determined that delivery of a deed requires the grantee’s acceptance. We consistently have held that delivery “is essential to the validity of the deed.” Oldham v. Oldham, 58 R.I. 268, 277, 192 A. 758, 763 (1937). At common law, a grantee who is without knowledge of a deed conveyance “could disclaim and repudiate the transaction, thereby 2 We note that the motion justice’s Super.R.Civ.P. 54(b) certification does not address whether the credit union accepted deed No. 2. The credit union did not seek such a ruling in its motion for partial summary judgment. Accordingly, the issue of the second deed is not properly before this Court at this time and we will not consider it. -4- revesting the title in the grantor.” Id.; see also Hood v. Hood, 384 A.2d 706, 708 (Me. 1978) (holding that “effective delivery of a deed requires the correlative act of acceptance by the grantee”); Juchno v. Toton, 155 N.E.2d 162, 164 (Mass. 1959) (“The recording of a deed without the knowledge or consent of the grantee is not effective to pass title; a deed becomes effective only upon its acceptance by the grantee.”); 14 Richard R. Powell, Powell on Real Property § 81A.04[2][b] at 81A-77, 78 (Michael Allan Wolf ed., LexisNexis Matthew Bender 2008) (explaining how delivery of a deed creates a rebuttable presumption of conveyance; refusing to accept a deed must be communicated with “reasonable promptness after the grantee learns of the conveyance”). Here, once the credit union came forward with evidence, in the form of Paul Levitre’s affidavit, that the credit union had refused to accept delivery of deed No. 1, the burden shifted to Berube to rebut or challenge that evidence. Berube responded by filing an affidavit; however, the affidavit was from Berube herself, not from an employee of the credit union or anyone else who could shed light on whether the credit union accepted the deed or refused it. Berube’s mere allegations are insufficient to rebut the affidavit offered by the credit union. Consequently, the motion justice correctly found that there were no genuine issues of material fact about whether the credit union refused delivery of deed No. 1 and properly granted the credit union partial summary judgment on its claim for declaratory relief. Conclusion We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court, to which we remand the papers in this case. -5- Supreme Court No. 2007-104-Appeal.

The Court is deciding this case on the basis of the memoranda filed by the parties and the statements made by the respondent at oral argument. For the reasons set forth herein, we deny and dismiss the appeal.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On October 3, 2002, respondent was adjudicated to be the biological father of minor child Tory S.

On October 31, 2003, the Family Court held a hearing with respect to the above-referenced motion.

Mr. Schiavitti further testified that, when he attempted to obtain the address of Tory’s mother from the Family Court in 2003, it was his intention to try to obtain visitation with Tory. Mr. Schiavitti stated that, after the file was sealed and he was denied the address of Tory’s mother, it was his belief that he could not obtain visitation with Tory. He testified that, although he was unsure whether he had filed a motion for visitation in 2003, 2004, or 2005, he recalled filing such a motion in August of 2006.6 He stated that, soon after the filing of his August of 2006 motion, he received “adoption papers and a restraining order.”', 'Tory’s mother was the next witness to testify at the June 1, 2007 hearing.

She testified that, since October 3, 2002, she had not had any contact with Mr. Schiavitti regarding Tory. She testified that the August 2006 motion for visitation from Mr. Schiavitti was the only such motion of which she was aware; she stated that she had not received any other informal written or oral requests for visitation from Mr. Schiavitti. She further testified that, at the time of the termination hearing, Tory was ten years old and that the last time he had seen his father was “[a] week before he turned a year old.”', 'Tory’s maternal grandfather was the final witness to testify at the termination of parental rights hearing. He testified that he had answered phone calls from the incarcerated Mr. Schiavitti seeking to speak with his daughter, but that she was not home at the time. He testified that he would relay these messages to Tory’s mother, but he added that Mr. Schiavitti never left a phone number. He testified that he did not know of any requests for visitation made by Mr. Schiavitti until August of 2006. He further testified that, when Mr. Schiavitti was out of the ACI, he would come to the maternal grandfather’s house and bang on the door; he stated that he would tell Mr. Schiavitti: “[I]f you don’t get out of here, I’m going to call the cops.” He testified that, on occasion, he did in fact call the police and that Mr. Schiavitti would then leave. He estimated that his calls to the police concerning Mr. Schiavitti occurred when Tory was approximately thirteen to fourteen months old.', 'On September 26, 2007, the Family Court justice issued her decision and findings of fact.

65,"State : v. : Jose Rivera. : Present: Suttell, C.J., and Goldberg, Flaherty, Robinson, JJ., and Williams, C.J. (ret.). OPINION Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The defendant, Jose Rivera, appeals from a judgment of conviction, after a jury trial, of two counts of first-degree sexual assault, four counts of second-degree sexual assault, and one count of simple assault. On appeal, the defendant presents four grounds for reversal of his conviction. He contends that: (1) the complaining witnesses were not competent to testify at trial; (2) the trial justice erred in denying his motion to sever the trial counts; (3) the denial of his motion for new trial was an abuse of discretion; (4) the testimony of the complaining witnesses was not competent, legally sufficient, or otherwise credible; and (5) it was error for the trial justice to permit the state to lead the complaining witnesses during direct examination. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. I Facts and Travel Mr. Rivera was employed as a bus driver in the RIde division of the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA), beginning on June 9, 2003. The RIde division provides transportation to people living in Rhode Island needing door-to-door service, such as the developmentally disabled and the elderly. -1- In 2005, Mr. Rivera drove five separate routes providing transportation to people attending the Adeline LaPlante Memorial Center (LaPlante Center), a private organization that provides services for children and adults with developmental disabilities. Mr. Rivera picked up his assigned passengers, drove them to the LaPlante Center, and assisted passengers as they got on and off the RIde bus. The defendant’s convictions stem from allegations that Mr. Rivera sexually assaulted three developmentally disabled women in June and July 2005. During this period, the three complaining witnesses in this case, Tracy, Elaine, and Deborah, 1 were passengers on two of Mr. Rivera’s bus routes. A Tracy Tracy, then thirty-seven years old, has a severe developmental disability. Tracy worked at the LaPlante Center for four years prior to the alleged assaults, and she took the RIde bus to the LaPlante Center each day. Tracy testified that Mr. Rivera sexually assaulted her twice when they were alone together on the bus. The first sexual assault allegedly occurred in the RIde bus while it was parked in the woods. 2 Tracy testified that defendant removed her pants, and she hit her head against the corner of the bus window. Tracy further stated that defendant touched her breasts under her bra without her consent. The defendant, according to Tracy’s testimony, also touched his penis to her vagina. She further testified that “[h]e tried to go inside with mine.” Tracy stated that she told Mr. Rivera, “no, stop it” and “[p]lease, stop it.” 1 We use pseudonyms to refer to the complaining witnesses. 2 There are inconsistencies in Tracy’s testimony. She testified that this sexual assault occurred in the woods near a male passenger’s house, and also that it took place in the woods near Deborah’s house. -2- The second assault allegedly occurred while the RIde bus was parked behind a church. According to Tracy’s testimony, Mr. Rivera and Tracy were alone together on the bus when he removed her socks, pants, and one of her shoes. She said defendant touched his penis to her “private area in front” and touched her breasts under her clothing and bra. Tracy further testified that “[a]ll white stuff came out” of defendant’s penis and that she told defendant to stop, but he continued to assault her. Mr. Rivera told Tracy, according to her testimony, not to tell her parents, or she would get in trouble. Tracy stated that when she arrived home, she told her mother that she had to wash her hands because she had “sticky stuff” on them. Tracy testified that she ultimately reported the incident to her mother, although she was too scared to tell her mother at first. Tracy said that she first spoke to Deborah about Mr. Rivera and, some time after, they both told their mothers about the assaults. Her mother testified that she remembered the day she got off the bus and was not acting like herself, but her mother could not recall the exact date. On July 13, 2005, Tracy went to a physician’s assistant, Josephine Barns-Brown, and, according to Ms. Barns-Brown, Tracy reported that she had lumps on her “pee-wee” and her left inner thigh. Ms. Barns-Brown testified that she was unable to determine the exact date of the assaults, that Tracy’s hymen was intact, and that Tracy’s mother had not found blood in Tracy’s underwear. Although Tracy testified that she had lumps on her breasts and hip, Ms. Barns- Brown testified that she did not find any such lumps or bumps. Mr. Rivera denied assaulting Tracy and, in fact, testified he was never alone with Tracy on the bus. The defendant stated that when he announced to his passengers he was going to be transferred to another route, Tracy was “angry, upset” and was in “tears.” Tracy testified that she told defendant “you’re not going anywhere; you’re going to be my bus driver.” Tracy -3- indicated that she wanted to get Mr. Rivera fired because she was upset that he was changing routes. Detective Patrick Strickland testified that he spoke to Tracy’s mother in the course of investigating the allegations against defendant. Tracy’s mother reported, according to Det. Strickland, that Tracy told her that defendant “exposed his penis to her [and] asked her if she wanted to play a game,” but that defendant never touched her. Detective Strickland testified, however, that when he spoke with Tracy, she reported, consistent with her own testimony, that defendant vaginally raped her and touched her breasts over and underneath her clothing. Tracy reported to Det. Strickland that this occurred while defendant and Tracy were alone together on the bus, parked in the woods. B Elaine Elaine, then twenty-two years old, has a developmental disability stemming from a seizure disorder. Elaine testified that one morning she was on the RIde bus parked in front of the LaPlante Center and defendant asked Corey, another passenger, to move from the seat next to Elaine. According to her testimony, Mr. Rivera sat next to her and used the palm of his hand to rub her breast area underneath her clothing and bra. The defendant also allegedly used his first finger and hand to touch her “privates” underneath her underwear. Elaine stated that she used tae kwon do training to attempt to block Mr. Rivera’s advances and told him to stop. Elaine further testified that there were five other passengers on the bus when the assault occurred. Elaine alleged that Mr. Rivera assaulted her on one occasion. When Elaine went into the LaPlante Center the morning of the assault, she approached Danielle Fournier Cole, an employee of the LaPlante Center at the time of the alleged assault, and told her that the bus driver had touched her inappropriately. Ms. Fournier Cole testified, contrary to Elaine’s testimony, that -4- Elaine reported she had been touched a couple of times that week. Although the date of the assault is not apparent from the record, Ms. Fournier Cole prepared a statement documenting Elaine’s report on July 22, 2005. Two passengers on the RIde bus testified that they witnessed Mr. Rivera assault Elaine. Corey confirmed that he was sitting next to Elaine when defendant told him to move. According to Corey’s testimony, defendant then sat next to Elaine and touched Elaine’s chest, her legs, and “in a private part.” Corey stated that he observed the alleged assault by looking in a mirror mounted above the driver’s seat of the bus. Katherine, another passenger, testified that she saw defendant touch Elaine’s breast and vagina. At trial, defendant elicited testimony to establish facts suggesting Elaine had a motive to fabricate the allegations against him. The defendant attempted to establish facts that (1) tended to show Elaine sought revenge against defendant for reprimanding her on the bus; (2) Elaine had a propensity to lie, especially that she had a propensity to make false accusations of sexual assault; and (3) the three complaining witnesses shared stories of defendant’s sexual assault before reporting the incidents to authority figures, implying that they had colluded to make such allegations. Mr. Rivera testified that he reprimanded Elaine and a male passenger, Emil, for being “intertwined” on the bus, “kissing, hugging and carrying on.” The defendant further testified that Elaine and Emil were “furious” at him for intervening. The defendant stated he reported the situation to employees of the LaPlante Center a day or two prior to Elaine’s accusation of sexual assault. During the trial, defendant questioned Brenda Centracchio, a state social worker at the LaPlante Center, about a “status sheet” she prepared that indicated Elaine’s mother thought -5- Elaine had a grudge against Mr. Rivera for reprimanding her. The trial justice, however, did not permit the questioning to continue, and he did not allow the admission of the “status sheet” as a full exhibit, ruling that it constituted double hearsay. Supporting defendant’s theory that Elaine had a propensity to lie, Elaine’s mother testified that she did not, at first, believe her daughter had been assaulted because some LaPlante Center attendees had started a “pathological liars club” and they were “trying to one up each other.” The defendant unsuccessfully sought to introduce other evidence suggesting Elaine had a propensity to lie; namely, that Elaine previously had made a false accusation against both Emil and another person. The defendant questioned Elaine about the alleged incident between Elaine and Emil, and Elaine denied that he had “done anything physically inappropriate,” but noted that Emil had “kissed [her] and stuff like that when [she] didn’t want to.” The defendant also questioned Elaine’s mother about whether Elaine had accused other people of touching her inappropriately. The trial justice, however, sustained the state’s objections to the questions, and the theory was not further developed at trial. Finally, defendant sought to elicit testimony implying that the complaining witnesses had discussed the allegations with one another. Tracy testified that Elaine told her about her allegation against Mr. Rivera, whereas Elaine denied discussing the alleged assault. C Deborah Deborah, then thirty-nine years old, has a developmental disability and three types of seizure disorders. Deborah worked at the LaPlante Center for approximately twelve years, and left in 2005. Deborah testified that while she was alone on the bus with defendant, Mr. Rivera placed his finger on her upper body without her consent. Deborah stated that, in response, she zipped -6- up her jacket. Both Deborah and her mother testified that after defendant dropped Deborah off at home, Deborah reported the incident to her mother. Deborah’s mother believed that Deborah reported the incident to her between June 20, 2005, and June 24, 2005. Tracy also testified that she saw Mr. Rivera touch Deborah. D Competency Hearing and Trial On February 10, 2006, a grand jury issued an indictment charging Mr. Rivera with seven offenses, including second-degree sexual assault of Deborah (count 1), two counts of first-degree sexual assault of Tracy (counts 2 and 4), two counts of second-degree sexual assault of Tracy (counts 3 and 5), and two counts of second-degree sexual assault (counts 6 and 7) of Elaine. The indictment charged defendant with committing each of the aforementioned counts “on a specific date between the 1st day of June, 2005 and the 31st day of August, 2005 * * *.” Before trial the trial justice conducted a hearing upon defendant’s motion to determine the competency of each of the three complaining witnesses. 3 These witnesses and a defense expert, Ronald L. Stewart, M.D., testified at the hearing. At the competency hearing, Deborah listed the members of her family, described her pets, and she recited her address. Deborah also was able to recall what she had for breakfast. She communicated an observation that the prosecutor was holding a blue pen, and she stated that it was bad to tell a lie. Deborah, however, did get somewhat confused about what she had eaten the previous day, and she had never heard the word “prosecutor” before. Deborah also had difficulty answering some other questions and naming the prosecutor, and she admitted that she rehearsed her testimony with the prosecutor. 3 The defendant narrowed his argument on appeal to the competency of Tracy and Deborah. We will, accordingly, address the competency hearing only as it relates to Tracy and Deborah. -7- Tracy, during the competency hearing, was able to state her address, the people with whom she lives, and her pets. She also was able to identify the prosecutor’s pen and paper. Tracy stated that she was a woman and the prosecutor was a man, but she was unable to explain how to tell men and women apart. Tracy promised to tell the truth, but was unable to define the word “promise.” Tracy also was unable to correctly describe the role of the judge, prosecutor, or lawyer. Tracy contradicted herself at several points during the hearing. She stated that she had tuna fish for lunch, and later testified that she had not yet eaten. She also testified that she knew Deborah, and later stated that she did not know Deborah. When asked whether she would be able to recognize defendant, Tracy answered “no.” Also, when asked, “If you were asked a question about what you did in the summer of 2005 and you can’t remember what you did in 2005, what are you going to say?” Tracy responded, “I worked that day.” Doctor Stewart testified that he heard just over half the testimony, and on the basis of his observations and the documents, interviews, and reports provided to him, he could not reach an opinion about the competency of the complaining witnesses. Doctor Stewart said that neurological testing was required to assess “the cognitive ability and reliability” of the complaining witnesses and stated later that he had “been asking * * * frequently for qualified experts in the respective field” to assess the complaining witnesses. Defense counsel, however, did not request neurological testing and instead stated, “the Court would be in the best position to determine the need, if any, to have the alleged victims further examined.” At the conclusion of the competency hearing, on May 22, 2007, the Superior Court found all three complaining witnesses competent to testify and denied defendant’s motion to sever the counts. On May 23, 2007, after the jury was empaneled, an eight-day trial began. -8- On June 4, 2007, the jury returned a guilty verdict on two counts of first-degree sexual assault, four counts of second-degree sexual assault, and one count of simple assault or battery. On July 20, 2007, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial. On August 7, 2007, the trial justice sentenced defendant to life imprisonment for counts 2 and 4 and fifteen years to serve on counts 3 and 5, all such terms to run concurrently. He also sentenced defendant to two concurrent terms of fifteen years on counts 6 and 7, said terms to run consecutively to counts 2, 3, 4, and 5. Finally, he sentenced defendant to one year, consecutive to all other counts for the simple-assault conviction. This sentence amounts to life imprisonment, plus sixteen years. We discuss additional facts in the context of the issues raised on appeal. II A The Competency of the Complaining Witnesses to Testify 1. Standard of Review This Court will overturn a trial justice’s competency ruling only if there has been an abuse of discretion. State v. Lynch, 854 A.2d 1022, 1029 (R.I. 2004). “The trial justice is afforded considerable deference in making a competency ruling since he is in the best position to assess the witness’s present ability to comprehend the obligation of this oath, and to give a correct account of what he may have seen or heard.” Id. (quoting Seabra v. Trafford-Seabra, 655 A.2d 250, 252 (R.I. 1995)). When there is any doubt concerning a witness’s minimum credibility, it “should be resolved in favor of allowing the jury to hear the testimony and judge the credibility of the witness themselves.” Lynch, 854 A.2d at 1030. 2. Discussion The trial justice in the instant case conducted a two-day competency hearing, allowing both defendant and the state to question the complaining witnesses. Further, Dr. Stewart -9- presented testimony and his opinion about the competency of the witnesses. After hearing the complaining witnesses and the expert witness testify, the trial justice found all three complaining witnesses competent to testify given their appreciation of the need to tell the truth and their ability to observe, recollect, and communicate. The defendant contends the trial justice abused his discretion in finding two of the three complaining witnesses, Tracy and Deborah, competent to testify at trial. Specifically, defendant draws attention to discrepancies in Tracy’s testimony, her testimony that she would be unable to identify defendant if she saw him, and her inability to explain the differences between a male and a female. In further support of his position, defendant notes Tracy’s inability to explain the word “promise,” her inability to identify the roles of a judge, lawyer, or prosecutor, as well as weaknesses in her recollection. The defendant highlights the fact that Tracy spontaneously uttered statements such as “he touched me,” and that Tracy had inconsistencies in her testimony. Additionally, Mr. Rivera contends that Tracy’s admission that she had rehearsed her testimony further supports his argument that she was incompetent to testify. Similarly, Mr. Rivera argues that it was an abuse of discretion for the trial justice to find Deborah competent to testify. To support his argument, defendant notes that Deborah was unable to differentiate between a man and woman, that she did not know the meaning of the word “oath,” and that she had practiced her testimony before the competency hearing. “Rule 601 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence requires that a witness be competent to testify.” Lynch, 854 A.2d at 1029. To find a witness competent to testify, the trial justice must make four determinations: “the witness must be able to ‘observe, recollect, communicate, and appreciate the necessity of telling the truth.” Id. (quoting Seabra, 655 A.2d at 252). Furthermore, there is no per se rule that disqualifies individuals with developmental disabilities or mental - 10 - illnesses from testifying at trial. See id. (finding a sixteen-year-old developmentally disabled youth competent to testify); State v. Franklin, 103 R.I. 715, 723-24, 241 A.2d 219, 225 (1968) (noting that there is no presumption disqualifying a mentally ill witness). Rather, competency is to be determined by the trial justice on a case-by-case basis. See Pierce v. New England Telephone & Telegraph Co., 86 R.I. 326, 330-31, 134 A.2d 421, 423 (1957). In the case under review, Tracy demonstrated her ability to observe and communicate her observations when she identified a pen and a piece of paper that the prosecutor was holding. She also exhibited her ability to recollect and communicate when she identified her address, the people with whom she lives, and her pets. Tracy demonstrated an appreciation for the necessity of telling the truth when she agreed to say “I don’t remember” if she did not recall an answer to a question. She also exhibited an understanding of the consequences of lying and promised not to lie. When the prosecutor asked whether a piece of paper was red, Tracy corrected the prosecutor, stating that the paper was white, thus showing that she was able to correctly observe the color of the paper, communicate her observation, and tell the truth. Although Tracy admitted to rehearsing her testimony, this does not change our analysis of her competency. Testimony rehearsal goes to the credibility of the witness, not his or her competency. Cf. State v. Russell, 950 A.2d 418, 434 (R.I. 2008) (approving a trial justice’s consideration of a witness’s testimony rehearsal in passing on the credibility of her testimony). It was within the province of the trial justice to consider the witness’s testimony in light of the fact that she had rehearsed her testimony. Tracy’s honesty about having rehearsed her testimony could be seen further as adding to her credibility and her appreciation of the need to tell the truth. Tracy was unable to define the word “promise,” but a witness need not be able to explain such abstract concepts. Rather, he or she must be able to appreciate that he or she must be - 11 - truthful. Tracy did state during the competency hearing that she would be unable to identify defendant if she saw him, 4 but she was able to identify him during the actual trial. Finally, Tracy’s testimony that she could not differentiate between a man and a woman, and her confusion over questions about Deborah, do not alter our assessment, considering that the totality of her testimony exhibited her ability to observe, recollect, and communicate. We agree with the trial justice that although Tracy responded to questions very literally, her literal understanding of language does not preclude her from being able to communicate. Similarly, Deborah displayed her ability to recall and communicate facts as she named the members in her family, described her pets, recalled what she ate for breakfast, and recited her home address. Deborah did display some confusion concerning what she had eaten the previous day, but she asked for clarification. Additionally, when she could not recall an answer, she chose not to answer the question, rather than give an incorrect answer. Deborah also displayed an appreciation for telling the truth when she stated that “you should tell the truth” and “a lie is bad.” Furthermore, she stated that if she did not understand a question about something that occurred in 2005, she would state that she could not remember. Deborah’s inability to articulate the difference between a man and a woman does not bear on her ability to observe, recollect, and communicate, given the totality of her testimony. Moreover, for the reasons noted above, Deborah’s rehearsal of her testimony and her inability to define “oath” are not sufficient grounds to find her incompetent to testify. 4 The dialogue concerning Tracy’s ability to identify defendant occurred as follows: “[State]: If you saw [defendant], you [sic] would you be able to recognize him? “[Tracy]: No. “[State]: You wouldn’t be able to recognize him if you saw him again? “[Tracy]: I won’t ever see him again. I won’t be on the bus then.” - 12 - Considering the totality of the evidence adduced at the competency hearing, we are satisfied that the trial justice’s ruling was a sustainable exercise of his discretion. B Motion to Sever The defendant avers that the trial justice improperly denied his motion to sever the counts against him. 5 Mr. Rivera contends that he was prejudiced by having three victims, particularly three developmentally disabled victims, testify against him during one trial because their testimony confused the jury. Furthermore, Mr. Rivera disagrees with the standard of review for severance of trial counts; specifically, he does not believe that “substantial prejudice” should be the standard. The defendant also argues that he was prejudiced because the weight of the evidence against defendant for some of the counts may have been greater than for others. Finally, defendant argues that it is unlikely the state would call a victim as a witness during a separate criminal trial because it would violate defendant’s Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment constitutional rights. 1. Standard of Review Severance of the counts against a defendant, under Rule 14 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, is not a matter of right, but rather lies within the sound discretion of the trial justice. State v. Pereira, 973 A.2d 19, 27 (R.I. 2009). This Court will not overturn a “trial justice’s decision under Rule 14 absent a clear abuse of discretion.” Id. at 28 (citing State v. Rice, 755 A.2d 137, 143 (R.I. 2000)). For reversal, “a defendant must show that the trial justice’s denial of the motion to sever prejudiced the defendant to such a degree that he or she 5 Though defendant’s brief presented his motion to sever argument under his motion for new trial heading, it does not appear that defendant addressed his motion for severance in his motion for new trial. Thus, we treat it as independent from defendant’s appeal from the denial of the motion for new trial. - 13 - was denied a fair trial.” State v. Hernandez, 822 A.2d 915, 920 (R.I. 2003) (quoting State v. Verrecchia, 766 A.2d 377, 386 (R.I. 2001)). Furthermore, “in cases in which the outcome would have been the same had separate trials been held, we will not disturb the trial justice’s decision not to sever, even when the defendant may have suffered some disadvantage in defending against the joined counts simultaneously.” Rice, 755 A.2d at 144. 2. Discussion Rule 8(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure allows the state to charge a defendant with multiple offenses in a single indictment if the offenses are “of the same or similar character or are based on the same transaction or on two (2) or more acts or transactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or plan.” A trial justice may, however, under Rule 14 order separate trials of the counts against the defendant “[i]f it appears that a defendant or the State is prejudiced by a joinder of offenses * * *.” Generally, Rule 14 does not require severance when “the evidence related to each one of the counts is straightforward, simple, and distinct.” State v. Day, 898 A.2d 698, 705 (R.I. 2006) (quoting Rice, 755 A.2d at 144). We are confident that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in denying defendant’s motion for severance. The counts against Mr. Rivera were similar in character and “straightforward, simple and distinct.” It is well settled in this jurisdiction that a defendant must show substantial prejudice for this Court to overturn a trial justice’s denial of a motion for severance. See Pereira, 973 A.2d at 28 (“The defendant must show that he did, in fact, suffer real and substantial prejudice.”). In fact, defendant himself notes in his brief that the defendant must show that severance resulted in - 14 - substantial prejudice. 6 Substantial prejudice is determined by balancing “efficiency and convenience in judicial administration on the one hand and the defendant’s right to a fair trial without prejudice on the other.” Id. (quoting Day, 898 A.2d at 705). This Court has found that substantial prejudice from joinder may come in different forms: “(1) [The defendant] may become embarrassed or confounded in presenting separate defenses; (2) the jury may use the evidence of one of the crimes charged to infer a criminal disposition on the part of the defendant from which it found his guilt of the other crime or crimes charged; or (3) the jury may cumulate the evidence of the various crimes charged and find guilt when, if considered separately, it would not so find.” Pereira, 973 A.2d at 28 (quoting State v. Patriarca, 112 R.I. 14, 30, 308 A.2d 300, 311 (1973) and Drew v. United States, 331 F.2d 85, 88 (D.C. Cir. 1964)). Mr. Rivera contends that there was potential for the jury to be misled because of the amount of evidence presented against him and, also, that the jury may have been misled because the weight of evidence with respect to one complaining witness was stronger than the evidence with respect to the other two complaining witnesses. It is unclear whether Mr. Rivera believes the jury may have used evidence from the stronger case to infer guilt in the other cases against him, or whether he believes the jury viewed the evidence cumulatively. In either case, defendant’s argument is unavailing, and we decline to disturb the trial justice’s ruling. In Rice, 755 A.2d at 141, the defendant was charged with six counts related to four incidents of sexual assault committed at three separate locations against two minor children. This Court in Rice found joinder appropriate because the incidents of sexual assault occurred during a short time span, the incidents occurred in close geographical proximity to one another, and the counts were similar to one another. Id. at 143-44. 6 Defense counsel also conceded at oral argument that the test was “substantial prejudice.” - 15 - In the present case, Mr. Rivera was charged with seven counts of sexual assault against three people with developmental disabilities and with whom he had contact as a RIde vehicle operator. The alleged assaults also were committed in the same vehicle over a period of approximately one month. Additionally, the evidence as to each count was straightforward, simple, and distinct. Generally, the three complaining witnesses testified about their own allegations, their mothers testified to the counts relating to their daughters, and the remaining witnesses gave background information about the RIde bus, the LaPlante Center, and the investigations that ensued upon the women’s reports. The straightforward and distinct presentation of evidence in this manner facilitated the jury’s understanding of the separate counts. The trial justice also stated at least twice during the jury instructions that each of the charges had to be considered separately and that the state must prove each element beyond a reasonable doubt. This Court has adopted the presumption that “juries are able to respond impartially to the trial evidence with the assistance given by instructions from the trial justice.” Day, 898 A.2d at 705 (quoting State v. LaRoche, 683 A.2d 989, 998 (R.I. 1996)). In the present case, the jury’s thoughtfulness in its consideration of the facts and credibility of the witnesses not only is presumed, but also may be inferred from defendant’s conviction on one count of a lesser- included offense. Moreover, defendant’s argument that the state would not call one victim as a witness in a separate criminal trial because it would violate defendant’s Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment constitutional rights is confusing, undeveloped, and without merit. The defendant seems to hypothesize that “a defendant,” not necessarily Mr. Rivera himself, would be faced with a dilemma concerning whether he or she should testify about one victim and not another victim. - 16 - This Court has held that severance is not “mandatory every time a defendant wishes to testify to one charge but to remain silent on another. If that were the law, a court would be divested of all control over the matter of severance and the choice would be entrusted to the defendant.” Pereira, 973 A.2d at 29 (quoting United States v. Archer, 843 F.2d 1019, 1022 (7th Cir. 1988)). A defendant must “offer in timely fashion ‘enough information’ so that the court can weigh ‘the considerations of judicial economy’ against the defendant’s ‘freedom to choose whether to testify’ as to a particular charge.” Id. (quoting United States v. Alosa, 14 F.3d 693, 695 (1st Cir. 1994)). In the present case, Mr. Rivera’s argument is difficult to decipher, and he also did not raise the dilemma of choosing to testify about separate complaining witnesses below. Therefore, we decline to consider any theoretical prejudice joinder may have caused. 7 C Motion for New Trial 1. Standard of Review The defendant raises a number of issues with respect to the denial of his motion for new trial. This Court is deferential to the trial justice when reviewing the decision on a motion for new trial. “Provided that the trial justice has ‘articulated an adequate rationale for denying a motion,’ * * * a trial justice’s ruling on a new trial motion is entitled to great weight.” State v. Flori, 963 A.2d 932, 937 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. Bergevine, 942 A.2d 974, 981 (R.I. 2008)). “Accordingly, ‘[a] trial justice’s ruling on a new-trial motion will not be overturned 7 Mr. Rivera also stated that a juror was excused for cause, off the record, because the juror said, “he could not sit on the jury because of what the defendant had done to all those women.” This incident, if it did indeed happen as defendant recounts, does not show actual substantial prejudice. Rather, it illustrates the effectiveness of voir dire, because the prospective juror was eliminated from the jury after exhibiting prejudice. - 17 - unless the trial justice was clearly wrong or unless he or she overlooked or misconceived material and relevant evidence that related to a critical issue in the case.’” Id. When deciding a motion for new trial on the basis of the legal sufficiency of the evidence, “the trial justice acts as a thirteenth juror and exercises independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.” State v. Cerda, 957 A.2d 382, 385 (R.I. 2008) (quoting Bergevine, 942 A.2d at 981). “[T]he trial justice must (1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” State v. Schloesser, 940 A.2d 637, 639 (R.I. 2007) (quoting State v. Morales, 895 A.2d 114, 121 (R.I. 2006)). “If, after conducting this independent review, the trial justice agrees with the jury’s verdict or if the evidence is such that reasonable minds could differ as to the outcome, the motion for a new trial should be denied.” Id. (quoting State v. Gomez, 848 A.2d 221, 234 (R.I. 2004)). “If, however, the trial justice finds that the state has failed to prove the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, a new trial must be ordered.” Cerda, 957 A.2d at 385. Although defendant does not expressly articulate an argument claiming that the trial justice committed an error of law, he raises several issues with respect to the denial of his motion for new trial which imply that the trial justice applied incorrect legal standards. These issues, he contends, “may warrant the Supreme Court considering a reversal.” Given the substance of defendant’s claims, we treat these issues as an appeal from the trial justice’s denial of his motion for new trial based upon error of law. The trial justice’s identification of the correct legal standard is a question of law, which this Court will review de novo. See State v. Oliveira, 961 A.2d 299, 308 (R.I. 2008) (“This Court undertakes a de novo review of questions of law * * *.”); - 18 - see also Votolato v. Merandi, 747 A.2d 455, 460 (R.I. 2000) (noting that, in a civil case, “for this Court to determine whether a trial justice has abused his or her discretion concerning the grant or denial of a new trial based on an error of law occurring at the trial, we must review that grant and the accompanying trial record before us de novo, as we do for other questions of law”). In the case at bar, we have carefully considered defendant’s arguments and are well satisfied that the trial justice identified and applied the correct legal standards. 2. The Legal Sufficiency of Evidence Presented at Trial The defendant argues that the testimony of the complaining witnesses “was neither competent, legally sufficient nor credible.” Specifically, defendant contends that the evidence supporting defendant’s alleged penetration of Tracy was “vague, suspect, unclear and not competent.” The defendant furthermore lists a number of facts to which the complaining witnesses testified during trial and states that they are devoid of credibility. It is our opinion, however, that the trial justice sufficiently conducted an independent review of the evidence and adequately stated his justification for denying defendant’s motion for new trial. In denying the motion for new trial, the trial justice applied the proper standard in making the determination and acted as a thirteenth juror, exercising independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence. The crux of this case is credibility: whether the jury believed defendant or the three complaining witnesses. After the trial justice independently assessed the credibility of the witnesses, he concurred with the jury that the complaining witnesses were credible. The trial justice supported this conclusion by referring to the testimony of virtually all of the key witnesses, especially the three complaining witnesses. After an independent review of defendant’s testimony, the trial justice determined that he was not credible. The trial justice placed emphasis on the fact that defendant’s description of the - 19 - seating structure of the bus was inaccurate, in addition to the fact that defendant’s driver manifests contradicted his statement that he never was alone on the bus with Tracy. The mere fact that defendant disagrees with the trial justice’s conclusions about credibility is not a sufficient basis to warrant the granting of a motion for new trial. See State v. Otero, 788 A.2d 469, 474 (R.I. 2002) (denying a motion for new trial noting that it was within the trial justice’s province to make credibility determinations). As this Court has stated, “it is the trial justice who has [had] the opportunity to observe the witnesses as they testify and therefore is in a better position to weigh the evidence and to pass upon the credibility of the witnesses than is this [C]ourt[.]” State v. Luanglath, 749 A.2d 1, 5-6 (R.I. 2000) (quoting Lembo v. Lembo, 677 A.2d 414, 417 (R.I. 1996)). Accordingly, the “trial justice’s ruling on a new trial motion is entitled to great weight.” State v. Flori, 963 A.2d 932, 937 (R.I. 2009) (quoting Bergevine, 942 A.2d at 981). We are satisfied that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in finding the evidence legally sufficient. 3. Impeachment and the Bill of Particulars The defendant argues that he was prejudiced and that the prosecutor committed prosecutorial misconduct when, on cross-examination, the state implied that defendant may have assaulted Tracy on a date outside those designated in the bill of particulars and the indictment. The defendant contends that when asked by the prosecutor whether he was alone with Tracy, or whether Tracy was ever the last passenger on the bus, defendant’s answer assumed that the prosecutor referred only to the time frame within the bill of particulars and the indictment. Mr. Rivera testified that he never was alone with Tracy on the bus, “[e]specially around the summer of 2005.” The state later asked Mr. Rivera whether there were two instances in May during which Tracy was the last passenger on the bus. The defendant objected to the line of - 20 - questioning as being outside of the time frame contained in the bill of particulars, but the trial justice allowed the questioning. In response, defendant replied that he could not recall, but, upon having his recollection refreshed by a driver’s manifest, he testified that Tracy was, in fact, the last person on the bus on May 23, 2005. Thereafter, the state moved to admit the May 2005 driver’s manifest into evidence as a full exhibit. The defendant objected on the grounds that the driver’s manifest was “not within the scope of the dates as indicated in the indictment.” The trial justice overruled defendant’s objection. In denying defendant’s motion for new trial, the trial justice stated that this line of questioning was allowed because it was solely for the purpose of impeachment. It is apparent from our review of the record that the state’s line of questioning was intended to serve impeachment purposes. The state sought to impeach both defendant’s memory and truthfulness in the eyes of the jury and was not attempting to prove that defendant had sexually assaulted Tracy in May 2005. This is apparent because the state specifically asked defendant to jog his memory as he was testifying, rather than having defendant refer to the manifest for the correct answer. The defendant’s inability to recall whether Tracy was the last person on the bus on May 23 and May 24, 2005, only eight days before the time frame cited in the bill of particulars, impeached defendant’s ability to remember facts from that period. Furthermore, defendant previously had testified that Tracy was never the last person on the bus, and it was within the scope of cross-examination to impeach the accuracy of that statement. Mr. Rivera argues that he believed during questioning that the state referred only to the dates stated in the indictment and the bill of particulars. The actual language of the state’s question, however, did not suggest such a limited time frame. - 21 - This Court has said that “the function of a bill of particulars is to apprise a defendant of the evidentiary details establishing the facts of the offense when such facts have not been included in the indictment or information.” State v. LaChapelle, 638 A.2d 525, 527 (R.I. 1994). The general rule is that “when a bill of particulars is produced but extraneous evidence is nevertheless admitted at trial, the trial justice must charge the jurors in a manner that makes clear that in order to convict the defendant, they must find the precise charge set forth in the bill.” Id. at 528. In the case at bar, the trial justice clearly instructed the jury that the state must prove “beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the particular charge * * * within that time period charged.” 8 Juries are presumed to follow a trial justice’s instructions. State v. Hallenbeck, 878 A.2d 992, 1009 (R.I. 2005) (citing State v. Perry, 770 A.2d 882, 885 (R.I. 2001)). We therefore are satisfied that the trial justice did not err in denying the motion for new trial because of the state’s questioning of defendant beyond the dates in the bill of particulars and the indictment. 4. Evidentiary Issues a. Evidence of Promiscuity The defendant contends he was improperly precluded from questioning Elaine’s mother about a previous incident that suggested Elaine was promiscuous. Specifically, defendant argues that he should have been allowed to question Elaine’s mother about an incident when Elaine allegedly allowed a male to enter her hotel room at a Special Olympics event. Mr. Rivera argues 8 The defendant did not object to the jury instructions. - 22 - that this line of questioning should have been allowed because evidence that Elaine had made sexual advances toward another male was highly relevant and probative. The rape-shield statute, G.L. 1956 § 11-37-13, requires a defendant to notify the trial justice of his or her intention to introduce evidence pertaining to the complaining witness’ sexual activities, with a specific offer of proof. Thereafter, the trial justice may allow the evidence to come in if it is found to be relevant. Lynch, 854 A.2d at 1035. The purpose of the law is to “encourage victims to report crimes without fear of inviting unnecessary probing into the victim’s sexual history.” State v. Manning, 973 A.2d 524, 535 n.11 (R.I. 2009) (quoting Lynch, 854 A.2d at 1035). The trial justice did not commit error in denying defendant’s motion for new trial with respect to the exclusion of questions about incidents that allegedly took place between Elaine and two other men. The record reflects that defendant did not notify the trial justice of his intention to probe into Elaine’s conduct or otherwise seek a hearing about the admissibility of such evidence, nor did he make a specific offer of proof. Furthermore, as defendant presents his argument, the incidents appear to have little or no probative value. b. Prior Accusations of Sexual Assault The defendant contends he should have been allowed to question Elaine’s mother about a previous false allegation against another person. 9 At trial, Mr. Rivera sought to question Elaine’s mother about an incident during which Elaine allegedly accused another driver of touching her inappropriately. The state objected on the grounds that the question constituted impermissible impeachment by extrinsic evidence. 9 The question at issue is: “Was there another incident on the bus where another driver was operating, she accused someone else of touching her inappropriately?” Thus, the issue appears to be about an alleged prior false accusation against another person rather than Mr. Rivera, as defendant states in his brief. - 23 - Generally, pursuant to Rule 404(a) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, evidence of a witness’s prior conduct may not be admitted “for the purpose of proving that he or she acted in conformity therewith on a particular occasion * * *.” Under Rule 608(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, however, it is within the discretion of the trial justice to allow extrinsic evidence of prior similar false accusations going to a witness’s credibility. We are satisfied that the trial justice did not err in this instance. The defendant never proffered any evidence that the previous allegation occurred, nor that it was false. Without any such evidence, the trial justice was free to find that the prejudicial effect of asking such a question outweighed its probative value and, as a result, to preclude such questioning. See Manning, 973 A.2d at 535 (“[H]e must at least present some indicia tending to show that the prior accusation was false, or else he runs the risk of a determination that its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect.”). c. Cross-Examination and Direct Examination The defendant contends that the trial justice made numerous erroneous evidentiary rulings that violated his right to confront the witnesses against him and to cross-examine those witnesses, under article 1, section 10, of the Rhode Island Constitution and the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The defendant argues that the trial justice erred in ruling that his questioning of a number of witnesses was beyond the scope of direct examination, and thus could not be explored on cross-examination. Specifically, defendant argues that the trial justice erroneously ruled that defendant’s questioning of the three complaining witnesses’ mothers and Brenda Centraccio, an employee of the Department of Mental Health, Retardation, and Hospitals, was beyond the scope of direct examination, and thus could not be explored on cross-examination. Mr. Rivera also - 24 - avers he was prejudiced by having to call Det. Strickland during his case-in-chief because the state listed him as a witness but never called him. The defendant further contends that he was unable to pursue lines of questioning with other witnesses, including Deborah, Deborah’s mother, Ms. Fournier Cole, and Ms. Lonczak, the recreational director and internal investigator at the LaPlante Center. “Inherent in a criminal defendant’s constitutional right to confront witnesses against him or her—found in both article 1, section 10, of the Rhode Island Constitution and the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution—‘is the fundamental right of the criminal defendant to cross-examine his or her accusers.’” State v. Drew, 919 A.2d 397, 411 (R.I. 2007) (quoting State v. Stansell, 909 A.2d 505, 509 (R.I. 2006)). A criminal defendant’s right to “cross-examination, however, is not unbounded.” Id. It is well settled that “trial justices are accorded wide discretion to curtail cross-examination after there has been ‘sufficient cross- examination to satisfy the Sixth Amendment.’” Id. (quoting Stansell, 909 A.2d at 510). This Court will review “[a] trial justice’s decision to limit the scope of cross-examination * * * for clear abuse of discretion; the decision will be overruled ‘only if such abuse constitutes prejudicial error.’” Id. Rule 611(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence restricts “[c]ross-examination * * * to the subject matter of the direct examination and matters affecting the credibility of the witness.” See also State v. Gordon, 880 A.2d 825, 838 (R.I. 2005) (“[C]ross-examination is generally limited to the scope of direct examination * * *.”). Questions that exceed the scope of direct examination but are “calculated to explain, contradict or discredit a witness’s testimony or designed to test the witness’s accuracy, memory, veracity, credibility or bias” may be permitted on cross-examination. State v. Motyka, 893 A.2d 267, 284 (R.I. 2006) (quoting Gordon, 880 - 25 - A.2d at 838). However, “it is well within the trial justice’s discretion ‘to limit cross-examination to that which was addressed on direct examination.’” Id. (quoting State v. Walsh, 731 A.2d 696, 698 (R.I. 1999)). In the case at bar, we are satisfied the trial justice limited cross-examination of the complaining witnesses’ mothers in an appropriate manner. The questions defendant asked were clearly outside the limited scope of direct examination. As to Ms. Fournier Cole and Ms. Lonczak, defendant does not specify the legal basis for his argument, nor do we perceive any abuse of the trial justice’s discretion. Similarly, the trial justice sustained objections to questions defendant asked of Deborah that generally called for speculation, or were overly broad and did not have a specific time frame. All other allegations of error on the part of the trial justice concerning evidentiary issues have been reviewed, and we perceive no error in the trial justice’s denial of the motion for new trial. D Motion to Lead the Complaining Witnesses The defendant argues that the state should not have been allowed to ask Tracy leading questions because she was not an emotionally distraught witness. Mr. Rivera further contends that the trial justice’s approach of considering each question on a question-by-question basis, rather than generally allowing or disallowing leading questions, was poor practice and invited error. The state counters that defendant’s objection to leading questions was waived at trial because defendant did not properly raise the issue with specificity. Before trial began, the state filed a motion requesting leave to ask leading questions of the complaining witnesses, and Mr. Rivera filed an objection to the state’s motion. Rather than making a broad ruling on the motion, the trial justice announced that he would consider the - 26 - questions as they were presented, and only then determine whether leading questions were appropriate given the context. The trial justice, during a sidebar colloquy, stated the following: “So it may be that it’s permissible to lead one [witness] and maybe not [another]; but I’ll take it as it comes. * * * If we get to that point and the [s]tate starts asking leading questions and [defendant objects], I’ll make that ruling then * * *. But if I overrule your objection I [will] give you a continuing objection * * *.” Although defendant does not specifically identify the questions to which he objects, we have identified the most likely exchanges from the citations given in defendant’s brief. The first exchange defendant raises on appeal appears as follows: “[State]: What part of his body touched your privacy? “[Tracy]: His penis. “[State]: Did it go inside? “[Defense counsel]: Objection.” The second colloquy at issue occurred as follows: “[State]: Are you talking about the same place that you just told us about? “[Tracy]: Well, one is in the woods? “[State]: Well, I’m not talking about the woods anymore. “[Defense Counsel]: Objection. “THE COURT: Overruled. “[State]: I want to talk about the time that you were behind the church. “[Defense Counsel]: Objection. “THE COURT: I don’t believe there was a question.” A trial justice’s ruling made during the examination of witnesses at trial will stand unless “there has been an abuse of discretion or substantial injury to a defendant.” State v. Gomez, 848 A.2d 221, 237 (R.I. 2004) (quoting State v. Boillard, 789 A.2d 881, 886 (R.I. 2002)). This Court gives “considerable latitude to a trial justice’s rulings made during examination of witnesses at trial.” Id. “Furthermore, we will consider the entire colloquy and the full context of the state’s examination in making our determination.” State v. Merced, 933 A.2d 172, 175 (R.I. 2007). - 27 - “A leading question * * * suggests the desired answer.” Id. Leading questions generally are not permitted on direct examination; however, a trial justice may use his or her discretion to allow leading questions “for a number of limited purposes.” Id. This Court has recognized the discretion of a trial justice to allow leading questions, for example, when a witness appears to be having a lapse in memory or to aid “an emotionally distraught juvenile witness reluctant to relate the necessary facts.” Boillard, 789 A.2d at 887. Additionally, this Court has held that a trial justice has the discretion to permit leading questions of a juvenile or “other witness of diminished understanding.” State v. Vanasse, 593 A.2d 58, 68 (R.I. 1991) (quoting State v. Girouard, 561 A.2d 882, 888 (R.I. 1989)). In Vanasse, 593 A.2d at 68, this Court allowed leading questions to facilitate the direct examination of an eleven-year-old complaining witness because “her tender age, coupled with the apparent difficulty she had in understanding questions, justified the use of leading questions on direct examination.” Assuming without deciding that “Did it go inside?” is a leading question, we discern no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial justice. Although Tracy is not a juvenile, she has a developmental disability, and thus it was within the purview of the trial justice to permit leading questions. Moreover, the second exchange to which the defendant objected does not contain a question at all. We are thoroughly satisfied that the trial justice did not err in overruling the defendant’s objections. III Conclusion For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court and remand the record of the case thereto. - 28 - Supreme Court No. 2008-100-C.A. (W1/06-69A) State : v. : Jose Rivera.",criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The defendant, Jose Rivera, appeals from a judgment of conviction, after a jury trial, of two counts of first-degree sexual assault, four counts of second-degree sexual assault, and one count of simple assault. On appeal, the defendant presents four grounds for reversal of his conviction. He contends that: (1) the complaining witnesses were not competent to testify at trial; (2) the trial justice erred in denying his motion to sever the trial counts; (3) the denial of his motion for new trial was an abuse of discretion; (4) the testimony of the complaining witnesses was not competent, legally sufficient, or otherwise credible; and (5) it was error for the trial justice to permit the state to lead the complaining witnesses during direct examination. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Mr. Rivera was employed as a bus driver in the RIde division of the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA), beginning on June 9, 2003.', 'The RIde division provides transportation to people living in Rhode Island needing door-to-door service, such as the developmentally disabled and the elderly.', '-1-', 'In 2005, Mr. Rivera drove five separate routes providing transportation to people attending the Adeline LaPlante Memorial Center (LaPlante Center), a private organization that provides services for children and adults with developmental disabilities. Mr. Rivera picked up his assigned passengers, drove them to the LaPlante Center, and assisted passengers as they got on and off the RIde bus.', 'The defendant’s convictions stem from allegations that Mr. Rivera sexually assaulted three developmentally disabled women in June and July 2005. During this period, the three complaining witnesses in this case, Tracy, Elaine, and Deborah, 1 were passengers on two of Mr. Rivera’s bus routes.', 'A', 'Tracy', 'Tracy, then thirty-seven years old, has a severe developmental disability. Tracy worked at the LaPlante Center for four years prior to the alleged assaults, and she took the RIde bus to the LaPlante Center each day. Tracy testified that Mr. Rivera sexually assaulted her twice when they were alone together on the bus.', 'The first sexual assault allegedly occurred in the RIde bus while it was parked in the woods. 2 Tracy testified that defendant removed her pants, and she hit her head against the corner of the bus window. Tracy further stated that defendant touched her breasts under her bra without her consent. The defendant, according to Tracy’s testimony, also touched his penis to her vagina. She further testified that “[h]e tried to go inside with mine.” Tracy stated that she told Mr. Rivera, “no, stop it” and “[p]lease, stop it.” 1', 'We use pseudonyms to refer to the complaining witnesses. 2', 'There are inconsistencies in Tracy’s testimony. She testified that this sexual assault occurred in the woods near a male passenger’s house, and also that it took place in the woods near Deborah’s house.', '-2-', 'The second assault allegedly occurred while the RIde bus was parked behind a church. According to Tracy’s testimony, Mr. Rivera and Tracy were alone together on the bus when he removed her socks, pants, and one of her shoes. She said defendant touched his penis to her “private area in front” and touched her breasts under her clothing and bra. Tracy further testified that “[a]ll white stuff came out” of defendant’s penis and that she told defendant to stop, but he continued to assault her. Mr. Rivera told Tracy, according to her testimony, not to tell her parents, or she would get in trouble. Tracy stated that when she arrived home, she told her mother that she had to wash her hands because she had “sticky stuff” on them.', 'Tracy testified that she ultimately reported the incident to her mother, although she was too scared to tell her mother at first. Tracy said that she first spoke to Deborah about Mr. Rivera and, some time after, they both told their mothers about the assaults. Her mother testified that she remembered the day she got off the bus and was not acting like herself, but her mother could not recall the exact date.', 'On July 13, 2005, Tracy went to a physician’s assistant, Josephine Barns-Brown, and, according to Ms. Barns-Brown, Tracy reported that she had lumps on her “pee-wee” and her left inner thigh. Ms. Barns-Brown testified that she was unable to determine the exact date of the assaults, that Tracy’s hymen was intact, and that Tracy’s mother had not found blood in Tracy’s underwear. Although Tracy testified that she had lumps on her breasts and hip, Ms. Barns- Brown testified that she did not find any such lumps or bumps.', 'Mr. Rivera denied assaulting Tracy and, in fact, testified he was never alone with Tracy on the bus. The defendant stated that when he announced to his passengers he was going to be transferred to another route, Tracy was “angry, upset” and was in “tears.”', 'Tracy testified that she told defendant “you’re not going anywhere; you’re going to be my bus driver.” Tracy', '-3- indicated that she wanted to get Mr. Rivera fired because she was upset that he was changing routes.', 'Detective Patrick Strickland testified that he spoke to Tracy’s mother in the course of investigating the allegations against defendant. Tracy’s mother reported, according to Det. Strickland, that Tracy told her that defendant “exposed his penis to her [and] asked her if she wanted to play a game,” but that defendant never touched her. Detective Strickland testified, however, that when he spoke with Tracy, she reported, consistent with her own testimony, that defendant vaginally raped her and touched her breasts over and underneath her clothing. Tracy reported to Det. Strickland that this occurred while defendant and Tracy were alone together on the bus, parked in the woods.', 'B', 'Elaine', 'Elaine, then twenty-two years old, has a developmental disability stemming from a seizure disorder. Elaine testified that one morning she was on the RIde bus parked in front of the LaPlante Center and defendant asked Corey, another passenger, to move from the seat next to Elaine. According to her testimony, Mr. Rivera sat next to her and used the palm of his hand to rub her breast area underneath her clothing and bra. The defendant also allegedly used his first finger and hand to touch her “privates” underneath her underwear. Elaine stated that she used tae kwon do training to attempt to block Mr. Rivera’s advances and told him to stop. Elaine further testified that there were five other passengers on the bus when the assault occurred.', 'Elaine alleged that Mr. Rivera assaulted her on one occasion. When Elaine went into the LaPlante Center the morning of the assault, she approached Danielle Fournier Cole, an employee of the LaPlante Center at the time of the alleged assault, and told her that the bus driver had touched her inappropriately. Ms. Fournier Cole testified, contrary to Elaine’s testimony, that', '-4- Elaine reported she had been touched a couple of times that week. Although the date of the assault is not apparent from the record, Ms. Fournier Cole prepared a statement documenting Elaine’s report on July 22, 2005.', 'Two passengers on the RIde bus testified that they witnessed Mr. Rivera assault Elaine. Corey confirmed that he was sitting next to Elaine when defendant told him to move. According to Corey’s testimony, defendant then sat next to Elaine and touched Elaine’s chest, her legs, and “in a private part.” Corey stated that he observed the alleged assault by looking in a mirror mounted above the driver’s seat of the bus. Katherine, another passenger, testified that she saw defendant touch Elaine’s breast and vagina.', 'At trial, defendant elicited testimony to establish facts suggesting Elaine had a motive to fabricate the allegations against him. The defendant attempted to establish facts that (1) tended to show Elaine sought revenge against defendant for reprimanding her on the bus; (2) Elaine had a propensity to lie, especially that she had a propensity to make false accusations of sexual assault; and (3) the three complaining witnesses shared stories of defendant’s sexual assault before reporting the incidents to authority figures, implying that they had colluded to make such allegations.', 'Mr. Rivera testified that he reprimanded Elaine and a male passenger, Emil, for being “intertwined” on the bus, “kissing, hugging and carrying on.” The defendant further testified that Elaine and Emil were “furious” at him for intervening. The defendant stated he reported the situation to employees of the LaPlante Center a day or two prior to Elaine’s accusation of sexual assault.', 'During the trial, defendant questioned Brenda Centracchio, a state social worker at the LaPlante Center, about a “status sheet” she prepared that indicated Elaine’s mother thought', '-5- Elaine had a grudge against Mr. Rivera for reprimanding her. The trial justice, however, did not permit the questioning to continue, and he did not allow the admission of the “status sheet” as a full exhibit, ruling that it constituted double hearsay.', 'Supporting defendant’s theory that Elaine had a propensity to lie, Elaine’s mother testified that she did not, at first, believe her daughter had been assaulted because some LaPlante Center attendees had started a “pathological liars club” and they were “trying to one up each other.” The defendant unsuccessfully sought to introduce other evidence suggesting Elaine had a propensity to lie; namely, that Elaine previously had made a false accusation against both Emil and another person. The defendant questioned Elaine about the alleged incident between Elaine and Emil, and Elaine denied that he had “done anything physically inappropriate,” but noted that Emil had “kissed [her] and stuff like that when [she] didn’t want to.” The defendant also questioned Elaine’s mother about whether Elaine had accused other people of touching her inappropriately. The trial justice, however, sustained the state’s objections to the questions, and the theory was not further developed at trial.', 'Finally, defendant sought to elicit testimony implying that the complaining witnesses had discussed the allegations with one another.', 'Tracy testified that Elaine told her about her allegation against Mr. Rivera, whereas Elaine denied discussing the alleged assault.', 'C', 'Deborah', 'Deborah, then thirty-nine years old, has a developmental disability and three types of seizure disorders.

Deborah stated that, in response, she zipped', '-6- up her jacket. Both Deborah and her mother testified that after defendant dropped Deborah off at home, Deborah reported the incident to her mother. Deborah’s mother believed that Deborah reported the incident to her between June 20, 2005, and June 24, 2005. Tracy also testified that she saw Mr. Rivera touch Deborah.', 'D', 'Competency Hearing and Trial', 'On February 10, 2006, a grand jury issued an indictment charging Mr. Rivera with seven offenses, including second-degree sexual assault of Deborah (count 1), two counts of first-degree sexual assault of Tracy (counts 2 and 4), two counts of second-degree sexual assault of Tracy (counts 3 and 5), and two counts of second-degree sexual assault (counts 6 and 7) of Elaine.

Deborah also was able to recall what she had for breakfast. She communicated an observation that the prosecutor was holding a blue pen, and she stated that it was bad to tell a lie. Deborah, however, did get somewhat confused about what she had eaten the previous day, and she had never heard the word “prosecutor” before. Deborah also had difficulty answering some other questions and naming the prosecutor, and she admitted that she rehearsed her testimony with the prosecutor. 3', 'The defendant narrowed his argument on appeal to the competency of Tracy and Deborah. We will, accordingly, address the competency hearing only as it relates to Tracy and Deborah.', '-7-', 'Tracy, during the competency hearing, was able to state her address, the people with whom she lives, and her pets. She also was able to identify the prosecutor’s pen and paper. Tracy stated that she was a woman and the prosecutor was a man, but she was unable to explain how to tell men and women apart. Tracy promised to tell the truth, but was unable to define the word “promise.” Tracy also was unable to correctly describe the role of the judge, prosecutor, or lawyer.', 'Tracy contradicted herself at several points during the hearing. She stated that she had tuna fish for lunch, and later testified that she had not yet eaten. She also testified that she knew Deborah, and later stated that she did not know Deborah. When asked whether she would be able to recognize defendant, Tracy answered “no.” Also, when asked, “If you were asked a question about what you did in the summer of 2005 and you can’t remember what you did in 2005, what are you going to say?” Tracy responded, “I worked that day.”', 'Doctor Stewart testified that he heard just over half the testimony, and on the basis of his observations and the documents, interviews, and reports provided to him, he could not reach an opinion about the competency of the complaining witnesses.', 'Doctor Stewart said that neurological testing was required to assess “the cognitive ability and reliability” of the complaining witnesses and stated later that he had “been asking * * * frequently for qualified experts in the respective field” to assess the complaining witnesses. Defense counsel, however, did not request neurological testing and instead stated, “the Court would be in the best position to determine the need, if any, to have the alleged victims further examined.”', 'At the conclusion of the competency hearing, on May 22, 2007, the Superior Court found all three complaining witnesses competent to testify and denied defendant’s motion to sever the counts.

On August 7, 2007, the trial justice sentenced defendant to life imprisonment for counts 2 and 4 and fifteen years to serve on counts 3 and 5, all such terms to run concurrently. He also sentenced defendant to two concurrent terms of fifteen years on counts 6 and 7, said terms to run consecutively to counts 2, 3, 4, and 5.

After hearing the complaining witnesses and the expert witness testify, the trial justice found all three complaining witnesses competent to testify given their appreciation of the need to tell the truth and their ability to observe, recollect, and communicate.', 'The defendant contends the trial justice abused his discretion in finding two of the three complaining witnesses, Tracy and Deborah, competent to testify at trial. Specifically, defendant draws attention to discrepancies in Tracy’s testimony, her testimony that she would be unable to identify defendant if she saw him, and her inability to explain the differences between a male and a female. In further support of his position, defendant notes Tracy’s inability to explain the word “promise,” her inability to identify the roles of a judge, lawyer, or prosecutor, as well as weaknesses in her recollection. The defendant highlights the fact that Tracy spontaneously uttered statements such as “he touched me,” and that Tracy had inconsistencies in her testimony. Additionally, Mr. Rivera contends that Tracy’s admission that she had rehearsed her testimony further supports his argument that she was incompetent to testify.', 'Similarly, Mr. Rivera argues that it was an abuse of discretion for the trial justice to find Deborah competent to testify. To support his argument, defendant notes that Deborah was unable to differentiate between a man and woman, that she did not know the meaning of the word “oath,” and that she had practiced her testimony before the competency hearing.', '“Rule 601 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence requires that a witness be competent to testify.” Lynch, 854 A.2d at 1029. To find a witness competent to testify, the trial justice must make four determinations: “the witness must be able to ‘observe, recollect, communicate, and appreciate the necessity of telling the truth.” Id. (quoting Seabra, 655 A.2d at 252). Furthermore, there is no per se rule that disqualifies individuals with developmental disabilities or mental', '- 10 - illnesses from testifying at trial. See id.

Franklin, 103 R.I. 715, 723-24, 241 A.2d 219, 225 (1968) (noting that there is no presumption disqualifying a mentally ill witness). Rather, competency is to be determined by the trial justice on a case-by-case basis. See Pierce v. New England Telephone & Telegraph Co., 86 R.I. 326, 330-31, 134 A.2d 421, 423 (1957).', 'In the case under review, Tracy demonstrated her ability to observe and communicate her observations when she identified a pen and a piece of paper that the prosecutor was holding. She also exhibited her ability to recollect and communicate when she identified her address, the people with whom she lives, and her pets. Tracy demonstrated an appreciation for the necessity of telling the truth when she agreed to say “I don’t remember” if she did not recall an answer to a question. She also exhibited an understanding of the consequences of lying and promised not to lie.', 'When the prosecutor asked whether a piece of paper was red, Tracy corrected the prosecutor, stating that the paper was white, thus showing that she was able to correctly observe the color of the paper, communicate her observation, and tell the truth.', 'Although Tracy admitted to rehearsing her testimony, this does not change our analysis of her competency. Testimony rehearsal goes to the credibility of the witness, not his or her competency. Cf. State v. Russell, 950 A.2d 418, 434 (R.I. 2008) (approving a trial justice’s consideration of a witness’s testimony rehearsal in passing on the credibility of her testimony). It was within the province of the trial justice to consider the witness’s testimony in light of the fact that she had rehearsed her testimony. Tracy’s honesty about having rehearsed her testimony could be seen further as adding to her credibility and her appreciation of the need to tell the truth.', 'Tracy was unable to define the word “promise,” but a witness need not be able to explain such abstract concepts. Rather, he or she must be able to appreciate that he or she must be', '- 11 - truthful. Tracy did state during the competency hearing that she would be unable to identify defendant if she saw him, 4 but she was able to identify him during the actual trial. Finally, Tracy’s testimony that she could not differentiate between a man and a woman, and her confusion over questions about Deborah, do not alter our assessment, considering that the totality of her testimony exhibited her ability to observe, recollect, and communicate. We agree with the trial justice that although Tracy responded to questions very literally, her literal understanding of language does not preclude her from being able to communicate.', 'Similarly, Deborah displayed her ability to recall and communicate facts as she named the members in her family, described her pets, recalled what she ate for breakfast, and recited her home address. Deborah did display some confusion concerning what she had eaten the previous day, but she asked for clarification. Additionally, when she could not recall an answer, she chose not to answer the question, rather than give an incorrect answer.', 'Deborah also displayed an appreciation for telling the truth when she stated that “you should tell the truth” and “a lie is bad.” Furthermore, she stated that if she did not understand a question about something that occurred in 2005, she would state that she could not remember. Deborah’s inability to articulate the difference between a man and a woman does not bear on her ability to observe, recollect, and communicate, given the totality of her testimony. Moreover, for the reasons noted above, Deborah’s rehearsal of her testimony and her inability to define “oath” are not sufficient grounds to find her incompetent to testify. 4', 'The dialogue concerning Tracy’s ability to identify defendant occurred as follows:', '“[State]: If you saw [defendant], you [sic] would you be able to recognize him?', '“[Tracy]: No.', '“[State]: You wouldn’t be able to recognize him if you saw him again?', '“[Tracy]: I won’t ever see him again. I won’t be on the bus then.”', '- 12 -', 'Considering the totality of the evidence adduced at the competency hearing, we are satisfied that the trial justice’s ruling was a sustainable exercise of his discretion.', 'B', 'Motion to Sever', 'The defendant avers that the trial justice improperly denied his motion to sever the counts against him. 5 Mr. Rivera contends that he was prejudiced by having three victims, particularly three developmentally disabled victims, testify against him during one trial because their testimony confused the jury. Furthermore, Mr. Rivera disagrees with the standard of review for severance of trial counts; specifically, he does not believe that “substantial prejudice” should be the standard. The defendant also argues that he was prejudiced because the weight of the evidence against defendant for some of the counts may have been greater than for others. Finally, defendant argues that it is unlikely the state would call a victim as a witness during a separate criminal trial because it would violate defendant’s Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment constitutional rights.', '1.

These issues, he contends, “may warrant the Supreme Court considering a reversal.” Given the substance of defendant’s claims, we treat these issues as an appeal from the trial justice’s denial of his motion for new trial based upon error of law. The trial justice’s identification of the correct legal standard is a question of law, which this Court will review de novo. See State v.

In the case at bar, we have carefully considered defendant’s arguments and are well satisfied that the trial justice identified and applied the correct legal standards.', '2. The Legal Sufficiency of Evidence Presented at Trial', 'The defendant argues that the testimony of the complaining witnesses “was neither competent, legally sufficient nor credible.” Specifically, defendant contends that the evidence supporting defendant’s alleged penetration of Tracy was “vague, suspect, unclear and not competent.”', 'The defendant furthermore lists a number of facts to which the complaining witnesses testified during trial and states that they are devoid of credibility.', 'It is our opinion, however, that the trial justice sufficiently conducted an independent review of the evidence and adequately stated his justification for denying defendant’s motion for new trial. In denying the motion for new trial, the trial justice applied the proper standard in making the determination and acted as a thirteenth juror, exercising independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence. The crux of this case is credibility: whether the jury believed defendant or the three complaining witnesses. After the trial justice independently assessed the credibility of the witnesses, he concurred with the jury that the complaining witnesses were credible. The trial justice supported this conclusion by referring to the testimony of virtually all of the key witnesses, especially the three complaining witnesses.', 'After an independent review of defendant’s testimony, the trial justice determined that he was not credible. The trial justice placed emphasis on the fact that defendant’s description of the', '- 19 - seating structure of the bus was inaccurate, in addition to the fact that defendant’s driver manifests contradicted his statement that he never was alone on the bus with Tracy.', 'The mere fact that defendant disagrees with the trial justice’s conclusions about credibility is not a sufficient basis to warrant the granting of a motion for new trial. See State v. Otero, 788 A.2d 469, 474 (R.I. 2002) (denying a motion for new trial noting that it was within the trial justice’s province to make credibility determinations).

Flori, 963 A.2d 932, 937 (R.I. 2009) (quoting Bergevine, 942 A.2d at 981). We are satisfied that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in finding the evidence legally sufficient.', '3. Impeachment and the Bill of Particulars', 'The defendant argues that he was prejudiced and that the prosecutor committed prosecutorial misconduct when, on cross-examination, the state implied that defendant may have assaulted Tracy on a date outside those designated in the bill of particulars and the indictment. The defendant contends that when asked by the prosecutor whether he was alone with Tracy, or whether Tracy was ever the last passenger on the bus, defendant’s answer assumed that the prosecutor referred only to the time frame within the bill of particulars and the indictment.', 'Mr. Rivera testified that he never was alone with Tracy on the bus, “[e]specially around the summer of 2005.” The state later asked Mr. Rivera whether there were two instances in May during which Tracy was the last passenger on the bus. The defendant objected to the line of', '- 20 - questioning as being outside of the time frame contained in the bill of particulars, but the trial justice allowed the questioning. In response, defendant replied that he could not recall, but, upon having his recollection refreshed by a driver’s manifest, he testified that Tracy was, in fact, the last person on the bus on May 23, 2005. Thereafter, the state moved to admit the May 2005 driver’s manifest into evidence as a full exhibit. The defendant objected on the grounds that the driver’s manifest was “not within the scope of the dates as indicated in the indictment.” The trial justice overruled defendant’s objection. In denying defendant’s motion for new trial, the trial justice stated that this line of questioning was allowed because it was solely for the purpose of impeachment.', 'It is apparent from our review of the record that the state’s line of questioning was intended to serve impeachment purposes. The state sought to impeach both defendant’s memory and truthfulness in the eyes of the jury and was not attempting to prove that defendant had sexually assaulted Tracy in May 2005. This is apparent because the state specifically asked defendant to jog his memory as he was testifying, rather than having defendant refer to the manifest for the correct answer. The defendant’s inability to recall whether Tracy was the last person on the bus on May 23 and May 24, 2005, only eight days before the time frame cited in the bill of particulars, impeached defendant’s ability to remember facts from that period. Furthermore, defendant previously had testified that Tracy was never the last person on the bus, and it was within the scope of cross-examination to impeach the accuracy of that statement.', 'Mr. Rivera argues that he believed during questioning that the state referred only to the dates stated in the indictment and the bill of particulars. The actual language of the state’s question, however, did not suggest such a limited time frame.', '- 21 -', 'This Court has said that “the function of a bill of particulars is to apprise a defendant of the evidentiary details establishing the facts of the offense when such facts have not been included in the indictment or information.” State v. LaChapelle, 638 A.2d 525, 527 (R.I. 1994). The general rule is that “when a bill of particulars is produced but extraneous evidence is nevertheless admitted at trial, the trial justice must charge the jurors in a manner that makes clear that in order to convict the defendant, they must find the precise charge set forth in the bill.” Id. at 528.', 'In the case at bar, the trial justice clearly instructed the jury that the state must prove “beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the particular charge * * * within that time period charged.” 8 Juries are presumed to follow a trial justice’s instructions.

Evidentiary Issues', 'a. Evidence of Promiscuity', 'The defendant contends he was improperly precluded from questioning Elaine’s mother about a previous incident that suggested Elaine was promiscuous. Specifically, defendant argues that he should have been allowed to question Elaine’s mother about an incident when Elaine allegedly allowed a male to enter her hotel room at a Special Olympics event. Mr. Rivera argues 8', 'The defendant did not object to the jury instructions.', '- 22 - that this line of questioning should have been allowed because evidence that Elaine had made sexual advances toward another male was highly relevant and probative.', 'The rape-shield statute, G.L. 1956 § 11-37-13, requires a defendant to notify the trial justice of his or her intention to introduce evidence pertaining to the complaining witness’ sexual activities, with a specific offer of proof. Thereafter, the trial justice may allow the evidence to come in if it is found to be relevant. Lynch, 854 A.2d at 1035. The purpose of the law is to “encourage victims to report crimes without fear of inviting unnecessary probing into the victim’s sexual history.” State v. Manning, 973 A.2d 524, 535 n.11 (R.I. 2009) (quoting Lynch, 854 A.2d at 1035).', 'The trial justice did not commit error in denying defendant’s motion for new trial with respect to the exclusion of questions about incidents that allegedly took place between Elaine and two other men. The record reflects that defendant did not notify the trial justice of his intention to probe into Elaine’s conduct or otherwise seek a hearing about the admissibility of such evidence, nor did he make a specific offer of proof. Furthermore, as defendant presents his argument, the incidents appear to have little or no probative value.', 'b. Prior Accusations of Sexual Assault', 'The defendant contends he should have been allowed to question Elaine’s mother about a previous false allegation against another person. 9', 'At trial, Mr. Rivera sought to question Elaine’s mother about an incident during which Elaine allegedly accused another driver of touching her inappropriately. The state objected on the grounds that the question constituted impermissible impeachment by extrinsic evidence. 9', 'The question at issue is: “Was there another incident on the bus where another driver was operating, she accused someone else of touching her inappropriately?” Thus, the issue appears to be about an alleged prior false accusation against another person rather than Mr. Rivera, as defendant states in his brief.', '- 23 -', 'Generally, pursuant to Rule 404(a) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, evidence of a witness’s prior conduct may not be admitted “for the purpose of proving that he or she acted in conformity therewith on a particular occasion * * *.” Under Rule 608(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, however, it is within the discretion of the trial justice to allow extrinsic evidence of prior similar false accusations going to a witness’s credibility.', 'We are satisfied that the trial justice did not err in this instance. The defendant never proffered any evidence that the previous allegation occurred, nor that it was false. Without any such evidence, the trial justice was free to find that the prejudicial effect of asking such a question outweighed its probative value and, as a result, to preclude such questioning. See Manning, 973 A.2d at 535 (“[H]e must at least present some indicia tending to show that the prior accusation was false, or else he runs the risk of a determination that its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect.”).', 'c. Cross-Examination and Direct Examination', 'The defendant contends that the trial justice made numerous erroneous evidentiary rulings that violated his right to confront the witnesses against him and to cross-examine those witnesses, under article 1, section 10, of the Rhode Island Constitution and the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice erred in ruling that his questioning of a number of witnesses was beyond the scope of direct examination, and thus could not be explored on cross-examination. Specifically, defendant argues that the trial justice erroneously ruled that defendant’s questioning of the three complaining witnesses’ mothers and Brenda Centraccio, an employee of the Department of Mental Health, Retardation, and Hospitals, was beyond the scope of direct examination, and thus could not be explored on cross-examination. Mr. Rivera also', '- 24 - avers he was prejudiced by having to call Det. Strickland during his case-in-chief because the state listed him as a witness but never called him. The defendant further contends that he was unable to pursue lines of questioning with other witnesses, including Deborah, Deborah’s mother, Ms. Fournier Cole, and Ms. Lonczak, the recreational director and internal investigator at the LaPlante Center.', '“Inherent in a criminal defendant’s constitutional right to confront witnesses against him or her—found in both article 1, section 10, of the Rhode Island Constitution and the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution—‘is the fundamental right of the criminal defendant to cross-examine his or her accusers.’” State v. Drew, 919 A.2d 397, 411 (R.I. 2007) (quoting State v. Stansell, 909 A.2d 505, 509 (R.I. 2006)). A criminal defendant’s right to “cross-examination, however, is not unbounded.” Id. It is well settled that “trial justices are accorded wide discretion to curtail cross-examination after there has been ‘sufficient cross- examination to satisfy the Sixth Amendment.’” Id. (quoting Stansell, 909 A.2d at 510). This Court will review “[a] trial justice’s decision to limit the scope of cross-examination * * * for clear abuse of discretion; the decision will be overruled ‘only if such abuse constitutes prejudicial error.’” Id.', 'Rule 611(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence restricts “[c]ross-examination * * * to the subject matter of the direct examination and matters affecting the credibility of the witness.” See also State v. Gordon, 880 A.2d 825, 838 (R.I. 2005) (“[C]ross-examination is generally limited to the scope of direct examination * * *.”). Questions that exceed the scope of direct examination but are “calculated to explain, contradict or discredit a witness’s testimony or designed to test the witness’s accuracy, memory, veracity, credibility or bias” may be permitted on cross-examination.

However, “it is well within the trial justice’s discretion ‘to limit cross-examination to that which was addressed on direct examination.’” Id. (quoting State v. Walsh, 731 A.2d 696, 698 (R.I. 1999)).', 'In the case at bar, we are satisfied the trial justice limited cross-examination of the complaining witnesses’ mothers in an appropriate manner. The questions defendant asked were clearly outside the limited scope of direct examination. As to Ms. Fournier Cole and Ms. Lonczak, defendant does not specify the legal basis for his argument, nor do we perceive any abuse of the trial justice’s discretion. Similarly, the trial justice sustained objections to questions defendant asked of Deborah that generally called for speculation, or were overly broad and did not have a specific time frame.', 'All other allegations of error on the part of the trial justice concerning evidentiary issues have been reviewed, and we perceive no error in the trial justice’s denial of the motion for new trial.', 'D', 'Motion to Lead the Complaining Witnesses', 'The defendant argues that the state should not have been allowed to ask Tracy leading questions because she was not an emotionally distraught witness. Mr. Rivera further contends that the trial justice’s approach of considering each question on a question-by-question basis, rather than generally allowing or disallowing leading questions, was poor practice and invited error. The state counters that defendant’s objection to leading questions was waived at trial because defendant did not properly raise the issue with specificity.', 'Before trial began, the state filed a motion requesting leave to ask leading questions of the complaining witnesses, and Mr. Rivera filed an objection to the state’s motion. Rather than making a broad ruling on the motion, the trial justice announced that he would consider the', '- 26 - questions as they were presented, and only then determine whether leading questions were appropriate given the context. The trial justice, during a sidebar colloquy, stated the following:', '“So it may be that it’s permissible to lead one [witness] and maybe', 'not [another]; but I’ll take it as it comes. * * * If we get to that', 'point and the [s]tate starts asking leading questions and [defendant', 'objects], I’ll make that ruling then * * *.

Additionally, this Court has held that a trial justice has the discretion to permit leading questions of a juvenile or “other witness of diminished understanding.” State v. Vanasse, 593 A.2d 58, 68 (R.I. 1991) (quoting State v. Girouard, 561 A.2d 882, 888 (R.I. 1989)). In Vanasse, 593 A.2d at 68, this Court allowed leading questions to facilitate the direct examination of an eleven-year-old complaining witness because “her tender age, coupled with the apparent difficulty she had in understanding questions, justified the use of leading questions on direct examination.”', 'Assuming without deciding that “Did it go inside?” is a leading question, we discern no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial justice. Although Tracy is not a juvenile, she has a developmental disability, and thus it was within the purview of the trial justice to permit leading questions.

66,"UAG West Bay AM, LLC et al. : v. : Nicholas E. Cambio et al. : Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, and Robinson, JJ. OPINION PER CURIAM. The defendant, Bald Hill Commons Condominium Association, Inc. (the Condominium Association), appeals from an order denying its motion for an extension of time to file a notice of appeal and dismissing its notice of appeal. The defendant contends that its appeal was timely because the Superior Court clerk failed to properly enter the judgment and failed to provide the parties with notice of the entry of judgment from which they wished to appeal. It further argues that, even if its filing of the notice of appeal was not timely, it has demonstrated excusable neglect for any delay. This case came before this Court pursuant to our order directing the parties to appear and show cause why this case should not summarily be decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions, we conclude that cause has not been shown. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Superior Court. -1- I Facts and Procedural History The underlying facts 1 of this case involve access rights for the entrance to the “Inskip Auto Mall” car dealership in Warwick, Rhode Island, as well as access rights to a nearby parking area used by the dealership. The plaintiff UAG West Bay AM, LLC (UAG West Bay) manages the Inskip dealership and leases the dealership property from plaintiff Car War, LLC (Car War), through an affiliated company, plaintiff UAG Realty, LLC (UAG Realty). Car War also owns a “remote parking area” near the dealership that UAG West Bay uses for long-term parking of car inventory and employee parking. The Inskip dealership abuts Bald Hill Commons Condominium (Bald Hill Commons), a commercial shopping center. Over the course of at least ten years, the Inskip dealership maintained a curb cut linking Inskip’s main campus with “Inskip Way,” an access drive that lies within Bald Hill Commons. It later installed a second curb cut as well. The curb cuts provide access from the dealership to both the shopping center and the remote parking area. According to plaintiffs, in June 2004, defendant Nicholas E. Cambio, one of the original Bald Hill Commons developers, contacted UAG West Bay’s chief operating officer and asserted that he held the exclusive right to grant access between Bald Hill Commons and any adjacent properties. He allegedly demanded that UAG West Bay pay a one-time access fee payable to him personally. UAG West Bay refused to make such payment. In January 2005, Mr. Cambio allegedly threatened to block the dealership’s curb cuts with concrete blocks to prevent access to Inskip Way. Shortly thereafter, plaintiffs filed the instant action in the Superior Court against the Condominium Association and Mr. Cambio, seeking injunctive relief restraining defendants 1 The majority of these facts derive from plaintiffs’ complaint. We note, however, that we include these facts to provide some context for the issues in dispute in this case; the underlying facts themselves have no bearing on the disposition of those issues. -2- from interfering with their easement rights of access to, and use of, the curb cuts, the condominium roadways, and the remote parking area. They also requested a declaratory judgment stating the same. Finally, they requested a judgment declaring that they have no obligation to pay an access fee to Mr. Cambio or to the Condominium Association. The nub of the dispute concerned certain special declarant rights that Car War alleged it held in Bald Hill Commons. After the complaint was filed, however, a conveyancing error in the deeds purporting to transfer such declarant rights was discovered. The plaintiffs sought to remedy the defects by executing and filing corrective deeds; defendants on the other hand argued that the conveyances were fatally defective and void, thus defeating any interest plaintiffs claimed in the condominium. Subsequently, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. On November 21, 2006, the hearing justice granted partial summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs, holding that Car War held valid title to the declarant rights and thus the creation of the three units was a valid exercise of its authority. Thereafter, the parties entered into negotiations to resolve the remaining issues, eventually agreeing to a consent judgment. On December 10, 2007, plaintiffs’ attorneys and defendants’ attorney signed a document entitled “Final Judgment,” that incorporated the hearing justice’s grant of partial summary judgment as well as the issues agreed upon by the parties. 2 The hearing justice then signed the judgment in the presence of attorneys representing all parties. The defendants’ attorney then asked plaintiffs’ counsel to file the judgment with the Kent County Superior Court clerk’s office and to provide him with a fully executed copy of the document. 3 The plaintiffs’ attorney filed the judgment with the clerk’s office that same day and mailed a copy to defendants’ counsel, 2 The “Final Judgment” also purported to preserve the defendants’ rights to appeal the partial summary judgment granted in favor of plaintiffs. 3 The hearing justice was sitting in Washington County when she approved the final judgment. -3- which was received the following day. The enclosed judgment bore a stamp indicating that it was filed with the clerks’ office on December 10, 2007, but it was not signed by the clerk. In fact, the judgment was not signed by the clerk until December 11, 2007, although the docket sheet indicates that it was entered on December 10. The clerk’s office never sent any party a notice of entry of judgment. On January 4, 2008, defendant filed an emergency motion for a brief extension of time to file its notice of appeal. In its motion, defendant asserted that there was excusable neglect justifying an extension of time within which to file an appeal. The defendant attached two affidavits to its motion—one from defendant’s attorney of record and one from an associate with the same firm. Both attorneys asserted that the attorney of record had completely delegated responsibility for the filing of the notice of appeal to the associate and that the latter failed to make the filing in a timely manner because of serious illness. The defendant Condominium Association also filed a notice of appeal from the December 10, 2007 judgment on January 4, 2008. 4 The hearing justice held an evidentiary hearing on defendant’s motion on January 23 and January 24, 2008. At this hearing, defendant raised an additional argument, viz., that the judgment was “defective and a nullity” because the clerk did not actually sign the document until December 11, notwithstanding the docket notation indicating that it was entered on December 10, 2007. The defendant presented the testimony of Todd Viccione, M.D., who discussed the associate’s medical condition during December 2007. There can be little doubt that she was ill at that time, although there was some debate as to the amount of work she actually was able to perform. 4 Nicholas Cambio did not file a notice of appeal. -4- The defendant’s attorney of record testified that he was present in court on December 10, 2007, when the hearing justice signed the final judgment. He also confirmed that he received a letter from one of plaintiffs’ attorneys the next day, indicating that judgment had been entered on December 10. He stated that, upon returning to his office on December 10, he spoke with the associate and told her to file a notice of appeal from the adverse summary-judgment decision. He further explained that he decided to delegate responsibility for the filing to the associate because she was a trusted colleague and a former law clerk and because he was extremely busy with other cases and had never filed a Supreme Court appeal. He also stated that the associate had worked on some aspects of the case, but she was not an attorney of record in the matter. According to the attorney of record, the associate enjoyed “a great deal of autonomy[,]” and he did not “huddle over” her to make sure the appeal had been filed. Indeed, he recalled discussing the filing of the appeal “in passing” with the associate, “about five or six days” after giving her the assignment. At that time, she told him that she was “taking care of it.” Thereafter, he conceded, he “never checked with her once * * * to see whether she had prepared and filed a notice of appeal.” Although the attorney of record testified that his firm had “a system in place” whereby a deadline is docketed so that attorneys are reminded of it, he stated that he never docketed the appeal deadline in this case. Further, he acknowledged that he did not know whether the associate had ever entered the deadline into the firm’s docketing system. On January 3, 2008, the attorney of record emailed the associate to confirm that she had filed the notice of appeal, only to learn that it had never been filed. Under cross-examination, he said that he was not aware of the length of the appeal period and confirmed that he was “totally depending on [the associate] to find out what the applicable deadline was and file the notice of appeal.” He also conceded that to his knowledge the associate had never filed a notice of appeal -5- to this Court. He further testified that he was unaware that she was suffering from any illness in December 2007. The associate also testified at the evidentiary hearing. She stated that she never informed any of her colleagues of her illness during the month of December, despite the fact that she “was having trouble getting a lot of things done.” Although she was experiencing serious medical symptoms during the appeal period, she performed approximately fifty hours of legal work for clients. She further testified that she did not realize that December 31 5 was the deadline for filing the notice of appeal because she never calculated when the twenty-day period of appeal would expire. The associate also confirmed that she had never formally entered an appearance in the case. On February 6, 2008, the hearing justice denied defendant’s request for an extension of time to file a notice of appeal. The hearing justice found that the appeal period began to run on December 11, 2007—the date that the clerk signed the judgment. She ruled that Article I, Rule 4 of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure did not require the judgment to be docketed for it to be appealed. The hearing justice also believed that, under the circumstances, the clerk’s failure to mail a copy of the entered judgment did not mean that the appeal period had not begun to run. She noted that the parties’ legal counsel were present when she signed the judgment, implying that they therefore were on notice that the appeal period was about to begin. On the issue of excusable neglect, the hearing justice noted that this Court has previously ruled that a busy legal practice does not meet the standard of excusable neglect. She observed that the associate was never an attorney of record in the case until after the deadline for filing the notice of appeal had expired. She therefore found that the associate’s illness had no bearing on 5 As discussed at greater length below, December 31, 2007 would have been the deadline for filing a notice of appeal regardless of whether judgment were deemed entered on December 10 or December 11. -6- the case. Rather, as the primary attorney in the matter, it was the attorney of record’s responsibility to follow up and make sure the notice of appeal had been filed. The hearing justice therefore denied defendant’s motion to extend and dismissed the Condominium Association’s notice of appeal. An order was entered on February 6, 2008, from which the Condominium Association timely appealed. II Standard of Review Questions of law are reviewed de novo by this Court. Carnevale v. Dupee, 783 A.2d 404, 408 (R.I. 2001). “Like questions of statutory construction, the interpretation of court rules of procedure is a legal question for the court.” McDonough v. McDonough, 962 A.2d 47, 54 (R.I. 2009); see also Crowe Countryside Realty Associates, Co., LLC v. Novare Engineers, Inc., 891 A.2d 838, 840 (R.I. 2006) (reviewing Rule 26 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure de novo); In re James C., 871 A.2d 940, 942 n.6 (R.I. 2005) (considering the interpretation of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence de novo). “This court will review the Superior Court’s excusable-neglect determination for abuse of discretion.” Friedman v. Lee Pare & Associates, Inc., 593 A.2d 1354, 1356 (R.I. 1991); Small Business Loan Fund Corp. v. Gallant, 795 A.2d 531, 532 (R.I. 2002) (“This Court will reverse a Superior Court dismissal of an appeal only upon a finding that the motion justice abused his or her discretion.”). -7- III Analysis A The Entry of Judgment On appeal, defendant argues that the Superior Court clerk’s office failed to properly enter and provide notice of the judgment in accordance with the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. First, defendant alleges that the judgment in the instant case was not properly entered pursuant to Rule 79(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure6 because the docket does not reflect the December 11, 2007 entry of the judgment. The defendant further argues that the clerk’s office did not comply with Rule 77(d) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure7 because it failed to mail notice of entry of judgment to the parties. Rule 58(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure states, in part, that a “judgment is effective and shall be deemed entered when so set forth and signed by the Clerk.” Likewise, Rule 4(a) of our rules provides that a “judgment, order, or decree is entered within the meaning of [Rule 4(a)] when it is set forth and signed by the clerk of the trial court in accordance with the 6 Rule 79(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure provides, in pertinent part, as follows: “The clerk shall keep the civil docket and shall enter therein each civil action to which these rules are made applicable. * * * All papers filed with the clerk * * * all appearances, orders, verdicts, and judgments shall be entered chronologically in the civil docket on the folio assigned to the action and shall be marked with its file number. * * * The entry of an order or judgment shall show the date the entry is made.” 7 Rule 77(d) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure states in relevant part: “Immediately upon the entry of an order or judgment the clerk shall serve a notice of the entry by mail * * * upon each party who is not in default for failure to appear, and shall make a note in the docket of the mailing. * * * No notice need be served if an order or judgment is entered in open court in the presence of the parties or their counsel.” -8- applicable rules of the trial court.” See generally Robert B. Kent, et al., Rhode Island Civil and Appellate Procedure § 58:2 at 41 (2006). Rule 4(a) provides that a notice of appeal must be filed within twenty days “of the date of the entry of the judgment, order, or decree appealed from.” Under the Superior Court rule, “[u]ntil a judgment is entered, no appeal can be taken, and an appeal filed before the entry of judgment on a separate paper is premature and subject to dismissal.” McClellan v. Thompson, 114 R.I. 334, 341, 333 A.2d 424, 428 (1975) (discussing Rule 58(a)). Although Rule 77(d) generally requires the clerk to serve notice of entry of judgment by mail upon each party not in default for failure to appear, the clerk’s failure to comply with this requirement “does not void the judgment.” McClellan, 114 R.I. at 341, 333 A.2d at 428; see also Kent, § 58:4 at 41. In the case under review, it is undisputed that the hearing justice signed the final judgment on December 10, 2007, in the presence of attorneys representing all parties. The Superior Court clerk, however, signed the judgment outside the presence of the parties on December 11. Rule 77(d) “authorizes a party to give notice of the entry of judgment by sending a copy of the judgment by mail to his adversary.” Thomas v. Ross, 477 A.2d 950, 951-52 n.2 (R.I. 1984). Here, an attested copy of the final judgment bearing both the hearing justice’s signature and the December 10, 2007 time-stamp of the clerk’s office was mailed by opposing counsel to defendant’s attorney of record on December 10, 2007. Moreover, he manifestly believed that the appeal period had begun to run (or would soon begin to run) because he asked his associate to file a notice of appeal even before receiving the copy. The defendant cites this Court’s decision in Kay v. Menard, 727 A.2d 665 (R.I. 1999), in support of its contention that the appeal period never began to run because of the clerk’s failure to mail the parties notice of entry of final judgment. The circumstances of the instant case differ -9- from those presented in Kay in several vital respects, however. In Kay, the trial justice’s clerk prepared and signed an order commemorating the denial of the defendant’s motion for a new trial, apparently outside the presence of the parties. Id. at 666. Unlike the final judgment in the instant case, however, “nothing noted upon the order [in Kay] indicat[ed] the time when the order was prepared and signed by the court clerk, nor [did] it contain any file marking showing when it was entered.” Id. The clerk’s office apparently did not provide the parties with notice of entry of judgment. Id. The defendant’s attorney subsequently prepared another order purporting to be a judgment and had it signed by the trial justice and the clerk. Id. Under those circumstances, this Court held that the original order was invalid because the parties lacked notice and knowledge of its entry. Id. Unlike the order at issue in Kay, the judgment in the instant case was dated by the clerk. Moreover, the parties had knowledge that entry of judgment was imminent because their respective attorneys were present when the hearing justice signed the judgment, and plaintiffs’ attorney notified defendant’s attorney of record that the judgment had been filed with the clerk’s office on December 10. This Court has noted that “[i]t is incumbent upon the party intending to appeal to be watchful for the entry of a valid judgment.” Blais v. Beacon Mutual Insurance Co., 812 A.2d 838, 839 (R.I. 2002) (mem.). Under the circumstances presented in this case, the clerk’s failure to mail the parties notice of the entry of judgment did not invalidate that judgment. In addition, the clerk’s erroneous recording of the date of entry of judgment on the docket pursuant to Rule 79(a) did not invalidate the judgment. Although Rule 79(a) requires that the clerk make an entry in the civil docket after signing a final judgment, it has been observed that “this ministerial act is not essential to the effectiveness of the judgment. It is deemed entered and is effective when the clerk signs it.” Kent, § 58:2 at 41. - 10 - Moreover, we note that December 31, 2007 was the deadline for filing a notice of appeal regardless of whether judgment was entered on December 10 or December 11. Counting twenty days from December 10, 2007, the deadline for filing a notice of appeal would have fallen on Sunday, December 30, 2007. The defendants therefore would have had until the next business day (Monday, December 31, 2007) to file a notice of appeal under Article I, Rule 20(a) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure. Likewise, the deadline for filing a notice of appeal from the actual date of entry (December 11) was also December 31. Under these circumstances, the failure of the docket to reflect the fact that judgment properly was entered on December 11—and not December 10—did not toll the running of the appeal period. B Excusable Neglect Rule 4 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure requires an appellant to file its notice of appeal within twenty days of the entry of judgment. Rule 4(a) also states: “Upon a showing of excusable neglect, the trial court may extend the time for filing the notice of appeal by any party for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days from the expiration of the original time prescribed by this subdivision. Such an extension may be granted before or after the time otherwise prescribed by this subdivision has expired * * *.” 8 Relief from the repercussions of failure to comply with procedural requirements will not be granted “unless it is first factually established that [counsel’s] neglect was occasioned by some extenuating circumstance of sufficient significance to render it excusable.” King v. Brown, 103 R.I. 154, 157, 235 A.2d 874, 875 (1967). We have characterized such circumstances as those 8 We observe that in this case the thirty-day extension period under Article I, Rule 4(a) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure expired on January 30, 2008. We do not address the question of whether the Superior Court had authority to grant an extension when it issued its decision on February 6, 2008 because this issue was not advanced on appeal. See Friedman v. Lee Pare & Associates, Inc., 593 A.2d 1354, 1355 (R.I. 1991) (holding that the Superior Court was without authority to grant an extension under Rule 4(a) nunc pro tunc after the expiration of fifty days from the judgment appealed from). - 11 - that are “out of that party or counsel’s control.” Boranian v. Richer, 983 A.2d 834, 840 (R.I. 2009). We hold that defendant has not demonstrated excusable neglect in this case. As we noted in Astors’ Beechwood v. People Coal Co., 659 A.2d 1109, 1115 (R.I. 1995), counsel’s explanation that he or she: “‘overlooked’ the filing of a notice of rejection, apparently because of duties attendant to his practice, was not an ‘extenuating circumstance of sufficient significance’ to warrant relief from judgment. * * * Thus, we [held] that counsel’s explanation that it was ‘an extremely busy time’ for him was insufficient to constitute excusable neglect.” Very recently, we also observed that “excusable neglect must involve something more than a careless deviation from standard office procedure or the failure to remember a deadline.” Boranian, 983 A.2d at 839-40; cf. Astors’ Beechwood, 659 A.2d at 1116 (noting that this Court will decline to grant relief if counsel’s failure to file a timely notice of rejection “was fully within his [or her] control, and his [or her] failure to do so derived from his [or her] own conduct”). The facts of the instant case are analogous to those presented in Friedman v. Lee Pare & Associates, Inc., 593 A.2d 1354 (R.I. 1991). In that case, one of the parties was granted an extension to file its notice of appeal on the basis of the fact that one of its attorneys became ill during the twenty-day appeal period. Id. at 1356. This Court reversed that decision, noting that the attorney in question was an out-of-state attorney who never made a pro hac vice motion to appear before the Superior Court. Id. The out-of-state attorney’s Rhode Island co-counsel was healthy during the appeal period, and nothing prevented him from filing a notice of appeal himself. Id. In the instant case, the attorney of record was lead counsel in all the proceedings in the Superior Court. The associate had never entered an appearance in the matter before the Superior Court, nor could she specifically recall signing any papers in the case. The attorney of record’s - 12 - assertion that he was extremely busy in December 2007 is not a sufficient basis for a finding of excusable neglect. See Boranian, 983 A.2d at 839-40; Astors’ Beechwood, 659 A.2d at 1115-16. Nor is his assertion that he did not know how to file a notice of appeal. Cf. Coutu ex rel. Coutu v. Porter, 744 A.2d 405, 406 (R.I. 1999) (mem.) (“[T]he defendants’ attorney’s failure in the present case to file a timely notice was fully within his control. He had a responsibility to know the rules and procedures * * *.”). Moreover, the attorney of record failed to monitor the status of the notice of appeal or even calculate when the window for filing the notice of appeal would close. He checked on the associate on only one occasion approximately a week after asking her to file the notice of appeal. At that time, he was told that the notice of appeal had not been filed, yet he failed to follow up with her until several days after the appeal period expired. A reasonably prudent attorney would have confirmed that his or her associate had actually filed the notice of appeal within the time period, or, discovering that he or she was incapable of doing so, assumed responsibility himself or herself. Therefore, the defendant’s failure to file a timely notice of appeal cannot be considered excusable neglect. IV Conclusion For the reasons discussed, we affirm the order of the Superior Court. The papers in this case may be returned to the Superior Court. Justice Flaherty did not participate. - 13 - Supreme Court No. 2008-132-Appeal. (KC 05-61) UAG West Bay AM, LLC et al. : v. : Nicholas E. Cambio et al. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['PER CURIAM. The defendant, Bald Hill Commons Condominium Association, Inc. (the Condominium Association), appeals from an order denying its motion for an extension of time to file a notice of appeal and dismissing its notice of appeal. The defendant contends that its appeal was timely because the Superior Court clerk failed to properly enter the judgment and failed to provide the parties with notice of the entry of judgment from which they wished to appeal. It further argues that, even if its filing of the notice of appeal was not timely, it has demonstrated excusable neglect for any delay.', 'This case came before this Court pursuant to our order directing the parties to appear and show cause why this case should not summarily be decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions, we conclude that cause has not been shown. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'The underlying facts 1 of this case involve access rights for the entrance to the “Inskip Auto Mall” car dealership in Warwick, Rhode Island, as well as access rights to a nearby parking area used by the dealership. The plaintiff UAG West Bay AM, LLC (UAG West Bay) manages the Inskip dealership and leases the dealership property from plaintiff Car War, LLC (Car War), through an affiliated company, plaintiff UAG Realty, LLC (UAG Realty). Car War also owns a “remote parking area” near the dealership that UAG West Bay uses for long-term parking of car inventory and employee parking.', 'The Inskip dealership abuts Bald Hill Commons Condominium (Bald Hill Commons), a commercial shopping center.', 'Over the course of at least ten years, the Inskip dealership maintained a curb cut linking Inskip’s main campus with “Inskip Way,” an access drive that lies within Bald Hill Commons. It later installed a second curb cut as well. The curb cuts provide access from the dealership to both the shopping center and the remote parking area.', 'According to plaintiffs, in June 2004, defendant Nicholas E. Cambio, one of the original Bald Hill Commons developers, contacted UAG West Bay’s chief operating officer and asserted that he held the exclusive right to grant access between Bald Hill Commons and any adjacent properties. He allegedly demanded that UAG West Bay pay a one-time access fee payable to him personally. UAG West Bay refused to make such payment. In January 2005, Mr. Cambio allegedly threatened to block the dealership’s curb cuts with concrete blocks to prevent access to Inskip Way. Shortly thereafter, plaintiffs filed the instant action in the Superior Court against the Condominium Association and Mr. Cambio, seeking injunctive relief restraining defendants 1', 'The majority of these facts derive from plaintiffs’ complaint. We note, however, that we include these facts to provide some context for the issues in dispute in this case; the underlying facts themselves have no bearing on the disposition of those issues.', '-2- from interfering with their easement rights of access to, and use of, the curb cuts, the condominium roadways, and the remote parking area.', 'They also requested a declaratory judgment stating the same. Finally, they requested a judgment declaring that they have no obligation to pay an access fee to Mr. Cambio or to the Condominium Association. The nub of the dispute concerned certain special declarant rights that Car War alleged it held in Bald Hill Commons. After the complaint was filed, however, a conveyancing error in the deeds purporting to transfer such declarant rights was discovered. The plaintiffs sought to remedy the defects by executing and filing corrective deeds; defendants on the other hand argued that the conveyances were fatally defective and void, thus defeating any interest plaintiffs claimed in the condominium.', 'Subsequently, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. On November 21, 2006, the hearing justice granted partial summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs, holding that Car War held valid title to the declarant rights and thus the creation of the three units was a valid exercise of its authority.', 'Thereafter, the parties entered into negotiations to resolve the remaining issues, eventually agreeing to a consent judgment.', 'On December 10, 2007, plaintiffs’ attorneys and defendants’ attorney signed a document entitled “Final Judgment,” that incorporated the hearing justice’s grant of partial summary judgment as well as the issues agreed upon by the parties. 2 The hearing justice then signed the judgment in the presence of attorneys representing all parties. The defendants’ attorney then asked plaintiffs’ counsel to file the judgment with the Kent County Superior Court clerk’s office and to provide him with a fully executed copy of the document. 3 The plaintiffs’ attorney filed the judgment with the clerk’s office that same day and mailed a copy to defendants’ counsel, 2', 'The “Final Judgment” also purported to preserve the defendants’ rights to appeal the partial summary judgment granted in favor of plaintiffs. 3', 'The hearing justice was sitting in Washington County when she approved the final judgment.', '-3- which was received the following day. The enclosed judgment bore a stamp indicating that it was filed with the clerks’ office on December 10, 2007, but it was not signed by the clerk. In fact, the judgment was not signed by the clerk until December 11, 2007, although the docket sheet indicates that it was entered on December 10. The clerk’s office never sent any party a notice of entry of judgment.', 'On January 4, 2008, defendant filed an emergency motion for a brief extension of time to file its notice of appeal. In its motion, defendant asserted that there was excusable neglect justifying an extension of time within which to file an appeal. The defendant attached two affidavits to its motion—one from defendant’s attorney of record and one from an associate with the same firm. Both attorneys asserted that the attorney of record had completely delegated responsibility for the filing of the notice of appeal to the associate and that the latter failed to make the filing in a timely manner because of serious illness. The defendant Condominium Association also filed a notice of appeal from the December 10, 2007 judgment on January 4, 2008. 4', 'The hearing justice held an evidentiary hearing on defendant’s motion on January 23 and January 24, 2008. At this hearing, defendant raised an additional argument, viz., that the judgment was “defective and a nullity” because the clerk did not actually sign the document until December 11, notwithstanding the docket notation indicating that it was entered on December 10, 2007.', 'The defendant presented the testimony of Todd Viccione, M.D., who discussed the associate’s medical condition during December 2007. There can be little doubt that she was ill at that time, although there was some debate as to the amount of work she actually was able to perform. 4', 'Nicholas Cambio did not file a notice of appeal.', '-4-', 'The defendant’s attorney of record testified that he was present in court on December 10, 2007, when the hearing justice signed the final judgment. He also confirmed that he received a letter from one of plaintiffs’ attorneys the next day, indicating that judgment had been entered on December 10. He stated that, upon returning to his office on December 10, he spoke with the associate and told her to file a notice of appeal from the adverse summary-judgment decision. He further explained that he decided to delegate responsibility for the filing to the associate because she was a trusted colleague and a former law clerk and because he was extremely busy with other cases and had never filed a Supreme Court appeal. He also stated that the associate had worked on some aspects of the case, but she was not an attorney of record in the matter.', 'According to the attorney of record, the associate enjoyed “a great deal of autonomy[,]” and he did not “huddle over” her to make sure the appeal had been filed. Indeed, he recalled discussing the filing of the appeal “in passing” with the associate, “about five or six days” after giving her the assignment.', 'At that time, she told him that she was “taking care of it.” Thereafter, he conceded, he “never checked with her once * * * to see whether she had prepared and filed a notice of appeal.” Although the attorney of record testified that his firm had “a system in place” whereby a deadline is docketed so that attorneys are reminded of it, he stated that he never docketed the appeal deadline in this case. Further, he acknowledged that he did not know whether the associate had ever entered the deadline into the firm’s docketing system.', 'On January 3, 2008, the attorney of record emailed the associate to confirm that she had filed the notice of appeal, only to learn that it had never been filed. Under cross-examination, he said that he was not aware of the length of the appeal period and confirmed that he was “totally depending on [the associate] to find out what the applicable deadline was and file the notice of appeal.” He also conceded that to his knowledge the associate had never filed a notice of appeal', '-5- to this Court. He further testified that he was unaware that she was suffering from any illness in December 2007.', 'The associate also testified at the evidentiary hearing. She stated that she never informed any of her colleagues of her illness during the month of December, despite the fact that she “was having trouble getting a lot of things done.” Although she was experiencing serious medical symptoms during the appeal period, she performed approximately fifty hours of legal work for clients. She further testified that she did not realize that December 31 5 was the deadline for filing the notice of appeal because she never calculated when the twenty-day period of appeal would expire. The associate also confirmed that she had never formally entered an appearance in the case.', 'On February 6, 2008, the hearing justice denied defendant’s request for an extension of time to file a notice of appeal. The hearing justice found that the appeal period began to run on December 11, 2007—the date that the clerk signed the judgment. She ruled that Article I, Rule 4 of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure did not require the judgment to be docketed for it to be appealed. The hearing justice also believed that, under the circumstances, the clerk’s failure to mail a copy of the entered judgment did not mean that the appeal period had not begun to run. She noted that the parties’ legal counsel were present when she signed the judgment, implying that they therefore were on notice that the appeal period was about to begin.', 'On the issue of excusable neglect, the hearing justice noted that this Court has previously ruled that a busy legal practice does not meet the standard of excusable neglect. She observed that the associate was never an attorney of record in the case until after the deadline for filing the notice of appeal had expired. She therefore found that the associate’s illness had no bearing on 5', 'As discussed at greater length below, December 31, 2007 would have been the deadline for filing a notice of appeal regardless of whether judgment were deemed entered on December 10 or December 11.', '-6- the case.', 'Rather, as the primary attorney in the matter, it was the attorney of record’s responsibility to follow up and make sure the notice of appeal had been filed. The hearing justice therefore denied defendant’s motion to extend and dismissed the Condominium Association’s notice of appeal. An order was entered on February 6, 2008, from which the Condominium Association timely appealed.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'Questions of law are reviewed de novo by this Court. Carnevale v.

First, defendant alleges that the judgment in the instant case was not properly entered pursuant to Rule 79(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure6 because the docket does not reflect the December 11, 2007 entry of the judgment. The defendant further argues that the clerk’s office did not comply with Rule 77(d) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure7 because it failed to mail notice of entry of judgment to the parties.', 'Rule 58(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure states, in part, that a “judgment is effective and shall be deemed entered when so set forth and signed by the Clerk.” Likewise, Rule 4(a) of our rules provides that a “judgment, order, or decree is entered within the meaning of [Rule 4(a)] when it is set forth and signed by the clerk of the trial court in accordance with the 6', 'Rule 79(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure provides, in pertinent part, as follows:', '“The clerk shall keep the civil docket and shall enter therein each', 'civil action to which these rules are made applicable. * * * All', 'papers filed with the clerk * * * all appearances, orders, verdicts,', 'and judgments shall be entered chronologically in the civil docket', 'on the folio assigned to the action and shall be marked with its file', 'number. * * * The entry of an order or judgment shall show the', 'date the entry is made.” 7', 'Rule 77(d) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure states in relevant part:', '“Immediately upon the entry of an order or judgment the clerk', 'shall serve a notice of the entry by mail * * * upon each party who', 'is not in default for failure to appear, and shall make a note in the', 'docket of the mailing. * * * No notice need be served if an order or', 'judgment is entered in open court in the presence of the parties or', 'their counsel.”', '-8- applicable rules of the trial court.” See generally Robert B. Kent, et al., Rhode Island Civil and Appellate Procedure § 58:2 at 41 (2006). Rule 4(a) provides that a notice of appeal must be filed within twenty days “of the date of the entry of the judgment, order, or decree appealed from.” Under the Superior Court rule, “[u]ntil a judgment is entered, no appeal can be taken, and an appeal filed before the entry of judgment on a separate paper is premature and subject to dismissal.” McClellan v. Thompson, 114 R.I. 334, 341, 333 A.2d 424, 428 (1975) (discussing Rule 58(a)).', 'Although Rule 77(d) generally requires the clerk to serve notice of entry of judgment by mail upon each party not in default for failure to appear, the clerk’s failure to comply with this requirement “does not void the judgment.” McClellan, 114 R.I. at 341, 333 A.2d at 428; see also Kent, § 58:4 at 41. In the case under review, it is undisputed that the hearing justice signed the final judgment on December 10, 2007, in the presence of attorneys representing all parties. The Superior Court clerk, however, signed the judgment outside the presence of the parties on December 11. Rule 77(d) “authorizes a party to give notice of the entry of judgment by sending a copy of the judgment by mail to his adversary.” Thomas v. Ross, 477 A.2d 950, 951-52 n.2 (R.I. 1984). Here, an attested copy of the final judgment bearing both the hearing justice’s signature and the December 10, 2007 time-stamp of the clerk’s office was mailed by opposing counsel to defendant’s attorney of record on December 10, 2007. Moreover, he manifestly believed that the appeal period had begun to run (or would soon begin to run) because he asked his associate to file a notice of appeal even before receiving the copy.', 'The defendant cites this Court’s decision in Kay v. Menard, 727 A.2d 665 (R.I. 1999), in support of its contention that the appeal period never began to run because of the clerk’s failure to mail the parties notice of entry of final judgment. The circumstances of the instant case differ', '-9- from those presented in Kay in several vital respects, however. In Kay, the trial justice’s clerk prepared and signed an order commemorating the denial of the defendant’s motion for a new trial, apparently outside the presence of the parties. Id. at 666. Unlike the final judgment in the instant case, however, “nothing noted upon the order [in Kay] indicat[ed] the time when the order was prepared and signed by the court clerk, nor [did] it contain any file marking showing when it was entered.” Id. The clerk’s office apparently did not provide the parties with notice of entry of judgment. Id. The defendant’s attorney subsequently prepared another order purporting to be a judgment and had it signed by the trial justice and the clerk. Id.', 'Under those circumstances, this Court held that the original order was invalid because the parties lacked notice and knowledge of its entry. Id.', 'Unlike the order at issue in Kay, the judgment in the instant case was dated by the clerk. Moreover, the parties had knowledge that entry of judgment was imminent because their respective attorneys were present when the hearing justice signed the judgment, and plaintiffs’ attorney notified defendant’s attorney of record that the judgment had been filed with the clerk’s office on December 10. This Court has noted that “[i]t is incumbent upon the party intending to appeal to be watchful for the entry of a valid judgment.” Blais v. Beacon Mutual Insurance Co., 812 A.2d 838, 839 (R.I. 2002) (mem.). Under the circumstances presented in this case, the clerk’s failure to mail the parties notice of the entry of judgment did not invalidate that judgment.', 'In addition, the clerk’s erroneous recording of the date of entry of judgment on the docket pursuant to Rule 79(a) did not invalidate the judgment.

67,"William P. McGloin : v. : Trammellcrow Services, Inc. : Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty, and Robinson, JJ. OPINION Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. This case came before the Supreme Court on William P. McGloin’s (employee) petition for issuance of a writ of certiorari to review a final decree of the Appellate Division of the Workers’ Compensation Court (Appellate Division). The Appellate Division affirmed the decision of a trial judge dismissing Mr. McGloin’s petition for workers’ compensation on the grounds that his injury was not work-related and did not arise out of or in the course of his employment. For the reasons set forth below, we reverse the final decree of the Appellate Division. I Facts and Procedural History Mr. McGloin’s original petition for workers’ compensation came before the Workers’ Compensation Court on June 15, 2005. The trial judge bifurcated the proceedings to determine preliminarily whether employee’s injury occurred in the course of his employment with Trammellcrow Services, Inc. (Trammellcrow). The liability portion of the claim was tried before the trial judge on August 4, 2005. -1- Both parties agreed that employee suffered the injury at issue on the morning of January 6, 2005. At that time, Mr. McGloin was employed by Trammellcrow as a “road technician.” In that capacity, employee traveled to various Bank of America facilities in a company-owned cargo van to perform, or arrange to have performed, routine and emergency maintenance. According to Mr. McGloin, “[his] vehicle is [his] office or [his] work space.” At the time of his injury, employee had been employed by Trammellcrow for approximately six months, and he had been employed by Trammellcrow’s predecessor company in substantially the same capacity for several years. He testified that he was “on call” with Trammellcrow “[t]wenty-four/seven, three hundred sixty-five days a year, unless [he] took vacation or sick time,” although his normal working hours were 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Mr. McGloin normally drove his cargo van back to his apartment in Smithfield at the end of the day so he could respond to emergency calls received outside normal working hours. It snowed several inches overnight on January 5, 2005. The next morning, Mr. McGloin left his apartment at approximately 7:30 a.m. He proceeded to the private parking lot of his apartment building and cleaned the snow off his company vehicle. The employee had not yet received any specific work orders that day, so he intended to drive to a central location in Providence, where he would be able to respond quickly to any calls concerning snow removal at Bank of America facilities in the greater metropolitan area. Mr. McGloin testified that, as he was leaving the parking lot at approximately 8:05 a.m., he noticed a snowbound vehicle blocking his exit. He got out of his cargo van to assist the motorist. He testified that his intention at that time was “to get [the other -2- motorist] off and on her way so [he] could jump in [his] vehicle and go about [his] day.” According to his testimony, employee “pushed [his] weight up against the vehicle” and “kind of lifted” the bumper. The car was able to drive away, but Mr. McGloin unfortunately “ended up on the ground.” As he rose, he felt “[e]xtreme pain” in his lower back. Mr. McGloin then returned to his apartment and called his partner, his immediate supervisor, and Trammellcrow’s human resources department, informing them that he was taking two sick days. He did not mention that his injury was work-related. When his back pain did not abate, he went to see a physician the next week. He testified that at that time he did not consider seeking workers’ compensation for his injury. Approximately a month after his injury, Mr. McGloin began receiving short-term disability benefits through his employer. He also applied for similar disability benefits from the state. He testified that “when the short-term disability benefits were all entangled * * * I decided to * * * file a workers’ compensation claim.” He never returned to work at Trammellcrow. Jill Santopietro, the human resources manager for Trammellcrow, testified that Mr. McGloin called her on January 11, 2005 to inform her of his injury. She stated that, at that time, she asked him if it was a work-related injury and that he said it was not. She further testified that Trammellcrow had a policy of not paying employees for the first thirty minutes of commuting time. Michael Fossa, Mr. McGloin’s supervisor and operations manager at Trammellcrow, also testified at trial. During a brief direct examination by Trammelcrow’s counsel, Mr. Fossa stated that he spoke to employee on January 6, 2005, -3- but that Mr. McGloin did not tell him his injury was work-related. On cross- examination, employee’s attorney attempted to elicit testimony from Mr. Fossa concerning whether there was “any provision within the company policy * * * for assisting other motorists in the course of * * * employment” or “any policy within the company of telling employees that they [should] be good citizens within the community and they should help people if they were in trouble during the course of their employment[.]” The trial judge sustained objections to these questions, presumably because they concerned matters outside the scope of direct examination. The employee’s counsel made an offer of proof, however, contradictorily asserting that, if the witness had been allowed to answer, he would have testified “that there was no provision for helping; there was a policy they should help people.” The trial judge issued her bench decision on September 19, 2005. She stated that the “issue before the Court is whether the employee was injured in the course of his employment.” The trial judge noted that, to claim workers’ compensation for his injury, employee was required to establish a “nexus or causal relationship between the injury and employment.” She went on to apply the three-part test set forth by this Court in the case of Di Libero v. Middlesex Construction Co., 63 R.I. 509, 9 A.2d 848 (1939), and she concluded that employee’s injury did not qualify as a work-related injury. She also found that the “going-and-coming rule” 1 applied and that Mr. McGloin’s injury therefore was not compensable. The trial judge further noted that employee had failed to prove the existence of a Trammellcrow “Good Samaritan” policy. A decree was entered on September 27, 2005, denying and dismissing employee’s claim for failure “to prove by a 1 The going-and-coming rule “operates to preclude compensation when injury occurs while the employee is traveling to or from the workplace.” Toolin v. Aquidneck Island Medical Resource, 668 A.2d 639, 640 (R.I. 1995). -4- fair preponderance of the credible evidence that he sustained a work-related injury on January 6, 2005, arising out of and in the course of his employment * * *.” Mr. McGloin appealed to the Appellate Division on September 28, 2005. The Appellate Division issued its final decree in the case on February 8, 2007, affirming the decision of the trial judge. The Appellate Division agreed that “the particular circumstances of Mr. McGloin’s injury clearly warrant the application of the ‘going-and- coming’ rule which precludes the recovery of workers’ compensation benefits.” Moreover, the Appellate Division noted that employee also had failed to prove that Trammellcrow had a “Good Samaritan” policy in place for its employees. It further declined to recognize a generalized “Good Samaritan” exception to the going-and- coming rule. It concluded that “the trial judge’s findings are not clearly erroneous,” and it therefore denied and dismissed Mr. McGloin’s appeal. Mr. McGloin timely filed a petition for writ of certiorari with this Court, and the writ issued on May 9, 2008. II Standard of Review “Upon a petition for certiorari, we review a decree of the Appellate Division for any error of law or equity pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 28-35-30.” Mumma v. Cumberland Farms, Inc., 965 A.2d 437, 441 (R.I. 2009). Our review on certiorari “is limited to examining the record to determine if an error of law has been committed.” In re Falstaff Brewing Corp. re: Narragansett Brewery Fire, 637 A.2d 1047, 1049 (R.I. 1994). We do not “weigh the evidence, but rather review[] the record to determine whether legally competent evidence supports the findings of the tribunal whose decision is under review, -5- in this case, the Appellate Division.” Poudrier v. Brown University, 763 A.2d 632, 635 (R.I. 2000). III Discussion The employee argues that the Appellate Division erred as a matter of law in determining that Mr. McGloin was not in the course of his employment at the time of his injury and that it further “failed to take into account the circumstances and duties of Mr. McGloin’s employment and apply them to the specific facts of Mr. McGloin’s efforts as a ‘Good Samaritan’ in the context of the ‘coming and going’ rule.” The Appellate Division correctly identified and summarized the law that applies to the instant case. Specifically, the Appellate Division noted that our longstanding going-and-coming rule operates to bar compensation for an injury that occurs while an employee is going to or coming from the workplace. See, e.g., Toolin v. Aquidneck Island Medical Resource, 668 A.2d 639, 640 (R.I. 1995). We note, however, that “[b]ecause of the harshness of the rule, this court has been willing to delineate exceptions to its application that depend on the particular circumstances of each case. Thus, we have held that an employee is entitled to compensation benefits if it can be demonstrated that a nexus or causal connection exists between the injury sustained and the employment.” Id. The Appellate Division correctly recognized that our precedent requires that to establish a causal connection, the employee must “show that the accident took place— [(a) w]ithin the period of employment; [(b) a]t a place where the employee may reasonably be; and [(c) w]hile he is reasonably fulfilling the duties of the employment or doing something incidental thereto.” Di Libero, 63 R.I. at 516, 9 A.2d at 851 (internal quotation marks omitted). If these three criteria are met and the nexus is established, “the -6- court will depart from the strict and harsh application of the ‘going-and-coming rule’ and the employee will be entitled to receive workers’ compensation benefits.” Toolin, 668 A.2d at 641. Considering the Di Libero criteria in the context of the instant case, we conclude that the Appellate Division erred as a matter of law in failing to find a nexus between employee’s injuries and his employment. The Appellate Division determined that Mr. McGloin’s injury did not occur within the period of employment, reasoning that “[t]he fact that the employee had pulled his van out of the parking space did not initiate his work day. He had not yet initiated his journey to work on the public roads.” In light of the peculiar circumstances of Mr. McGloin’s employment, however, we do not consider the fact that he had not yet entered the public highways to be dispositive. The uncontroverted facts, as found by the trial judge and affirmed by the Appellate Division, are that Mr. McGloin was on call seven days a week, twenty-four hours per day. Moreover, his primary work space was indeed the van supplied by Trammellcrow. Although he was not responding to a specific call when he backed the van out of its parking space on the morning of January 6, 2005, Mr. McGloin testified that he was headed toward a central location to await such a call. We presume that had he received a call en route, he would have responded immediately. Under these circumstances we conclude that the competent evidence satisfies the first Di Libero criterion that employee was injured within the period of his employment. This conclusion is not altered by Ms. Santopietro’s testimony that Trammellcrow does not compensate employees for the first half hour of commuting time. This Court has -7- previously held that “the fact that an employee is not paid for his or her travel time does not mean that the trip was not in the scope of employment.” Toolin, 668 A.2d at 641. Turning to the next element of the Di Libero exception, we must consider the situs of employee’s injury. For employee to satisfy this factor, the injury must have occurred at a place that Trammellcrow could have reasonably expected Mr. McGloin to be. Toolin, 668 A.2d at 641. In Toolin, 668 A.2d at 640, the employee was a nursing assistant who traveled to patients’ homes to provide care. She was injured in an automobile accident while traveling between visits. Id. This Court ruled that the employer in Toolin reasonably could have expected the nursing assistant to be on the public roads at the time of her injury because the employer directed and controlled her schedule and she did not deviate from her travel route. Id. at 641. Unlike the employee in Toolin, employee was injured in his own apartment complex parking lot, not on the public roads. Mr. McGloin testified at trial, however, that his company cargo van served as his office and contained the tools he needed for his job. The employee also testified that he fielded calls, used his personal digital assistant (PDA) to check work requests, and did paperwork in the cargo van. Moreover, Trammellcrow was aware that Mr. McGloin drove his company vehicle home in the evening and would respond to emergency maintenance calls outside normal working hours as part of his job. In light of the nature of employee’s work, it is reasonable that Trammellcrow could have expected Mr. McGloin’s employment activities to begin the moment he got into the cargo van—whether on the public roadways or in his own apartment parking lot. -8- Finally, we must consider whether Mr. McGloin was injured while engaged in his job duties or tasks incidental to his job duties. In Toolin, this Court emphasized that travel was integral to the nursing assistant’s job (viz., visiting her patients in their homes), and that the risk of travel on public roads was incidental to her employment. Toolin, 668 A.2d at 641. Similarly, in the instant case, travel in the company cargo van was an integral part of Mr. McGloin’s employment with Trammellcrow. On the morning of his injury, employee had commenced traveling on behalf of his job. He attempted to move the snowbound vehicle in his apartment parking lot in order to continue to a central location in the Providence metropolitan area so he could respond to requests for snow- removal or other emergencies. It was undisputed at trial that travel to job sites was an integral part of Mr. McGloin’s employment. We believe that the Appellate Division drew too fine a line in concluding that Mr. McGloin “was performing an activity outside his vehicle which was not an incident of his employment * * *.” He was, in fact, attempting to remove a vehicle that was blocking his exit from the parking lot, thereby eliminating an obstacle preventing him from doing his employer’s business. We conclude, therefore, that under the facts of this case and in light of the nature of Mr. McGloin’s employment, the circumstances of employee’s injury must be considered incidental to his job duties. Having satisfied the three Di Libero criteria for establishing a nexus between his injury and his employment, he is entitled to workers’ compensation benefits. Although we disagree with the legal conclusions drawn by the Appellate Division, we share its aversion to the adoption of a “portal-to-portal” rule of compensation. See Kyle v. Davol, Inc., 121 R.I. 79, 82, 395 A.2d 714, 715 (1978) (“[W]e believe that -9- overruling past precedent in this case would open a veritable Pandora’s box that would inevitably lead to the ‘portal-to-portal’ type of rule of compensation espoused by the petitioner’s counsel at oral argument. That is a journey upon which we are not prepared to embark.”). We emphasize, therefore, that our opinion is predicated upon the unique circumstances of Mr. McGloin’s employment in this case. Mr. McGloin did not so much commute to work as he traveled with his office, parking it at his apartment complex so that he could better respond to emergencies twenty-four hours a day. The rule set forth in Kyle remains intact. IV Conclusion For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we reverse the final decree of the Appellate Division. The papers in this case may be remanded to the Workers’ Compensation Court. - 10 - Supreme Court No. 2007-63-M.P. (05-652) William P.

68,"State : v. : Robert J. Cardin. : Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty, and Robinson, JJ. OPINION Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The defendant, Robert J. Cardin, was convicted of shoplifting in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-41-20 after a trial in District Court. The defendant appealed the verdict and the case was tried de novo before a jury in Superior Court. The jury rendered a guilty verdict, and the defendant thereafter was sentenced to six months probation and fifteen hours of community service. The defendant now appeals from this judgment of conviction, averring the trial justice erred in (1) denying his motion for judgment of acquittal, and (2) improperly instructing the jury. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment. I Facts and Procedural History Bruce Rice, a loss-prevention supervisor employed by Wal-Mart, with thirty-two years experience in retail loss-prevention, testified that, on April 30, 2004, he observed Mr. Cardin enter the Wal-Mart on Plainfield Pike in Cranston at approximately 11 a.m. Mr. Rice grew suspicious of defendant because he noticed defendant was moving through the store very quickly. Mr. Rice then followed defendant to the automotive department. Mr. Rice watched -1- defendant unseal and open a box containing four wheel covers and associated retention wires. 1 Mr. Rice continued watching as defendant opened an identical box of merchandise and took one retention wire from the second box and put it in the first box. After defendant added the wire to the first box, he put it in his shopping cart and left the automotive department. According to Mr. Rice’s testimony, he made his way to the front of the store and watched as defendant paid for the box containing the extra retention wire. Mr. Rice approached defendant in the parking lot, identified himself as Wal-Mart security, and asked him to reenter the store. Mr. Rice told defendant he had seen him tampering with merchandise in the automotive department, and defendant began angrily yelling and screaming at Mr. Rice, denying the accusations. Mr. Rice then had the Cranston police called, and when an officer arrived, defendant was placed under arrest. After a jury trial and imposition of sentence, defendant timely appealed from the judgment of conviction. II Standard of Review “Under Rule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, a judgment of acquittal shall be entered when the evidence is not legally sufficient to sustain a conviction.” State v. Ros, 973 A.2d 1148, 1159 (R.I. 2009). “Whenever this Court reviews the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal, we apply the same standard as that applied by the trial justice; namely, we ‘must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, * * * giving full credibility to the state’s witnesses, and draw therefrom all reasonable inferences consistent with guilt.’” State v. Caba, 887 A.2d 370, 372 (R.I. 2005) (quoting State v. Higham, 865 A.2d 1040, 1 Retention wires are used to secure wheel covers to wheels. -2- 1048 (R.I. 2004)). The trial justice is required to evaluate “only that evidence that the prosecution claims is capable of supporting proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id. (quoting State v. Andrades, 725 A.2d 262, 263 (R.I. 1999)). “If that examination reveals sufficient evidence to warrant a jury verdict of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,” the trial justice’s denial of the motion should be upheld. State v. Oliveira, 882 A.2d 1097, 1108-09 (R.I. 2005) (quoting State v. Bulgin, 845 A.2d 308, 311 (R.I. 2004)). “When this Court reviews jury instructions, it does so on a de novo basis.” State v. Graham, 941 A.2d 848, 855 (R.I. 2008). It is well established that, “[o]n review, we examine the [jury] instructions in their entirety to ascertain the manner in which a jury of ordinary intelligent lay people would have understood them.” State v. Ibrahim, 862 A.2d 787, 796 (R.I. 2004) (quoting State v. Kittell, 847 A.2d 845, 849 (R.I. 2004)). “[T]his Court will not examine a single sentence apart from the rest of the instructions, but rather ‘the challenged portions must be examined in the context in which they were rendered.’” Id. (quoting Kittell, 847 A.2d at 849). “In accordance with G.L. 1956 § 8-2-38, we determine whether the jury charge ‘sufficiently addresses the requested instructions and correctly states the applicable law.’” Graham, 941 A.2d at 855 (quoting State v. Mastracchio, 546 A.2d 165, 173 (R.I. 1988)). “[A]n incorrect charge warrants reversal only if a jury could have been misled to the prejudice of the complaining party.” Id. III Discussion A Judgment of Acquittal The defendant first contends that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal. Section 11-41-20(b)(3) provides that an individual is guilty of shoplifting -3- if he or she “[t]ransfer[s] any merchandise displayed, held, stored or offered for sale in a retail mercantile establishment from one container to another in an attempt to purchase or purchase the merchandise personally or in consort with another at less than the full retail value with the intention of depriving the merchant of all or any part of the full retail value of the merchandise[.]” The defendant argues that the state failed to prove that Wal-Mart was deprived of any “retail value” of its merchandise because it did not present any evidence establishing the value of the retention wire, as required by § 11-41-20. Furthermore, defendant argues that the state’s failure to produce the item itself at trial2 supports a finding that there was no “retail value” established for the retention wires. We disagree. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, sufficient evidence was presented to support a guilty verdict. The only witness offered by the state was Mr. Rice. Mr. Rice testified that he saw defendant open two sealed boxes of wheel covers, remove a retention wire from one box, and then place it in the other box. Mr. Rice further testified that the price of a box of four wheel covers and four retention wires was $11.66 and that the included items are sold as a set. Thus, if defendant had wanted to legally obtain a fifth retention wire, he would have had to purchase another box at the full price of $11.66. Clearly a box containing only three retention wires loses some (if not all) of its value; a box that comes with four wheel covers, only three of which can be secured into place, is of questionable value to a customer. At the very least, if the box does retain some value, its value is surely less than a box complete with a full set of wheel covers and retention wires. 2 At trial, the state introduced into evidence a picture of the box for which defendant had paid. -4- Furthermore, the fact that only a photograph of the box was offered into evidence does not warrant a judgment of acquittal here. The photograph of the box, together with the testimony of Mr. Rice, provides sufficient evidence to support a jury verdict of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. We are of the opinion, therefore, that the trial justice did not err in denying defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal. B Jury Instructions Mr. Cardin next argues that the trial justice erred by instructing the jury only in the language of subsection (b)(3) of § 11-41-20 even though the “language of the [criminal] complaint against Mr. Cardin alleged that he violated subsections (1) and (3)” of the statute. The criminal complaint states that defendant did “make a transfer of merchandise, to wit, one (1) box of fourteen (14) inch wheelcovers and retention ring [sic], valued at $11.66, displayed, held, stored and offered for sale in Wal-Mart, from one container to another and did purchase said merchandise at less that [sic] the full retail value with the intention of depriving said merchant of all and [sic] a part of the full retail value of said merchandise, in violation of RIGL [§] 11-41- 20.” Although the complaint does not specify a violation of either subsections (1) or (3) of § 11- 41-20(b), its language clearly tracks § 11-41-20(b)(3). The language of subsection (b)(3) of § 11-41-20 is also consistent with the testimony of Mr. Rice, who said he observed the defendant remove a retention wire from one box, place it in another box, and then purchase the merchandise containing the five retention wires. We are satisfied, therefore, that the trial justice’s jury instruction, in which she quoted the language of § 11-41-20(b)(3), was correct. -5- IV Conclusion For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed. The record shall be remanded to the Superior Court. -6- Supreme Court No. 2005-79-C.A. (P3/04-1921A) State : v. : Robert J. Cardin.",criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court.

69,"Dorothy Curry : v. : Andrew Curry. : Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty, and Robinson, JJ. OPINION Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The marriage of Andrew and Dorothy Curry, which began in 1968, has been in the throes of dissolution since 1996. Finally, in 2005, a justice of the Family Court granted the parties’ divorce petitions and divided their marital assets in accordance with Rhode Island’s law of equitable distribution. Even then, certain issues pertaining to the division of their marital property continued to be adjudicated in the Family Court until 2007. The couples’ dispute finally has made its way to this Court. On appeal, each contends that the trial justice erred when she determined certain assets and liabilities to be marital and when she divided their marital assets. We hold that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion when she determined the parties’ marital estate and equitably distributed it between them. Additionally, we hold that the trial justice did not err when she denied Dorothy’s motion seeking revaluation of certain property after the time of trial. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Family Court. -1- I Procedural History Dorothy Curry, plaintiff, and Andrew Curry, defendant, married on December 8, 1968, in New York. They had three sons during their marriage, all of whom are now adults. Dorothy filed for divorce on April 25, 1996, citing irreconcilable differences resulting in the irremediable breakdown of their marriage. Andrew filed a counterclaim in which he asked the court to deny and dismiss Dorothy’s complaint and to grant him a divorce on the grounds of living separate and apart for more than three years and irreconcilable differences. The complaint for divorce was heard on July 8-9, 2004, September 28-29, 2004, November 22-23, 2004, and March 28, 2005, before a justice of the Family Court. On October 5, 2005, the trial justice rendered a bench decision. First, she granted each party a divorce “on the grounds that they have lived separate and apart * * * in excess of three years.” She subsequently determined the couple’s marital assets and made an equitable distribution of those assets. The trial justice considered “all the variables in the equitable distribution statute” 1 and the testimony given at trial, and determined that the “marital estate should be divided equally.” 1 The statutory factors set forth in G.L. 1956 § 15-5-16.1(a) are as follows: “(1) The length of the marriage; “(2) The conduct of the parties during the marriage; “(3) The contribution of each of the parties during the marriage in the acquisition, preservation, or appreciation in value of their respective estates; “(4) The contribution and services of either party as a homemaker; “(5) The health and age of the parties; “(6) The amount and sources of income of each of the parties; “(7) The occupation and employability of each of the parties; -2- The decision pending entry of final judgment was entered on April 4, 2007, 2 followed by an amended decision pending entry of final judgment that was entered on August 2, 2007. Final judgment was entered on September 21, 2007. Andrew timely appealed to this Court and Dorothy followed with a cross-appeal. II Issues on Appeal On appeal, Andrew submits that the trial justice committed a number of errors when she distributed his and Dorothy’s marital property. First, he argues that the trial justice erred when she “fail[ed] to compensate Andrew adequately for actions Dorothy took that substantially reduced the marital estate and injured Andrew financially.” Relative to this argument, Andrew contends that the trial justice miscued when she (1) failed to consider a tuition refund that Dorothy “converted to her own use”; (2) failed to consider that Dorothy “dissipated” and “destroyed” the parties’ finances when she assigned Dorothy 50 percent of the marital assets; (3) “(8) The opportunity of each party for future acquisition of capital assets and income; “(9) The contribution by one party to the education, training, licensure, business, or increased earning power of the other; “(10) The need of the custodial parent to occupy or own the marital residence and to use or own its household effects taking into account the best interests of the children of the marriage; “(11) Either party’s wasteful dissipation of assets or any transfer or encumbrance of assets made in contemplation of divorce without fair consideration; and “(12) Any factor which the court shall expressly find to be just and proper.” 2 At oral argument, both parties were at a loss to fully explain why this case has been pending for more than thirteen years. In part, Andrew attributes the delay between the bench decision and entry of the decision pending entry of final judgment in April 2007 to his motion filed on January 11, 2007 “seeking clarification of the Bench Decision.” Andrew also had filed another motion on October 23, 2006, which sought access to the Narragansett home to retrieve personal items and a restraining order against Dorothy to prevent her from “disbursing any funds received from the parties’ insurance carrier” without first consulting Andrew. -3- failed to determine that Dorothy’s income tax refunds and Andrew’s income tax “shortfalls” in 1996 and 1997 were marital assets; (4) failed to consider that Andrew “paid all the marital debt” from April 1996 until June 2002; and (5) failed to consider Andrew’s contributions to Dorothy’s education. He also maintains that the trial justice erred when she assigned Dorothy an interest in a co-op apartment at 7259 Shore Road, Brooklyn, N.Y., and when she found that another co-op at 308 101st Street, Brooklyn, N.Y., was a marital asset. 3 In response, Dorothy argues that the trial justice, but for one exception, properly distributed the marital property. However, in her cross-appeal, Dorothy contends that the trial justice abused her discretion when she ordered Dorothy to be responsible for half of a loan from Citizens Bank during their marriage on the ground that she was discharged from that obligation because she filed for bankruptcy. Additionally, Dorothy also argues on appeal that the trial justice erred when she declined to “update the values of the marital real estate.” III Standard of Review “When hearing an appeal from the Family Court, we have said that ‘it is not our function to arrive at de novo findings and conclusions of fact based on the evidence presented at trial.’” Schwab v. Schwab, 944 A.2d 156, 158 (R.I. 2008) (quoting Moran v. Moran, 612 A.2d 26, 33-34 (R.I. 1992)). “We do not disturb the trial justice’s findings of fact unless it can be shown that he or she has overlooked or misconceived relevant and material evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.” Id. (quoting Oduyingbo v. Oduyingbo, 685 A.2d 280, 280 (R.I. 1996) (mem.)). Accordingly, “[w]hen the parties contest the equitable distribution of marital assets, ‘this [C]ourt will not disturb the trial justice’s findings where he or she has scrupulously considered all of the 3 A co-op is an abbreviation for a cooperative, which is an apartment building “owned by its residents, to whom the apartments are leased.” Black’s Law Dictionary 384 (9th ed. 2009). -4- elements set forth in * * * [G.L. 1956] § 15-5-16.1.’” Ruffel v. Ruffel, 900 A.2d 1178, 1184 (R.I. 2006) (quoting Tarro v. Tarro, 485 A.2d 558, 560 (R.I. 1984)). We will vacate the equitable distribution and remand the case “for a rehearing where the trial justice overlooks salient uncontradicted evidence in determining the amount of assets to be distributed.” Id. (quoting Stephenson v. Stephenson, 811 A.2d 1138, 1142 (R.I. 2002)). However, when this Court reviews questions of law in an appeal from the Family Court, “we must apply a de novo review.” Schwab, 944 A.2d at 158 (citing Gorman v. Gorman, 883 A.2d 732, 738 n.8 (R.I. 2005)). IV Discussion “In dividing property, a trial justice must decide which assets are marital property, consider the contribution of each party, and then distribute the property.” Stephenson, 811 A.2d at 1143 (quoting Stanzler v. Stanzler, 560 A.2d 342, 345 (R.I. 1989)). Such determination of the parties’ marital property and its equitable distribution is within the “sound discretion of the trial court.” DiOrio v. DiOrio, 751 A.2d 747, 750 (R.I. 2000) (quoting Murphy v. Murphy, 714 A.2d 576, 579 (R.I. 1998)). When doing so, the trial justice “is obligated to consider the factors * * * in * * * § 15-5-16.1.” Id. In addition to the distribution factors set forth in G.L. 1956 § 15-5- 16.1(a), § 15-5-16.1(b) prohibits the trial justice “from assigning three categories of property”: (1) “property * * * held by the party prior to the marriage”; (2) “property or an interest in property which has been transferred to one of the parties by inheritance before, during, or after the term of the marriage”; and (3) “property or an interest in property which has been transferred to one of the parties by gift from a third party before, during, or after the term of the marriage.” Ruffel, 900 A.2d at 1187 (quoting § 15-5-16.1(b)). Further, “[a]s long as this Court is able to -5- review a lower court’s decision and to determine therefrom that all the necessary facts and statutory factors were considered,” the trial justice need not “explicitly list[] his or her findings on each factor.” Chiappone v. Chiappone, 984 A.2d 32, 37 (R.I. 2009) (quoting Gervais v. Gervais, 688 A.2d 1303, 1308 (R.I. 1997) (Gervais I)). Andrew’s Appeal A Dorothy’s Alleged Financially Harmful Actions The majority of Andrew’s appeal is premised on his argument that the trial justice failed to compensate him adequately for certain actions of Dorothy that Andrew asserts “substantially reduced the marital estate” and caused him financial harm, particularly in relation to his business, Connect Corporation. As an initial matter, we note that the trial justice said that she “consider[ed] all the variables in the equitable distribution statute.” Although the trial justice did not delineate those factors with the precision we like to see, a review of the record nonetheless indicates that she reflected upon each relevant factor set forth in the equitable distribution statute, including the eleventh factor, which directs the trial justice to consider “[e]ither party’s wasteful dissipation of assets or any transfer or encumbrance of assets made in contemplation of divorce without fair consideration.” Section 15-5-16.1(a)(11); see Olivieri v. Olivieri, 760 A.2d 1246, 1250 (R.I. 2000). We hold that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion when she made her factual findings and when she distributed the parties’ marital property according to the statutory factors enumerated in § 15-5-16.1(a). -6- 1 Tuition Refund One of the parties’ three sons attended Vanderbilt University in Tennessee in September 1997. Although the parties previously had paid such obligations from joint assets, Dorothy prevailed on Andrew to take out a loan in his name to pay for the Vanderbilt tuition. In late October 1997, their son withdrew from the university because of an illness. As a result, the trial justice found that the university made a partial refund of the tuition to Dorothy, despite Andrew’s having obligated himself through the loan. Dorothy testified that she did not recall receiving the refund, nor did she recall its amount. According to Andrew, the amount refunded was about $15,000. The trial justice found that the rebate of the tuition payment “more properly should have gone to” Andrew. However, she ruled that the amount of the refund would be deducted from Dorothy’s share of the marital estate only if Andrew could “determine the exact amount of the monies received by” Dorothy. Andrew contends that this was error, and that the trial justice should have required Dorothy to reimburse Andrew for half of his obligation on the debt because she “caused” the debt and prevented him from reducing the loan balance with the refund. Alternatively, Andrew argues that the trial justice unfairly allocated the burden of determining the exact amount of the refund to Andrew instead of to Dorothy, who received it. In our view, the trial justice did not abuse her discretion, because there simply was insufficient evidence presented at trial from which the trial justice could have made the distribution that Andrew argues would have been most proper. Therefore, a review of the record reveals that the trial justice did not “overlook[] salient uncontradicted evidence in determining the amount of assets to be distributed.” Ruffel, 900 A.2d at 1184 (quoting Stephenson, 811 A.2d -7- at 1142). We cannot say that the trial justice abused her discretion when she assigned responsibility to satisfy the loan to Andrew, but at the same time required him to prove the amount of the rebate that Dorothy had retained before it could be deducted from Dorothy’s share of the marital assets. Andrew had particular incentive during trial to supply specific information about the refund amount so that he could be reimbursed, yet failed to do so. 4 Thus, the trial justice was limited to considering the evidence produced at trial, which consisted of Andrew’s mere conjecture that the rebate amounted to $15,000. 5 Nonetheless, the trial justice generously afforded Andrew additional time to prove the amount of the rebate after trial. Therefore, we hold that the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive the evidence available to her, and we decline to disturb this portion of her decision on appeal. 2 Individual Tax Returns The couple filed a joint tax return for 1995. They incurred a tax liability for that year because Andrew did not withhold sufficient money from his income to satisfy the amount that they owed in taxes. In 1996 and 1997, Dorothy filed her tax returns individually. 6 Dorothy testified that she chose to do so because Andrew again failed to withhold sufficient funds and she 4 Additionally, Andrew did not file a motion with the Family Court during trial requesting an order that Dorothy pay the tuition with money from the couple’s joint account, which she controlled. Rather, Andrew deferred seeking a remedy until this appeal, more than a decade after trial began. 5 Interestingly, Andrew now characterizes the amount of the rebate as “buried by the sands of time.” This further bolsters our view that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion when she declined to give weight to Andrew’s testimony about the $15,000 rebate. It is unclear why the parties simply did not inquire of the university about the exact amount of the rebate. At oral argument, counsel for Andrew represented that the university had been contacted, but the amount refunded was still undetermined. 6 The record is unclear as to why the parties resumed filing their tax returns jointly in 1998 and for how long they continued to do so until the entry of the final judgment of divorce. -8- “couldn’t really rely on some numbers.” As a result of their filing individually and not jointly, Dorothy received a refund and Andrew incurred a substantial tax liability. Andrew argues that the trial justice should have found that Dorothy’s refunds and Andrew’s liabilities were marital assets that were subject to equitable distribution. He maintains that the trial justice should have assigned to him an amount representing an equal share of Dorothy’s refunds and to her an equal share of his liability. Dorothy argues that the trial justice “correctly refused to alter the equitable distribution award to compensate Andrew for his tax penalties” because her findings “were supported by the evidence and were not clearly wrong.” We agree with Dorothy and do not disturb the trial justice’s ruling. The trial justice acknowledged that Dorothy’s decision to file separately from Andrew for two years caused him to owe “significant” amounts to the IRS. Further, she noted that the parties’ joint properties were sold to “pay down” a business debt to Citizens Bank, “only to have those monies levied by the IRS to pay [Andrew’s] overdue taxes which were overdue, in no small measure, due to [Dorothy] filing separately for two significant tax years, ’96 and ’97.” However, the trial justice considered these facts when she ruled that Dorothy would be responsible for half of the Citizens Bank loan. This Court will not disturb the trial justice’s assignment of property unless her decision clearly was wrong. Schwab, 944 A.2d at 158. In our view, the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive the relevant evidence about the reasons for and impact of Dorothy’s filing her taxes singly for two years, and thus her findings of fact are entitled to great weight. Therefore, we cannot say that the trial justice was clearly wrong when she determined that the impact of the parties’ individual tax filings was appropriately addressed through her assignment of partial responsibility to Dorothy for the Citizens Bank loan. -9- 3 Evidence of Dorothy’s Dissipation of the Marital Estate In April 1987, after wearying of the travel required of him in his position in the corporate world, Andrew established his own telemarketing business, which was incorporated in Rhode Island as Connect Corporation. Andrew was president of Connect Corporation and was its majority shareholder. At the corporation’s inception, Dorothy contributed to the venture by “typing proposals at [her] kitchen table.” 7 Dorothy was employed by Connect Corporation in various capacities in what she described as “support” positions. She also served as treasurer of Connect Corporation from 1994 to 1996. Eventually, she became a shareholder in Connect Corporation. In August 1995, Andrew desired to computerize Connect Corporation’s office in Rhode Island. Although Dorothy was reluctant to upgrade the business’s technology before it was necessary, Connect Corporation took out a loan from Citizens Bank to purchase the new equipment, and Dorothy and Andrew personally guaranteed the loan. In 1995, Connect Research was incorporated in Rhode Island. Dorothy served as secretary for Connect Research and later as its treasurer. Her sister, Rose Marie Hurrell, was president of Connect Research from Feburary 1995 until August 1996, and she also held a 55 percent ownership interest. 8 As president, Ms. Hurrell hired a separate accounting firm in New York, and she maintained the corporation’s books and records. Ms. Hurrell testified that she established a bank account for Connect Research with a New York bank and that she deposited 7 She also worked part time in real estate sales for approximately five years, until 1989. 8 According to Andrew, a client informed him that he would receive preferential treatment if a woman was a majority stockholder. This, along with his feeling that she was “reliable” and produced “quality” work, prompted him to name Ms. Hurrell as president and majority stockholder of Connect Research. - 10 - into that account money that she had withdrawn from Connect Research’s Rhode Island account. In what she described as an effort to take control of Connect Research, Andrew filed a lawsuit against Ms. Hurrell in Rhode Island and alleged that she had misappropriated funds. 9 Andrew said that he believed that Dorothy was involved with her sister in the embezzlement of company funds. In July 1996, Andrew sought to refinance Connect Corporation with Citizens Bank, but Dorothy declined to participate in the refinancing effort and would not take part in discussions with the bank. 10 As a result, Andrew was unable to obtain alternative financing. This, he contends, contributed in part to the corporation filing for receivership in 1997. Andrew argues that the trial justice failed to consider Dorothy’s actions, which he contends precipitated their business’s insolvency, when she assigned to Dorothy 50 percent of the marital estate. In particular, Andrew contends that Dorothy’s refusal to cooperate in settling the Citizens Bank debt, her filing for personal bankruptcy, 11 and her “dismantl[ing]” of Connect Research “in concert with her sister” destroyed the parties’ finances. In response, Dorothy argues that Andrew’s version of the facts omits the fact that Andrew lacked control of Connect Research both before and after Dorothy had already filed her divorce petition, and that Dorothy did not discuss a “plan” to divorce him with her sister because their April 1996 meeting occurred after she already had filed for divorce. Further, she maintains that it actually was Andrew who “dismantled” Connect Research because he engaged in expensive litigation in an effort “to wrest control of Connect Research from Hurrell.” Thus, Dorothy maintains, the trial justice’s findings 9 The lawsuit later was settled after the expenditure of substantial money. 10 Since Connect Corporation failed, Andrew has been employed by Volt Information Science. Dorothy held several part-time jobs and began working full time in 1999. Currently, she is a teacher in the Providence Public Schools. 11 On May 31, 2002, Dorothy filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Rhode Island. - 11 - of fact were not clearly wrong and her distribution of the marital estate “on a 50-50 basis” should be upheld. The trial justice found that there were “no allegations of misconduct against [Dorothy], other than her husband’s belief that she was not supportive of Connect Corp.” She said she was “unclear as to whether [Andrew] believed his wife knew” that her sister, Hurrell, had transferred approximately $160,000 to a New York bank account from Connect Research’s Rhode Island account. 12 Additionally, the trial justice also found that Dorothy was “evasive” when cross- examined regarding Connect Research. Further, the trial justice acknowledged Dorothy’s failure to participate in settling the debt with Citizens Bank when she assigned half that outstanding liability to Dorothy. It is our opinion that these findings are supported by the record, and that the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive the evidence, nor was she clearly wrong. 4 Evidence of Andrew’s Payment of Marital Debt On April 25, 1996, Dorothy secured an ex parte restraining order, which provided that the parties were not precluded “from paying bills and/or operating the parties’ business entities in the ordinary course of business.” Subsequently, on May 3, 1996, Dorothy obtained a preliminary injunction that vacated the ex parte restraining order and said that “the parties may incur and shall pay all of those marital bills, debts, charges, and other obligations as they have in the past with each party contributing * * * in the same approximate percentage that said party had maintained prior to the parties’ separation.” As a result, Andrew’s and Dorothy’s salaries, at that 12 Andrew testified that he didn’t know for sure whether Dorothy “physically met with her sister” but he “[knew] that [they] had conversations.” Dorothy testified that Andrew left her apologetic voicemails expressing that he was mistaken that she was involved with her sister in the transfer of funds. Andrew did not recall leaving a message on Dorothy’s machine that he was “happy you weren’t dishonest and you didn’t betray me.” - 12 - time $300,000 and $140,000 respectively, continued to be deposited into their joint account, over which Dorothy maintained control. In her decision, the trial justice acknowledged that the restraining order prevented Andrew from getting access to their joint accounts; indeed, she found that Andrew “was effectively hobbled” as a result of the injunctive relief. The trial justice noted that, as a result, Dorothy was left “with the duty to pay the expenses.” Andrew argues that the trial justice erred when she did not consider Andrew’s payment of the marital debt and obligations from April 1996 until June 2002. He contends that these contributions “properly should have resulted in an equitable distribution award more favorable to” him; he suggests that a grant to him of 60 percent of the marital estate, rather than 50 percent, would be more appropriate. Dorothy maintains that Andrew’s assertion that he satisfied all the couples’ financial obligations during this time period is inaccurate. In our opinion, the trial justice did not misconceive or overlook material evidence, specifically evidence of the manner in which the marital debt was paid. When she considered the required statutory factors, many other aspects of the parties’ relationship entered into her calculus when she divided the marital estate equally, including the couple’s “long marriage” spanning thirty-seven years, their mutual contributions in raising their three children, that “both worked long and hard on” Connect Corporation, and also Andrew’s concession that he verbally abused Dorothy. 13 We afford her findings their due weight and decline to disturb her distribution of 50 percent of the marital estate to Andrew, rather than the 60 percent he contends would have been most proper. 13 The trial justice also determined that, contrary to Dorothy’s allegations, Andrew was not physically abusive toward Dorothy during their marriage. - 13 - 5 Evidence of Andrew’s Financial Contributions to Dorothy’s Education After her children were born, Dorothy attended college two evenings a week over the course of two years. She later attended the University of Rhode Island and then took courses at New York University from January until May of 1996. Dorothy’s education was intended to enable her to be more effective in her roles at Connect Corporation, benefiting Andrew as well as herself. Dorothy also testified that when she attended the University of Rhode Island, her children were older, enabling her to maintain employment as a real estate agent, and enhancing her ability to contribute to the family’s financial well-being. Andrew argues that the trial justice failed to take into account his financial contributions to Dorothy’s education. In response, Dorothy argues that the trial justice did, in fact, consider Andrew’s contributions to Dorothy’s education when she distributed the marital property. This, she maintains, is reflected in the trial justice’s specific acknowledgement of Andrew’s support for Dorothy’s education. Indeed, in her decision, the trial justice awarded half of Dorothy’s teacher pension to Andrew. The trial justice said, “In terms of their assisting each other with education, clearly, [Andrew], even after [Dorothy] filed for divorce, continued to contribute to her continuing education.” This finding is supported by the record. Therefore, although the trial justice’s treatment of Andrew’s contribution to Dorothy’s education was brief, it is our opinion that the trial justice sufficiently considered it, as she was required to do by statute, and she did not overlook or misconceive relevant evidence. See Olivieri, 760 A.2d at 1250 (holding that the magistrate adequately “enumerated and discussed each factor, even if briefly” when he distributed marital property). - 14 - B 7259 Shore Road After they married, the Currys lived in Brooklyn, N.Y. In 1981, the family moved to Narragansett, R.I. However, they retained ownership of the co-op apartment at 7259 Shore Road, Brooklyn, N.Y. The trial justice found that the co-op at 7259 Shore Road was a marital asset and awarded Andrew “all right, title, interest, and ownership to the co-op,” subject to his paying to Dorothy one-half of the equity in the unit. Andrew argues that the trial justice erred when she assigned Dorothy one-half of the equity in the co-op at 7259 Shore Road because Dorothy relinquished any interest that she had in that property when she filed for personal bankruptcy and thus, under bankruptcy law, she “no longer had any legal or equitable interest in it whatsoever.” Conversely, Dorothy argues that the trial justice did not err when she awarded Andrew the co-op while at the same time awarding half its value to Dorothy, because the co-op remains in Andrew’s possession and was purchased with marital funds. After careful review of the record, we are of the opinion that the trial justice was not clearly wrong when she divided the equity in the Shore Road property between the parties. Although Dorothy’s bankruptcy filing divested her of any legal and equitable interest in the co-op, Andrew’s reliance on In re Robison, 74 B.R. 646 (Bankr. E.D. Mo. 1987) to support his contention that the trial justice erred when she assigned Dorothy interest in the property is misplaced. The court in Robison, 74 B.R. at 648, held that Chapter 7 debtors have no right to sell property in their bankruptcy estates because they do “not have incentive to maximize the sales price” as would the bankruptcy trustee. But here, Dorothy is not attempting to sell the co- op and we believe that the trial justice was correct when she distributed half its value to Dorothy - 15 - as marital property. Moreover, we have held that although a bankruptcy court’s order may be final between the debtor and third parties, the order is not final concerning divorcing spouses. Hopkins v. Hopkins, 487 A.2d 500, 504 (R.I. 1985). Thus, the Family Court is free to distribute marital property or debt between divorcing spouses despite the existence of a bankruptcy court order divesting one of them of an interest in the property. See id. The record shows that the parties lived as husband and wife at the Brooklyn property and raised their children there before they moved to Rhode Island. Additionally, the parties retained the residence after their move to Rhode Island and used marital funds to purchase it in 1987. We cannot say that the trial justice “overlook[ed] salient uncontradicted evidence” when she determined the co-op to be marital property and assigned Dorothy a one-half interest in its equity. Ruffel, 900 A.2d at 1184. C 308 101st Street In 1986, Andrew and his two sisters purchased a co-op at 308 101st Street, Brooklyn, N.Y., for their mother’s residence, and they agreed to pay the mortgage in one-third shares. The record reveals that title to that property was in the names of Andrew and his sisters from the time it was purchased until they sold their interests in the co-op in the spring of 2009. 14 Dorothy could not recall who made the down payment when the property was acquired, but Andrew testified that his mother paid it. Each month, the Currys paid Andrew’s mother $200, which she would put toward the mortgage loan on the co-op. Andrew’s sisters likewise each paid their mother $200 as their monthly share. Andrew’s mother continued to live in the co-op until her 14 According to Andrew, he and his sisters received $185,000 in the sale, and his share of the proceeds approximated $33,000 after closing costs, but prior to his payment of capital gains taxes. - 16 - death. Significantly, the parties listed the property on their joint tax returns each year. In her decision, the trial justice found Andrew’s share of the co-op at 308 101st Street, Brooklyn, N.Y., to be a marital asset. Andrew argues that the trial justice erred when she determined that this property was a marital asset because Andrew “inherited [the property] from his mother.” Dorothy argues in response that the trial justice properly found the property to be a marital asset because the testimony of both parties established that they paid $200 toward the mortgage each month, which represented their one-third share, they listed the property on their joint tax returns annually, and the title was held in the siblings’ names since 1986, when the property was purchased. She maintains that Andrew’s assertion that he inherited the co-op from his mother is not supported by the record. After careful review of the record, we agree with Dorothy and hold that the trial justice was not clearly wrong when she found that one-third the value of the property at 308 101st Street was marital property. Dorothy’s Cross-Appeal A Citizens Bank Loan After Connect Corporation went into receivership in 1997, Andrew met with Citizens Bank in an effort to work out the outstanding business debt that he and Dorothy personally had guaranteed. Andrew testified that Dorothy “wasn’t willing to participate” in the meeting, and no settlement affording them relief was reached. As a result of Dorothy’s 2002 bankruptcy filing, she no longer had any obligation to Citizens Bank on the loan. The trial justice found that, although Dorothy was discharged of that debt as a consequence of her bankruptcy filing in 2002, Dorothy was nonetheless “responsible to reimburse [Andrew] for her one-half of that debt.” - 17 - In a flip worthy of an Olympic gymnast, Dorothy argues in her cross-appeal that the trial justice erred when she ordered Dorothy to pay one-half of the debt owed on the Citizens Bank loan. She contends that her obligation to honor her guarantee of the loan was discharged as a result of her bankruptcy and because that obligation involved neither alimony nor support, it was error to order her to reimburse Andrew for half of the debt. In a response equally impressive as a complete reversal of his position on the Shore Road co-op, Andrew argues that although a debt may be discharged in bankruptcy between the debtor and third-party creditor, the Family Court may assign such discharged debts between divorcing spouses. We agree with Andrew and hold that the trial justice did not err when she ordered Dorothy to pay one-half of the outstanding loan. As we have explained above, although a Bankruptcy Court order that discharges a debt is final concerning a spouse-debtor and third-party creditors, it is not final between divorcing spouses. Hopkins, 487 A.2d at 504. However, Dorothy argues that Hopkins is distinguishable from this case because Hopkins dealt with a conditional waiver of alimony, while here, alimony is not at issue. See id. at 502. In Hopkins, 487 A.2d at 502, the final judgment dissolving the Hopkins’ marriage provided that the former wife waived alimony on the condition that her former husband indemnify her if she became liable on certain debts. Subsequently, the husband filed for bankruptcy and the Bankruptcy Court ruled that the debts “were the result of a property settlement rather than an award of alimony and, hence, ordered the debts discharged.” Id. The Family Court ordered the husband to indemnify the wife pursuant to the conditional waiver of alimony set forth in the divorce decree despite the discharge in bankruptcy. This Court affirmed, because the discharge of the husband’s “obligations to third-party creditors in no way released him from the obligations assumed under the original Family Court decree.” Id. at 505. - 18 - Dorothy’s discharge in bankruptcy as to the Citizens Bank loan freed her from her obligation as to Citizens Bank. We agree with her that equitably distributed debts that are meant as a property settlement rather than for support of the former spouse are dischargeable in bankruptcy. In re McCartin, 145 B.R. 118, 119 (Bankr. D.R.I. 1992). However, this did not preclude the Family Court from requiring Dorothy to indemnify Andrew for a portion of the debt after it weighed the statutory factors governing equitable distribution. See Hopkins, 487 A.2d at 504. The trial justice gave careful thought to Dorothy’s refusal to participate in the negotiations on the Citizens Bank loan when she found Dorothy to be responsible for half that debt. It was within the discretion of the trial justice to assign half that debt to Dorothy, and we hold that she did not abuse her discretion when she did so. B Revaluation of Marital Estate Before she issued her bench decision on October 5, 2005, the trial justice said that she had given the parties six weeks after the trial to submit more current appraisals of the real property in the marital estate. Notwithstanding that latitude, Andrew did not submit appraisals until October 3, 2005, and Dorothy’s appraisals “flew in” on October 5, 2005; thus, both were submitted well beyond the six-week time limit. 15 On April 13, 2007, Dorothy moved under Rule 59 of the Family Court Rules of Procedure for Domestic Relations, that the trial justice “determine the present fair market values of all three (3) parcels of real estate and their present balances of the mortgages” and that she order that the amount of Dorothy’s interest in the two New York co-ops be deducted from Andrew’s interest in the Narragansett real estate because of the time lapse between the hearing 15 The six-week period set by the trial justice expired on May 10, 2005. - 19 - on October 5, 2005, and the decision pending entry of final judgment in April 2007. As a result of that delay, Dorothy argued, “the value should be taken into account at the time of the actual distribution.” On June 11, 2007, the trial justice held a hearing with regard to Dorothy’s motion and ruled that the proper time for valuation of the marital assets is at the time of the hearing on the complaint for divorce and she declined to revisit the value of the marital estate. Dorothy argues that the trial justice erred when she refused to accept professional appraisals of the marital estate both at the time of the bench decision and when she denied Dorothy’s Rule 59 motion. Dorothy maintains that the proper time to value the property is at the time of judgment, which was not entered in this case until nearly two years after the bench decision, and that the trial justice therefore erred when she declined to accept the professional appraisals and instead relied on Andrew’s “unreliable” testimony about the value of the New York and Rhode Island real estate. Conversely, Andrew argues that the trial justice properly valued the properties as of the time of trial, and thus she did not err when she declined to revalue them at a later date. We agree with Andrew, and hold that the trial justice committed no error when she declined to accept the parties’ appraisals before she issued her bench decision and later when she denied Dorothy’s Rule 59 motion. This Court has held that “marital assets should be valued as of the date of trial unless there are compelling circumstances warranting a deviation.” Gervais v. Gervais, 735 A.2d 214, 214 (R.I. 1999) (mem.) (Gervais II) (attributing this rule to our holding in Gervais I) (citing Saback v. Saback, 593 A.2d 459, 461 (R.I. 1991) (holding trial justice should “distribute the marital assets at the time of trial” and ordering assessment of assets “as of the time of the entry of judgment” where trial justice’s bench decision distributed assets that were nonexistent at that time) and Briceno v. Briceno, 566 A.2d 397, 397 (R.I. 1989) (holding that “in the absence of - 20 - compelling circumstances * * * the trial justice should value marital assets as of the time of trial”)); see also Gervais I, 688 A.2d at 1308 (holding that trial justice erred when he valued “the marital estate * * * prior to the trial”). We acknowledge that we also have referred to the appropriate time for valuation as the time of “final” judgment or order. Ruffel, 900 A.2d at 1187 (holding that date of “the final order resolving the * * * equitable-distribution issues” was appropriate valuation date); Cardinale v. Cardinale, 889 A.2d 210, 228 (R.I. 2006) (holding wife’s interest in certain property should be determined on date of final judgment). However, although Ruffel and Cardinale refer to the date of “final” judgment or order as the proper time for valuation, these dates were also “when all the equitable issues were purported to be resolved,” rather than the when the final judgment of divorce was entered. Ruffel, 900 A.2d at 1186-87 (divorce final on December 16, 2002, but equitable distribution unresolved until December 29, 2003, order following November 26, 2003, bench decision) (citing Cardinale, 889 A.2d at 228); Cardinale, 889 A.2d at 220 (divorce final on April 1, 2003, with final judgment resolving all equitable issues entered on June 1, 2004). Therefore, the proper date for valuation of marital assets is at the time when all equitable issues are resolved, which in divorce cases, should be at the time of trial. See Cardinale, 889 A.2d at 228 (holding that bifurcated proceedings are inappropriate in divorce cases and “all the issues between the parties shall be adjudicated in a single proceeding”). Here, the trial justice did just that on October 5, 2005, when she purported to resolve all issues relating to the equitable distribution of the parties’ marital property. In doing so, she properly valued the real estate based on the evidence produced at trial. Unlike the situations in Ruffel and Cardinale, in which the final divorce decrees were entered before the equitable distribution issues were resolved, the Currys’ divorce became final after the trial justice had - 21 - distributed the marital assets and liabilities between them. In this case, because no written order memorializing this October 5, 2005, bench decision was entered, and because the decision pending entry of final judgment, entered on April 4, 2007, refers back to the bench decision, we hold that October 5, 2005, was the appropriate date for valuation of the assets. See Ruffel, 900 A.2d at 1182, 1186-87 (holding date of final order resolving the equitable distribution, which was issued approximately one month after the bench decision, was the appropriate termination date for the valuation of assets). This is so because that is the date when the issues were resolved. Further, the trial justice did not abuse her discretion when she declined to accept belated offers of valuations before she issued her bench decision. The trial justice afforded the parties ample time to submit more recent appraisals, but they did not do so. Therefore, the trial justice did not err when she relied on the evidence of the property values as was adduced during the trial, because this was the only information on the record when she made her decision. Nor did the trial justice err when she denied Dorothy’s Rule 59 motion requesting that the trial justice revalue the properties because of the lapse of time between the bench decision on October 5, 2005, and the decision pending entry of final judgment on April 4, 2007. The trial justice properly valued the property at the time of trial, when all equitable issues were resolved and, in our view, no compelling circumstances exist to warrant deviation from this “usual date of valuation.” Gervais II, 735 A.2d at 214. We are not persuaded by Dorothy’s argument that the lapse of time, “the fluctuation of the real estate market,” or the assertion of “the questionable reliability of the * * * owner opinion valuations” used in the bench decision are sufficiently compelling to warrant deviation from the usual date of valuation. Id. (holding that “mere allegations are not sufficient to justify a deviation”). It is time for this litigation to end. This - 22 - couple, who married in 1968, have been involved in divorce proceedings since 1996, a period of thirteen years. Such an unconscionable delay serves no one’s interest, and is repugnant to the interests of justice. Conclusion For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Family Court and remand the record to that court. - 23 - Supreme Court No. 2007-347-Appeal. (W 96-0247) Dorothy Curry : v. : Andrew Curry.",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The marriage of Andrew and Dorothy Curry, which began in 1968, has been in the throes of dissolution since 1996. Finally, in 2005, a justice of the Family Court granted the parties’ divorce petitions and divided their marital assets in accordance with Rhode Island’s law of equitable distribution. Even then, certain issues pertaining to the division of their marital property continued to be adjudicated in the Family Court until 2007. The couples’ dispute finally has made its way to this Court. On appeal, each contends that the trial justice erred when she determined certain assets and liabilities to be marital and when she divided their marital assets. We hold that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion when she determined the parties’ marital estate and equitably distributed it between them. Additionally, we hold that the trial justice did not err when she denied Dorothy’s motion seeking revaluation of certain property after the time of trial. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Family Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Procedural History', 'Dorothy Curry, plaintiff, and Andrew Curry, defendant, married on December 8, 1968, in New York. They had three sons during their marriage, all of whom are now adults.', 'Dorothy filed for divorce on April 25, 1996, citing irreconcilable differences resulting in the irremediable breakdown of their marriage. Andrew filed a counterclaim in which he asked the court to deny and dismiss Dorothy’s complaint and to grant him a divorce on the grounds of living separate and apart for more than three years and irreconcilable differences.

Andrew timely appealed to this Court and Dorothy followed with a cross-appeal.', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'On appeal, Andrew submits that the trial justice committed a number of errors when she distributed his and Dorothy’s marital property. First, he argues that the trial justice erred when she “fail[ed] to compensate Andrew adequately for actions Dorothy took that substantially reduced the marital estate and injured Andrew financially.” Relative to this argument, Andrew contends that the trial justice miscued when she (1) failed to consider a tuition refund that Dorothy “converted to her own use”; (2) failed to consider that Dorothy “dissipated” and “destroyed” the parties’ finances when she assigned Dorothy 50 percent of the marital assets; (3)', '“(8) The opportunity of each party for future acquisition of', 'capital assets and income;', '“(9) The contribution by one party to the education, training,', 'licensure, business, or increased earning power of the other;', '“(10) The need of the custodial parent to occupy or own the', 'marital residence and to use or own its household effects taking', 'into account the best interests of the children of the marriage;', '“(11) Either party’s wasteful dissipation of assets or any transfer', 'or encumbrance of assets made in contemplation of divorce', 'without fair consideration; and', '“(12) Any factor which the court shall expressly find to be just', 'and proper.” 2', 'At oral argument, both parties were at a loss to fully explain why this case has been pending for more than thirteen years. In part, Andrew attributes the delay between the bench decision and entry of the decision pending entry of final judgment in April 2007 to his motion filed on January 11, 2007 “seeking clarification of the Bench Decision.” Andrew also had filed another motion on October 23, 2006, which sought access to the Narragansett home to retrieve personal items and a restraining order against Dorothy to prevent her from “disbursing any funds received from the parties’ insurance carrier” without first consulting Andrew.', '-3- failed to determine that Dorothy’s income tax refunds and Andrew’s income tax “shortfalls” in 1996 and 1997 were marital assets; (4) failed to consider that Andrew “paid all the marital debt” from April 1996 until June 2002; and (5) failed to consider Andrew’s contributions to Dorothy’s education. He also maintains that the trial justice erred when she assigned Dorothy an interest in a co-op apartment at 7259 Shore Road, Brooklyn, N.Y., and when she found that another co-op at 308 101st Street, Brooklyn, N.Y., was a marital asset. 3', 'In response, Dorothy argues that the trial justice, but for one exception, properly distributed the marital property. However, in her cross-appeal, Dorothy contends that the trial justice abused her discretion when she ordered Dorothy to be responsible for half of a loan from Citizens Bank during their marriage on the ground that she was discharged from that obligation because she filed for bankruptcy. Additionally, Dorothy also argues on appeal that the trial justice erred when she declined to “update the values of the marital real estate.”', 'III', 'Standard of Review', '“When hearing an appeal from the Family Court, we have said that ‘it is not our function to arrive at de novo findings and conclusions of fact based on the evidence presented at trial.’” Schwab v.

As an initial matter, we note that the trial justice said that she “consider[ed] all the variables in the equitable distribution statute.” Although the trial justice did not delineate those factors with the precision we like to see, a review of the record nonetheless indicates that she reflected upon each relevant factor set forth in the equitable distribution statute, including the eleventh factor, which directs the trial justice to consider “[e]ither party’s wasteful dissipation of assets or any transfer or encumbrance of assets made in contemplation of divorce without fair consideration.” Section 15-5-16.1(a)(11); see Olivieri v. Olivieri, 760 A.2d 1246, 1250 (R.I. 2000). We hold that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion when she made her factual findings and when she distributed the parties’ marital property according to the statutory factors enumerated in § 15-5-16.1(a).', '-6-', '1', 'Tuition Refund', 'One of the parties’ three sons attended Vanderbilt University in Tennessee in September 1997. Although the parties previously had paid such obligations from joint assets, Dorothy prevailed on Andrew to take out a loan in his name to pay for the Vanderbilt tuition. In late October 1997, their son withdrew from the university because of an illness. As a result, the trial justice found that the university made a partial refund of the tuition to Dorothy, despite Andrew’s having obligated himself through the loan. Dorothy testified that she did not recall receiving the refund, nor did she recall its amount. According to Andrew, the amount refunded was about $15,000.', 'The trial justice found that the rebate of the tuition payment “more properly should have gone to” Andrew. However, she ruled that the amount of the refund would be deducted from Dorothy’s share of the marital estate only if Andrew could “determine the exact amount of the monies received by” Dorothy. Andrew contends that this was error, and that the trial justice should have required Dorothy to reimburse Andrew for half of his obligation on the debt because she “caused” the debt and prevented him from reducing the loan balance with the refund. Alternatively, Andrew argues that the trial justice unfairly allocated the burden of determining the exact amount of the refund to Andrew instead of to Dorothy, who received it.', 'In our view, the trial justice did not abuse her discretion, because there simply was insufficient evidence presented at trial from which the trial justice could have made the distribution that Andrew argues would have been most proper. Therefore, a review of the record reveals that the trial justice did not “overlook[] salient uncontradicted evidence in determining the amount of assets to be distributed.” Ruffel, 900 A.2d at 1184 (quoting Stephenson, 811 A.2d', '-7- at 1142).', 'We cannot say that the trial justice abused her discretion when she assigned responsibility to satisfy the loan to Andrew, but at the same time required him to prove the amount of the rebate that Dorothy had retained before it could be deducted from Dorothy’s share of the marital assets. Andrew had particular incentive during trial to supply specific information about the refund amount so that he could be reimbursed, yet failed to do so. 4 Thus, the trial justice was limited to considering the evidence produced at trial, which consisted of Andrew’s mere conjecture that the rebate amounted to $15,000. 5 Nonetheless, the trial justice generously afforded Andrew additional time to prove the amount of the rebate after trial. Therefore, we hold that the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive the evidence available to her, and we decline to disturb this portion of her decision on appeal.', '2', 'Individual Tax Returns', 'The couple filed a joint tax return for 1995. They incurred a tax liability for that year because Andrew did not withhold sufficient money from his income to satisfy the amount that they owed in taxes. In 1996 and 1997, Dorothy filed her tax returns individually. 6 Dorothy testified that she chose to do so because Andrew again failed to withhold sufficient funds and she 4', 'Additionally, Andrew did not file a motion with the Family Court during trial requesting an order that Dorothy pay the tuition with money from the couple’s joint account, which she controlled. Rather, Andrew deferred seeking a remedy until this appeal, more than a decade after trial began. 5', 'Interestingly, Andrew now characterizes the amount of the rebate as “buried by the sands of time.” This further bolsters our view that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion when she declined to give weight to Andrew’s testimony about the $15,000 rebate. It is unclear why the parties simply did not inquire of the university about the exact amount of the rebate. At oral argument, counsel for Andrew represented that the university had been contacted, but the amount refunded was still undetermined. 6', 'The record is unclear as to why the parties resumed filing their tax returns jointly in 1998 and for how long they continued to do so until the entry of the final judgment of divorce.', '-8- “couldn’t really rely on some numbers.” As a result of their filing individually and not jointly, Dorothy received a refund and Andrew incurred a substantial tax liability.', 'Andrew argues that the trial justice should have found that Dorothy’s refunds and Andrew’s liabilities were marital assets that were subject to equitable distribution. He maintains that the trial justice should have assigned to him an amount representing an equal share of Dorothy’s refunds and to her an equal share of his liability. Dorothy argues that the trial justice “correctly refused to alter the equitable distribution award to compensate Andrew for his tax penalties” because her findings “were supported by the evidence and were not clearly wrong.” We agree with Dorothy and do not disturb the trial justice’s ruling.', 'The trial justice acknowledged that Dorothy’s decision to file separately from Andrew for two years caused him to owe “significant” amounts to the IRS. Further, she noted that the parties’ joint properties were sold to “pay down” a business debt to Citizens Bank, “only to have those monies levied by the IRS to pay [Andrew’s] overdue taxes which were overdue, in no small measure, due to [Dorothy] filing separately for two significant tax years, ’96 and ’97.” However, the trial justice considered these facts when she ruled that Dorothy would be responsible for half of the Citizens Bank loan. This Court will not disturb the trial justice’s assignment of property unless her decision clearly was wrong. Schwab, 944 A.2d at 158. In our view, the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive the relevant evidence about the reasons for and impact of Dorothy’s filing her taxes singly for two years, and thus her findings of fact are entitled to great weight. Therefore, we cannot say that the trial justice was clearly wrong when she determined that the impact of the parties’ individual tax filings was appropriately addressed through her assignment of partial responsibility to Dorothy for the Citizens Bank loan.', '-9-', '3', 'Evidence of Dorothy’s Dissipation of the Marital Estate', 'In April 1987, after wearying of the travel required of him in his position in the corporate world, Andrew established his own telemarketing business, which was incorporated in Rhode Island as Connect Corporation. Andrew was president of Connect Corporation and was its majority shareholder. At the corporation’s inception, Dorothy contributed to the venture by “typing proposals at [her] kitchen table.” 7 Dorothy was employed by Connect Corporation in various capacities in what she described as “support” positions. She also served as treasurer of Connect Corporation from 1994 to 1996. Eventually, she became a shareholder in Connect Corporation.', 'In August 1995, Andrew desired to computerize Connect Corporation’s office in Rhode Island. Although Dorothy was reluctant to upgrade the business’s technology before it was necessary, Connect Corporation took out a loan from Citizens Bank to purchase the new equipment, and Dorothy and Andrew personally guaranteed the loan.', 'In 1995, Connect Research was incorporated in Rhode Island.', 'Dorothy served as secretary for Connect Research and later as its treasurer. Her sister, Rose Marie Hurrell, was president of Connect Research from Feburary 1995 until August 1996, and she also held a 55 percent ownership interest. 8 As president, Ms. Hurrell hired a separate accounting firm in New York, and she maintained the corporation’s books and records. Ms. Hurrell testified that she established a bank account for Connect Research with a New York bank and that she deposited 7', 'She also worked part time in real estate sales for approximately five years, until 1989. 8', 'According to Andrew, a client informed him that he would receive preferential treatment if a woman was a majority stockholder.

In what she described as an effort to take control of Connect Research, Andrew filed a lawsuit against Ms. Hurrell in Rhode Island and alleged that she had misappropriated funds. 9 Andrew said that he believed that Dorothy was involved with her sister in the embezzlement of company funds.', 'In July 1996, Andrew sought to refinance Connect Corporation with Citizens Bank, but Dorothy declined to participate in the refinancing effort and would not take part in discussions with the bank. 10', 'As a result, Andrew was unable to obtain alternative financing. This, he contends, contributed in part to the corporation filing for receivership in 1997.', 'Andrew argues that the trial justice failed to consider Dorothy’s actions, which he contends precipitated their business’s insolvency, when she assigned to Dorothy 50 percent of the marital estate. In particular, Andrew contends that Dorothy’s refusal to cooperate in settling the Citizens Bank debt, her filing for personal bankruptcy, 11 and her “dismantl[ing]” of Connect Research “in concert with her sister” destroyed the parties’ finances. In response, Dorothy argues that Andrew’s version of the facts omits the fact that Andrew lacked control of Connect Research both before and after Dorothy had already filed her divorce petition, and that Dorothy did not discuss a “plan” to divorce him with her sister because their April 1996 meeting occurred after she already had filed for divorce. Further, she maintains that it actually was Andrew who “dismantled” Connect Research because he engaged in expensive litigation in an effort “to wrest control of Connect Research from Hurrell.” Thus, Dorothy maintains, the trial justice’s findings 9', 'The lawsuit later was settled after the expenditure of substantial money. 10', 'Since Connect Corporation failed, Andrew has been employed by Volt Information Science.

Further, the trial justice acknowledged Dorothy’s failure to participate in settling the debt with Citizens Bank when she assigned half that outstanding liability to Dorothy. It is our opinion that these findings are supported by the record, and that the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive the evidence, nor was she clearly wrong.', '4', 'Evidence of Andrew’s Payment of Marital Debt', 'On April 25, 1996, Dorothy secured an ex parte restraining order, which provided that the parties were not precluded “from paying bills and/or operating the parties’ business entities in the ordinary course of business.” Subsequently, on May 3, 1996, Dorothy obtained a preliminary injunction that vacated the ex parte restraining order and said that “the parties may incur and shall pay all of those marital bills, debts, charges, and other obligations as they have in the past with each party contributing * * * in the same approximate percentage that said party had maintained prior to the parties’ separation.” As a result, Andrew’s and Dorothy’s salaries, at that 12', 'Andrew testified that he didn’t know for sure whether Dorothy “physically met with her sister” but he “[knew] that [they] had conversations.” Dorothy testified that Andrew left her apologetic voicemails expressing that he was mistaken that she was involved with her sister in the transfer of funds.

The trial justice noted that, as a result, Dorothy was left “with the duty to pay the expenses.” Andrew argues that the trial justice erred when she did not consider Andrew’s payment of the marital debt and obligations from April 1996 until June 2002. He contends that these contributions “properly should have resulted in an equitable distribution award more favorable to” him; he suggests that a grant to him of 60 percent of the marital estate, rather than 50 percent, would be more appropriate. Dorothy maintains that Andrew’s assertion that he satisfied all the couples’ financial obligations during this time period is inaccurate.', 'In our opinion, the trial justice did not misconceive or overlook material evidence, specifically evidence of the manner in which the marital debt was paid. When she considered the required statutory factors, many other aspects of the parties’ relationship entered into her calculus when she divided the marital estate equally, including the couple’s “long marriage” spanning thirty-seven years, their mutual contributions in raising their three children, that “both worked long and hard on” Connect Corporation, and also Andrew’s concession that he verbally abused Dorothy. 13', 'We afford her findings their due weight and decline to disturb her distribution of 50 percent of the marital estate to Andrew, rather than the 60 percent he contends would have been most proper. 13', 'The trial justice also determined that, contrary to Dorothy’s allegations, Andrew was not physically abusive toward Dorothy during their marriage.', '- 13 -', '5', 'Evidence of Andrew’s Financial Contributions to Dorothy’s Education', 'After her children were born, Dorothy attended college two evenings a week over the course of two years. She later attended the University of Rhode Island and then took courses at New York University from January until May of 1996. Dorothy’s education was intended to enable her to be more effective in her roles at Connect Corporation, benefiting Andrew as well as herself. Dorothy also testified that when she attended the University of Rhode Island, her children were older, enabling her to maintain employment as a real estate agent, and enhancing her ability to contribute to the family’s financial well-being.', 'Andrew argues that the trial justice failed to take into account his financial contributions to Dorothy’s education. In response, Dorothy argues that the trial justice did, in fact, consider Andrew’s contributions to Dorothy’s education when she distributed the marital property. This, she maintains, is reflected in the trial justice’s specific acknowledgement of Andrew’s support for Dorothy’s education. Indeed, in her decision, the trial justice awarded half of Dorothy’s teacher pension to Andrew.', 'The trial justice said, “In terms of their assisting each other with education, clearly, [Andrew], even after [Dorothy] filed for divorce, continued to contribute to her continuing education.” This finding is supported by the record. Therefore, although the trial justice’s treatment of Andrew’s contribution to Dorothy’s education was brief, it is our opinion that the trial justice sufficiently considered it, as she was required to do by statute, and she did not overlook or misconceive relevant evidence.

In 1981, the family moved to Narragansett, R.I. However, they retained ownership of the co-op apartment at 7259 Shore Road, Brooklyn, N.Y. The trial justice found that the co-op at 7259 Shore Road was a marital asset and awarded Andrew “all right, title, interest, and ownership to the co-op,” subject to his paying to Dorothy one-half of the equity in the unit.', 'Andrew argues that the trial justice erred when she assigned Dorothy one-half of the equity in the co-op at 7259 Shore Road because Dorothy relinquished any interest that she had in that property when she filed for personal bankruptcy and thus, under bankruptcy law, she “no longer had any legal or equitable interest in it whatsoever.” Conversely, Dorothy argues that the trial justice did not err when she awarded Andrew the co-op while at the same time awarding half its value to Dorothy, because the co-op remains in Andrew’s possession and was purchased with marital funds. After careful review of the record, we are of the opinion that the trial justice was not clearly wrong when she divided the equity in the Shore Road property between the parties.', 'Although Dorothy’s bankruptcy filing divested her of any legal and equitable interest in the co-op, Andrew’s reliance on In re Robison, 74 B.R. 646 (Bankr. E.D. Mo. 1987) to support his contention that the trial justice erred when she assigned Dorothy interest in the property is misplaced. The court in Robison, 74 B.R. at 648, held that Chapter 7 debtors have no right to sell property in their bankruptcy estates because they do “not have incentive to maximize the sales price” as would the bankruptcy trustee. But here, Dorothy is not attempting to sell the co- op and we believe that the trial justice was correct when she distributed half its value to Dorothy', '- 15 - as marital property.

Hopkins, 487 A.2d 500, 504 (R.I. 1985). Thus, the Family Court is free to distribute marital property or debt between divorcing spouses despite the existence of a bankruptcy court order divesting one of them of an interest in the property. See id.', 'The record shows that the parties lived as husband and wife at the Brooklyn property and raised their children there before they moved to Rhode Island. Additionally, the parties retained the residence after their move to Rhode Island and used marital funds to purchase it in 1987.

Each month, the Currys paid Andrew’s mother $200, which she would put toward the mortgage loan on the co-op. Andrew’s sisters likewise each paid their mother $200 as their monthly share.

She maintains that Andrew’s assertion that he inherited the co-op from his mother is not supported by the record. After careful review of the record, we agree with Dorothy and hold that the trial justice was not clearly wrong when she found that one-third the value of the property at 308 101st Street was marital property.', 'Dorothy’s Cross-Appeal', 'A', 'Citizens Bank Loan', 'After Connect Corporation went into receivership in 1997, Andrew met with Citizens Bank in an effort to work out the outstanding business debt that he and Dorothy personally had guaranteed. Andrew testified that Dorothy “wasn’t willing to participate” in the meeting, and no settlement affording them relief was reached. As a result of Dorothy’s 2002 bankruptcy filing, she no longer had any obligation to Citizens Bank on the loan. The trial justice found that, although Dorothy was discharged of that debt as a consequence of her bankruptcy filing in 2002, Dorothy was nonetheless “responsible to reimburse [Andrew] for her one-half of that debt.”', '- 17 -', 'In a flip worthy of an Olympic gymnast, Dorothy argues in her cross-appeal that the trial justice erred when she ordered Dorothy to pay one-half of the debt owed on the Citizens Bank loan. She contends that her obligation to honor her guarantee of the loan was discharged as a result of her bankruptcy and because that obligation involved neither alimony nor support, it was error to order her to reimburse Andrew for half of the debt. In a response equally impressive as a complete reversal of his position on the Shore Road co-op, Andrew argues that although a debt may be discharged in bankruptcy between the debtor and third-party creditor, the Family Court may assign such discharged debts between divorcing spouses. We agree with Andrew and hold that the trial justice did not err when she ordered Dorothy to pay one-half of the outstanding loan.', 'As we have explained above, although a Bankruptcy Court order that discharges a debt is final concerning a spouse-debtor and third-party creditors, it is not final between divorcing spouses. Hopkins, 487 A.2d at 504. However, Dorothy argues that Hopkins is distinguishable from this case because Hopkins dealt with a conditional waiver of alimony, while here, alimony is not at issue. See id. at 502. In Hopkins, 487 A.2d at 502, the final judgment dissolving the Hopkins’ marriage provided that the former wife waived alimony on the condition that her former husband indemnify her if she became liable on certain debts. Subsequently, the husband filed for bankruptcy and the Bankruptcy Court ruled that the debts “were the result of a property settlement rather than an award of alimony and, hence, ordered the debts discharged.” Id. The Family Court ordered the husband to indemnify the wife pursuant to the conditional waiver of alimony set forth in the divorce decree despite the discharge in bankruptcy. This Court affirmed, because the discharge of the husband’s “obligations to third-party creditors in no way released him from the obligations assumed under the original Family Court decree.” Id. at 505.', '- 18 -', 'Dorothy’s discharge in bankruptcy as to the Citizens Bank loan freed her from her obligation as to Citizens Bank.

However, this did not preclude the Family Court from requiring Dorothy to indemnify Andrew for a portion of the debt after it weighed the statutory factors governing equitable distribution. See Hopkins, 487 A.2d at 504. The trial justice gave careful thought to Dorothy’s refusal to participate in the negotiations on the Citizens Bank loan when she found Dorothy to be responsible for half that debt. It was within the discretion of the trial justice to assign half that debt to Dorothy, and we hold that she did not abuse her discretion when she did so.', 'B', 'Revaluation of Marital Estate', 'Before she issued her bench decision on October 5, 2005, the trial justice said that she had given the parties six weeks after the trial to submit more current appraisals of the real property in the marital estate. Notwithstanding that latitude, Andrew did not submit appraisals until October 3, 2005, and Dorothy’s appraisals “flew in” on October 5, 2005; thus, both were submitted well beyond the six-week time limit. 15', 'On April 13, 2007, Dorothy moved under Rule 59 of the Family Court Rules of Procedure for Domestic Relations, that the trial justice “determine the present fair market values of all three (3) parcels of real estate and their present balances of the mortgages” and that she order that the amount of Dorothy’s interest in the two New York co-ops be deducted from Andrew’s interest in the Narragansett real estate because of the time lapse between the hearing 15', 'The six-week period set by the trial justice expired on May 10, 2005.', '- 19 - on October 5, 2005, and the decision pending entry of final judgment in April 2007. As a result of that delay, Dorothy argued, “the value should be taken into account at the time of the actual distribution.” On June 11, 2007, the trial justice held a hearing with regard to Dorothy’s motion and ruled that the proper time for valuation of the marital assets is at the time of the hearing on the complaint for divorce and she declined to revisit the value of the marital estate.', 'Dorothy argues that the trial justice erred when she refused to accept professional appraisals of the marital estate both at the time of the bench decision and when she denied Dorothy’s Rule 59 motion. Dorothy maintains that the proper time to value the property is at the time of judgment, which was not entered in this case until nearly two years after the bench decision, and that the trial justice therefore erred when she declined to accept the professional appraisals and instead relied on Andrew’s “unreliable” testimony about the value of the New York and Rhode Island real estate. Conversely, Andrew argues that the trial justice properly valued the properties as of the time of trial, and thus she did not err when she declined to revalue them at a later date. We agree with Andrew, and hold that the trial justice committed no error when she declined to accept the parties’ appraisals before she issued her bench decision and later when she denied Dorothy’s Rule 59 motion.', 'This Court has held that “marital assets should be valued as of the date of trial unless there are compelling circumstances warranting a deviation.” Gervais v. Gervais, 735 A.2d 214, 214 (R.I. 1999) (mem.) (Gervais II) (attributing this rule to our holding in Gervais I) (citing Saback v. Saback, 593 A.2d 459, 461 (R.I. 1991) (holding trial justice should “distribute the marital assets at the time of trial” and ordering assessment of assets “as of the time of the entry of judgment” where trial justice’s bench decision distributed assets that were nonexistent at that time) and Briceno v. Briceno, 566 A.2d 397, 397 (R.I. 1989) (holding that “in the absence of', '- 20 - compelling circumstances * * * the trial justice should value marital assets as of the time of trial”)); see also Gervais I, 688 A.2d at 1308 (holding that trial justice erred when he valued “the marital estate * * * prior to the trial”). We acknowledge that we also have referred to the appropriate time for valuation as the time of “final” judgment or order. Ruffel, 900 A.2d at 1187 (holding that date of “the final order resolving the * * * equitable-distribution issues” was appropriate valuation date); Cardinale v. Cardinale, 889 A.2d 210, 228 (R.I. 2006) (holding wife’s interest in certain property should be determined on date of final judgment). However, although Ruffel and Cardinale refer to the date of “final” judgment or order as the proper time for valuation, these dates were also “when all the equitable issues were purported to be resolved,” rather than the when the final judgment of divorce was entered. Ruffel, 900 A.2d at 1186-87 (divorce final on December 16, 2002, but equitable distribution unresolved until December 29, 2003, order following November 26, 2003, bench decision) (citing Cardinale, 889 A.2d at 228); Cardinale, 889 A.2d at 220 (divorce final on April 1, 2003, with final judgment resolving all equitable issues entered on June 1, 2004). Therefore, the proper date for valuation of marital assets is at the time when all equitable issues are resolved, which in divorce cases, should be at the time of trial.', 'See Cardinale, 889 A.2d at 228 (holding that bifurcated proceedings are inappropriate in divorce cases and “all the issues between the parties shall be adjudicated in a single proceeding”).', 'Here, the trial justice did just that on October 5, 2005, when she purported to resolve all issues relating to the equitable distribution of the parties’ marital property. In doing so, she properly valued the real estate based on the evidence produced at trial. Unlike the situations in Ruffel and Cardinale, in which the final divorce decrees were entered before the equitable distribution issues were resolved, the Currys’ divorce became final after the trial justice had', '- 21 - distributed the marital assets and liabilities between them. In this case, because no written order memorializing this October 5, 2005, bench decision was entered, and because the decision pending entry of final judgment, entered on April 4, 2007, refers back to the bench decision, we hold that October 5, 2005, was the appropriate date for valuation of the assets. See Ruffel, 900 A.2d at 1182, 1186-87 (holding date of final order resolving the equitable distribution, which was issued approximately one month after the bench decision, was the appropriate termination date for the valuation of assets). This is so because that is the date when the issues were resolved.', 'Further, the trial justice did not abuse her discretion when she declined to accept belated offers of valuations before she issued her bench decision. The trial justice afforded the parties ample time to submit more recent appraisals, but they did not do so. Therefore, the trial justice did not err when she relied on the evidence of the property values as was adduced during the trial, because this was the only information on the record when she made her decision.', 'Nor did the trial justice err when she denied Dorothy’s Rule 59 motion requesting that the trial justice revalue the properties because of the lapse of time between the bench decision on October 5, 2005, and the decision pending entry of final judgment on April 4, 2007. The trial justice properly valued the property at the time of trial, when all equitable issues were resolved and, in our view, no compelling circumstances exist to warrant deviation from this “usual date of valuation.” Gervais II, 735 A.2d at 214. We are not persuaded by Dorothy’s argument that the lapse of time, “the fluctuation of the real estate market,” or the assertion of “the questionable reliability of the * * * owner opinion valuations” used in the bench decision are sufficiently compelling to warrant deviation from the usual date of valuation.

70,"Catherine Goetz : v. : LUVRAJ, LLC et al. : Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty and Robinson, JJ. OPINION Justice Goldberg, for the Court. This case came before the Supreme Court on December 8, 2009, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. The defendants, LUVRAJ, LLC, and Raju Chadha (Chadha and collectively defendants) appeal from the Superior Court’s grant of a motion by the plaintiff, Catherine Goetz (plaintiff), to enforce a Minnesota District Court judgment pursuant to the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 32 of title 9. The defendants argue that the $100,878 judgment was entered improperly because the Minnesota District Court lacked personal jurisdiction over them. After reviewing the memoranda submitted by the parties and hearing counsel’s arguments, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown, and thus, the appeal may be decided at this time. -1- Facts and Travel The defendant, LUVRAJ, LLC, 1 owned an internet-based jigsaw puzzle business named puzzlewarehouse.com. The business sold puzzles to customers in all fifty states; 120 patrons were located in Minnesota, accounting for roughly 2 percent of defendants’ active customers. In 2005, defendants decided to sell the puzzle business and posted internet advertisements soliciting potential buyers. The plaintiff came across an internet advertisement and telephoned Chadha, who was the president of LUVRAJ, LLC, and a Massachusetts resident, to inquire about purchasing the business. According to the record, approximately 100 contacts, consisting of emails, telephone calls, and letters were exchanged between the parties in negotiating the terms of the sale. These negotiations successfully concluded when plaintiff traveled to Massachusetts, where, on June 30, 2005, she signed the contract for a purchase price of $100,000. The contract contained a Minnesota choice-of-law provision, but not a forum selection clause. 2 After the sale, plaintiff became convinced that defendants overstated the amount of the business’s sales and understated the business’s expenses. The plaintiff notified defendants of these concerns in February 2006. In a March 2006 letter, defendants denied the allegations and further declared that they would not defend a lawsuit in Minnesota because the Minnesota courts lacked in personam jurisdiction over them. Nonetheless, on April 10, 2006, plaintiff filed suit in the Minnesota District Court, 1 According to the Massachusetts Secretary of State’s records, prior to the sale, LUVRAJ, LLC, was a Massachusetts limited liability company. According to the Rhode Island Secretary of State’s records, after the sale, but before the lawsuit, LUVRAJ, LLC, was registered in Rhode Island as a foreign limited liability company. 2 Article XI provides that, “[t]his Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws * * * of the State of Minnesota.” -2- alleging breach of contract, misrepresentation, and fraud; additionally, plaintiff asked that the contract be rescinded. The defendant LUVRAJ, LLC, which since had registered as a foreign limited liability company in Rhode Island, and Chadha, who also moved to Rhode Island, were served with the complaint, but did not answer or make an appearance in Minnesota. 3 As a result, on August 28, 2006, the Minnesota District Court, having concluded that it had jurisdiction over the parties and the subject-matter, entered judgment against defendants for $100,878. The court further found that the fair market value of the business was zero, and that defendants’ actions constituted breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, and fraud. In November 2006, plaintiff sought to enforce the Minnesota judgment in Rhode Island by filing the judgment in accordance with the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act. 4 The defendants unsuccessfully argued to the Superior Court that the judgment was unenforceable because the Minnesota District Court lacked personal jurisdiction. 5 On May 20, 2008, the hearing justice issued a bench decision, noting that Minnesota properly had exercised its jurisdiction over the case and defendants. The hearing justice noted that defendants sold their products to 120 Minnesota customers, engaged in approximately 100 communications with plaintiff about the sale, and 3 On June 26, 2006, plaintiff properly served process on defendants in Providence, Rhode Island. 4 General Laws 1956 § 9-32-2 provides that, “[a] copy of any foreign judgment * * * may be filed in the office of the clerk of the appropriate superior or district court. The clerk shall treat the foreign judgment in the same manner as a judgment of the superior or district court.” 5 The defendants’ arguments included the contention that the business sale was an improper contact for Minnesota to exercise jurisdiction, the contention that the choice-of- law clause had no place in the court’s inquiry, the fact that only 2 percent of its customers included Minnesota residents, and the fact that the contract was not signed in Minnesota. -3- voluntarily agreed that Minnesota law would govern the sales contract. The hearing justice further noted that defendants’ negotiations with plaintiff in Minnesota were actions directed at obtaining a commercial benefit in Minnesota and that defendants’ alleged fraudulent and misleading statements should have placed them on notice that they could be sued in Minnesota. This timely appeal followed. We affirm. Standard of Review We undertake our analysis mindful that, “[i]f a defendant fails to appear after having been served with a complaint filed against him in another state and a default judgment is entered, he may ‘defeat subsequent enforcement in another forum’ by showing that the judgment was ‘issued from a court lacking personal jurisdiction.’” C&J Leasing Corp. v. Paolino, 721 A.2d 839, 841 (R.I. 1998) (quoting Video Products Distributors, Inc. v. Kilsey, 682 A.2d 1381, 1382 (R.I. 1996)). This course of action is not without risk, however, because the defendant has a heavy burden in seeking to overturn a default judgment; and, if the jurisdictional challenge fails, then the default becomes as final and determinative on the merits as a judgment entered after a full trial. Video Products Distributors, Inc., 682 A.2d at 1382. Additionally, this Court will apply a de novo standard of review to questions of law that may implicate a constitutional right. Pierce v. Wall, 941 A.2d 189, 192 (R.I. 2008); State v. Wiggins, 919 A.2d 987, 989 (R.I. 2007). Personal Jurisdiction “Under the full faith and credit clause [of the United States Constitution], a state court must enforce and give effect to a judgment of a court of a sister state, provided, upon inquiry, the court is satisfied that its sister court properly exercised * * * in -4- personam jurisdiction.” Maryland Central Collection Unit v. Board of Regents for Education of the University of Rhode Island, 529 A.2d 144, 152-53 (R.I. 1987) (emphasis added). In the case before us, defendants have failed to overcome their heavy evidentiary burden to defeat Minnesota’s exercise of personal jurisdiction. In determining whether the Minnesota District Court appropriately exercised jurisdiction in this case, we look to Minnesota law. 6 The Minnesota long-arm statute confers jurisdiction over nonresident individuals and foreign corporations, if the nonresident defendant “commits any act outside Minnesota causing injury or property damage in Minnesota * * *.” Minn.Stat.Ann. § 543.19 subd.1(4) (West 2008) (conferring jurisdiction over nonresidents, subject to exceptions inapplicable here). The Minnesota courts have interpreted the state’s long-arm statute to extend the state’s personal jurisdiction to the limits of the Due Process Clause of the federal constitution. State ex rel. Humphrey v. Granite Gate Resorts, Inc., 568 N.W.2d 715, 718 (Minn. Ct. App. 1997); Valspar Corp. v. Lukken Color Corp., 495 N.W.2d 408, 410 (Minn. 1992). “[D]ue process requires that a nonresident defendant have ‘certain minimum contacts with [the forum state] such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend ‘traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.’” V.H. v. Estate of Birnbaum, 543 N.W.2d 649, 656 (Minn. 1996) (quoting International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945)). To establish minimum contacts with Minnesota, a nonresident defendant must purposefully avail itself of the privilege of conducting activities within Minnesota, “such 6 The parties also have acknowledged in their briefs that Minnesota law governs the issue of personal jurisdiction. -5- that [it] should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.” Id. at 656-57 (quoting Larson v. Dunn, 460 N.W.2d 39, 44 (Minn. 1990)). There is, however, a distinction between general and specific in personam jurisdiction. Marshall v. Inn on Madeline Island, 610 N.W.2d 670, 674 (Minn. Ct. App. 2000) (citing Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S.A. v. Hall, 466 U.S. 408, 414nn 8- 9 (1984)). “General jurisdiction arises when a defendant has ‘continuous and systematic’ contacts with the forum state.” Id. (quoting Helicopteros Nacionales, 466 U.S. at 415- 16). “Specific jurisdiction exists when the cause of action arises out of or is related to the defendant’s contacts with the forum.” Id. (citing Helicopteros Nacionales, 466 U.S. at 414n.8). Although LUVRAJ’s customer list included approximately 120 Minnesota residents, comprising approximately 2 percent of its total active customers, we question whether this number amounts to “continuous and systematic” contacts within Minnesota such that the state could exercise general in personam jurisdiction over defendants. However, because the cause of action in the case at bar arose from defendants’ contacts with Minnesota and related to the sale of the internet-based business, we are satisfied that these contacts support the exercise of specific in personam jurisdiction over these defendants by the Minnesota court. Minnesota’s Five-Factor Jurisdiction Test Minnesota consistently employs a five-factor test to determine whether the state has personal jurisdiction over a nonresident party. 7 Estate of Birnbaum, 543 N.W.2d at 7 In a series of cases, Minnesota has specifically examined each factor seriatim; we shall do likewise. See, e.g., Juelich v. Yamazaki Mazak Optonics Corp., 682 N.W.2d 565, 573 (Minn. 2004); Marshall v. Inn on Madeline Island, 610 N.W.2d 670, 674 (Minn. Ct. App. 2000); State ex rel. Humphrey v. Granite Gate Resorts, Inc., 568 N.W.2d 715, 718 (Minn. Ct. App. 1997). -6- 657; see also Marshall, 610 N.W.2d at 674; Granite Gate Resorts, Inc., 568 N.W.2d at 718. This inquiry centers on: “(1) the quantity of the defendant’s contacts; (2) the nature and quality of the defendant’s contacts; (3) the connection between the cause of action and the defendant’s contacts; (4) the state’s interest in providing a forum; and (5) the convenience of the parties.” Granite Gate Resorts, Inc., 568 N.W.2d at 718. Minnesota case law demonstrates that these quantitive and qualitative factors and their relationship to the cause of action largely control the analysis. “Any doubt regarding the sufficiency of contacts to support the exercise of personal jurisdiction should be resolved in favor of finding jurisdiction.” Marshall, 610 N.W.2d at 674; see also Dent-Air, Inc. v. Beech Mountain Air Service, Inc., 332 N.W.2d 904, 907 (Minn. 1983). We will address each factor in turn; that is, quantity, quality, connection with the claim, as well as the forum state’s interest and the parties’ convenience. 1. Quantity of Contacts The number of contacts by defendants with the forum state with respect to the subject of the suit or otherwise is the first point of inquiry. In the case at bar, defendants’ numerous contacts with Minnesota, through product sales, advertisements, and negotiations with plaintiff concerning the sale of the business, support a finding of personal jurisdiction. The Minnesota Court of Appeals previously has held that a sufficient number of contacts to establish personal jurisdiction arose when persons in Minnesota called a nonresident defendant to inquire about the defendant’s internet gambling website. Granite Gate Resorts, Inc., 568 N.W.2d at 717, 718 (acknowledging that a Minnesota consumer investigator dialed nonresident defendant’s toll-free phone number). The court -7- also noted that the mailing list of the nonresident defendant’s gambling website included the name and address of at least one Minnesota resident, and that Minnesota residents accessed defendant’s website from computers located in Minnesota. See id. at 718-19. A few years later, the same court recognized that a nonresident defendant engaged in interstate contract negotiations, submitted to Minnesota’s jurisdiction, in part, due to his numerous contacts with resident customers. See Viking Engineering & Development, Inc. v. R.S.B. Enterprises, Inc., 608 N.W.2d 166, 170 (Minn. Ct. App. 2000). In Viking Engineering & Development, Inc., a case similar to the present controversy, the defendant never physically entered Minnesota, but his multiple phone calls and faxes to the Minnesota residents to promote his businesses’s products solidified the court’s decision that it had proper jurisdiction over the defendant. Id. The fact that the defendant actively engaged in interstate contract negotiations with the plaintiff “constituted specific business activity” to satisfy the Due Process Clause. Id. Additionally, the Minnesota Supreme Court has held that Minnesota was the proper jurisdiction of a nonresident defendant who had a “plethora of indirect contacts” with its residents. Rostad v. On- Deck, Inc., 372 N.W.2d 717, 721 (Minn. 1985). The court recognized that the defendant’s marketing efforts, which were calculated at advertising to a nationwide audience, included “numerous contacts” with Minnesota residents through its distributors. Id. In the case at bar, plaintiff, a Minnesota resident, called the nonresident defendants to inquire about defendants’ internet advertisement about the puzzle business. The plaintiff and nonresident defendants also exchanged approximately 100 emails, telephone calls, and letters. Additionally, defendants’ customer list included the names -8- and addresses of 120 Minnesota residents that constituted approximately 2 percent of defendants’ active customers. We conclude that defendants’ contacts with Minnesota are sufficient to satisfy the quantity of contacts factor for personal jurisdiction. 2. Nature and Quality of Contacts The second factor involves the nature and quality of the contacts between the parties. The nature of contact in this case – solicitation of business in the forum state – supports Minnesota’s exercise of personal jurisdiction. Even in cases in which the quantity may be lacking, the nature and quality of the contacts, although few, nonetheless can be dispositive. Granite Gate Resorts, Inc., 568 N.W.2d at 719; see also Trident Enterprises International, Inc. v. Kemp & George, Inc., 502 N.W.2d 411, 415 (Minn. Ct. App. 1993). In Marshall, 610 N.W.2d at 673-74, a nonresident corporation owned an out-of-state vacation property that it leased to the public, including many Minnesota residents. Referring to this second factor, the quality of the contacts, the Minnesota Court of Appeals noted that there is a distinction between nonresident sellers of goods to Minnesota residents and nonresident purchasers of goods from Minnesota residents. Id. at 675 (recognizing that there is a higher quality to the acts of nonresidents that reach into Minnesota to do business). The court in Marshall also noted that, “[j]urisdiction may be proper when a nonresident’s contacts are directed at attaining a commercial benefit in Minnesota.” Id. (concluding that jurisdiction was proper because defendant directly solicited and sold goods to Minnesota residents). Furthermore, the Minnesota Court of Appeals established that nonresident defendants who know that their messages will be broadcasted in the state are subject to suit in Minnesota. Granite Gate Resorts, Inc., 568 -9- N.W.2d at 719-20 (acknowledging that radio and television advertisements confer jurisdiction and equating internet advertisements similar thereto). In the case at bar, defendants sold goods to 120 Minnesota residents, thus, obtaining a commercial benefit in Minnesota. Although this number represents only approximately 2 percent of the business’s active customers, defendants also advertised the sale of the business to Minnesota residents, intending to solicit potential buyers. When defendants placed the internet advertisement, they knew that the advertisement would be broadcasted to all fifty states including Minnesota, viewed by residents of Minnesota, and accessible by computers in Minnesota. Accordingly, we are of the opinion that the nature and quality of defendants’ contacts with Minnesota supports the assertion of personal jurisdiction. 3. Connection Between Cause of Action and Contacts The third factor is whether the cause of action stems from the nonresident’s contact with the state. Here, defendants’ contacts and interactions with Minnesota residents substantially relate to plaintiff’s cause of action and supports Minnesota’s exercise of jurisdiction over defendants. The Minnesota Court of Appeals stated that a nonresident who enters into a contract with a Minnesota resident would be subject to Minnesota’s jurisdiction if the cause of action involves the contract. Marshall, 610 N.W.2d at 674, 676 (noting that “entering into a contract with a Minnesota resident can justify the exercise of [personal] jurisdiction but only where the dispute involves the contract”). The case at bar involves allegations of breach of contract, misrepresentation, and fraud. All plaintiff’s allegations stem from the information contained in the emails, - 10 - telephone calls, and letters sent to and from Minnesota between nonresident defendants and plaintiff to negotiate the terms of the sale. Clearly, plaintiff’s cause of action arises from defendants’ assertions and misrepresentations about the sale of the business that is the subject of the Minnesota lawsuit. We need go no further concerning this factor. 4. State’s Interest The fourth factor pertains to Minnesota’s interest in adjudicating the case within its judicial system. This factor, although secondary to the first three factors, also weighs in favor of Minnesota’s assertion of jurisdiction over defendants. See Granite Gate Resorts, Inc., 568 N.W.2d at 721 (noting this factor alone cannot confer jurisdiction, but it can support jurisdiction in light of the other three factors). There is no doubt that Minnesota has a strong interest in providing its citizens with a forum to seek redress from alleged wrongful conduct. Marshall, 610 N.W.2d at 676; Estate of Birnbaum, 543 N.W.2d at 658 (noting that Minnesota has a legitimate interest in providing forums for its citizens to address tortious conduct). In the case at bar, nonresident defendants were alleged to have committed tortious acts against plaintiff, a Minnesota citizen, relating to the sales contract. These alleged tortious misrepresentations should have put defendants on notice that they could be subject to suit in Minnesota. 5. Convenience of Parties The fifth factor concerns the convenience of the parties and the burden of having to litigate the case in Minnesota. The Minnesota Supreme Court has held that, the convenience of the parties is “of minor interest” compared with the other factors. Rostad, 372 N.W.2d at 722. Although we recognize that it may not be ideal for a Rhode Island resident and president of a Massachusetts limited liability corporation to litigate a case in - 11 - Minnesota, this factor does not alter our conclusion that Minnesota properly exercised jurisdiction over defendants in this case. See Granite Gate Resorts, Inc., 568 N.W.2d at 721 (noting that nonresident defendants cannot claim inconvenience as an excuse to avoid personal jurisdiction, particularly since Minnesota has an interest in regulating advertisements). Choice-of-Law Provision Additionally, it is undisputed that defendants agreed to a choice-of-law clause in the contract, which requires that the contract would be governed by and enforced in accordance with Minnesota law. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, applying Minnesota law, previously has held that choice-of-law clauses are an important factor in determining whether nonresidents avail themselves to the jurisdiction of the forum state. Wessels, Arnold, & Henderson v. National Medical Waste, Inc., 65 F.3d 1427, 1434 (8th Cir. 1995); see also Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 482 (1985) (recognizing that there is no reason to ignore the defendant’s consent to choice-of-law provisions when deciding proper jurisdiction). In Wessels, the Eighth Circuit held that the freely negotiated choice-of-law law provision, combined with the nonresident defendant’s mail and telephone contacts into Minnesota, were both relevant and significant in the court’s determination that Minnesota properly asserted personal jurisdiction over the nonresident defendant. Wessels, 65 F.3d at 1434. In the case at bar, defendants acknowledged and signed a contract that clearly states that Minnesota law governs and controls the contract that is the subject of this dispute. Although standing alone, this provision could not confer jurisdiction on the Minnesota courts, the choice-of-law clause taken together with defendants’ emails, - 12 - telephone calls, and letters with a Minnesota plaintiff, weigh in favor of Minnesota asserting personal jurisdiction over the nonresident defendants. Conclusion The defendants have not made a sufficient showing to justify why the courts of this state should not accord full faith and credit to the Minnesota judgment. It was reasonable for the defendants to be sued in Minnesota, and we decline to interfere with this properly entered default judgment from our sister-state. We note that the only involvement Rhode Island has in this case is the happenstance of the defendants relocating here after the transaction was consummated. For the reasons stated in this opinion, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed. The record may be remanded to the Superior Court. - 13 - Supreme Court No. 2008-270-Appeal.

The plaintiff notified defendants of these concerns in February 2006. In a March 2006 letter, defendants denied the allegations and further declared that they would not defend a lawsuit in Minnesota because the Minnesota courts lacked in personam jurisdiction over them. Nonetheless, on April 10, 2006, plaintiff filed suit in the Minnesota District Court, 1', 'According to the Massachusetts Secretary of State’s records, prior to the sale, LUVRAJ, LLC, was a Massachusetts limited liability company. According to the Rhode Island Secretary of State’s records, after the sale, but before the lawsuit, LUVRAJ, LLC, was registered in Rhode Island as a foreign limited liability company. 2', 'Article XI provides that, “[t]his Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws * * * of the State of Minnesota.”', '-2- alleging breach of contract, misrepresentation, and fraud; additionally, plaintiff asked that the contract be rescinded. The defendant LUVRAJ, LLC, which since had registered as a foreign limited liability company in Rhode Island, and Chadha, who also moved to Rhode Island, were served with the complaint, but did not answer or make an appearance in Minnesota. 3 As a result, on August 28, 2006, the Minnesota District Court, having concluded that it had jurisdiction over the parties and the subject-matter, entered judgment against defendants for $100,878. The court further found that the fair market value of the business was zero, and that defendants’ actions constituted breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, and fraud.', 'In November 2006, plaintiff sought to enforce the Minnesota judgment in Rhode Island by filing the judgment in accordance with the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act. 4 The defendants unsuccessfully argued to the Superior Court that the judgment was unenforceable because the Minnesota District Court lacked personal jurisdiction. 5 On May 20, 2008, the hearing justice issued a bench decision, noting that Minnesota properly had exercised its jurisdiction over the case and defendants. The hearing justice noted that defendants sold their products to 120 Minnesota customers, engaged in approximately 100 communications with plaintiff about the sale, and 3', 'On June 26, 2006, plaintiff properly served process on defendants in Providence, Rhode Island. 4', 'General Laws 1956 § 9-32-2 provides that, “[a] copy of any foreign judgment * * * may be filed in the office of the clerk of the appropriate superior or district court. The clerk shall treat the foreign judgment in the same manner as a judgment of the superior or district court.” 5', 'The defendants’ arguments included the contention that the business sale was an improper contact for Minnesota to exercise jurisdiction, the contention that the choice-of- law clause had no place in the court’s inquiry, the fact that only 2 percent of its customers included Minnesota residents, and the fact that the contract was not signed in Minnesota.', '-3- voluntarily agreed that Minnesota law would govern the sales contract. The hearing justice further noted that defendants’ negotiations with plaintiff in Minnesota were actions directed at obtaining a commercial benefit in Minnesota and that defendants’ alleged fraudulent and misleading statements should have placed them on notice that they could be sued in Minnesota. This timely appeal followed. We affirm.', 'Standard of Review', 'We undertake our analysis mindful that, “[i]f a defendant fails to appear after having been served with a complaint filed against him in another state and a default judgment is entered, he may ‘defeat subsequent enforcement in another forum’ by showing that the judgment was ‘issued from a court lacking personal jurisdiction.’” C&J Leasing Corp. v. Paolino, 721 A.2d 839, 841 (R.I. 1998) (quoting Video Products Distributors, Inc. v. Kilsey, 682 A.2d 1381, 1382 (R.I. 1996)). This course of action is not without risk, however, because the defendant has a heavy burden in seeking to overturn a default judgment; and, if the jurisdictional challenge fails, then the default becomes as final and determinative on the merits as a judgment entered after a full trial. Video Products Distributors, Inc., 682 A.2d at 1382. Additionally, this Court will apply a de novo standard of review to questions of law that may implicate a constitutional right. Pierce v. Wall, 941 A.2d 189, 192 (R.I. 2008); State v.

Board of Regents for Education of the University of Rhode Island, 529 A.2d 144, 152-53 (R.I. 1987) (emphasis added). In the case before us, defendants have failed to overcome their heavy evidentiary burden to defeat Minnesota’s exercise of personal jurisdiction.', 'In determining whether the Minnesota District Court appropriately exercised jurisdiction in this case, we look to Minnesota law. 6 The Minnesota long-arm statute confers jurisdiction over nonresident individuals and foreign corporations, if the nonresident defendant “commits any act outside Minnesota causing injury or property damage in Minnesota * * *.”', 'Minn.Stat.Ann. § 543.19 subd.1(4) (West 2008) (conferring jurisdiction over nonresidents, subject to exceptions inapplicable here). The Minnesota courts have interpreted the state’s long-arm statute to extend the state’s personal jurisdiction to the limits of the Due Process Clause of the federal constitution. State ex rel.

App. 2000) (citing Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S.A. v.

(citing Helicopteros Nacionales, 466 U.S. at 414n.8).', 'Although LUVRAJ’s customer list included approximately 120 Minnesota residents, comprising approximately 2 percent of its total active customers, we question whether this number amounts to “continuous and systematic” contacts within Minnesota such that the state could exercise general in personam jurisdiction over defendants. However, because the cause of action in the case at bar arose from defendants’ contacts with Minnesota and related to the sale of the internet-based business, we are satisfied that these contacts support the exercise of specific in personam jurisdiction over these defendants by the Minnesota court.', 'Minnesota’s Five-Factor Jurisdiction Test', 'Minnesota consistently employs a five-factor test to determine whether the state has personal jurisdiction over a nonresident party. 7 Estate of Birnbaum, 543 N.W.2d at 7', 'In a series of cases, Minnesota has specifically examined each factor seriatim; we shall do likewise. See, e.g., Juelich v. Yamazaki Mazak Optonics Corp., 682 N.W.2d 565, 573 (Minn. 2004); Marshall v. Inn on Madeline Island, 610 N.W.2d 670, 674 (Minn. Ct. App. 2000); State ex rel. Humphrey v. Granite Gate Resorts, Inc., 568 N.W.2d 715, 718 (Minn. Ct. App. 1997).', '-6- 657; see also Marshall, 610 N.W.2d at 674; Granite Gate Resorts, Inc., 568 N.W.2d at 718. This inquiry centers on: “(1) the quantity of the defendant’s contacts; (2) the nature and quality of the defendant’s contacts; (3) the connection between the cause of action and the defendant’s contacts; (4) the state’s interest in providing a forum; and (5) the convenience of the parties.” Granite Gate Resorts, Inc., 568 N.W.2d at 718. Minnesota case law demonstrates that these quantitive and qualitative factors and their relationship to the cause of action largely control the analysis. “Any doubt regarding the sufficiency of contacts to support the exercise of personal jurisdiction should be resolved in favor of finding jurisdiction.” Marshall, 610 N.W.2d at 674; see also Dent-Air, Inc. v. Beech Mountain Air Service, Inc., 332 N.W.2d 904, 907 (Minn. 1983). We will address each factor in turn; that is, quantity, quality, connection with the claim, as well as the forum state’s interest and the parties’ convenience.', '1. Quantity of Contacts', 'The number of contacts by defendants with the forum state with respect to the subject of the suit or otherwise is the first point of inquiry. In the case at bar, defendants’ numerous contacts with Minnesota, through product sales, advertisements, and negotiations with plaintiff concerning the sale of the business, support a finding of personal jurisdiction.', 'The Minnesota Court of Appeals previously has held that a sufficient number of contacts to establish personal jurisdiction arose when persons in Minnesota called a nonresident defendant to inquire about the defendant’s internet gambling website. Granite Gate Resorts, Inc., 568 N.W.2d at 717, 718 (acknowledging that a Minnesota consumer investigator dialed nonresident defendant’s toll-free phone number). The court', '-7- also noted that the mailing list of the nonresident defendant’s gambling website included the name and address of at least one Minnesota resident, and that Minnesota residents accessed defendant’s website from computers located in Minnesota. See id. at 718-19. A few years later, the same court recognized that a nonresident defendant engaged in interstate contract negotiations, submitted to Minnesota’s jurisdiction, in part, due to his numerous contacts with resident customers. See Viking Engineering & Development, Inc. v. R.S.B. Enterprises, Inc., 608 N.W.2d 166, 170 (Minn. Ct. App. 2000). In Viking Engineering & Development, Inc., a case similar to the present controversy, the defendant never physically entered Minnesota, but his multiple phone calls and faxes to the Minnesota residents to promote his businesses’s products solidified the court’s decision that it had proper jurisdiction over the defendant. Id. The fact that the defendant actively engaged in interstate contract negotiations with the plaintiff “constituted specific business activity” to satisfy the Due Process Clause. Id. Additionally, the Minnesota Supreme Court has held that Minnesota was the proper jurisdiction of a nonresident defendant who had a “plethora of indirect contacts” with its residents. Rostad v. On- Deck, Inc., 372 N.W.2d 717, 721 (Minn. 1985).', 'The court recognized that the defendant’s marketing efforts, which were calculated at advertising to a nationwide audience, included “numerous contacts” with Minnesota residents through its distributors. Id.', 'In the case at bar, plaintiff, a Minnesota resident, called the nonresident defendants to inquire about defendants’ internet advertisement about the puzzle business. The plaintiff and nonresident defendants also exchanged approximately 100 emails, telephone calls, and letters. Additionally, defendants’ customer list included the names', '-8- and addresses of 120 Minnesota residents that constituted approximately 2 percent of defendants’ active customers. We conclude that defendants’ contacts with Minnesota are sufficient to satisfy the quantity of contacts factor for personal jurisdiction.', '2. Nature and Quality of Contacts', 'The second factor involves the nature and quality of the contacts between the parties. The nature of contact in this case – solicitation of business in the forum state – supports Minnesota’s exercise of personal jurisdiction. Even in cases in which the quantity may be lacking, the nature and quality of the contacts, although few, nonetheless can be dispositive. Granite Gate Resorts, Inc., 568 N.W.2d at 719; see also Trident Enterprises International, Inc. v. Kemp & George, Inc., 502 N.W.2d 411, 415 (Minn. Ct. App. 1993). In Marshall, 610 N.W.2d at 673-74, a nonresident corporation owned an out-of-state vacation property that it leased to the public, including many Minnesota residents. Referring to this second factor, the quality of the contacts, the Minnesota Court of Appeals noted that there is a distinction between nonresident sellers of goods to Minnesota residents and nonresident purchasers of goods from Minnesota residents. Id. at 675 (recognizing that there is a higher quality to the acts of nonresidents that reach into Minnesota to do business). The court in Marshall also noted that, “[j]urisdiction may be proper when a nonresident’s contacts are directed at attaining a commercial benefit in Minnesota.” Id. (concluding that jurisdiction was proper because defendant directly solicited and sold goods to Minnesota residents). Furthermore, the Minnesota Court of Appeals established that nonresident defendants who know that their messages will be broadcasted in the state are subject to suit in Minnesota. Granite Gate Resorts, Inc., 568', '-9- N.W.2d at 719-20 (acknowledging that radio and television advertisements confer jurisdiction and equating internet advertisements similar thereto).', 'In the case at bar, defendants sold goods to 120 Minnesota residents, thus, obtaining a commercial benefit in Minnesota. Although this number represents only approximately 2 percent of the business’s active customers, defendants also advertised the sale of the business to Minnesota residents, intending to solicit potential buyers. When defendants placed the internet advertisement, they knew that the advertisement would be broadcasted to all fifty states including Minnesota, viewed by residents of Minnesota, and accessible by computers in Minnesota. Accordingly, we are of the opinion that the nature and quality of defendants’ contacts with Minnesota supports the assertion of personal jurisdiction.', '3. Connection Between Cause of Action and Contacts', 'The third factor is whether the cause of action stems from the nonresident’s contact with the state.', 'Here, defendants’ contacts and interactions with Minnesota residents substantially relate to plaintiff’s cause of action and supports Minnesota’s exercise of jurisdiction over defendants. The Minnesota Court of Appeals stated that a nonresident who enters into a contract with a Minnesota resident would be subject to Minnesota’s jurisdiction if the cause of action involves the contract. Marshall, 610 N.W.2d at 674, 676 (noting that “entering into a contract with a Minnesota resident can justify the exercise of [personal] jurisdiction but only where the dispute involves the contract”).', 'The case at bar involves allegations of breach of contract, misrepresentation, and fraud. All plaintiff’s allegations stem from the information contained in the emails,', '- 10 - telephone calls, and letters sent to and from Minnesota between nonresident defendants and plaintiff to negotiate the terms of the sale. Clearly, plaintiff’s cause of action arises from defendants’ assertions and misrepresentations about the sale of the business that is the subject of the Minnesota lawsuit. We need go no further concerning this factor.', '4. State’s Interest', 'The fourth factor pertains to Minnesota’s interest in adjudicating the case within its judicial system. This factor, although secondary to the first three factors, also weighs in favor of Minnesota’s assertion of jurisdiction over defendants. See Granite Gate Resorts, Inc., 568 N.W.2d at 721 (noting this factor alone cannot confer jurisdiction, but it can support jurisdiction in light of the other three factors). There is no doubt that Minnesota has a strong interest in providing its citizens with a forum to seek redress from alleged wrongful conduct.', 'Marshall, 610 N.W.2d at 676; Estate of Birnbaum, 543 N.W.2d at 658 (noting that Minnesota has a legitimate interest in providing forums for its citizens to address tortious conduct). In the case at bar, nonresident defendants were alleged to have committed tortious acts against plaintiff, a Minnesota citizen, relating to the sales contract. These alleged tortious misrepresentations should have put defendants on notice that they could be subject to suit in Minnesota.', '5. Convenience of Parties', 'The fifth factor concerns the convenience of the parties and the burden of having to litigate the case in Minnesota. The Minnesota Supreme Court has held that, the convenience of the parties is “of minor interest” compared with the other factors. Rostad, 372 N.W.2d at 722. Although we recognize that it may not be ideal for a Rhode Island resident and president of a Massachusetts limited liability corporation to litigate a case in', '- 11 - Minnesota, this factor does not alter our conclusion that Minnesota properly exercised jurisdiction over defendants in this case. See Granite Gate Resorts, Inc., 568 N.W.2d at 721 (noting that nonresident defendants cannot claim inconvenience as an excuse to avoid personal jurisdiction, particularly since Minnesota has an interest in regulating advertisements).', 'Choice-of-Law Provision', 'Additionally, it is undisputed that defendants agreed to a choice-of-law clause in the contract, which requires that the contract would be governed by and enforced in accordance with Minnesota law. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, applying Minnesota law, previously has held that choice-of-law clauses are an important factor in determining whether nonresidents avail themselves to the jurisdiction of the forum state. Wessels, Arnold, & Henderson v. National Medical Waste, Inc., 65 F.3d 1427, 1434 (8th Cir. 1995); see also Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 482 (1985) (recognizing that there is no reason to ignore the defendant’s consent to choice-of-law provisions when deciding proper jurisdiction). In Wessels, the Eighth Circuit held that the freely negotiated choice-of-law law provision, combined with the nonresident defendant’s mail and telephone contacts into Minnesota, were both relevant and significant in the court’s determination that Minnesota properly asserted personal jurisdiction over the nonresident defendant. Wessels, 65 F.3d at 1434.', 'In the case at bar, defendants acknowledged and signed a contract that clearly states that Minnesota law governs and controls the contract that is the subject of this dispute. Although standing alone, this provision could not confer jurisdiction on the Minnesota courts, the choice-of-law clause taken together with defendants’ emails,', '- 12 - telephone calls, and letters with a Minnesota plaintiff, weigh in favor of Minnesota asserting personal jurisdiction over the nonresident defendants.', 'Conclusion', 'The defendants have not made a sufficient showing to justify why the courts of this state should not accord full faith and credit to the Minnesota judgment. It was reasonable for the defendants to be sued in Minnesota, and we decline to interfere with this properly entered default judgment from our sister-state. We note that the only involvement Rhode Island has in this case is the happenstance of the defendants relocating here after the transaction was consummated.', 'For the reasons stated in this opinion, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.

71,"State : v. : Gary Letts. : Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty, and Robinson, JJ. OPINION Justice Flaherty, for the Court. Gary Letts appeals from a misdemeanor conviction for obtaining money by false pretenses. The conviction arises from a paving contract entered into on May 5, 2003, between Letts and Luis and Barbara Aponte. The parties appeared for oral argument on December 2, 2009, pursuant to an order of this Court ordering them to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided without further briefing or argument. After considering the record, the memoranda submitted by the parties, and the oral arguments advanced by each, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that the case should be decided at this time. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the Superior Court’s judgment of conviction. -1- I Facts and Travel In May 2003, Luis and Barbara Aponte decided to have their driveway widened and repaved. 1 The defendant Gary Letts, a longtime paving contractor, met with the Apontes, and their meeting resulted in a written contract dated May 5, 2003. 2 On May 8, 2003, Barbara wrote a $400 check to Letts as a deposit, which he accepted and deposited. At trial, Luis Aponte, Barbara Aponte, and Letts gave divergent accounts of when the contractual performance was to occur. There seems to be little disagreement that during the May 2003 meeting, the Apontes told Letts that they would be vacationing between May 17 and May 26 and that they would return home on May 27. Letts handwrote in the contract’s upper left side “Leave” and then “May 17-26” and then wrote the number 27, which he circled. Barbara Aponte said that she expected the work to begin about May 27, and in her view the circled 27 reflected that understanding. On October 22, 2003, her driveway still unpaved, Barbara sent a letter to Letts in which she wrote that she had expected the work to be done “on or about May 27.” In that correspondence she also demanded the return of her deposit. In his testimony at trial, Luis Aponte said that Letts was to pave his driveway sometime in late June or early July, but upon being directed to the circled 27 in the contract, he remembered that he expected the performance to start on May 27 or within a reasonable time thereafter. Conversely, Letts said that he circled the number 27 for his own purposes, as a reminder that he should not pave the Apontes’ driveway until at least May 27, because the Apontes would be away until that date. Letts also indicated that if he were to specify a particular performance 1 At the time, Luis and Barbara were not married but lived together and shared expenses, and they also maintained a checking account. They subsequently were married. 2 Luis also had received quotes from other pavers, but chose Letts because he was impressed both by Letts’s presentation and his lower price. -2- date, something that he rarely did, he would have followed his normal practice and indicated it on the bottom of the contract, not in the upper left. At all times, Letts asserted that he intended to fulfill his contractual obligations to the Apontes. After the Apontes returned from vacation in late May, they contacted Letts and asked him when he would start the work at their home. Initially, Letts responded to the Apontes’ phone calls; he told them that he was delayed because of rain, but he would start the job shortly. But by mid-June, Letts stopped taking the Apontes’ calls. Barbara Aponte complained to the chief of the contractors’ board, 3 but she did not institute any formal proceedings against Letts in that forum. It is undisputed that Letts never paved the Apontes’ driveway, nor did he return their deposit. 4 At the time of these incidents, Letts had been in the asphalt paving business for over twenty-five years. He owned and operated Atlantic Letts Company. 5 There is little question that the paving business is both seasonal and affected by the weather. Asphalt plants close during the cold weather months, and even after they reopen in the spring, paving cannot be done properly in wet conditions. Because of these factors, Letts said that he usually provided clients with estimated dates that he would begin paving on their property. By May 2003, Letts said that he had a backlog of at least fifty jobs. He also testified that under favorable weather conditions, he could complete about ten jobs per week or thirty-five to forty jobs per month. Letts said that unfortunately, the weather between March and May 2003 was frequently rainy, with only intermittent periods of dry conditions. 3 General Laws 1956 chapter 65 of title 5 provides for the types of registration of contractors. This chapter also creates a board, known as the contractors’ board, to address disputes between contractors and clients, and it establishes claims that may be brought against contractors before the board. 4 After his conviction, Letts returned the Apontes’ $400 deposit. 5 Atlantic employed six people, including Letts, an office manager, and four pavers. -3- In November 2003, after the Apontes filed a complaint, Letts was arraigned in District Court for the misdemeanor offense of obtaining money by false pretenses in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-41-4. On February 24, 2004, Letts’s District Court offense was transferred from the District Court to the Superior Court. There it was consolidated with two felony offenses of obtaining money by false pretenses against Letts. 6 A nonjury trial was held on November 8 and 9, 2006. The state offered the testimony of Luis and Barbara Aponte, as well as two former clients of Letts who were the complaining witnesses in the two felony counts against Letts. The defendant testified on his own behalf and he also produced two witnesses who testified that they were former clients who contracted with him in May or June 2003 for paving work and that Letts ultimately completed these paving jobs in September or October 2003. On December 4, 2006, the trial justice found Letts guilty of the misdemeanor count of obtaining money by false pretenses. Letts received a one-year suspended sentence and a one- year period of probation. He timely appealed his misdemeanor conviction to this Court. 6 Between March 14 and 16, 2003, Letts entered into a written contract with David Pezzullo for the paving of Pezzullo’s driveway; Pezzullo paid Letts a $2,400 deposit. Their written contract was silent as to when Letts’s performance was to occur. Letts said that he told Pezzullo that he would not be able to start the job for at least five to six weeks and that he would call Pezzullo when he knew his schedule; Pezzullo claimed that Letts represented to him that the paving would be done in April. Also in late March 2003, Letts entered into a written contract with Thomas and Laurie Rossi for the paving of their driveway; the Rossis gave Letts a deposit check of $1,325. Thomas Rossi said that Letts told him that he would begin work toward the end of April or early May. Again the written contract was silent about when performance was to begin. Ultimately, Letts did not pave either the Rossi or Pezzullo driveway, and felony criminal charges were filed. After the consolidated trial, the trial justice found Letts not guilty on the two felony charges. -4- II Issue on Appeal On appeal, Letts raises the argument “that the evidence adduced at this trial does not support the conclusion that [he] received the Aponte’s $400 deposit in May of 2003 * * * with the intent to cheat or defraud them.” He contends that the trial justice both misconceived the evidence and drew unreasonable inferences from it. Specifically, Letts argues that the trial justice erroneously found that he was aware of certain personnel and equipment problems as of May 5, 2003, when he entered the contract with the Apontes and accepted their check. Letts further argues that the trial justice incorrectly found that the circled 27 on the contract indicated a time for performance of his obligations under the paving contract. Lastly, Letts contends that the trial justice’s conclusion that Letts accepted the $400 deposit in an effort “to fund his then ‘floundering’ business” was in error because it is “merely unsubstantiated speculation.” III Standard of Review “In a jury-waived criminal proceeding, this Court gives deference to a trial justice’s finding of facts.” State v. Forand, 958 A.2d 134, 138 (R.I. 2008) (citing State v. Harris, 871 A.2d 341, 346 (R.I. 2005) and Barone v. Cotroneo, 711 A.2d 648, 649 (R.I. 1998) (mem.)). This Court will not overturn a trial justice’s finding of facts “unless it can be shown that he or she overlooked or misconceived relevant and material evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.” State v. Silvia, 798 A.2d 419, 424 (R.I. 2002) (quoting State v. Traficante, 636 A.2d 692, 694 (R.I. 1994)). The trial justice is not required to provide “an exhaustive analysis of the evidence or a specific statement of all the reasons for his conclusion.” State v. Aurgemma, 116 R.I. 425, 436, 358 A.2d 46, 52 (1976). Under this standard, “our role is ‘to review the record carefully to -5- see if it in fact contains sufficient evidence to support the trial justice’s conclusion.’” Forand, 958 A.2d at 138 (quoting Harris, 871 A.2d at 346). IV Analysis Section 11-41-4 provides that “[e]very person who shall obtain from another designedly, by any false pretense or pretenses, any money, goods, wares, or other property, with intent to cheat or defraud, * * * shall be deemed guilty of larceny.” “[T]he essential elements of obtaining property by false pretenses are that the accused (1) obtain property from another designedly, by any false pretense or pretenses; and (2) with the intent to cheat or defraud.” State v. Markarian, 551 A.2d 1178, 1180 (R.I. 1988). A False Pretense(s) Under the statute, a false pretense may be a misrepresentation of a past or existing fact. Aurgemma, 116 R.I. at 430-31, 358 A.2d at 49-50. A promise to perform a future act may also constitute a false pretense. Id. at 431, 358 A.2d at 50. “[I]n an action for deceit intention not to meet a future obligation is a question of fact to be submitted to the jury and that misrepresentation of a present state of mind as to such intention is a false representation of an existing fact.” Id. (quoting State v. McMahon, 49 R.I. 107, 108-09, 140 A. 359, 360 (1928)). Therefore, “the rule in this state is that a misrepresentation with regard to a future transaction, no less than one relating to an existing fact, is a false pretense within the meaning of § 11-41-4.” Aurgemma, 116 R.I. at 431, 358 A.2d at 50 (emphases in original). In his bench decision, the trial justice found as a fact that on May 5, 2003, “defendant was well aware of his predicament, continuing bad weather and personnel and equipment -6- problems, that had put him in a position that a very experienced paving contractor had to recognize. That is, he could not possibly perform paving work for any new customers, including the Apontes, at that point in time, and to represent otherwise was knowingly deceptive and fraudulent.” After reviewing the record, and after giving due deference to the trial justice’s factual conclusion, we hold that the trial justice did not clearly err when he found that Letts misrepresented his intention to perform his contract with the Apontes within a reasonable time of May 27, 2003. As we reiterated in Aurgemma, “intention not to meet a future obligation is a question of fact” and “misrepresentation of a present state of mind as to such intention is a false representation of an existing fact.” Aurgemma, 116 R.I. at 431, 358 A.2d at 50 (quoting McMahon, 49 R.I. at 108, 140 A. at 360). Here, the trial justice found that Letts misrepresented his intention to perform a future obligation, i.e., to perform the Aponte paving job within a reasonable time of May 27, 2003, when he entered into a contract with the Apontes on May 5, 2003. Because this was an issue of fact, we give great deference to the trial justice’s findings. Forand, 958 A.2d at 138. We cannot conclude that the trial justice’s findings of fact and his conclusion as to the first element of obtaining money by false pretenses were clearly wrong. Sufficient evidence exists in the record to support the trial justice’s conclusion that in light of the fifty-plus job backlog and the poor weather conditions at the time, Letts deliberately misrepresented his intention to perform the Apontes paving job within a reasonable time after May 27, 2003. See id. -7- B Intent to Cheat or Defraud “[T]he crime is complete when the defendant intentionally uses false pretenses to induce another to alter or terminate any of that person’s rights or powers concerning the money or property with the intent to cheat or defraud that person.” State v. Fiorenzano, 690 A.2d 857, 859 (R.I. 1997). This Court has defined an intent to defraud as “an intention to deceive another person, and to induce such other person, in reliance upon such deception, to assume, create, transfer, alter or terminate [that other person’s] * * * right, obligation or power with reference to property.” Id. (quoting State v. LaRoche, 683 A.2d 989, 996 (R.I. 1996)). Such intent can be inferred, and the only relevant time period is when the victim is “induced to part with his money or property.” Id. at 860 (quoting Aurgemma, 116 R.I. at 429-30, 358 A.2d at 49). An innocent or negligent misrepresentation is insufficient to convict; the defendant must intend to defraud. Id. The state does not have the burden to prove that the defendant intended to permanently deprive a person of his or her property. LaRoche, 683 A.2d at 997; Aurgemma, 116 R.I. at 429- 30, 358 A.2d at 49. Further, “even proof that a victim has suffered no loss whatsoever or that the money fraudulently obtained has been repaid will not suffice as a defense.” Aurgemma, 116 R.I. at 430, 358 A.2d at 49. The trial justice found that Letts’s “acceptance of a $400 deposit, knowing his bleak financial circumstances, establishes his intent to cheat and defraud the Apontes.” The evidence clearly establishes that Letts deposited the $400 check he received from Barbara Aponte. The trial justice found that Letts induced the Apontes to enter into the contract under the intentional false representation that Letts would perform his work within a reasonable time after May 27, -8- 2003, and, as discussed above, we will not disturb that finding. Similarly, it is our opinion that the trial justice did not err when he found that Letts’s “intent to cheat or defraud” was established when he accepted the $400 deposit on May 8, 2003 after intentionally using false pretenses to obtain the deposit from the Apontes. V Conclusion The judgment of conviction is affirmed. The papers in this case are remanded to the Superior Court. -9- Supreme Court No. 2007-324-C.A. (K3/04-115A) State : v. : Gary Letts.",criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. Gary Letts appeals from a misdemeanor conviction for obtaining money by false pretenses. The conviction arises from a paving contract entered into on May 5, 2003, between Letts and Luis and Barbara Aponte. The parties appeared for oral argument on December 2, 2009, pursuant to an order of this Court ordering them to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided without further briefing or argument. After considering the record, the memoranda submitted by the parties, and the oral arguments advanced by each, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that the case should be decided at this time. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the Superior Court’s judgment of conviction.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In May 2003, Luis and Barbara Aponte decided to have their driveway widened and repaved. 1 The defendant Gary Letts, a longtime paving contractor, met with the Apontes, and their meeting resulted in a written contract dated May 5, 2003. 2 On May 8, 2003, Barbara wrote a $400 check to Letts as a deposit, which he accepted and deposited.', 'At trial, Luis Aponte, Barbara Aponte, and Letts gave divergent accounts of when the contractual performance was to occur. There seems to be little disagreement that during the May 2003 meeting, the Apontes told Letts that they would be vacationing between May 17 and May 26 and that they would return home on May 27. Letts handwrote in the contract’s upper left side “Leave” and then “May 17-26” and then wrote the number 27, which he circled. Barbara Aponte said that she expected the work to begin about May 27, and in her view the circled 27 reflected that understanding.', 'On October 22, 2003, her driveway still unpaved, Barbara sent a letter to Letts in which she wrote that she had expected the work to be done “on or about May 27.” In that correspondence she also demanded the return of her deposit. In his testimony at trial, Luis Aponte said that Letts was to pave his driveway sometime in late June or early July, but upon being directed to the circled 27 in the contract, he remembered that he expected the performance to start on May 27 or within a reasonable time thereafter.', 'Conversely, Letts said that he circled the number 27 for his own purposes, as a reminder that he should not pave the Apontes’ driveway until at least May 27, because the Apontes would be away until that date. Letts also indicated that if he were to specify a particular performance 1', 'At the time, Luis and Barbara were not married but lived together and shared expenses, and they also maintained a checking account. They subsequently were married. 2', 'Luis also had received quotes from other pavers, but chose Letts because he was impressed both by Letts’s presentation and his lower price.', '-2- date, something that he rarely did, he would have followed his normal practice and indicated it on the bottom of the contract, not in the upper left. At all times, Letts asserted that he intended to fulfill his contractual obligations to the Apontes.', 'After the Apontes returned from vacation in late May, they contacted Letts and asked him when he would start the work at their home. Initially, Letts responded to the Apontes’ phone calls; he told them that he was delayed because of rain, but he would start the job shortly. But by mid-June, Letts stopped taking the Apontes’ calls. Barbara Aponte complained to the chief of the contractors’ board, 3 but she did not institute any formal proceedings against Letts in that forum.', 'It is undisputed that Letts never paved the Apontes’ driveway, nor did he return their deposit. 4', 'At the time of these incidents, Letts had been in the asphalt paving business for over twenty-five years. He owned and operated Atlantic Letts Company. 5', 'There is little question that the paving business is both seasonal and affected by the weather. Asphalt plants close during the cold weather months, and even after they reopen in the spring, paving cannot be done properly in wet conditions. Because of these factors, Letts said that he usually provided clients with estimated dates that he would begin paving on their property.', 'By May 2003, Letts said that he had a backlog of at least fifty jobs. He also testified that under favorable weather conditions, he could complete about ten jobs per week or thirty-five to forty jobs per month. Letts said that unfortunately, the weather between March and May 2003 was frequently rainy, with only intermittent periods of dry conditions. 3', 'General Laws 1956 chapter 65 of title 5 provides for the types of registration of contractors. This chapter also creates a board, known as the contractors’ board, to address disputes between contractors and clients, and it establishes claims that may be brought against contractors before the board. 4', 'After his conviction, Letts returned the Apontes’ $400 deposit. 5', 'Atlantic employed six people, including Letts, an office manager, and four pavers.', '-3-', 'In November 2003, after the Apontes filed a complaint, Letts was arraigned in District Court for the misdemeanor offense of obtaining money by false pretenses in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-41-4. On February 24, 2004, Letts’s District Court offense was transferred from the District Court to the Superior Court. There it was consolidated with two felony offenses of obtaining money by false pretenses against Letts. 6', 'A nonjury trial was held on November 8 and 9, 2006. The state offered the testimony of Luis and Barbara Aponte, as well as two former clients of Letts who were the complaining witnesses in the two felony counts against Letts. The defendant testified on his own behalf and he also produced two witnesses who testified that they were former clients who contracted with him in May or June 2003 for paving work and that Letts ultimately completed these paving jobs in September or October 2003.', 'On December 4, 2006, the trial justice found Letts guilty of the misdemeanor count of obtaining money by false pretenses.', 'Letts received a one-year suspended sentence and a one- year period of probation. He timely appealed his misdemeanor conviction to this Court. 6', 'Between March 14 and 16, 2003, Letts entered into a written contract with David Pezzullo for the paving of Pezzullo’s driveway; Pezzullo paid Letts a $2,400 deposit. Their written contract was silent as to when Letts’s performance was to occur. Letts said that he told Pezzullo that he would not be able to start the job for at least five to six weeks and that he would call Pezzullo when he knew his schedule; Pezzullo claimed that Letts represented to him that the paving would be done in April. Also in late March 2003, Letts entered into a written contract with Thomas and Laurie Rossi for the paving of their driveway; the Rossis gave Letts a deposit check of $1,325. Thomas Rossi said that Letts told him that he would begin work toward the end of April or early May. Again the written contract was silent about when performance was to begin. Ultimately, Letts did not pave either the Rossi or Pezzullo driveway, and felony criminal charges were filed. After the consolidated trial, the trial justice found Letts not guilty on the two felony charges.', '-4-', 'II', 'Issue on Appeal', 'On appeal, Letts raises the argument “that the evidence adduced at this trial does not support the conclusion that [he] received the Aponte’s $400 deposit in May of 2003 * * * with the intent to cheat or defraud them.” He contends that the trial justice both misconceived the evidence and drew unreasonable inferences from it.', 'Specifically, Letts argues that the trial justice erroneously found that he was aware of certain personnel and equipment problems as of May 5, 2003, when he entered the contract with the Apontes and accepted their check. Letts further argues that the trial justice incorrectly found that the circled 27 on the contract indicated a time for performance of his obligations under the paving contract. Lastly, Letts contends that the trial justice’s conclusion that Letts accepted the $400 deposit in an effort “to fund his then ‘floundering’ business” was in error because it is “merely unsubstantiated speculation.”', 'III', 'Standard of Review', '“In a jury-waived criminal proceeding, this Court gives deference to a trial justice’s finding of facts.” State v.

72,"Justice Cardozo in In re Rouss, 116 N.E. 782, 783 (N.Y. 1917). 2 In 2008, Mr. Morowitz formed a partnership, under the name “Morowitz & Barry, Ltd.,” but he still presses his objection to Sokolove’s application. 3 We note at the outset that, as Sokolove himself declares in his papers, should the petitioners or any member of the public believe that Sokolove Law, LLC, has engaged in unethical conduct, then they should feel free to file a complaint with the Supreme Court’s Disciplinary Counsel. -1- Facts and Travel The papers in this case disclose that Sokolove Law, LLC, is a national law firm with a complex referral system that can refer clients to attorneys throughout the country. The firm’s advertisements proclaim that although it “maintains joint responsibility, most cases are referred to other attorneys for principal responsibility.” Further, Sokolove Law, LLC’s advertisements denote that “Jim Sokolove is licensed to practice law in Massachusetts and New York and that Rhode Island attorneys will represent clients in this state.” 4 According to Sokolove, his law firm is approved as a limited liability entity in every jurisdiction, except for California, Virginia, Michigan, Tennessee, and Rhode Island. In those states, other than Rhode Island, the firm is approved to practice law as a limited liability partnership (LLP). Sokolove avers that his firm practices law in every jurisdiction, save for South Dakota and Rhode Island. Additionally, attorney Brian J. Farrell (Farrell) has filed an amicus curiae memorandum in this case to support the license application and has represented to this Court that he is a member of Sokolove Law, LLC, and intends to operate the law firm in this state. According to Sokolove, for many years before this petition arose, he was a partner in a Rhode Island general partnership with attorneys licensed in Rhode Island; this allegation was not refuted. In 2006, however, Sokolove organized a Delaware LLC under the name “The Law Offices of James Sokolove, LLC.” He then began the two- 4 This language was used specifically for Rhode Island advertisements. However, Sokolove advertises throughout the country and presumably adjusts the language for the particular state in which he is marketing his law firm. We also note that this specific advertisement led to one of the three objections that petitioners have levied against Sokolove. (See infra.) -2- part process of applying for a license in Rhode Island as a LLC, in accordance with Article II, Rule 10(d) of the Supreme Court Rules: “Within thirty (30) days after filing its limited liability entity charter with the Secretary of State, each limited liability entity formed to engage in the practice of law shall file with the clerk of the Supreme Court a copy of its limited liability entity charter together with an application for license on a form to be prescribed by the clerk * * *.” 5 On November 21, 2007, Sokolove filed an application for registration with the Rhode Island Secretary of State, as part one of the licensing process. In January 23, 2008, he then applied for a license with the Rhode Island Supreme Court clerk’s office under the firm name, “The Law Offices of James Sokolove, LLC.” 6 Mr. Sokolove subsequently filed an amended application with the Secretary of State and this Court, changing the name to “Sokolove Law, LLC.” We presume at the outset that Sokolove Law, LLC, has complied with the requirements of the Rhode Island Limited Liability Company Act, G.L. 1956 (chapter 16 of title 7), and the Secretary of State’s office. See § 7-16-8(a) (“The [S]ecretary of [S]tate may not accept for filing any document under this chapter which does not conform with law.”). The Court has been advised by attorney Farrell that Sokolove Law, LLC, will have an office in Rhode Island, “with office signage, letterhead [stationery] and business 5 We take this opportunity to emphasize this requirement to all limited liability entities licensed with the Secretary of State, many of which have yet to apply for licenses with the clerk of the Supreme Court. 6 We note that Sokolove’s application for license to practice as a limited liability entity was not timely filed with our Court. Rule 10(d) requires that within thirty days of filing its charter with the Secretary of State, the application must be filed with this Court. Sokolove filed its charter with the Secretary of State on November 21, 2007, and did not file this application until January 23, 2008 – nor was the application on the form prescribed by the clerk. -3- cards identifying the name of the firm and its Rhode Island address and telephone number * * *.” According to Farrell, Sokolove Law, LLC, “would be physically located at Farrell’s present practice location.” 7 This case arrives before us under unusual circumstances. The petitioners have opposed Sokolove’s foray into Rhode Island on three fronts: a complaint with the Supreme Court Disciplinary Counsel, a complaint with the Unauthorized Practice of Law Committee (UPLC), and the current matter – i.e., a petition to the Supreme Court objecting to Sokolove’s application for his LLC license. 8 The initial complaint, filed with the Disciplinary Counsel and referred to the Disciplinary Board, alleged that Sokolove’s television and print advertisements violated numerous provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, specifically those concerning attorney advertising when the lawyer is not licensed to practice law in Rhode Island. A screening panel of the Supreme Court Disciplinary Board voted to dismiss the complaint against Sokolove after concluding that the evidence presented did not rise to the requisite clear and convincing standard. Shortly thereafter, the petitioners filed a complaint with the UPLC, essentially alleging the same violations that had been raised before the disciplinary proceedings. The UPLC found that there was probable cause to proceed; however, Sokolove and his counsel met informally with the UPLC and reached an informal resolution agreement. Prior to the UPLC complaint, petitioners filed their 7 Farrell seems to imply that Sokolove Law, LLC will be operated within his existing law firm. (See infra.) 8 Although the disciplinary and UPLC proceedings are confidential, we discuss them today because Sokolove discussed them in his papers and in open Court, which we deem a waiver of confidentiality by respondent. -4- objection to the LLC application with this Court. The informal resolution was intended to remain in place until this Court decided the issues raised in this objection to the LLC application. Essentially, the question before us is whether the application to practice law as a LLC under the name “Sokolove Law, LLC” complies with our rules and should be approved in accordance with this opinion. Analysis We note that this is a case of first impression; we are confronted for the first time with the task of considering an objection to an application for license as a limited liability entity. Before this Court, petitioners argue that Sokolove’s proposed LLC will not function in compliance with the Rhode Island Supreme Court rules, specifically, Rule 10(d), which provides in pertinent part: “(d) Within thirty (30) days after filing its limited liability entity charter with the Secretary of State, each limited liability entity formed to engage in the practice of law shall file with the clerk of the Supreme Court a copy of its limited liability entity charter together with an application for license on a form to be prescribed by the clerk setting forth: “(1) The name and address of the limited liability entity; “(2) The names and addresses of all shareholders, directors andofficers [sic], if the applicant is a professional service corporation; partners if the applicant is a registered limited liability partnership; and managers and members if the applicant is a limited liability company, each of whom must be an attorney authorized to practice law. “(3) The names and address of all of its attorneys who will practice law in Rhode Island.” (Emphases added.) In short, petitioners contend that the members of Sokolove’s proposed LLC will maintain their own individual law firms and simply have cases referred to them because -5- of Sokolove’s extensive advertisements. The petitioners argue that this type of referral system would be inappropriate and that it is addressed in Rule 10(f): “The limited liability entity shall comply with and be subject to all rules governing the practice of law by attorneys and it shall do nothing which, if done by an individual attorney, would violate the standard of professional conduct applicable to attorneys licensed to practice law in this state.” The petitioners further argue that Sokolove improperly undertook to advertise in Rhode Island before the LLC was approved, such that this Court should deny the application. According to petitioners, Sokolove’s advertisements demonstrate that his national law firm is nothing but a referral network and should not be deemed a legitimate law firm. In response, Sokolove asserts that denying his application for a license based on the prior disciplinary complaints would circumvent the Supreme Court rules by preemptively suspending the LLC practice without following the proper procedures concerning attorney discipline. Specifically, Sokolove argues that Article III of the Supreme Court Rules of Disciplinary Procedure governs disciplinary procedures and that it is improper to ask this Court to deny a LLC license based on potential violations of Article V of the Supreme Court Rules of Professional Conduct. As we explain throughout, we agree with Sokolove’s contention and fully expect that any member of the bar who practices law in this state and violates our disciplinary rules will be investigated by Disciplinary Counsel. Additionally, Sokolove argues that the only issue before this Court is whether his application meets the requisite filing qualifications for a LLC license, set forth in Rule 10. Finally, Sokolove assures this Court that Sokolove Law, LLC, will, at all times, maintain an office in Rhode Island, staffed by one or more -6- attorneys who are licensed to practice in Rhode Island. 9 Sokolove adds that Sokolove Law, LLC, is a bona fide LLC and that petitioners are asserting incorrectly that he is holding himself out as an attorney licensed to practice in this state. 10 Supreme Court Rules: Article II, Rule 10 Rule 10 of our rules prescribes how legal entities in Rhode Island may apply for a professional license; whether the entity intends to function as a professional service corporation, a limited liability partnership, or as a limited liability company. See Rule 10(a) (explaining which limited liability entities are provided for by law). 11 Rule 10(b) also sets forth, in clear and unambiguous language, the type of entity that is included within the term “limited liability entity”: 9 At oral argument, counsel for Sokolove assured us that this will be a real, or bona fide, LLC that will have its own offices in Rhode Island and its own stationery setting forth the firm’s name as “Sokolove Law, LLC.” 10 Sokolove notes that if he were asserting he was licensed to practice in this state (despite being licensed only in Massachusetts and New York), then Article V, Rule 5.5(b) of the Supreme Court Rules of Professional Conduct and G.L. 1956 § 11-27-12 would prohibit him from doing so, and his conduct would constitute the unauthorized practice of law. However, Sokolove argues that is not the case, and his advertisements clearly state “he is a member of the bars of Massachusetts and New York.” He also adds that he “has the First Amendment right to advertise and so long as the advertisements are not violative of the disciplinary rules or the laws against the unauthorized practice of law, his advertisements are constitutionally protected. See Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, 433 U.S. 350 (1977).” 11 Rule 10(a) provides: “Attorneys at law admitted to practice before this [C]ourt may engage in the practice of law in the form of professional service corporations as provided by the Professional Service Corporation Law, G.L. 1956 (1999 Reenactment), §§ 7-5.1-1 to 7-5.1-12, as amended, as registered limited liability partnerships, as provided by the Uniform Partnership Act, G.L. 1956 (1999 Reenactment), §§ 7-12-31.1, 7-12-56 to 7-12-59, as amended, or as limited liability companies, as provided by the Rhode Island Limited Liability Company Act, G.L. 1956 (1999 Reenactment) §§ 7-16-1 to 17- 16-75, as amended.” -7- “As used in this rule, the term ‘limited liability entity’ shall include a professional service corporation and a registered limited liability partnership and limited liability company organized to practice law pursuant to the laws of any state or other jurisdiction of the United States and which practices law in the State of Rhode Island; the term ‘limited liability entity charter’ shall mean its Articles of Incorporation (in the case of a professional service corporation), its Articles of Organization (in the case of a domestic limited liability company), its Application for Registration (in the case of a foreign limited liability company), its Application for Registered Limited Liability Partnership (in the case of a domestic partnership) or its Notice of Foreign Registered Limited Liability Partnership (in the case of a foreign partnership); and the term ‘limited liability entity amendment’ shall mean its Articles of Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation (in the case of a professional service corporation), its Articles of Amendment to Articles of Organization (in the case of a domestic limited liability company), its Amendment to Application for Registration (in the case of a foreign limited liability company) or its renewal Application for Registered Limited Liability Partnership (in the case of a domestic partnership) or its new Notice of Foreign Registered Limited Liability Partnership (in the case of a foreign partnership).” (Emphases added.) In examining Sokolove Law, LLC’s application in light of Rule 10, we do so in accordance with our long-standing rules of statutory construction. As we stated in Park v. Rizzo Ford, Inc., 893 A.2d 216 (R.I. 2006), “[a]ccording to our established rules of statutory construction, ‘[w]hen the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, we must enforce the statute as written by giving the words of the statute their plain and ordinary meaning.’” Id. at 221 (quoting Gem Plumbing & Heating Co. v. Rossi, 867 A.2d 796, 811 (R.I. 2005)). We are of the opinion that the language in Rule 10(b) is clear and unambiguous; “‘limited liability entity’ shall include a professional service corporation and a registered limited liability partnership and limited liability company organized to practice law -8- pursuant to the laws of any state or other jurisdiction of the United States.” (Emphasis added.) In approving these rules, this Court deemed it proper for a legal entity to exist outside Rhode Island and maintain offices in this state that are staffed by attorneys who are licensed members of the Rhode Island bar. 12 Additionally, Rule 10(d)(2)(3) also requires that the LLC set forth in the application the following two classes of attorneys: (1) the principals of the LLC, “each of whom must be an attorney authorized to practice law” and (2) the names and addresses of all attorneys (whether principals or employees) “who will practice law in Rhode Island.” “(2) The names and addresses of all shareholders, directors andofficers [sic], if the applicant is a professional service corporation; partners if the applicant is a registered limited liability partnership; and managers and members if the applicant is a limited liability company, each of whom must be an attorney authorized to practice law. “(3) The names and addresses of all of its attorneys who will practice law in Rhode Island.” Id. (emphases added). Nothing in the rule requires that each member of the LLC must be licensed to practice law in Rhode Island. Indeed, Rule 10 anticipates that members of the LLC may be attorneys in other states, not licensed to practice law in Rhode Island, but that the lawyers who practice in Rhode Island will be members of the Rhode Island bar. Sokolove has represented to this Court that he is a member of the bar in good standing in Massachusetts and New York and, in accordance with Rule 10(d)(3), that at least one member of the firm will be located in Rhode Island, and that individual will be licensed to practice law in Rhode Island as a member of Sokolove Law, LLC. We deem Rule 10 12 We deem this structure to be similar, although not identical, to the numerous large firms with offices in Rhode Island but incorporated and headquartered elsewhere. -9- unambiguous and are satisfied, based on these representations, that Sokolove Law, LLC, meets its requirements. We hasten to add however, that Rule 10 does not envision a law firm operating as a LLC, to make referrals to other attorneys who, but for their “membership” in the entity would be engaged in prohibited fee-splitting arrangements. An attorney practicing law in this jurisdiction is an officer of this Court; he or she may not hold himself or herself out as a sole practitioner or member of a given law firm, only to receive a referral from Sokolove Law, LLC, switch hats, and represent the client as a member of Sokolove Law, LLC, to avoid the prohibition against fee-sharing as set forth in our Rules of Professional Conduct. Farrell has represented that Sokolove Law, LLC, “would be physically located” at Farrell’s “present practice location” and that all communications with the firm’s clients “would clearly identify the firm.” Although this description gives us pause, we take attorney Farrell at his word that Sokolove Law, LLC, will be a bona fide law firm and that he will not simply change the letterhead of his existing law practice, based upon the method by which the client came through the door. Fee-Sharing and Referrals Because petitioners vehemently have argued that this application amounts to a fee-splitting arrangement based on client-referrals that violates our rules, we take this opportunity to reiterate our well-established principles on the law concerning fees for all members of the bar. 13 The Rules of Professional Conduct are found in Article V of the 13 The Court was assured at oral argument that if the member who practices in Rhode Island has experience in the subject area of the litigation, he or she will represent the client. If not, however, then the LLC will refer the potential client to other attorneys in the state. This relationship is governed by Article V, Rules 1.5 and 7.2. We require strict and diligent adherence to these rules. - 10 - Supreme Court Rules. Article V, Rules 1.5 and 7.2 control referral and fee-sharing between lawyers; the rules are separate and distinct. Rule 7.2(c) provides in relevant part: “A lawyer shall not give anything of value to a person for recommending the lawyer’s services except that a lawyer may * * * (4) refer clients to another lawyer or a nonlawyer professional pursuant to an agreement not otherwise prohibited under these [r]ules that provides for the other person to refer clients or customers to the lawyer, if (i) the reciprocal referral agreement is not exclusive, and (ii) the client is informed of the existence and nature of the agreement.” Additionally, Rule 7.2(f) provides: “Any lawyer or law firm who advertises that his or her practice includes or concentrates in particular fields of law and then refers the majority of cases in those fields of law or of that type to another lawyer, law firm or group of lawyers shall clearly state the following disclaimer: “1. ‘Most cases of this type are not handled by this firm, but are referred to other attorneys[,]’ or if applicable: “2. ‘While this firm maintains joint responsibility, most cases of this type are referred to other attorneys for principal responsibility.’” Whether the attorney fees can be shared by the referring lawyer or law firm and the lawyer to whom the case is referred is another question. Rule 1.5 provides the framework for how the division between lawyers dividing fees is governed: “(e) A division of a fee between lawyers who are not in the same firm may be made only if: “(1) the division is in proportion to the services performed by each lawyer or each lawyer assumes joint responsibility for the representation; - 11 - “(2) the client agrees to the arrangement, including the share each lawyer will receive, and the agreement is confirmed in writing; and “(3) the total fee is reasonable.” (Emphases added.) Clearly, the Rules of Professional Conduct anticipate and permit attorney-to- attorney referrals; fee-splitting, however, is regulated more stringently to protect the client from unscrupulous practitioners. Attorneys are prohibited from paying other lawyers or anyone else for funneling business or “channeling professional work.” Rule 7.2, comment [6]. Further, a division of fees among lawyers who are not in the same firm is prohibited unless the division is based on the proportional amount of work performed by each lawyer or, if each lawyer – not the law firm – “assumes joint responsibility for the representation.” Rule 1.5(e)(1). “A division of fee is a single billing to a client covering the fee of two or more lawyers who are not in the same firm. A division of fee facilitates association of more than one lawyer in a matter in which neither alone could serve the client as well, and most often is used when the fee is contingent and the division is between a referring lawyer and a trial specialist.” Rule 1.5, comment [7]. Joint responsibility for the representation presumes that each lawyer who shares in the fee has rendered services in proportion to the fee or a lawyer – not the law firm – has assumed “responsibility for the representation as a whole.” Rule 1.5, comment [7]. Responsibility for the representation is not an empty concept – it requires that an identified attorney assume financial accountability for the costs of the suit in a contingent-fee case, as well as individual “ethical responsibility for the representation as if the lawyers were associated in a partnership.” Id. - 12 - Attorneys who are licensed to practice law in this state, no matter the form of the entity, must strictly adhere to the Rules of Professional Conduct governing fees, and we are confident that Disciplinary Counsel will pay close attention to these concerns. The Practice of Law The concerns underlying petitioners’ claims throughout their various objections to Sokolove and Sokolove Law, LLC, have centered on the basic premise that the entity should not be allowed to practice in Rhode Island, based on our Rules of Professional Conduct. We deem our observation in Rhode Island Bar Association v. Automobile Service Association, 55 R.I. 122, 126, 179 A. 139, 140 (1935) to be compelling: “The practice of law is difficult to define. Perhaps it does not admit of exact definition. Whether or not it can be reduced to definition is not important to the decision of the matter before us at this time. ‘Definition, simple, positive, hard and fast as it is, never tells the whole truth about a conception,’ said the American philosopher, Josiah Royce, and we adopt that view in refraining from any attempt at definition here. That the practice of the law is a special field reserved to lawyers duly licensed by the [C]ourt, no one denies.” Thus, over seventy years ago, this Court, in Rhode Island Bar Association recognized that what constitutes the practice of law does not easily lend itself to concise definition; this especially is true today, based on the changing nature of the legal profession and the lightning speed with which these changes have occurred. See Rhode Island Bar Association, 55 R.I. at 126, 179 A. at 140. What is certain however, is “[t]he practice of law is affected with a public interest[,]” such that it is the duty of this Court to regulate those who seek to engage in it, “so that the public welfare will be served and promoted.” Id. at 131, 179 A. at 143. We note that, although Sokolove Law, LLC, may - 13 - not fall within the traditional boundaries of the practice of law in Rhode Island, we are hopeful that, as represented, the LLC will operate in compliance with our rules. Finally, we observe that when the members of this Court in Rhode Island Bar Association, 55 R.I. at 138, 179 A. at 146, found that “lay respondents” were performing legal services in the context of a corporate structure, the practice of law greatly differed from today’s modern law firm with the dominating presence of computers, electronic communications, and the Internet. The Court, we believe, was on target when it described the nature of this honorable profession: “The bar is an important element of our judicial system and all of its members are obligated to govern their professional conduct in full accord with the solemn responsibility which that entails. Under our system of law the most effective guaranty of equal justice to all in the commonwealth is a competent and learned bar composed of men [and women] of high personal character who govern their professional conduct at all times by the well known and generally accepted canons of legal ethics. The lack of such a bar or the co-existence with it of an array of individuals or groups operating under deceptive devices and catch-names to mislead the public into the belief that they are entrusting their causes to those learned in the law and competent to serve them, would inevitably result in a deprivation of justice to many in the State.” Id. at 139-40, 179 A. at 146. These are neither idle observations, nor rhetorical exhortations; the public has a right and expectation that those who practice law in this jurisdiction do so in accordance with our standards of integrity, character, and competence, so that “the people may be assured the best possible service in the dispatch of their legal business.” Rhode Island Bar Association, 55 R.I. at 140, 179 A. at 147. - 14 - Conclusion For the reasons stated in this opinion, we approve the application and grant the license of the respondent, Sokolove Law, LLC, to practice law as a limited liability entity. 14 After careful consideration, we remand the record to the Supreme Court clerk’s office for approval of the application in accordance with this opinion. Chief Justice Williams (ret.) did not participate. 14 We wish to express our sincere appreciation for the articulate arguments and well- written briefs submitted by counsel for both sides in this case, as well as for the insightful amicus curiae briefs submitted in this case. - 15 - Supreme Court No. 2008-151-M.P.

The firm’s advertisements proclaim that although it “maintains joint responsibility, most cases are referred to other attorneys for principal responsibility.” Further, Sokolove Law, LLC’s advertisements denote that “Jim Sokolove is licensed to practice law in Massachusetts and New York and that Rhode Island attorneys will represent clients in this state.” 4 According to Sokolove, his law firm is approved as a limited liability entity in every jurisdiction, except for California, Virginia, Michigan, Tennessee, and Rhode Island. In those states, other than Rhode Island, the firm is approved to practice law as a limited liability partnership (LLP). Sokolove avers that his firm practices law in every jurisdiction, save for South Dakota and Rhode Island. Additionally, attorney Brian J. Farrell (Farrell) has filed an amicus curiae memorandum in this case to support the license application and has represented to this Court that he is a member of Sokolove Law, LLC, and intends to operate the law firm in this state.', 'According to Sokolove, for many years before this petition arose, he was a partner in a Rhode Island general partnership with attorneys licensed in Rhode Island; this allegation was not refuted.

The petitioners have opposed Sokolove’s foray into Rhode Island on three fronts: a complaint with the Supreme Court Disciplinary Counsel, a complaint with the Unauthorized Practice of Law Committee (UPLC), and the current matter – i.e., a petition to the Supreme Court objecting to Sokolove’s application for his LLC license. 8', 'The initial complaint, filed with the Disciplinary Counsel and referred to the Disciplinary Board, alleged that Sokolove’s television and print advertisements violated numerous provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, specifically those concerning attorney advertising when the lawyer is not licensed to practice law in Rhode Island.

Shortly thereafter, the petitioners filed a complaint with the UPLC, essentially alleging the same violations that had been raised before the disciplinary proceedings.

The informal resolution was intended to remain in place until this Court decided the issues raised in this objection to the LLC application. Essentially, the question before us is whether the application to practice law as a LLC under the name “Sokolove Law, LLC” complies with our rules and should be approved in accordance with this opinion.', 'Analysis', 'We note that this is a case of first impression; we are confronted for the first time with the task of considering an objection to an application for license as a limited liability entity. Before this Court, petitioners argue that Sokolove’s proposed LLC will not function in compliance with the Rhode Island Supreme Court rules, specifically, Rule 10(d), which provides in pertinent part:', '“(d) Within thirty (30) days after filing its limited', 'liability entity charter with the Secretary of State, each', 'limited liability entity formed to engage in the practice of', 'law shall file with the clerk of the Supreme Court a copy of', 'its limited liability entity charter together with an', 'application for license on a form to be prescribed by the', 'clerk setting forth:', '“(1) The name and address of the limited liability', 'entity;', '“(2) The names and addresses of all shareholders,', 'directors andofficers [sic], if the applicant is a professional', 'service corporation; partners if the applicant is a registered', 'limited liability partnership; and managers and members if', 'the applicant is a limited liability company, each of whom', 'must be an attorney authorized to practice law.', '“(3) The names and address of all of its attorneys', 'who will practice law in Rhode Island.” (Emphases added.)', 'In short, petitioners contend that the members of Sokolove’s proposed LLC will maintain their own individual law firms and simply have cases referred to them because', '-5- of Sokolove’s extensive advertisements.

Specifically, Sokolove argues that Article III of the Supreme Court Rules of Disciplinary Procedure governs disciplinary procedures and that it is improper to ask this Court to deny a LLC license based on potential violations of Article V of the Supreme Court Rules of Professional Conduct. As we explain throughout, we agree with Sokolove’s contention and fully expect that any member of the bar who practices law in this state and violates our disciplinary rules will be investigated by Disciplinary Counsel. Additionally, Sokolove argues that the only issue before this Court is whether his application meets the requisite filing qualifications for a LLC license, set forth in Rule 10. Finally, Sokolove assures this Court that Sokolove Law, LLC, will, at all times, maintain an office in Rhode Island, staffed by one or more', '-6- attorneys who are licensed to practice in Rhode Island. 9 Sokolove adds that Sokolove Law, LLC, is a bona fide LLC and that petitioners are asserting incorrectly that he is holding himself out as an attorney licensed to practice in this state. 10', 'Supreme Court Rules: Article II, Rule 10', 'Rule 10 of our rules prescribes how legal entities in Rhode Island may apply for a professional license; whether the entity intends to function as a professional service corporation, a limited liability partnership, or as a limited liability company.

73,"State : v. : Kenneth S. Rice. : Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty, and Robinson, JJ. OPINION Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The defendant, Kenneth S. Rice, appeals from a Superior Court order denying his motion to correct sentence with respect to his convictions on two counts of first-degree child molestation sexual assault. Mr. Rice’s motion to correct was based on a discrepancy between the wording of the judgment of conviction and the transcript of his sentencing hearing. The former sets forth sentences of fifty years for each count, whereas the latter provides that he shall serve five years for each count. For the following reasons, we affirm the order of the Superior Court. In 1998, a jury convicted defendant of three counts of first-degree child molestation sexual assault, one count of second-degree child molestation sexual assault, and two counts of solicitation with intent to commit a felony. The convictions were related to sexual crimes committed against two minor victims over a period of approximately twenty months. The defendant’s convictions were affirmed by this Court in 2000. State v. Rice, 755 A.2d 137 (R.I. 2000). -1- It is undisputed that defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment on one of the three counts of first-degree child molestation sexual assault (count 1). Further, defendant received ten years on the second-degree child molestation sexual assault count (count 4), which was to run consecutively to the life sentence; five years on each of the two solicitation counts, to run concurrently (counts 5 and 6); and an additional ten years for being a habitual offender, to be served consecutively to the other sentences. The defendant alleges, however, that the judgment of conviction and commitment erroneously recites that he is to serve fifty years, to run concurrently to his life sentence, on each of the other two first-degree child molestation sexual assault counts (counts 2 and 3). Mr. Rice contends that the trial justice sentenced him orally to five years on each count. To support this contention, defendant points to the transcript of the trial justice’s announcement of sentencing, which sets forth in pertinent part: “I’m satisfied that I have to give you a life sentence on at least one of these counts. And I’ll do it for Count 1. And that that life sentence has to be consecutive; that is, following the term that you were serving as a violator. As to Count[s] 2 and 3, which are just as egregious as Count 1, the Court is going to sentence you to five years on each, concurrent to the life sentence given to you in Count 1.” A judgment of conviction and commitment reflecting, inter alia, sentences of fifty years on counts 2 and 3 was entered on May 8, 1998, the date of the sentencing hearing. The judgment also stated that defendant would not be eligible for parole for thirty years. In 2000, defendant filed a motion to reduce sentence under Rule 35 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure and, on appeal, this Court vacated that portion of the judgment concerning his ineligibility for parole, holding that under the habitual-offender statute, G.L. 1956 § 12-19-21, “he could have been ordered to serve an additional -2- consecutive term of no more than ten years in prison before becoming eligible for parole under that portion of his sentence.” State v. Rice, 811 A.2d 1144, 1146 (R.I. 2002). Upon remand, a new judgment of conviction and commitment was entered, again reciting fifty- year sentences on both counts 2 and 3. The defendant filed a motion to correct his sentence, also under Super. R. Crim. P. 35, on February 22, 2007, nearly nine years after the original judgment of conviction and commitment had been entered. 1 The trial justice denied defendant’s motion in a written decision issued on April 10, 2007, and defendant appealed. The defendant advances a number of arguments on appeal. All of defendant’s arguments are barred, however, because he made statements through his attorney, on at least two occasions in 2000 in the context of his original Rule 35 motion, which amount to judicial admissions. “A judicial admission is a deliberate, clear, unequivocal statement of a party about a concrete fact within that party’s knowledge[,]” which is “considered conclusive and binding as to the party making [it].” 29A Am. Jur. 2d Evidence § 783 at 48, 49 (2008); see also Black’s Law Dictionary 54 (9th ed. 2009) (noting that a judicial admission “relieves an opposing party from having to prove the admitted fact and bars the party who made the admission from disputing it”). In other words, “[a] judicially admitted fact is conclusively established.” Crafford Precision Products Co. v. Equilasers, Inc., 850 A.2d 958, 963 (R.I. 2004) (quoting DiLuglio v. Providence Auto Body, Inc., 755 A.2d 757, 767 (R.I. 2000)). We first observe that defendant’s 2000 motion to reduce sentence was not predicated upon his current assertion that his sentences on counts 2 and 3 were for five 1 Rule 35 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure provides in part that “[t]he Court may correct an illegal sentence at any time.” -3- years rather than fifty. On the contrary, defendant clearly stated that his sentence comprised “fifty years concurrent on Counts 2 and 3[.]” Further, counsel for defendant, at the hearing on that motion, stated in open court: “The sentence that you imposed was * * * 50 years concurrent on Counts [2 and 3].” Notably, defendant was in attendance at the hearing and spoke to the court at length after this statement, but he did not call attention to what he now alleges to be error. We need not, however, base our decision in this case solely on the estoppel effect of the defendant’s judicial admissions. See State v. Verrecchia, 880 A.2d 89, 97 n.19 (R.I. 2005). There are a number of factors pointing to the conclusion that the trial justice did, in fact, orally pronounce a sentence of fifty years, but that the transcript does not reflect this fact because of a typographical error. Significantly, a sentence of five years would have been illegal under the mandatory sentencing laws in force at the time of the commission of the crime and the defendant’s sentencing. See G.L. 1956 § 11-37-8.2, as amended by P.L. 1984, ch. 59, § 2. At all relevant times, a charge of first-degree child molestation sexual assault carried a minimum sentence of not less than twenty years. Id. Additionally, the trial justice stated during sentencing that counts 2 and 3 were “just as egregious as” count 1, for which he sentenced the defendant to life in prison. It is clear that fifty years more closely parallels the severity of the life sentence imposed for the identical charges on count 1 than five years. Thus, it is eminently reasonable to conclude that the trial justice, in fact, pronounced a sentence of fifty years, but that the stenographer incorrectly recorded that number in the transcript. After reviewing the record, we agree with the trial justice that “all reasonable inferences support that there is a mistake in defendant’s sentencing transcript, not in his -4- judgment of conviction.” Accordingly, we deem the defendant’s contentions to be without merit. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Superior Court. The record shall be returned to the Superior Court. -5- Supreme Court No. 2007-201-C.A.

She said that, in that family discussion context, defendant had admitted to having touched Kaitlin inappropriately.', 'Detective McIlmail further testified that he next interviewed defendant7 with Detective Lieutenant Lance Trafford also being present in the interview room. During the interview, both officers were in plain clothes and were not dressed in uniform. Detective McIlmail testified that, prior to commencing a discussion with defendant, he gave him a rights form, which set forth the Miranda8 rights; he stated that he asked Mr. Gonzalez to read the form. Detective McIlmail testified that Mr. Gonzalez read the form without asking any questions and gave no indication that he did not understand what was written on the form. The detective testified that defendant then signed and dated the form and placed a check mark next to the word “YES” that appeared on the rights form next to the statement: “I understand my rights.”9 Detective McIlmail and Detective Trafford also signed the form.', 'Detective McIlmail testified that, after defendant had read and signed the rights form, he informed defendant that he was a suspect and that allegations had been made by Kaitlin to the 7', 'While Kaitlin and Caroline were being interviewed, defendant had remained in the waiting area of the police station. 8', 'Miranda v.

Detective McIlmail testified that neither he nor Detective Trafford told defendant what to write in the statement; he added that neither officer physically touched defendant. Detective McIlmail stated that, when he had brought defendant from the waiting area to the conference room, he had a strong suspicion that defendant would be charged; he acknowledged that, if defendant had attempted to leave the police station at that point in time, he would not have been free to leave. However, Detective McIlmail also testified that, although defendant was told that he was suspected of second-degree child molestation, he was not told that he was not free to leave the police station, nor was he placed in handcuffs or other restraints while speaking to the detectives in the conference room.', 'Detective McIlmail additionally testified that defendant informed him of the contact that he had had with a DCYF investigator.10 Detective McIlmail testified that he did not recall defendant’s having stated to him that the DCYF investigator had threatened to take away the children with whom he resided if he did not go to the police and make a statement. 10', 'The DCYF investigator to whom we make reference in the text was one of that agency’s child protective investigators (CPIs). For the sake of simplicity and consistency, we shall hereinafter refer to said person as “the DCYF investigator.”', '-5-', 'It was further Detective McIlmail’s testimony that, after defendant made his incriminating statements, he was placed in the police station’s cell block; he added that, prior to that time, defendant had not been locked up or otherwise restrained.', '2. The Testimony of Defendant Victor Gonzalez', 'At the hearing on the motion to suppress, Mr. Gonzalez testified that, in December of 2004, he was living in an apartment in Pawtucket with Caroline and her two daughters (Kaitlin and Cynthia)11 and with the daughter that he had fathered with Caroline (Suzanne). He stated that, as of that point in time, he had been living with Caroline and the three girls for about seven years.', 'The defendant further testified that, on December 9, 2004, he came home to the apartment and was informed by Caroline and Kaitlin that an investigator from DCYF wanted to speak with him. He also testified at the suppression hearing that he did in fact speak with the DCYF investigator and was asked by her whether he had touched Kaitlin; he testified that, after looking over at Caroline, he had responded: “[Y]es, I did.”', 'The defendant also testified that, after the meeting with the DCYF investigator in the apartment, he and Caroline and Kaitlin all proceeded to go to the Pawtucket police station together; he said that he went there because the DCYF investigator had told him that, if he did not go to the police station and fill out papers, she was going to take his daughter and Caroline’s daughters from the home.', 'The defendant testified that he and Caroline and Kaitlin waited approximately fifteen or twenty minutes in the waiting area of the police station before the officers called Kaitlin to talk with them in another room; Caroline accompanied Kaitlin to that interview. The defendant 11', 'Kaitlin and Cynthia are the biological children of Caroline, but not of defendant.', '-6- remained in the waiting area after Kaitlin and Caroline left that area to go with the officers; he testified that he thought that he could have walked out of the station if he had wanted to.', 'Mr. Gonzalez further testified that, after he had been in the waiting area for more than an hour and a half, a detective asked him to come to another room, at which point defendant was told that he was suspected of child molestation. Mr. Gonzalez testified that there were two officers in the room and that they gave him a piece of paper and asked him to read it—which, according to his testimony, he did; he added that he then told the officers that he understood the contents of the piece of paper.', 'The defendant testified that the police did not threaten him at all, but he added that he told the police officers about what he described as “the threats” that he alleged the DCYF investigator had made to him. He stated that, because he felt that he hadn’t done anything wrong, he would not have gone to the police station but for the fact that the DCYF investigator had told him to go there. The defendant testified that the Pawtucket police told him, and he understood, that he had the right to remain silent; but he added that he felt threatened by the DCYF investigator’s comments that, if he did not go to the police station and fill out papers, the children would be taken away. The defendant also testified that the DCYF investigator had told him that, if he went to the police station and filled out papers, he was “not going to have any problem” and that “the Judge is going to be on [defendant’s] side.” He testified that the reason that he acted as the DCYF investigator had indicated was that he would do anything to keep the children and to prevent the children from being removed from the home.', '-7-', 'It was further defendant’s testimony at the suppression hearing that, a couple of years12 before he made the incriminating statements at the Pawtucket police station in December of 2004, he had been confronted by Caroline and her sister and that he had admitted to having touched Kaitlin inappropriately. He testified that the reason that he admitted to those family members that he had touched Kaitlin was because they were screaming at him and asking him to tell them that he did it; he added that he did not like people screaming at him. It was his testimony that he told the police that he had apologized to Caroline and her sister on that earlier occasion for something that in actuality he had never done.', 'The defendant then testified that he “never did anything to [Kaitlin] * * *.” He stated that, before he wrote his own statement at the police station, he read Kaitlin’s statement to the police and then essentially copied the information set forth in her statement. When he was cross- examined at the suppression hearing with respect to his assertion that he had copied Kaitlin’s written statement, defendant could not explain why in his police statements he admitted to having touched Kaitlin’s chest, but denied ever touching her vagina—even though, in her written statement to the police (from which defendant said he had copied), Kaitlin had explicitly alleged that defendant had touched her in both areas.13', 'At the hearing on the motion to suppress, Mr. Gonzalez contended that his statements to the Pawtucket police should be suppressed because they were not given freely—due to the fact that, according to him, they were coerced by threats made by the DCYF investigator.

Accordingly, the hearing justice denied defendant’s motion to suppress the statements.', 'B', 'The Trial', 'After the motion to suppress was denied, a trial was held from June 5 to June 8, 2006.

Based upon this testimony, the hearing justice found that defendant was not in custody at the police station in Pawtucket on December 9, 2004, when he made the incriminating statements to the police.16 She reasoned that defendant had gone to the police station voluntarily with Kaitlin and Caroline in order to make a statement about the allegations concerning his involvement in the alleged incidents of child molestation. The hearing justice further found that defendant’s “freedom of movement was never curtailed,” and she also noted that defendant had stated that he had felt free to leave the waiting area of the police station and that he was neither handcuffed nor subjected to force while waiting in that area. She further noted that defendant was not arrested until after he made his incriminating statements. The 16', 'The hearing justice further found that, despite there being no constitutional requirement that Miranda warnings be given (due to the fact that defendant was not then in custody), defendant had in fact received such warnings prior to making his incriminating statements. The hearing justice additionally found that defendant had read the rights form and had indicated on the form that he understood his rights. She further found that only after receiving such warnings did defendant then freely waive his right to remain silent by answering questions of the detectives and giving a written statement without any coercion or threats by the police.', '- 12 - hearing justice found that, when he made his incriminating statements, defendant subjectively believed that he was free to leave.17', 'Significantly, the hearing justice clearly stated on the record that she did “not accept as fact that DCYF threatened to take the defendant’s children if he did not give a police statement.” The hearing justice stated that she was not convinced, after reviewing the testimony of defendant and the detective, that a threat was made by DCYF—although she acknowledged the possibility that the DCYF investigator may have recommended that defendant speak with the police. The hearing justice stated that, although defendant “may have believed that his children were at risk or in jeopardy if he did not give a statement,” that was a “far cry” from defendant’s confession being “the product of an express threat by DCYF to report the conduct to police or face such [a] risk.”', 'The hearing justice stated that she was also “not at all convinced” by defendant’s argument that, had he not been threatened by the DCYF investigator (as he alleged had happened), he would not have spoken to the police nor would he have made a confession. In reference to that allegation, the hearing justice pointed to defendant’s inability to explain how confessing would help avoid DCYF intervention with respect to the three girls who lived with Caroline and him; the hearing justice characterized as “totally illogical” defendant’s assertion that he thought that making incriminating statements to the police would help him and Caroline keep the children. The hearing justice reasoned as follows:', '“It is far more logical that the defendant thought he would help', 'himself by telling the police the same truths, albeit incomplete, by', 'admitting to some touchings, but not others, that he had previously 17', 'The hearing justice noted that, despite Detective McIlmail’s testimony that defendant would not have been free to leave once he was brought into the conference room to speak with the police officers, this fact was not communicated to defendant, who at that juncture was merely told that he was a suspect.', '- 13 -', 'told [Kaitlin], [Caroline] and DCYF.

In so finding, the hearing justice made a credibility assessment with respect to defendant’s testimony: in plain English, the hearing justice stated that she did “not accept as fact that DCYF threatened to take the defendant’s children if he did not give a police statement”—and there is no evidence in the record (other than defendant’s disbelieved testimony) that a threat was made. It is a fundamental principle that credibility assessments are primarily the responsibility of hearing justices; they are deferred to by appellate courts except in instances where the trial court failed to touch all the right bases. See, e.g., DeOliveira, 972 A.2d at 662 (“We are mindful of the fact that the trier of fact is in the best position to assess the relative credibility of witnesses.”); see also Woods, 936 A.2d at 198 (“We do not have the same vantage point as the presiding judge, and we are unable to assess the witness’ demeanor, tone of voice, and body language.

After taking into account the “totality of the circumstances”18 and according appropriate deference to the hearing justice’s findings of historical fact,19 there is clearly sufficient evidence in the record to satisfy us as to the voluntary nature of both the oral and written statements that Mr. Gonzalez made to the Pawtucket police.', 'It is undisputed that defendant arrived at the police station voluntarily and of his own accord, in the company of both his girlfriend (Caroline) and the complaining witness (Kaitlin). Having arrived at the police station, he remained in the waiting area and believed that he was free to leave the police station if he so chose.

Further, no evidence was proffered that would suggest that defendant was subjected to coercion by the detectives in the form of verbal threats or intimidation or physical force. Mr. Gonzalez was not restrained or handcuffed; he retained his freedom of movement while at the police station until the point in time when he made the incriminating statements. Only then was he placed in the cell block.', 'Having reviewed the record of the suppression hearing, we are unable to perceive any basis for ruling that the analysis conducted by the hearing justice was erroneous.', 'On appeal, defendant contends that our recent decision in State v. Oliveira, 961 A.2d 299 (R.I. 2008) is controlling with respect to his case. In Oliveira, we held that the admission at trial of certain incriminating statements which the defendant made to a DCYF investigator, who had spoken with the defendant after he had been arraigned and while he was being held at the Adult Correctional Institutions on charges of first-degree child molestation, violated the defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Id. at 304. Mr. Gonzalez contends that this Court should find that his incriminating statements to the Pawtucket police detectives were similarly unconstitutional—in view of what he describes as “threats” allegedly made by the DCYF investigator to him.', 'It is obvious that there are some superficial factual similarities between what transpired in the Oliveira case and what took place in the case at bar: most notably, each case involves the interaction between a DCYF investigator and a person accused of child molestation.', 'Upon analysis, however, it is clear that defendant’s reliance on Oliveira is unavailing. Oliveira was expressly decided on Sixth Amendment grounds, whereas there is absolutely no allegation in the instant case of any violation of defendant’s Sixth Amendment rights; the whole', '- 16 - focus of defendant’s argument on appeal is on his right against self-incrimination. Oliveira focused on the admission of a statement made to a DCYF investigator by a detainee at the ACI whose right to counsel had already attached.

Moulton, 474 U.S. 159, 173 (1985)). In the case at bar, however, the Sixth Amendment is not implicated. Moreover, as we have emphasized, the hearing justice expressly found that no threat was made in this case—and, therefore, there exists no basis for triggering close Fifth Amendment review.', 'The defendant further argues that his situation is controlled by the principles set forth in Lynumn v. Illinois, 372 U.S. 528 (1963). In Lynumn, three police officers and an informant, who had purportedly “set up” the defendant, were found to have “encircled [the defendant] in her apartment” after the officers had seized and arrested her. Id. at 534. The officers then threatened the defendant, indicating that, unless she cooperated and told them that she had sold marijuana to the informant in a sting operation, state financial aid to the defendant’s infant children would be cut off and her children would be taken from her. Id. The United States Supreme Court held that the threats made by the police rendered the defendant’s incriminating statements involuntary under the circumstances and the admission of those statements at trial was violative of her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Id.', 'The defendant’s contention that Lynumn is applicable to the case at bar is simply untenable in light of the hearing justice’s express finding of fact (which we have held to be not clearly erroneous) that no such threats were made to Mr. Gonzalez. In stark contrast, in Lynumn, the police officers did not deny that they made threats to the defendant, including the', '- 17 - threat that, if she did not cooperate and was arrested, her children would likely be taken away and her state-funded aid would be cut off. Lynumn, 372 U.S. at 532-34.

The record in this case may be returned to the Superior Court. 20', 'The defendant also cites as supporting authority a case recently decided by the Supreme Court of Kansas, State v.

The Kansas court held that the defendant-father’s confession to the police, on the day of the scheduled court hearing with respect to the termination of the defendant’s parental rights, was not voluntary and violated his right against self-incrimination. Id. at 1212. The Court reasoned that the defendant’s predicament constituted “a classic penalty situation,” which required him to either give up his right against self-incrimination or lose his parental rights. Id.', 'We reject defendant’s contention that Brown is relevant to his case. The case at bar is plainly distinguishable from Brown because the hearing justice in the present case found (and we have upheld that finding) that there was no threat made by the DCYF investigator to Mr. Gonzalez.

75,"Sharie Paul : v. : Marvin Lester Paul. : Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty, and Robinson, JJ. OPINION Justice Flaherty, for the Court. Before this Court is an appeal by Marvin Lester Paul (Marvin) from a Family Court post-judgment order in favor of his former wife, Sharie Paul (Sharie). This case came before the Court for oral argument on December 2, 2009, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After hearing the parties’ arguments and considering the memoranda submitted on behalf of each of them, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide this appeal at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Family Court. -1- I Facts and Travel In December 2005, after nearly ten years of marriage, Sharie filed a complaint for divorce. 1 Just before trial was to begin, the parties completed a Marital Settlement Agreement (agreement). However, some last-minute haggling resulted in the parties making handwritten changes to the previously negotiated and typewritten agreement. Consequently, some parts of the agreement were lined out by hand, and other handwritten language was substituted for what had been typed. These holographic revisions concerned the disposition of the parties’ rather extensive real estate interests. After a hearing on the merits, the trial justice granted both Sharie’s complaint and Marvin’s counterclaim for an absolute divorce on the grounds of irreconcilable differences. The trial justice found that the hurriedly amended agreement divided the parties’ real and personal property and that, based on the testimony of the parties that they freely and voluntarily entered into the agreement and that they understood it and believed it to be fair and equitable, the trial justice approved the agreement. He ordered that it be incorporated, but not merged in the decision for divorce. Critical to this case, the agreement provides in paragraph twelve that Marvin will pay Sharie $500,000 as an equitable distribution. The agreement further specifies that that sum shall be paid on or before March 28, 2012. 2 The payments due Sharie were to be realized through the sale of specified real estate in which the parties had an interest. The agreement requires that 1 Sharie filed a complaint for separate maintenance without commencement of divorce proceedings in June 2005. In December 2005, she moved to amend the original complaint to a complaint for divorce. The case was reached for trial on April 2, 2007. 2 As of the time of oral argument, Sharie had received $15,000 of the $500,000 to which she is entitled under the agreement. -2- Sharie receive 90 percent of the net proceeds received from the sale of any real estate delineated in the agreement, those proceeds to be applied toward the $500,000. Additionally, the agreement provides that if Marvin has not paid the $500,000 by March 28, 2012, “then in that event the Wife shall have the right to foreclose on any and all remaining properties covered by her mortgage deed and note in order to satisfy the outstanding moneys due her.” The nub of this dispute is focused on paragraph seven of the agreement. 3 Paragraph 7.A enumerates eight parcels of real estate in which title is held in Marvin’s name. As originally drafted, paragraph 7.B.1(b) states, “The Husband shall take whatever steps are necessary in order to list for sale on the open market forthwith all of the above properties except the property at 199 Providence Street, West Warwick, RI; 130 Pilgrim Parkway, Warwick, RI and 99 Vera Street, Providence, RI if this has not already been done.” However, on the day their case was heard on the merits, they amended paragraph 7.B.1(b) to read as follows: “The Husband shall take whatever steps are necessary in order to list for sale on the open market forthwith all of the above properties except the property listed at 199 Providence Street, West Warwick, RI; 130 Pilgrim Parkway, Warwick, RI and 110 Pilgrim Par[k]way Warwick RI. 99 Vera Street Warwick RI shall not be listed for sale until 4-2- 2008.” The record of the hearing is unclear as to the parties’ understanding of the handwritten amendments. The final judgment of divorce between the parties entered on August 27, 2007. In January 2008, Sharie filed a motion in which she requested that the court order the listing for 3 Attached as an addendum is page three of the agreement, which contains the disputed paragraph. -3- sale, forthwith, the properties located at 199 Providence Street, West Warwick, R.I.; 130 Pilgrim Parkway, Warwick, R.I.; 110 Pilgrim Parkway, Warwick, R.I.; and 99 Vera Street, Warwick, R.I. Marvin objected to the motion. He maintained that he had fully complied with the agreement and that the request for the immediate sale of all four properties and proceeds thereof would “constitute no more than a blatant attempt to have the Court rewrite the terms of the [P]roperty Settlement Agreement.” The Family Court conducted a hearing on April 9, 2008, to resolve the dispute. The issue before the Family Court was at what point in time the agreement required that the properties listed in paragraph 7.B.1(b) be listed for sale. The bone of contention between the parties was how to construe the handwritten changes to paragraph 7.B. The parties agreed that the property at 99 Vera Street would be immediately placed on the market for sale. However, still in controversy was whether the agreement also required the three remaining properties (199 Providence Street, West Warwick, R.I.; 130 Pilgrim Parkway, Warwick, R.I.; and 110 Pilgrim Parkway, Warwick, R.I.) to be listed for sale forthwith, or whether the Agreement exempted those three properties from being offered for sale at any particular time. Central to the dispute was the significance of a punctuation mark after the handwritten abbreviation for the state of Rhode Island set forth in the handwritten changes to the agreement. Sharie argued that the agreement required that the properties listed in paragraph 7.B.1(b) be given a one-year reprieve from being listed for sale until April 2, 2008, and thus they should have been listed for sale after that date. Marvin argued that the punctuation mark following “110 Pilgrim Par[k]way Warwick RI” was a period that ended a sentence, and therefore only 99 Vera Street was affected by the one-year reprieve, and therefore he was not required to list the other three properties for sale on any specific date. The trial justice said in the record that his understanding of the agreement was -4- that Marvin had agreed to pay Sharie $500,000 and the “mechanism” for producing that amount for her was through the sale of the properties listed in the agreement. On April 15, 2008, the Family Court issued a bench decision. The trial justice found paragraph 7.B.1(b) to be ambiguous, based on the parties’ arguments and his examination of the four corners of the agreement. Citing general contract principles, the trial justice ordered that all four properties be placed on the market for sale. He found that certain properties already had been foreclosed upon by creditors and that it was “iffy” whether the sale of the remaining properties would garner sufficient money to satisfy the equitable distribution due to Sharie. Further, the trial justice found that a contrary construction would place Marvin “in total control” over whether the properties ever were sold. Thus, on May 23, 2008, the Family Court granted Sharie’s motion to enforce and directed Marvin to place the properties at 199 Providence Street, 130 Pilgrim Parkway, 110 Pilgrim Parkway, and 99 Vera Street on the market for sale. From this ruling, Marvin timely appealed to this Court. II Issues on Appeal The issues in this case arose from the parties’ opposing views on the impact of certain punctuation in their agreement, and how the interpretation of a period point impacts their respective rights and obligations under the agreement. The primary issue on appeal is whether the trial justice erred as a matter of law when he found that the agreement was ambiguous on its face. Also at issue is whether the trial justice abused his discretion when he found that Marvin’s interpretation of paragraph 7.B.1(b) of the agreement was not the most equitable construction, and therefore construed the agreement as requiring the immediate listing for sale of the properties set forth in paragraph 7.B.1(b). -5- III Standard of Review The existence of ambiguity in a contract is a question of law. Young v. Warwick Rollermagic Skating Center, Inc., 973 A.2d 553, 558 (R.I. 2009) (citing Gorman v. Gorman, 883 A.2d 732, 738 n.8 (R.I. 2005)). We review questions of law de novo. Holden v. Salvadore, 964 A.2d 508, 513 (R.I. 2009) (citing Richards v. Halder, 853 A.2d 1206, 1209 (R.I. 2004)). Therefore, “the holding of a trial court (including the Family Court) about the existence or non- existence of ambiguity in the terms of the contract is freely reviewable by this Court.” Gorman, 883 A.2d at 738 n.8 (citing Rhode Island Depositors Economic Protection Corp. v. Bowen Court Associates, 763 A.2d 1005, 1007 (R.I. 2001)). On the other hand, we afford deference to the trial justice’s findings of fact and will not disturb them unless he or she “misconceived the relevant evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.” Horton v. Horton, 891 A.2d 885, 888 (R.I. 2006) (quoting Koutroumanos v. Tzeremes, 865 A.2d 1091, 1097 (R.I. 2005)). Thus, absent an abuse of discretion, “this Court will accept the factual findings of the trial justice.” Id. (citing Cardinale v. Cardinale, 889 A.2d 210, 217-18 (R.I. 2006)). IV Discussion A The Family Court’s Ruling that the Agreement is Ambiguous An ambiguity exists if the contract provision is “reasonably susceptible of different constructions.” Andrukiewicz v. Andrukiewicz, 860 A.2d 235, 238 (R.I. 2004) (quoting Flynn v. Flynn, 615 A.2d 119, 121 (R.I. 1992)). In making such a determination, “we view the agreement in its entirety and give to its language its ‘plain, ordinary and usual meaning.’” Vickers Antone -6- v. Vickers, 610 A.2d 120, 123 (R.I. 1992) (quoting Amica Mutual Insurance Co. v. Streicker, 583 A.2d 550, 552 (R.I. 1990)). However, “[b]ecause ambiguity lurks in every word, sentence, and paragraph in the eyes of a skilled advocate * * * the question is not whether there is an ambiguity in the metaphysical sense, but whether the language has only one reasonable meaning when construed, not in a hypertechnical fashion, but in an ordinary, common sense manner.” Garden City Treatment Center, Inc. v. Coordinated Health Partners, Inc., 852 A.2d 535, 542 (R.I. 2004) (quoting Textron, Inc. v. Aetna Casualty and Surety Co., 638 A.2d 537, 541 (R.I. 1994)) (emphasis omitted). On appeal, Marvin argues that paragraph 7.B.1(b) “is clear and unambiguous on its face.” He contends that the paragraph consists of two sentences: the first requiring the listing for sale of all the properties previously enumerated except for “the business property and the two condominiums” and the second stating that the 99 Vera Street property “need not be listed for sale until April of 2008.” He points to the “style and grammar of the entire document,” specifically previous abbreviations of “RI” without any punctuation, to support his position. On the other hand, Sharie argues that the handwritten punctuation that follows the abbreviation for the state of Rhode Island in the handwritten additions to paragraph 7.B.1(b), the paragraph “can reasonably be construed in two manners – it can be read as two separate sentences or it can be read as one sentence with a state abbreviation.” Therefore, she maintains that the Family Court correctly found that the agreement “was ambiguous on its face.” Additionally, in response to Marvin’s argument that his construction is consistent with the grammar and style of the agreement, Sharie counters that it does not so comport. She argues that although the typed references to “RI” do not contain punctuation, the instances in which “RI” is handwritten are, in fact, set off with periods. -7- After reading the agreement and the disputed paragraph and giving the terms their ordinary and usual meaning, we agree with Sharie and hold that paragraph 7.B.1(b), containing handwritten changes, is reasonably susceptible to two different meanings and therefore ambiguous. See Andrukiewicz, 860 A.2d at 238. One reasonably may read the paragraph both as one complete sentence reprieving all four properties from being listed for sale for just one year or as two sentences that defer the listing for sale of one property, but exempt the other three properties from being offered for sale. As a result of the uncertainty that inheres in the agreement’s handwritten changes, particularly the inconsistent punctuation of the abbreviation for the state of Rhode Island, this paragraph is not susceptible to merely “one reasonable meaning” when read in a “common sense manner.” 4 Garden City Treatment Center, Inc., 852 A.2d at 542 (quoting Textron, Inc., 638 A.2d at 541). Therefore, it is our opinion that the trial justice was correct when he found paragraph 7.B.1(b) to be ambiguous. B The Family Court’s Finding of Most Equitable Construction Marvin argues that the Family Court overlooked the “specific provisions of the scheme fashioned by the parties” when it found that an exemption of the properties in 7.B.1(b) from listing for sale would allow Marvin to avoid his obligation to pay Sharie the equitable distribution of $500,000. He maintains that his obligations to Sharie are “highly leveraged and the consequences of his failure to do so are quite serious.” Consequently, Marvin argues that a 4 We wish to express our concern that the parties hastily disposed of approximately $1 million in real property in what appears to be a slapdash manner as the trial was about to begin. Property settlement agreements such as the one at issue here are intended to clearly and amicably distribute the assets and liabilities of a divorcing couple, while at the same time minimizing rancor and personal animus. Obviously, there was a failure to accomplish that goal here, and the result was the very type of judicial interpretation that the parties sought to avoid. -8- requirement for the listing for sale of all of the property actually affords Sharie “greater leverage than was negotiated between the parties.” Sharie argues that the trial justice did not misconceive the evidence or abuse his discretion when he found that Marvin’s interpretation of the ambiguous provision was not the most equitable. She asserts that the trial justice’s conclusion is supported by his finding that some of the properties already had been foreclosed upon and “it would appear that it is very iffy even with the remaining properties that the plaintiff will receive the total amount of the funds due her.” Sharie contends that not requiring Marvin to immediately list the properties for sale would risk additional foreclosures before she is able to enforce her rights with respect to the remaining properties herself in March 2012. 5 Thus, potentially, she would have no means to recover the $500,000 that Marvin had agreed to pay to her. Finally, Sharie argues that eliminating Marvin’s obligation to sell these three properties gives him “an unconscionable advantage” and “flies in the face of the intent of the agreement * * * to sell the property so as to satisfy [Marvin’s] $500,000 obligation to [her].” A property settlement agreement “that is not merged into a divorce judgment retains the characteristics of a contract.” Riffenburg v. Riffenburg, 585 A.2d 627, 630 (R.I. 1991); see Ritter v. Mantissa Investment Corp., 864 A.2d 601, 607 (R.I. 2005) (holding property settlement agreement that was not merged into the divorce judgment “retains” contract “characteristics”) (quoting Riffenburg, 585 A.2d at 630). Therefore, a property settlement agreement such as the agreement here that has been incorporated by reference in, but not merged with, a divorce judgment can be modified only if the parties consent or if a ground for reformation under contract law, such as ambiguity, exists. Gorman, 883 A.2d at 740-41 (citing Riffenburg, 585 5 Sharie holds a mortgage on four other properties designated as part of the marital estate but not referred to in the disputed paragraph seven of the agreement. -9- A.2d at 630). As we have discussed, this agreement is ambiguous; thus, the Family Court had the authority to construe the ambiguous contract provision and modify the agreement accordingly. Id. at 746. When he does so, the trial justice “should adopt that construction which is most equitable and which will not give to one party an unconscionable advantage over the other.” Donelan v. Donelan, 741 A.2d 268, 270 (R.I. 1999) (quoting Flynn, 615 A.2d at 122). Additionally, this Court has held that “it is necessary to examine both the circumstances surrounding the development of the ambiguous terms and the intentions of the parties.” Flynn, 615 A.2d at 121. Indeed, “one of the cardinal rules of construction of agreements is that the meaning should be gathered from the entire context and the language should be interpreted so as to subserve, and not subvert, the general intention of the parties * * *.” Massasoit Housing Corp. v. Town of North Kingstown, 75 R.I. 211, 217, 65 A.2d 38, 40 (1949) (citing 12 Am. Jur. Contracts § 241 (1938)). This Court affords great deference to the trial justice’s findings of fact that support his conclusion that Sharie’s interpretation of the ambiguous paragraph was the most equitable in light of the parties’ intentions under the agreement. See Horton, 891 A.2d at 888 (citing Koutroumanos, 865 A.2d at 1097). Thus, we will overturn these findings only if he overlooked or misconceived the relevant evidence or otherwise was clearly wrong. Id. It is our opinion that the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive the relevant evidence when he found that Marvin’s construction of the ambiguous provision, which would exempt several of the properties from listing for sale, was not the most equitable because such a construction is ineffective to achieve the agreement’s overarching goal, which is to provide Sharie with $500,000, produced by the sale of the enumerated properties. - 10 - We hold that the findings of the trial justice are supported by the record, and we decline to disturb them on review. He found that the agreement directed “certain properties that were marital assets” to be sold and Sharie should receive the “net proceeds * * * until she receives the sum of $500,000.” This finding is supported by the agreement’s provision that directs Marvin to pay to Sharie the amount of the equitable distribution and then sets forth in detail the mechanism through which this distribution will be realized, specifically, the sale of “any parcel of real estate identified in [the] Agreement.” The trial justice based his conclusion on the fact that several of the properties already had been foreclosed upon, thus making it likely that the remaining properties could not generate the amount that Marvin had agreed to pay Sharie unless they were listed for sale immediately. It is our opinion that this is a logical conclusion supported by the record, and thus is not clearly wrong. Further, the trial justice was not clearly wrong when he found that Marvin’s interpretation of the ambiguous provision would give him an unconscionable advantage over Sharie by affording Marvin an inordinate amount of control with respect to disposition of the property and, consequently, over his obligation to pay her $500,000. See Donelan, 741 A.2d at 270. Similarly, he also was not clearly wrong when he found that Marvin’s interpretation would “subvert” the intention of the parties, which is clearly embodied in the agreement, that the sale of the enumerated properties is the primary mechanism through which to generate the funds to satisfy the equitable distribution due to Sharie. See Massasoit Housing Corporation, 75 R.I. at 217, 65 A.2d at 40-41. For these reasons, we hold that the trial justice did not err when he ruled that Sharie’s interpretation was the most equitable construction of the ambiguous provision and when he ordered the three properties in question to be listed for sale forthwith. - 11 - V Conclusion We affirm the order of the Family Court, to which we remand the record in this case. - 12 - Supreme Court No. 2008-222-Appeal. (K 05-378M) Sharie Paul : v. : Marvin Lester Paul. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. Before this Court is an appeal by Marvin Lester Paul (Marvin) from a Family Court post-judgment order in favor of his former wife, Sharie Paul (Sharie). This case came before the Court for oral argument on December 2, 2009, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After hearing the parties’ arguments and considering the memoranda submitted on behalf of each of them, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide this appeal at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Family Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In December 2005, after nearly ten years of marriage, Sharie filed a complaint for divorce. 1 Just before trial was to begin, the parties completed a Marital Settlement Agreement (agreement). However, some last-minute haggling resulted in the parties making handwritten changes to the previously negotiated and typewritten agreement. Consequently, some parts of the agreement were lined out by hand, and other handwritten language was substituted for what had been typed. These holographic revisions concerned the disposition of the parties’ rather extensive real estate interests. After a hearing on the merits, the trial justice granted both Sharie’s complaint and Marvin’s counterclaim for an absolute divorce on the grounds of irreconcilable differences. The trial justice found that the hurriedly amended agreement divided the parties’ real and personal property and that, based on the testimony of the parties that they freely and voluntarily entered into the agreement and that they understood it and believed it to be fair and equitable, the trial justice approved the agreement. He ordered that it be incorporated, but not merged in the decision for divorce.', 'Critical to this case, the agreement provides in paragraph twelve that Marvin will pay Sharie $500,000 as an equitable distribution.

Marvin objected to the motion. He maintained that he had fully complied with the agreement and that the request for the immediate sale of all four properties and proceeds thereof would “constitute no more than a blatant attempt to have the Court rewrite the terms of the [P]roperty Settlement Agreement.” The Family Court conducted a hearing on April 9, 2008, to resolve the dispute.', 'The issue before the Family Court was at what point in time the agreement required that the properties listed in paragraph 7.B.1(b) be listed for sale. The bone of contention between the parties was how to construe the handwritten changes to paragraph 7.B. The parties agreed that the property at 99 Vera Street would be immediately placed on the market for sale. However, still in controversy was whether the agreement also required the three remaining properties (199 Providence Street, West Warwick, R.I.; 130 Pilgrim Parkway, Warwick, R.I.; and 110 Pilgrim Parkway, Warwick, R.I.) to be listed for sale forthwith, or whether the Agreement exempted those three properties from being offered for sale at any particular time.

Donelan, 741 A.2d 268, 270 (R.I. 1999) (quoting Flynn, 615 A.2d at 122). Additionally, this Court has held that “it is necessary to examine both the circumstances surrounding the development of the ambiguous terms and the intentions of the parties.” Flynn, 615 A.2d at 121. Indeed, “one of the cardinal rules of construction of agreements is that the meaning should be gathered from the entire context and the language should be interpreted so as to subserve, and not subvert, the general intention of the parties * * *.” Massasoit Housing Corp. v.

See Horton, 891 A.2d at 888 (citing Koutroumanos, 865 A.2d at 1097). Thus, we will overturn these findings only if he overlooked or misconceived the relevant evidence or otherwise was clearly wrong. Id. It is our opinion that the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive the relevant evidence when he found that Marvin’s construction of the ambiguous provision, which would exempt several of the properties from listing for sale, was not the most equitable because such a construction is ineffective to achieve the agreement’s overarching goal, which is to provide Sharie with $500,000, produced by the sale of the enumerated properties.', '- 10 -', 'We hold that the findings of the trial justice are supported by the record, and we decline to disturb them on review. He found that the agreement directed “certain properties that were marital assets” to be sold and Sharie should receive the “net proceeds * * * until she receives the sum of $500,000.” This finding is supported by the agreement’s provision that directs Marvin to pay to Sharie the amount of the equitable distribution and then sets forth in detail the mechanism through which this distribution will be realized, specifically, the sale of “any parcel of real estate identified in [the] Agreement.” The trial justice based his conclusion on the fact that several of the properties already had been foreclosed upon, thus making it likely that the remaining properties could not generate the amount that Marvin had agreed to pay Sharie unless they were listed for sale immediately. It is our opinion that this is a logical conclusion supported by the record, and thus is not clearly wrong.', 'Further, the trial justice was not clearly wrong when he found that Marvin’s interpretation of the ambiguous provision would give him an unconscionable advantage over Sharie by affording Marvin an inordinate amount of control with respect to disposition of the property and, consequently, over his obligation to pay her $500,000.', 'See Donelan, 741 A.2d at 270. Similarly, he also was not clearly wrong when he found that Marvin’s interpretation would “subvert” the intention of the parties, which is clearly embodied in the agreement, that the sale of the enumerated properties is the primary mechanism through which to generate the funds to satisfy the equitable distribution due to Sharie. See Massasoit Housing Corporation, 75 R.I. at 217, 65 A.2d at 40-41. For these reasons, we hold that the trial justice did not err when he ruled that Sharie’s interpretation was the most equitable construction of the ambiguous provision and when he ordered the three properties in question to be listed for sale forthwith.', '- 11 -', 'V', 'Conclusion We affirm the order of the Family Court, to which we remand the record in this case.', '- 12 -', 'Supreme Court', 'No. 2008-222-Appeal.', '(K 05-378M)', 'Sharie Paul', ':', 'v.', ': Marvin Lester Paul.', ':', 'NOTICE: This opinion is subject to formal revision before publication in', 'the Rhode Island Reporter.

The defendant proceeded to give an oral statement to Detective Brigandi. That statement was subsequently reduced to writing in a document in which Detective Brigandi paraphrased what defendant had stated orally.2 In his statement to Detective Brigandi, Mr. Pagan admitted, inter alia, to breaking into Greg’s Seafood Restaurant in July of 1998. The defendant was thereafter charged by criminal information in Rhode Island with breaking and entering with felonious intent in connection with the alleged break-in at the restaurant.', 'In February of 2003, Mr. Pagan’s case was reached for trial before a jury in the Washington County (Rhode Island) Superior Court.

Later that day, the prosecution produced a copy of the document, and it sought to call Detective Brigandi as a witness in order to authenticate the arrest warrant and supporting affidavit. Detective Brigandi testified that, acting in accordance with the trial justice’s request earlier that day, he had asked the West Hartford Police Department to locate Mr. Pagan’s arrest warrant; shortly thereafter a facsimile copy of the warrant was introduced as an exhibit. Although he was unable to identify which Connecticut judge had signed the document, Detective Brigandi was able to identify the prosecutorial official’s signature on the document as well as the signatures of the two affiants.', 'After considering the testimony of Detective Brigandi and after reviewing the copy of the arrest warrant and supporting affidavit that the prosecution had produced at his request, the trial justice expressly found that document to be a “truthful, exact copy of an original that was executed * * * in advance of the defendant’s arrest.” The trial justice further found that the document had “all of the indicia of * * * [re]liability and credibility.” On the basis of those findings, the trial justice held that defendant had not been subjected to an illegal arrest in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights.', 'In support of his contention that the trial justice erred in finding that his arrest in Connecticut was not illegal, defendant directs our attention to State v. Taylor, 621 A.2d 1252 4', 'In Connecticut, an arrest warrant and the affidavit in support thereof are combined as one single document.', '-4- (R.I. 1993). In Taylor, this Court noted that “[i]t is well-settled law that when a state intends to justify an arrest on the basis of a warrant, the burden is on the state to produce the warrant and supporting affidavit in order that the trial court can determine whether the warrant was properly issued and constitutionally sufficient.” Id. at 1254. The defendant’s reliance on the Taylor case is misplaced, however, because in the instant case the prosecution did eventually produce a copy of the document that contained both the arrest warrant and the supporting affidavit (see footnote 4, supra). After examining that document and after considering the testimony of Detective Brigandi, the trial justice determined that “the warrant met all the technical requirements for its validity.” See id.

77,"Cayetano Giron et al. : v. : Jane F. Bailey et al. : Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty, and Robinson, JJ. OPINION Justice Flaherty, for the Court. Jane Bailey, the owner of residential rental property, appeals from Superior Court judgments in favor of her tenants, Cayetano and Robin Giron. The Girons’ claim against Bailey emanates from Cayetano’s1 fall from a second-floor porch to the street after the porch railing collapsed. The parties appeared for oral argument on November 3, 2009, pursuant to an order of this Court ordering them to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided without further briefing or argument. After considering the record, the memoranda submitted by the parties, and the oral arguments advanced by each, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that the case should be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgments of the Superior Court. 1 We refer to the Girons by their first names, Cayetano and Robin. This is for the reader’s ease, and we do not intend any disrespect. -1- I Facts and Travel In the evening hours of September 30, 1999, Robin answered a telephone call for her daughter Jill, and gave the telephone to Cayetano to locate Jill. Cayetano called out for Jill to answer the phone, but she did not respond. Cayetano then walked onto porch to see if Jill was either on the porch or in the street below. After taking four steps, Cayetano’s foot sank into the soft-wooden floorboards. He tripped, lost his balance, and fell forward toward the right porch railing. He had the telephone in one hand, and he reached out for the porch railing with his free hand in an attempt to break his fall. Unfortunately, the porch railing broke free from the columns to which it had been attached, and Cayetano plunged from the second floor onto the sidewalk below; the railing crashed to the ground with him. Over a year before this incident, in August 1998, Cayetano and Robin Giron moved into the second-floor apartment at 221 Union Avenue in Providence. The building was owned by Jane Bailey and managed by her son, Marshall Bailey.2 Jane never visited the property and Marshall acted at all times as if he was the landlord of the building. A contractor, Marshall performed repairs to the building and also collected the rents from the tenants. Immediately after moving into the apartment, Robin Giron notified Marshall about the poor condition of the second-floor porch. She described the wooden porch as “a little lopped,” and although she sat on the porch occasionally, she never went near the front railings, preferring to sit just to the right of the porch door. She said that Marshall told her that he planned to construct a new second-floor porch, but no new porch ever was built. Charles Norris, the third- 2 As we have done with the Girons, we frequently refer to Marshall Bailey and Jane Bailey by their first names. This is for the reader’s ease, and we do not intend any disrespect. -2- floor tenant, frequently used the porch, and he agreed that some parts of the wooden floor were rotted and in need of repair. Cayetano never went on the porch prior to the day of his fall. The second-floor porch railing was composed of four wooden columns and three separate metal railings that spanned the width of the front of the house. Each railing section was affixed to two wooden columns with screws at the top and bottom of each side of the railing. The four wooden columns extended from the ceiling to the floor. On September 29, 1999, Robin had a couch delivered to her apartment. The couch was lifted from the street and hoisted over the second-floor porch railing. During that process, it came into contact with the middle section of the railing. As a result, both screws affixing one side of the middle railing to the columns became detached, causing the railing to hang precariously, rather than in its normal upright position. Robin called Marshall later that day and told him that the middle railing had been damaged. Marshall came to the house that night. Marshall testified that from the street he observed that the right railing, the same railing that Cayetano later would fall through, and not the middle railing struck by the couch, “looked loose,” but that it remained attached to the columns. When Marshall took another look at the right railing from the second floor, he thought that the railing looked bent, not loose. He said that he told Robin to stay off the porch and also said that he locked the porch door with a deadbolt. He conceded, however, that he did not put up any warning tape and that the deadbolt could be unlocked from the inside without using a key.3 Robin testified that Marshall looked at the middle railing from the second-floor window, but she never saw Marshall go out onto the porch to inspect the railing; she did indicate she may 3 Marshall also said that he spoke with the third-floor tenant, Charles Norris, about the porch’s condition but Norris had no recollection of being so warned prior to Cayetano’s fall on September 30. -3- have heard him go onto the porch. According to Robin, Marshall said that he would fix the railing, but he took no action before Cayetano was injured. She also denied that Marshall instructed her to stay off the porch. The day after Cayetano’s misfortune, Robin telephoned Marshall to report the fall. Robin also took photographs of the missing right porch railing, the previously damaged middle porch railing, and the porch floorboards. Later that day, Marshall came to the house and nailed the porch door shut. At that time, he also told Robin and Charles Norris to stay off the porch. At a later point in time, Marshall replaced all the metal porch railings with railings made of wood. On September 27, 2002, Cayetano and Robin Giron filed a complaint in Superior Court against Jane and Marshall Bailey.4 The Girons alleged that on September 30, 1999, the Baileys “negligently and recklessly failed to exercise proper due care to maintain the common areas” and that Cayetano Giron tumbled from the second-floor porch and suffered injury “due to defective railings and dangerous conditions maintained by the Baileys.” Robin Giron claimed that she had suffered a loss of consortium as a result of Cayetano’s injuries. The trial began on February 13, 2008. Robin, Jane, Robin’s daughter Jill Jones, Marshall, and Cayetano all were called to testify during plaintiffs’ case. Although he did not appear personally, portions of Charles Norris’s deposition transcript were read into the record. The Girons also introduced photographs of the second-floor porch, taken the day after Cayetano’s fall. Jane Bailey offered no witnesses. Before the trial justice submitted the evidence for the jury’s consideration, Jane moved for a judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil 4 A default judgment was entered against Marshall Bailey after he failed to respond to the complaint. Subsequently, Marshall filed a suggestion of bankruptcy in the Superior Court. -4- Procedure.5 In her motion, she argued that she was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the Girons had failed “to introduce expert testimony that the railing was unreasonably dangerous or defective or that [Bailey] should have known that the railing was unreasonably dangerous or defective.” The trial justice denied Jane’s Rule 50 motion, ruling that expert testimony was not required to support a finding of negligence. The trial justice determined that either the accounts of Robin or Charles Norris’s deposition testimony that a couch damaged the middle railing and Marshall was notified about it, or Marshall’s testimony that the right railing was loose or bent, provided sufficient evidence of negligence to survive a Rule 50 motion. She reasoned further that Jane, through her agent Marshall, was on notice of a dangerous condition on the property; specifically, that the porch railings were bent or had become detached as a result of minimal contact, and she failed to take any action to either repair the dangerous condition or warn her tenants of its existence. According to the trial justice, “[t]he jury wouldn’t be speculating, they’d be drawing the reasonable inference that this was a damaged railing.” The jury found that Jane Bailey breached her duty to the Girons, and that this breach was the proximate cause of Cayetano’s injuries. The jury further determined that Cayetano did not assume the risk of his injuries nor was he negligent in causing his injuries. A judgment was 5 Rule 50(a)(1) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure provides that: “If during a trial by jury a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue, the court may determine the issue against that party and may grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law against that party with respect to a claim or defense that cannot under the controlling law be maintained or defeated without a favorable finding on that issue.” -5- entered on February 19, 2008, for Cayetano Giron for $180,000 and for Robin Giron for $10,000.6 Bailey timely appealed. On appeal, Bailey asks this Court to reverse the trial justice’s denial of her Rule 50 motion and to enter judgment as a matter of law in her favor. As grounds, Bailey argues that expert testimony was required to determine if the railing was defective, and if so, whether that defect was the proximate cause of Cayetano’s fall. Bailey argues that it was not within the jury’s common knowledge or experience to determine the cause of the railing’s failure. The Girons ask this Court to affirm the denial of Bailey’s Rule 50 motion because the trial justice correctly ruled that expert testimony was not required because there “was substantial, reliable and probative [evidence] for the jury to find, without expert testimony, that Jane Bailey was negligent.” II Standard of Review “Our review of a trial justice’s decision on a motion for judgment as a matter of law is de novo.” Gianquitti v. Atwood Medical Associates, Ltd., 973 A.2d 580, 589 (R.I. 2009) (citing Franco v. Latina, 916 A.2d 1251, 1258 (R.I. 2007)). We review the trial justice’s decision by applying the same standard as the trial justice: we “consider[] the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, without weighing the evidence or evaluating the credibility of witnesses, and draw[] from the record all reasonable inferences that support the position of the nonmoving party.” Tedesco v. Connors, 871 A.2d 920, 927 (R.I. 2005) (quoting Mills v. State Sales, Inc., 824 A.2d 461, 472 (R.I. 2003)). 6 Bailey renewed her Rule 50 motion after the jury verdict. The trial justice denied this motion as well upon the same grounds as she denied the pre-verdict motion. -6- III Analysis In a civil action that alleges injury as a result of a defendant’s negligence, “plaintiff must establish a legally cognizable duty owed by a defendant to a plaintiff, a breach of that duty, proximate causation between the conduct and the resulting injury, and the actual loss or damage.” Selwyn v. Ward, 879 A.2d 882, 886 (R.I. 2005) (quoting Mills, 824 A.2d at 467). A Deviation from the Standard of Care In Rhode Island, “a landowner has a duty to exercise reasonable care for the safety of persons reasonably expected to be on the premises, and that duty includes an obligation to protect against the risks of a dangerous condition existing on the premises, provided the landowner knows of, or by the exercise of reasonable care would have discovered, the dangerous condition.” Tancrelle v. Friendly Ice Cream Corp., 756 A.2d 744, 752 (R.I. 2000) (citing Cutroneo v. F.W. Woolworth Co., 112 R.I. 696, 698, 315 A.2d 56, 58 (1974)). If the landowner rents residential property to tenants, the Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (the act), codified in G.L. 1956 chapter 18 of title 34, imposes a still higher standard of care. It states that “[a] landlord shall: * * * [m]ake all repairs and do whatever is necessary to put and keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition.” Section 34-18-22(a)(2). The act “supersede[s] any common-law rules relating to residential tenants and landlords in conflict with its provisions.” Errico v. LaMountain, 713 A.2d 791, 794 (R.I. 1998). Here, the Girons, although never explicitly pleading that their cause of action arose from the duty imposed upon landlords by the act, nonetheless effectively stated a claim that Bailey had violated the duty imposed by it. The trial justice adopted the standard of care created by the act -7- and Jane never objected. For these reasons, we hold that the standard of care provided by the act, supplemented by common law, governs this case. That is, in addition to a landlord’s statutory duty to make repairs and do whatever is necessary to maintain the premises in a fit and habitable condition, the landlord has an obligation to exercise reasonable care for the safety of those expected to be on the premises and to protect against dangerous conditions existing on the premises. See Tancrelle, 756 A.2d at 752 (summarizing landowners duty to those reasonably expected to be on the premises); Errico, 713 A.2d at 794 (determining that the act displaces only those common law rules in conflict with the act’s provisions). In Errico, 713 A.2d at 792, we considered whether landlords breached their duty under the act to their tenant, Errico, when a second-floor wooden balcony railing collapsed after Errico leaned against it, precipitating her fall to the ground. This Court determined that “the observable evidence of the railing’s physical deterioration, in conjunction with defendants’ admission that they had inspected the railing at various times before the accident occurred, supports the conclusion of the jury and the trial justice that the railing was structurally unsound when Errico fell and that defendants either knew of this condition or failed to inspect the railing properly to detect this structural problem, thereby breaching their statutory duty to Errico.” Id. at 795. Similarly, in this case, Marshall testified that the railing through which Cayetano fell was loose or bent and Robin testified that she told Marshall about the damage to the middle railing. Also, there was evidence about the deterioration of the porch floor that caused Cayetano to trip and fall into the right railing, leading, ultimately, to his injuries. Jane had constructive notice of the deteriorating condition of the railing and the porch floor because Marshall, her agent, had actual notice of both. This evidence supports a conclusion that the porch railing constituted a dangerous condition, and that the landlord, Jane, failed to keep the premises in a fit and habitable -8- condition as required by § 34-18-22(a)(2). As a result, she breached her duty of care to the Girons. Cf. Ramos v. Granajo, 822 A.2d 936, 938-39 (R.I. 2003) (holding that tenant failed to establish that the landlord breached his duty because tenant offered no evidence that landlord failed to properly maintain second floor balcony or that the landlord was aware of tenant’s use of deck to move furniture into the second floor or that such a practice was common). B Proximate Causation Jane argues that even if she did deviate from the standard of care she owed the Girons, a jury could not determine, absent expert testimony, whether that deviation was the proximate cause of Cayetano’s fall and resulting injuries. This is so, she claims, because the Girons introduced no evidence that would show that a properly maintained railing could have supported Cayetano’s weight and the force with which he struck the railing, and thus prevented his fall. According to Jane, only an expert could testify to whether Cayetano fell because the railing was defective or, alternatively, because the force he exerted was such that even a properly installed and maintained railing could not withstand Cayetano’s impact.7 In response, the Girons argue that the evidence adduced at trial was sufficient to prove that the railing was an unreasonably dangerous condition, and that this, along with the condition of the porch floorboards, proximately caused Cayetano’s fall. Significantly, they emphasize that 7 Jane argues that a Connecticut Appellate Court case, DeOliveira v. PMG Land Associates, L.P., 939 A.2d 2 (Conn. App. Ct. 2008), is persuasive. However, her reliance on DeOliveira is misplaced. In that case, the plaintiff, a painter, was unable to remember how he fell from a second floor balcony while painting a condominium’s exterior, and he could not demonstrate that the landowners had any prior notice about defective rail conditions. Id. at 6-7. The DeOliveira court upheld the entry of summary judgment in favor of the defendant because the plaintiff failed to establish any connection between an alleged defect in the guardrail and the plaintiff’s injury. Id. at 8. Here, however, plaintiffs have introduced evidence about the condition of the railing and porch, about defendant’s notice of those conditions, and of causation between those conditions and Cayetano’s fall from the porch. -9- an abundance of evidence supporting Bailey’s negligence exists beyond the fitness of the railing itself, including the rotted porch floor and the failure to repair this condition or to warn the tenants about this condition, all of which contributed directly to Cayetano’s losing his footing, his subsequent fall into the railing, and ultimately, his fall to the sidewalk. Rule 702 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence provides that expert testimony is permissible “[i]f scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of fact or opinion.” This Court has held that “expert testimony is required to establish any matter that is not obvious to a lay person and thus lies beyond common knowledge.” Mills, 824 A.2d at 468 (holding expert testimony necessary to establish the “existence of a causal relationship between a particular toxin and its effect on the human body”); see also Broadley v. State, 939 A.2d 1016, 1019, 1022 (R.I. 2008) (expert testimony required to establish standard of care owed to plaintiff patient by the staff at facility for the disabled); Boccasile v.

Rhode Island Public Transit Authority, 740 A.2d 1243, 1248 (R.I. 1999) (citing Allen v. State, 420 A.2d 70, 72-73 (R.I. 1980)). But expert testimony is not necessary “[i]f all the facts and circumstances can be accurately described to a jury and if the jury is as capable of comprehending and understanding such facts and drawing correct conclusions from them as is - 10 - the expert * * *.” Allen, 420 A.2d at 73 (quoting Barenbaum v. Richardson, 114 R.I. 87, 90-91, 328 A.2d 731, 733 (1974)). We hold that the evidence enabled the jury to conclude, without the necessity of expert testimony, that the landlord’s breach was a proximate cause of Cayetano’s fall through the railing onto the sidewalk. Cayetano’s stumble on the poorly maintained porch floor caused him to be propelled to the railing. He grasped the railing with one hand in an attempt to halt his fall, but the railing did not support him. The existence of defects in the railing and the floor, Bailey’s awareness of them, and the failure to sufficiently protect or warn Cayetano about these conditions, is more than sufficient evidence for a jury to find that Bailey’s breach of her duty was the proximate cause of Cayetano’s injuries. On these facts, the jury was not speculating about whether the defendant’s breach of her duty was the proximate cause; there was sufficient evidence of causation and expert testimony was not required. IV Conclusion For the reasons set forth, we affirm the judgments in favor of Cayetano and Robin Giron. We return the record to the Superior Court. - 11 - Supreme Court No. 2008-179-Appeal. (PC 02-5493) Cayetano Giron et al. : v. : Jane F. Bailey et al. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. Jane Bailey, the owner of residential rental property, appeals from Superior Court judgments in favor of her tenants, Cayetano and Robin Giron. The Girons’ claim against Bailey emanates from Cayetano’s1 fall from a second-floor porch to the street after the porch railing collapsed. The parties appeared for oral argument on November 3, 2009, pursuant to an order of this Court ordering them to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided without further briefing or argument.', 'After considering the record, the memoranda submitted by the parties, and the oral arguments advanced by each, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that the case should be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgments of the Superior Court. 1', 'We refer to the Girons by their first names, Cayetano and Robin. This is for the reader’s ease, and we do not intend any disrespect.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In the evening hours of September 30, 1999, Robin answered a telephone call for her daughter Jill, and gave the telephone to Cayetano to locate Jill. Cayetano called out for Jill to answer the phone, but she did not respond. Cayetano then walked onto porch to see if Jill was either on the porch or in the street below. After taking four steps, Cayetano’s foot sank into the soft-wooden floorboards. He tripped, lost his balance, and fell forward toward the right porch railing. He had the telephone in one hand, and he reached out for the porch railing with his free hand in an attempt to break his fall. Unfortunately, the porch railing broke free from the columns to which it had been attached, and Cayetano plunged from the second floor onto the sidewalk below; the railing crashed to the ground with him.', 'Over a year before this incident, in August 1998, Cayetano and Robin Giron moved into the second-floor apartment at 221 Union Avenue in Providence. The building was owned by Jane Bailey and managed by her son, Marshall Bailey.2 Jane never visited the property and Marshall acted at all times as if he was the landlord of the building. A contractor, Marshall performed repairs to the building and also collected the rents from the tenants.', 'Immediately after moving into the apartment, Robin Giron notified Marshall about the poor condition of the second-floor porch. She described the wooden porch as “a little lopped,” and although she sat on the porch occasionally, she never went near the front railings, preferring to sit just to the right of the porch door. She said that Marshall told her that he planned to construct a new second-floor porch, but no new porch ever was built. Charles Norris, the third- 2', 'As we have done with the Girons, we frequently refer to Marshall Bailey and Jane Bailey by their first names. This is for the reader’s ease, and we do not intend any disrespect.', '-2- floor tenant, frequently used the porch, and he agreed that some parts of the wooden floor were rotted and in need of repair. Cayetano never went on the porch prior to the day of his fall.', 'The second-floor porch railing was composed of four wooden columns and three separate metal railings that spanned the width of the front of the house. Each railing section was affixed to two wooden columns with screws at the top and bottom of each side of the railing. The four wooden columns extended from the ceiling to the floor.', 'On September 29, 1999, Robin had a couch delivered to her apartment. The couch was lifted from the street and hoisted over the second-floor porch railing. During that process, it came into contact with the middle section of the railing. As a result, both screws affixing one side of the middle railing to the columns became detached, causing the railing to hang precariously, rather than in its normal upright position.', 'Robin called Marshall later that day and told him that the middle railing had been damaged. Marshall came to the house that night. Marshall testified that from the street he observed that the right railing, the same railing that Cayetano later would fall through, and not the middle railing struck by the couch, “looked loose,” but that it remained attached to the columns. When Marshall took another look at the right railing from the second floor, he thought that the railing looked bent, not loose. He said that he told Robin to stay off the porch and also said that he locked the porch door with a deadbolt. He conceded, however, that he did not put up any warning tape and that the deadbolt could be unlocked from the inside without using a key.3', 'Robin testified that Marshall looked at the middle railing from the second-floor window, but she never saw Marshall go out onto the porch to inspect the railing; she did indicate she may 3', 'Marshall also said that he spoke with the third-floor tenant, Charles Norris, about the porch’s condition but Norris had no recollection of being so warned prior to Cayetano’s fall on September 30.', '-3- have heard him go onto the porch. According to Robin, Marshall said that he would fix the railing, but he took no action before Cayetano was injured. She also denied that Marshall instructed her to stay off the porch.', 'The day after Cayetano’s misfortune, Robin telephoned Marshall to report the fall. Robin also took photographs of the missing right porch railing, the previously damaged middle porch railing, and the porch floorboards. Later that day, Marshall came to the house and nailed the porch door shut. At that time, he also told Robin and Charles Norris to stay off the porch. At a later point in time, Marshall replaced all the metal porch railings with railings made of wood.', 'On September 27, 2002, Cayetano and Robin Giron filed a complaint in Superior Court against Jane and Marshall Bailey.4 The Girons alleged that on September 30, 1999, the Baileys “negligently and recklessly failed to exercise proper due care to maintain the common areas” and that Cayetano Giron tumbled from the second-floor porch and suffered injury “due to defective railings and dangerous conditions maintained by the Baileys.” Robin Giron claimed that she had suffered a loss of consortium as a result of Cayetano’s injuries.', 'The trial began on February 13, 2008.', 'Robin, Jane, Robin’s daughter Jill Jones, Marshall, and Cayetano all were called to testify during plaintiffs’ case. Although he did not appear personally, portions of Charles Norris’s deposition transcript were read into the record. The Girons also introduced photographs of the second-floor porch, taken the day after Cayetano’s fall. Jane Bailey offered no witnesses.', 'Before the trial justice submitted the evidence for the jury’s consideration, Jane moved for a judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil 4', 'A default judgment was entered against Marshall Bailey after he failed to respond to the complaint. Subsequently, Marshall filed a suggestion of bankruptcy in the Superior Court.', '-4- Procedure.5 In her motion, she argued that she was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the Girons had failed “to introduce expert testimony that the railing was unreasonably dangerous or defective or that [Bailey] should have known that the railing was unreasonably dangerous or defective.”', 'The trial justice denied Jane’s Rule 50 motion, ruling that expert testimony was not required to support a finding of negligence. The trial justice determined that either the accounts of Robin or Charles Norris’s deposition testimony that a couch damaged the middle railing and Marshall was notified about it, or Marshall’s testimony that the right railing was loose or bent, provided sufficient evidence of negligence to survive a Rule 50 motion. She reasoned further that Jane, through her agent Marshall, was on notice of a dangerous condition on the property; specifically, that the porch railings were bent or had become detached as a result of minimal contact, and she failed to take any action to either repair the dangerous condition or warn her tenants of its existence.', 'According to the trial justice, “[t]he jury wouldn’t be speculating, they’d be drawing the reasonable inference that this was a damaged railing.”', 'The jury found that Jane Bailey breached her duty to the Girons, and that this breach was the proximate cause of Cayetano’s injuries. The jury further determined that Cayetano did not assume the risk of his injuries nor was he negligent in causing his injuries.', 'A judgment was 5', 'Rule 50(a)(1) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure provides that:', '“If during a trial by jury a party has been fully heard on an issue', 'and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable', 'jury to find for that party on that issue, the court may determine the', 'issue against that party and may grant a motion for judgment as a', 'matter of law against that party with respect to a claim or defense', 'that cannot under the controlling law be maintained or defeated', 'without a favorable finding on that issue.”', '-5- entered on February 19, 2008, for Cayetano Giron for $180,000 and for Robin Giron for $10,000.6 Bailey timely appealed.', 'On appeal, Bailey asks this Court to reverse the trial justice’s denial of her Rule 50 motion and to enter judgment as a matter of law in her favor. As grounds, Bailey argues that expert testimony was required to determine if the railing was defective, and if so, whether that defect was the proximate cause of Cayetano’s fall. Bailey argues that it was not within the jury’s common knowledge or experience to determine the cause of the railing’s failure. The Girons ask this Court to affirm the denial of Bailey’s Rule 50 motion because the trial justice correctly ruled that expert testimony was not required because there “was substantial, reliable and probative [evidence] for the jury to find, without expert testimony, that Jane Bailey was negligent.”', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“Our review of a trial justice’s decision on a motion for judgment as a matter of law is de novo.” Gianquitti v.

Ward, 879 A.2d 882, 886 (R.I. 2005) (quoting Mills, 824 A.2d at 467).', 'A', 'Deviation from the Standard of Care', 'In Rhode Island, “a landowner has a duty to exercise reasonable care for the safety of persons reasonably expected to be on the premises, and that duty includes an obligation to protect against the risks of a dangerous condition existing on the premises, provided the landowner knows of, or by the exercise of reasonable care would have discovered, the dangerous condition.” Tancrelle v. Friendly Ice Cream Corp., 756 A.2d 744, 752 (R.I. 2000) (citing Cutroneo v. F.W. Woolworth Co., 112 R.I. 696, 698, 315 A.2d 56, 58 (1974)).', 'If the landowner rents residential property to tenants, the Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (the act), codified in G.L. 1956 chapter 18 of title 34, imposes a still higher standard of care. It states that “[a] landlord shall: * * * [m]ake all repairs and do whatever is necessary to put and keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition.” Section 34-18-22(a)(2). The act “supersede[s] any common-law rules relating to residential tenants and landlords in conflict with its provisions.” Errico v. LaMountain, 713 A.2d 791, 794 (R.I. 1998).', 'Here, the Girons, although never explicitly pleading that their cause of action arose from the duty imposed upon landlords by the act, nonetheless effectively stated a claim that Bailey had violated the duty imposed by it. The trial justice adopted the standard of care created by the act', '-7- and Jane never objected. For these reasons, we hold that the standard of care provided by the act, supplemented by common law, governs this case. That is, in addition to a landlord’s statutory duty to make repairs and do whatever is necessary to maintain the premises in a fit and habitable condition, the landlord has an obligation to exercise reasonable care for the safety of those expected to be on the premises and to protect against dangerous conditions existing on the premises. See Tancrelle, 756 A.2d at 752 (summarizing landowners duty to those reasonably expected to be on the premises); Errico, 713 A.2d at 794 (determining that the act displaces only those common law rules in conflict with the act’s provisions).', 'In Errico, 713 A.2d at 792, we considered whether landlords breached their duty under the act to their tenant, Errico, when a second-floor wooden balcony railing collapsed after Errico leaned against it, precipitating her fall to the ground. This Court determined that “the observable evidence of the railing’s physical deterioration, in conjunction with defendants’ admission that they had inspected the railing at various times before the accident occurred, supports the conclusion of the jury and the trial justice that the railing was structurally unsound when Errico fell and that defendants either knew of this condition or failed to inspect the railing properly to detect this structural problem, thereby breaching their statutory duty to Errico.” Id. at 795.', 'Similarly, in this case, Marshall testified that the railing through which Cayetano fell was loose or bent and Robin testified that she told Marshall about the damage to the middle railing. Also, there was evidence about the deterioration of the porch floor that caused Cayetano to trip and fall into the right railing, leading, ultimately, to his injuries. Jane had constructive notice of the deteriorating condition of the railing and the porch floor because Marshall, her agent, had actual notice of both. This evidence supports a conclusion that the porch railing constituted a dangerous condition, and that the landlord, Jane, failed to keep the premises in a fit and habitable', '-8- condition as required by § 34-18-22(a)(2). As a result, she breached her duty of care to the Girons. Cf. Ramos v. Granajo, 822 A.2d 936, 938-39 (R.I. 2003) (holding that tenant failed to establish that the landlord breached his duty because tenant offered no evidence that landlord failed to properly maintain second floor balcony or that the landlord was aware of tenant’s use of deck to move furniture into the second floor or that such a practice was common).', 'B', 'Proximate Causation', 'Jane argues that even if she did deviate from the standard of care she owed the Girons, a jury could not determine, absent expert testimony, whether that deviation was the proximate cause of Cayetano’s fall and resulting injuries. This is so, she claims, because the Girons introduced no evidence that would show that a properly maintained railing could have supported Cayetano’s weight and the force with which he struck the railing, and thus prevented his fall. According to Jane, only an expert could testify to whether Cayetano fell because the railing was defective or, alternatively, because the force he exerted was such that even a properly installed and maintained railing could not withstand Cayetano’s impact.7', 'In response, the Girons argue that the evidence adduced at trial was sufficient to prove that the railing was an unreasonably dangerous condition, and that this, along with the condition of the porch floorboards, proximately caused Cayetano’s fall. Significantly, they emphasize that 7', 'Jane argues that a Connecticut Appellate Court case, DeOliveira v. PMG Land Associates, L.P., 939 A.2d 2 (Conn. App. Ct. 2008), is persuasive. However, her reliance on DeOliveira is misplaced. In that case, the plaintiff, a painter, was unable to remember how he fell from a second floor balcony while painting a condominium’s exterior, and he could not demonstrate that the landowners had any prior notice about defective rail conditions. Id. at 6-7. The DeOliveira court upheld the entry of summary judgment in favor of the defendant because the plaintiff failed to establish any connection between an alleged defect in the guardrail and the plaintiff’s injury. Id. at 8. Here, however, plaintiffs have introduced evidence about the condition of the railing and porch, about defendant’s notice of those conditions, and of causation between those conditions and Cayetano’s fall from the porch.', '-9- an abundance of evidence supporting Bailey’s negligence exists beyond the fitness of the railing itself, including the rotted porch floor and the failure to repair this condition or to warn the tenants about this condition, all of which contributed directly to Cayetano’s losing his footing, his subsequent fall into the railing, and ultimately, his fall to the sidewalk.', 'Rule 702 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence provides that expert testimony is permissible “[i]f scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of fact or opinion.” This Court has held that “expert testimony is required to establish any matter that is not obvious to a lay person and thus lies beyond common knowledge.” Mills, 824 A.2d at 468 (holding expert testimony necessary to establish the “existence of a causal relationship between a particular toxin and its effect on the human body”); see also Broadley v. State, 939 A.2d 1016, 1019, 1022 (R.I. 2008) (expert testimony required to establish standard of care owed to plaintiff patient by the staff at facility for the disabled); Boccasile v.

78,"Nilsa Rodrigues : (a/k/a Juana Rodriguez)1 v. : State of Rhode Island. : Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty, and Robinson, JJ. OPINION Justice Goldberg, for the Court. The applicant, Juana “Nilsa” Rodrigues (applicant or Rodrigues) appeals from the denial of her application for postconviction relief in the Superior Court. For the reasons that follow, we reject the applicant’s assertions of legal error and affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. Facts and Travel On November 6, 1993, a mere twelve days after arriving in Rhode Island from Puerto Rico, Rodrigues was arrested by Middletown police while delivering fourteen grams of heroin and seven grams of cocaine to an undercover detective. She subsequently was charged by criminal information with delivery of both heroin and cocaine, as well as two counts of conspiracy to violate the Uniformed Controlled Substances Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 28 of title 21, by delivering heroin and cocaine. On March 14, 1994, she was provided with court-appointed counsel from the Office of the Public Defender. 1 The record indicates that applicant’s legal name is Juana Rodriguez. -1- Rodrigues originally attempted to enter a plea of nolo contendere to the charges, with an agreed-upon disposition. However, during the plea colloquy, on April 7, 1994, the trial justice refused to accept a plea of nolo contendere and indicated that he would accept only a guilty plea. The applicant agreed and did plead guilty. In accordance with the agreement, Rodrigues was sentenced to ten years in prison, with one year to serve and nine years suspended, with probation. She served nine months of her prison sentence at the Adult Correctional Institutions and the remaining three months in home confinement. Almost thirteen years later, under G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-1,2 Rodrigues filed an application for postconviction relief, alleging, inter alia, ineffective assistance of counsel and that her plea was neither knowing, voluntary, nor intelligent. On July 3, 2007, the hearing justice issued a written decision denying relief on all grounds. A timely notice of appeal to this Court followed. Additional facts will be supplied as necessary. Analysis Before this Court, applicant argues that the hearing justice erred in denying her application for postconviction relief and asserts several grounds for appeal. However, we shall only address the two arguments we deem relevant.3 The applicant alleges that her conviction should be vacated because the plea colloquy failed to comply with Rule 11 of 2 General Laws 1956 § 10-9.1-1 provides in pertinent part: “(a) Any person who has been convicted of, or sentenced for, a crime, a violation of law, or a violation of probationary or deferred sentence status and who claims: (1) That the conviction or the sentence was in violation of the constitution of the United States or the constitution or laws of this state; * * * may institute, without paying a filing fee, a proceeding under this chapter to secure relief.” 3 The applicant also alleged that her conviction should be vacated because the hearing justice misconceived material evidence during the postconviction relief hearing. We are satisfied that this argument lacks merit. -2- the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, and thus was not a knowing, voluntary, or intelligent waiver of her rights. Additionally, Rodrigues argues that she received ineffective assistance of counsel because her attorney did not adequately investigate her case or review potentially exculpatory evidence. Furthermore, applicant contends that counsel failed to inform her about potential immigration consequences resulting from the plea.4 We deem applicant’s arguments without merit and affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. A. Standard of Review “Post-conviction relief is available to any person in this state pursuant to G.L. 1956 chapter 9.1 of title 10, who after having been convicted of a crime, claims,‘inter alia, that the conviction violated [his or her] constitutional rights * * *.’” Powers v. State, 734 A.2d 508, 513-14 (R.I. 1999) (quoting Mastracchio v. Moran, 698 A.2d 706, 710 (R.I. 1997)); see also Pelletier v. State, 966 A.2d 1237, 1240 (R.I. 2009). When this Court reviews a ruling on an application for postconviction relief, we afford great deference to the hearing justice’s findings of fact. Moniz v. State, 933 A.2d 691, 694 (R.I. 2007). We will uphold a postconviction relief decision absent clear error or a determination that the hearing justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence. Id.; Hassett v. State, 899 A.2d 430, 433 (R.I. 2006). This Court, however, will review de novo any determination pertaining to an issue concerning a defendant’s constitutional rights. Hassett, 899 A.2d at 433; Powers, 734 A.2d at 514. 4 Rodrigues is a citizen of the Dominican Republic, but had permanent resident status in the United States. -3- B. Knowing, Voluntary, and Intelligent Nature of the Plea Rodrigues argues that her conviction should be vacated because the plea colloquy was so riddled with errors that her guilty plea was neither knowing, voluntary, nor intelligent. Rule 11 codifies the manner in which a trial justice must conduct a plea proceeding in order to ensure constitutional compliance. Rule 11 provides: “A defendant may plead not guilty, guilty or, with the consent of the court, nolo contendere. The court may refuse to accept a plea of guilty, and shall not accept such plea or a plea of nolo contendere without first addressing the defendant personally and determining that the plea is made voluntarily with understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea. If a defendant refuses to plead or if the court refuses to accept a plea of guilty or if a defendant corporation fails to appear, the court shall enter a plea of not guilty. The court shall not enter a judgment upon a plea of guilty or nolo contendere unless it is satisfied that there is a factual basis for the plea.” See Moniz, 933 A.2d at 695 (recognizing Superior Court must conduct an “‘on the record’” examination to determine defendant’s voluntariness and knowledge); State v. Frazar, 822 A.2d 931, 935 (R.I. 2003). It is well settled in this state that “[g]uilty pleas are valid only if voluntarily and intelligently entered, and the record must so affirmatively disclose” facts pertaining to those requirements. State v. Figueroa, 639 A.2d 495, 498 (R.I. 1994). Having reviewed the record, including the transcript of the plea, it is our opinion that the trial justice’s colloquy was thorough and established that applicant’s guilty plea was voluntary and made with knowledge and understanding of the charges against her. See Tavarez v. State, 826 A.2d 941, 943 (R.I. 2003) (acknowledging proper colloquy when trial justice clearly explained the defendant’s rights and inquired about the defendant’s understanding of the plea form); Frazar, 822 A.2d at 936 (recognizing that -4- plea colloquy demonstrated that the defendant understood his rights and voluntarily relinquished them). The justice who presided over the postconviction relief hearing reviewed the plea colloquy and determined that Rodrigues knew that she was pleading guilty. To support his conclusion, the hearing justice noted that Rodrigues had counsel and a Spanish language interpreter by her side and that she “expressly acknowledged that she understood that the court was accepting her plea as a plea of guilty and nothing else.” The transcript from the plea proceeding is instructive. The trial justice had Rodrigues summarize the Spanish language plea form, which she had signed. Rodrigues indicated that she understood that she was waiving her rights to a trial, that she would serve one year in prison, with nine years suspended, with probation, and that she would go back to jail if she violated the terms and conditions of her term of probation. After this discussion, the prosecutor summarized the facts that the state was prepared to prove. Although there may have been some confusion at this point in the colloquy, this seasoned trial justice, with assistance from defense counsel, obviated Rodrigues’ confusion and continued with the proceeding. Throughout the remainder of the colloquy, Rodrigues admitted no fewer than four times that she was guilty of the crimes set forth in the criminal information.5 When Rodrigues again appeared confused, the trial justice stopped his line of questioning to make sure that applicant understood the question being asked. “THE DEFENDANT: I did deliver it. I know I did it. 5 Rodrigues stated, “I’m admitting that I delivered this.” Upon further inquiry, she acknowledged again, “Yes, I did deliver it.” Subsequently, she stated again, “I did deliver it. I know I did it.” Later, she said yet again, “Yes, I knew what I was passing out.” -5- “THE COURT: In other words, you knew that what you were involved in was heroin and cocaine, is that so? “THE DEFENDANT: That if I knew? I have to say yes. “THE COURT: Well, you don’t have to [say yes] if it’s not so. “THE DEFENDANT: Yes, I knew what I was passing out.” (Emphasis added.) Additionally, the trial justice specifically declared that Rodrigues voluntarily submitted to the plea and waived her rights. “THE COURT: Now, Ms. Rodrigues, I’m going to make a determination that you are waiving your right to a trial and also the other rights that you have such as presumption of innocence, privilege against self-incrimination, knowingly, voluntarily, and understandingly, and I base that finding on your responses to me, the representation that you read and discussed with the interpreter the Spanish version of the request to enter your guilty plea, and the confirmation by the interpreter taht [sic] she read that form to you. Do you understand what I just said? “THE DEFENDANT: Yes. “THE COURT: Do you have any fault with any findings? “THE DEFENDANT: No, sir.” (Emphasis added.) This Court “shall not vacate a plea unless the record viewed in its totality discloses no facts that could have satisfied the trial justice that a factual basis existed for a defendant’s plea.” Frazar, 822 A.2d at 935-36 (quoting State v. Feng, 421 A.2d 1258, 1269 (R.I. 1980)). In the case at bar, the trial justice conducted an appropriate plea colloquy in accordance with Rule 11, and there is no basis for us to vacate applicant’s guilty plea based on allegations of constitutional error. Additionally, it makes no difference that applicant’s plea was changed to a plea of guilty based on the trial justice’s refusal to accept a plea of nolo contendere. Defense -6- counsel testified at the postconviction relief hearing that she discussed with Rodrigues that a plea of nolo contendere and a guilty plea were essentially the same thing. It is well settled in this state that, “[a] plea of nolo contendere is the substantive equivalent of a guilty plea * * *.” LaChappelle v. State, 686 A.2d 924, 927 (R.I. 1996) (quoting Figueroa, 639 A.2d at 498); see also Armenakes v. State, 821 A.2d 239, 246 (R.I. 2003) (noting that the Court’s concern lies not with the categorization of the plea, but rather with its consequences, and that the consequences of a plea of guilty and nolo contendere are the same). C. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel Rodrigues additionally contends that her conviction should be vacated because she received ineffective assistance of counsel. “This Court has adopted the standard announced by the United States Supreme Court in Strickland v. Washington, [466 U.S. 668 * * * (1984)] when generally reviewing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.” Powers, 734 A.2d at 521-22 (quoting LaChappelle, 686 A.2d at 926). The Strickland standard requires that this Court conduct a two-part test: “First, the defendant must show that counsel’s performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the ‘counsel’ guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that counsel’s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.” Powers, 734 A.2d at 522 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687). The Court will reject an allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel “unless a defendant can demonstrate that counsel’s ‘advice was not within the range of competence -7- demanded of attorneys in criminal cases’ * * *.” Moniz, 933 A.2d at 697 (quoting Miguel v. State, 774 A.2d 19, 22 (R.I. 2001)). In the case at bar, Rodrigues argues that her attorney failed to investigate the case and failed to review discovery, including a videotape of the alleged crime, evidence that applicant asserts would highlight potentially exculpatory facts. Additionally, Rodrigues alleges that she received ineffective assistance of counsel because she was not informed about potential immigration consequences attendant to the plea. We address each argument in turn. 1. Failure to Investigate and Review Discovery and Evidence The applicant contends that her attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to adequately investigate her case, failing to obtain and review discovery documents, and failing to view a videotape of the drug deal. Defense counsel testified during the postconviction relief hearing, relying on both her memory and her case file notes. She stated that she entered an appearance for Rodrigues on March 14, 1994, and hand-delivered a motion for discovery to the prosecution that day. She testified that she had an investigator and interpreter visit Rodrigues in prison and that she met with Rodrigues – at least once with an interpreter – several times before the plea proceeding. Defense counsel admitted that she never received discovery, nor did she view the videotape of the transaction.6 She also testified that she was familiar with the case and the background facts because Rodrigues’s arrest was one of a number of cases that her office handled involving an informant, Cesar Moreno, and the undercover officer in the case. She testified about the strength of the state’s case, articulating that, “I had 6 We were informed at oral argument that the videotape has not been produced, and may be lost. -8- cross-examined [this officer] many times, so I had some idea of how credible a witness he might be. Ordinarily – a case involving a hand-to-hand delivery to a police officer is much stronger for the prosecution * * *.” Defense counsel also noted that Rodrigues was not interested in going to trial and that she had been in prison since November 1993. Rodrigues also testified. She stated that she remembered meeting with her lawyer only once, on the morning of the plea, and that it was the investigator, not defense counsel, who informed her about the plea bargain. The hearing justice rejected Rodrigues’s argument about ineffective assistance of counsel. As for the credibility of the witnesses, he found that defense counsel testified “convincingly” and that Rodrigues testified to a “less certain” degree. Although he noted that counsel perhaps should have spent more time with Rodrigues, he was satisfied that she was sufficiently familiar with the case and was cognizant of the credibility of the state’s witnesses. The hearing justice found that Rodrigues desired that this ordeal conclude quickly, and that “[t]he plea bargain struck by her attorney made her eligible for parole consideration in a very short period of time.” It is our opinion that Rodrigues was provided with effective counsel. Defense counsel clearly was aware of the strength of the state’s evidence and the undercover police officer’s reputation for integrity and the likelihood that he would make an effective witness for the state. Defense counsel also was familiar with the facts surrounding applicant’s case. Although only two people including Rodrigues, were arrested on the evening of November 6, 1993, applicant’s arrest was just one of many arrests stemming from a large undercover operation that was handled by defense counsel’s office. -9- Additionally, defense counsel’s failure to review any discovery in this case did not amount to constitutionally deficient representation. There was a criminal information package, in which voluminous material about applicant’s case was produced ab initio, including inventory sheets, fingerprint evidence, and statements from the police witnesses. The applicant has failed to point to any other material – save for the lost videotape – that was not provided and wholly has failed to demonstrate that such phantom proof would have influenced her decision to plead guilty. Although defense counsel did not evaluate the allegedly exculpatory videotape of the transaction, we are satisfied that this did not prejudice Rodrigues, who admitted in open court, numerous times, that she was guilty of the charges. In LaChappelle, 686 A.2d at 927, this Court denied the defendant’s allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to investigate. In that case, counsel failed to interview witnesses and also neglected to obtain a medical report that allegedly contained exculpatory evidence. Id. We noted that the report was not exculpatory, and we also noted that counsel’s failure to interview witnesses was not inappropriate, particularly in light of the defendant’s own statements to police. Id. Here, although counsel did not review the tape, which applicant suggests may contain evidence suggesting that applicant did not know she was delivering drugs, Rodrigues admitted in court that she knew what she was doing and knew what she was “passing out.” We are satisfied that failure to review the videotape, which apparently has disappeared, did not amount to ineffective assistance of counsel. Furthermore, it has not escaped our attention that the experienced and respected attorney who served as defense counsel was able to secure a favorable disposition; Rodrigues was faced with the potential for a much longer sentence than the - 10 - one-year term she served. This Court previously has held that a lawyer’s performance in advising a client to enter a plea involving a shorter sentence than the client otherwise might have received is not ineffective assistance of counsel, such that the client’s constitutional rights have been violated. See, e.g., Pelletier, 966 A.2d at 1241-42 (counsel’s decision to suggest that the applicant plea nolo contendere rather than face a potentially long jail sentence was not constitutionally ineffective); Gonder v. State, 935 A.2d 82, 88 (R.I. 2007) (acknowledging that, if the defendant did not follow advice of counsel and accept the plea, the defendant ran the risk of receiving a much more serve sentence, and thus, counsel’s performance was not deficient); Hassett, 899 A.2d at 437 (noting that because there was a strong possibility that the defendant may have received a more severe sentence had he not followed counsel’s advice to accept a plea, the defendant could not demonstrate prejudice by counsel’s allegedly deficient performance). 2. Immigration Consequences Finally, applicant argues that she received ineffective assistance of counsel because she was not informed that her guilty plea could result in deportation from the United States. The applicant relies on an amendment (P.L. 2000, ch. 501, § 1) to G.L. 1956 § 12- 12-22,7 which requires that before accepting a guilty plea, the trial justice must notify a 7 General Laws 1956 § 12-12-22, as amended by P.L. 2000, ch. 501, § 1, the notice requirement provides: “(b) Prior to accepting a plea of guilty or nolo contendere in the district or superior court, the court shall inform the defendant that if he or she is not a citizen of the United States, a plea of guilty or nolo contendere may have immigration consequences, including deportation * * *. “(c) If the court fails to so inform the defendant as required by this section, and the defendant later shows that his plea and conviction may - 11 - defendant that if he or she is not a citizen, the plea may have immigration consequences including deportation. See Tavarez, 826 A.2d at 944 (holding same for plea of nolo contendere). The amendment took effect on July 20, 2000 – more than six years after applicant’s plea. This Court consistently has declared that “‘statutes and their amendments are applied prospectively,’” absent “‘clear, strong language, or by necessary implication that the Legislature intended’ a statute to have retroactive application * * *.” Ducally v. State, 809 A.2d 472, 474 (R.I. 2002) (quoting Wilkinson v. State Crime Laboratory Commission, 788 A.2d 1129, 1140, 1141 (R.I. 2002)). We already have held that the amendment to § 12-12-22 does not apply retroactively; in fact, the amendment specifically provides that it did not take effect until July 20, 2000. Moniz, 933 A.2d at 697; Ducally, 809 A.2d at 474-75. Applying the law as it existed before the amendment, this Court has held that a defendant need be apprised only of the direct consequences of a plea, which do not include deportation. See Moniz, 933 A.2d at 697; Tavarez, 826 A.2d at 944; Figueroa, 639 A.2d at 499. “The possibility of deportation is only a collateral consequence [of a plea] because that sanction is controlled by an agency which operates beyond the direct authority of the trial [justice].” Ducally, 809 A.2d at 474 (quoting State v. Desir, 766 A.2d 374, 376 (R.I. 2001)). Additionally, and conclusively, applicant should not be heard to contend that she did not receive notice of the immigration consequences. Before she pleaded, she admitted to the trial justice that she read and understood the Spanish language version of the plea form. The Spanish language plea form clearly warns the defendant about have immigration consequences, the defendant shall be entitled, upon a proper petition for post-conviction relief, to have the plea vacated.” - 12 - possible immigration consequences that can result from the plea.8 See Figueroa, 639 A.2d at 499 (recognizing that the applicant received notice from the plea form, even though such notice was not required). Because neither counsel, nor for that matter the trial justice, was required to inform the applicant about the possible immigration consequences of her plea, the applicant’s second allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel is denied. Ducally, 809 A.2d at 475-76. Defense counsel’s actions in this case were not constitutionally deficient. Conclusion For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. The applicant’s appeal is denied and dismissed; the record shall be remanded to the Superior Court. 8 The form provided: “Su alegación de Nolo Contendere o Culpable hoy, puede resultar en una forma de acción por el Departmento de Immigración la cual pueda afectar su posición en los Estados Unidos.” This translates roughly as follows: “Your plea of Nolo Contendere or Guilty today may result in an action by the Department of Immigration that could affect your status in the United States.” - 13 - Supreme Court No. 2007-345-Appeal.

For the reasons that follow, we reject the applicant’s assertions of legal error and affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On November 6, 1993, a mere twelve days after arriving in Rhode Island from Puerto Rico, Rodrigues was arrested by Middletown police while delivering fourteen grams of heroin and seven grams of cocaine to an undercover detective.', 'She subsequently was charged by criminal information with delivery of both heroin and cocaine, as well as two counts of conspiracy to violate the Uniformed Controlled Substances Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 28 of title 21, by delivering heroin and cocaine. On March 14, 1994, she was provided with court-appointed counsel from the Office of the Public Defender. 1', 'The record indicates that applicant’s legal name is Juana Rodriguez.', '-1-', 'Rodrigues originally attempted to enter a plea of nolo contendere to the charges, with an agreed-upon disposition. However, during the plea colloquy, on April 7, 1994, the trial justice refused to accept a plea of nolo contendere and indicated that he would accept only a guilty plea. The applicant agreed and did plead guilty. In accordance with the agreement, Rodrigues was sentenced to ten years in prison, with one year to serve and nine years suspended, with probation. She served nine months of her prison sentence at the Adult Correctional Institutions and the remaining three months in home confinement.', 'Almost thirteen years later, under G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-1,2 Rodrigues filed an application for postconviction relief, alleging, inter alia, ineffective assistance of counsel and that her plea was neither knowing, voluntary, nor intelligent. On July 3, 2007, the hearing justice issued a written decision denying relief on all grounds. A timely notice of appeal to this Court followed.', 'Additional facts will be supplied as necessary.', 'Analysis', 'Before this Court, applicant argues that the hearing justice erred in denying her application for postconviction relief and asserts several grounds for appeal. However, we shall only address the two arguments we deem relevant.3 The applicant alleges that her conviction should be vacated because the plea colloquy failed to comply with Rule 11 of 2', 'General Laws 1956 § 10-9.1-1 provides in pertinent part:', '“(a) Any person who has been convicted of, or sentenced for, a crime, a', 'violation of law, or a violation of probationary or deferred sentence status', 'and who claims: (1) That the conviction or the sentence was in violation of', 'the constitution of the United States or the constitution or laws of this', 'state; * * * may institute, without paying a filing fee, a proceeding under', 'this chapter to secure relief.” 3', 'The applicant also alleged that her conviction should be vacated because the hearing justice misconceived material evidence during the postconviction relief hearing.

Additionally, Rodrigues argues that she received ineffective assistance of counsel because her attorney did not adequately investigate her case or review potentially exculpatory evidence. Furthermore, applicant contends that counsel failed to inform her about potential immigration consequences resulting from the plea.4 We deem applicant’s arguments without merit and affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'A. Standard of Review', '“Post-conviction relief is available to any person in this state pursuant to G.L. 1956 chapter 9.1 of title 10, who after having been convicted of a crime, claims,‘inter alia, that the conviction violated [his or her] constitutional rights * * *.’” Powers v.

When this Court reviews a ruling on an application for postconviction relief, we afford great deference to the hearing justice’s findings of fact. Moniz v. State, 933 A.2d 691, 694 (R.I. 2007). We will uphold a postconviction relief decision absent clear error or a determination that the hearing justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence. Id.; Hassett v. State, 899 A.2d 430, 433 (R.I. 2006). This Court, however, will review de novo any determination pertaining to an issue concerning a defendant’s constitutional rights.

Knowing, Voluntary, and Intelligent Nature of the Plea', 'Rodrigues argues that her conviction should be vacated because the plea colloquy was so riddled with errors that her guilty plea was neither knowing, voluntary, nor intelligent. Rule 11 codifies the manner in which a trial justice must conduct a plea proceeding in order to ensure constitutional compliance. Rule 11 provides:', '“A defendant may plead not guilty, guilty or, with the', 'consent of the court, nolo contendere. The court may', 'refuse to accept a plea of guilty, and shall not accept such', 'plea or a plea of nolo contendere without first addressing', 'the defendant personally and determining that the plea is', 'made voluntarily with understanding of the nature of the', 'charge and the consequences of the plea.

Frazar, 822 A.2d 931, 935 (R.I. 2003). It is well settled in this state that “[g]uilty pleas are valid only if voluntarily and intelligently entered, and the record must so affirmatively disclose” facts pertaining to those requirements. State v. Figueroa, 639 A.2d 495, 498 (R.I. 1994).', 'Having reviewed the record, including the transcript of the plea, it is our opinion that the trial justice’s colloquy was thorough and established that applicant’s guilty plea was voluntary and made with knowledge and understanding of the charges against her. See Tavarez v. State, 826 A.2d 941, 943 (R.I. 2003) (acknowledging proper colloquy when trial justice clearly explained the defendant’s rights and inquired about the defendant’s understanding of the plea form); Frazar, 822 A.2d at 936 (recognizing that', '-4- plea colloquy demonstrated that the defendant understood his rights and voluntarily relinquished them). The justice who presided over the postconviction relief hearing reviewed the plea colloquy and determined that Rodrigues knew that she was pleading guilty. To support his conclusion, the hearing justice noted that Rodrigues had counsel and a Spanish language interpreter by her side and that she “expressly acknowledged that she understood that the court was accepting her plea as a plea of guilty and nothing else.”', 'The transcript from the plea proceeding is instructive.', 'The trial justice had Rodrigues summarize the Spanish language plea form, which she had signed. Rodrigues indicated that she understood that she was waiving her rights to a trial, that she would serve one year in prison, with nine years suspended, with probation, and that she would go back to jail if she violated the terms and conditions of her term of probation. After this discussion, the prosecutor summarized the facts that the state was prepared to prove. Although there may have been some confusion at this point in the colloquy, this seasoned trial justice, with assistance from defense counsel, obviated Rodrigues’ confusion and continued with the proceeding. Throughout the remainder of the colloquy, Rodrigues admitted no fewer than four times that she was guilty of the crimes set forth in the criminal information.5', 'When Rodrigues again appeared confused, the trial justice stopped his line of questioning to make sure that applicant understood the question being asked.', '“THE DEFENDANT: I did deliver it.

79,"Nicholas T. Long and Julianne Ricci, : individually and on behalf of a class of persons similarly situated v. : Dell, Inc., et al. : Present: Goldberg and Flaherty, JJ., and Williams, C.J. (ret.) OPINION Justice Goldberg, for the Court. This case came before the Supreme Court on October 6, 2009. The defendants, Dell, Inc. f/k/a Dell Computer Corp., Dell Catalog Sales L.P., Dell Marketing L.P., Qualxserv, LLC, and Banctec, Inc. (Dell or collectively defendants) and the intervenor, David M. Sullivan, tax administrator for the State of Rhode Island, sought common-law certiorari to review the denial of a motion to dismiss this case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. The plaintiffs, Nicholas T. Long and Julianne Ricci (plaintiffs), individually and on behalf of a yet-to-be-certified class of persons similarly situated filed a class-action lawsuit in Superior Court alleging violations of the Rhode Island Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA) under G.L. 1956 chapter 13.1 of title 6, as well as common-law negligence. For the following reasons, we affirm the order of the Superior Court, quash the writ, and remand the case to the lower court for trial. -1- Facts and Travel This case arrives before us as a putative class action involving Dell computers and the optional service contracts Dell offers for its products.1 The central issue before us is whether the Superior Court has subject-matter jurisdiction to entertain the complaint. Before reaching that question, however, we must address the complex travel that brings us to this point. The original plaintiff in this action was Mary E. DeFontes, individually and on behalf of a class of similarly situated persons. She brought suit on May 16, 2003, alleging defendants collected an improper tax on the service contracts. Subsequently, Nicholas T. Long joined the suit as a plaintiff on July 16, 2003; he included a new allegation that defendants collected an improper tax on the shipping and handling (transportation) charges, in addition to the service contracts. It is important to note that Mr. Long purchased his Dell computer for business purposes.2 Also, it was discovered that Mary E. DeFontes was an employee of plaintiffs’ counsel and, we are informed, plaintiffs filed a “Substituted First Amended Class Action Complaint” that replaced 1 Shortly after this action was filed in Superior Court, defendants sought to stay proceedings and compel arbitration based on the “Terms and Conditions Agreement” between plaintiffs and Dell, which has a provision making arbitration mandatory for any content disputes. On January 29, 2004, the trial justice denied defendants’ motion, declined to order arbitration and directed the case to proceed to trial. The defendants subsequently appealed to this Court, seeking a review of the decision denying arbitration; they sought to consolidate both cases. We denied the motion to consolidate. Because we held that the arbitration clause was unenforceable in DeFontes v. Dell, Inc., No. 2004- 137-A., No. 2004-114-A., (R.I., filed Dec. 14, 2009) it is necessary for us to decide whether the Superior Court is vested with subject-matter jurisdiction over the issues raised by the parties. 2 This distinction is of consequence to the outcome here because the DTPA provides only for purchases “primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.” See G.L. 1956 § 6-13.1-5.2(a). -2- DeFontes with Julianne Ricci as named plaintiff, which the Superior Court granted. Ms. Ricci, unlike Mr. Long, purchased her Dell computer solely for personal use. There are numerous defendants. Dell is a national computer hardware and software corporation, located in Texas. Within the corporation, there exists Dell Catalog and Dell Marketing, both of which are responsible for selling products to individuals and businesses. Whenever Dell sells a product, it offers consumers optional service repair contracts to address any defects in its products. Dell then acts as an agent for third-party service providers to handle these repairs, among which are defendants, BancTec and QualxServ. Those consumers who elected to purchase the optional service contract were charged a tax on their purchase price, which then was paid to the State of Rhode Island or collected by one of the third-party service providers and subsequently remitted to the State of Rhode Island by that entity. The collection of these taxes is the central dispute in this case. The plaintiffs purchased their Dell computers, as well as the optional service contracts, in October and December 2000. Also included in the purchase were charges designated as “ship. &/or handling.” The plaintiffs allege that the tax levied on the service contracts and the shipping and handling fees was illegal and should not have been collected, they argue, because taxes are payable only on sales of personal property. Because the service contracts and shipping and handling charges are not personalty, plaintiffs contend that they were improperly charged, and they brought claims for negligence and violation of the DTPA. The plaintiffs agree with Dell’s contention that the erroneous tax is approximately $50 for Mr. Long and Ms. Ricci combined. -3- However, they are seeking additional statutory damages of $200 per person under the DTPA.3 At the time of this appeal, the action had not yet been certified as a class action. The defendants, on the other hand, argue that because the cost of the service contract and shipping and handling charges was not stated separately from the price of the hardware (the computer), then the tax must be computed on the entire transaction amount, as opposed to piecemeal taxation on only the hardware. This is the so-called “separately stated” concept of taxation, which was embodied in a former regulation of the Division of Taxation that was in effect at the time of the purchases in 2000.4 The defendants further contend that, in accordance with G.L. 1956 § 44-18-12(b)(5)(which has been amended), “shipping and handling” charges were taxable even if separately stated.5 3 Section 6-13.1-5.2(a) provides: “Any person who purchases or leases goods or services primarily for personal, family, or household purposes and thereby suffers any ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result of the use or employment by another person of a method, act, or practice declared unlawful by § 6-13.1-2, may bring an action under Rules of Civil Procedure in the [S]uperior [C]ourt of the county in which the seller or lessor resides, is found, has his or her principal place of business, or is doing business, or in the [S]uperior [C]ourt of the county as is otherwise provided by law, to recover actual damages or two hundred dollars ($200), whichever is greater. The court may, in its discretion, award punitive damages and may provide other equitable relief that it deems necessary or proper.” 4 The previous regulation that defendants argue was Regulation SU 89-126. It subsequently has been superseded by Regulation SU 00-126. 5 General Laws 1956 § 44-18-12(b)(5) was amended by P.L. 2006, ch. 246, art. 30, § 21, becoming effective on January 1, 2007 and replaced with a new statute, § 44-18-12(a)(iv) whereby both “shipping” and “shipping and handling” charges are taxable (incorporating terms via reference to § 44-18-7.1(i)). -4- Subsequently, in 2005 and 2006, defendants obtained letter rulings6 from the tax administrator on the taxation issues that were raised in this case. The tax administrator’s letter rulings declared that consumer transactions, such as Ricci’s purchase for personal use, should not have included tax on the service contract because the invoice separately stated the service-contract price. However, the letter rulings also declared that the taxes collected on commercial-use transactions, such as Mr. Long’s purchase, were proper because neither the service-contract price nor the “transportation” charges were stated separately. In short, the letter rulings found that the tax was properly collected on the entire amount for Long’s purchase and was correct concerning the shipping and handling charge for Ricci’s purchase. It should be noted that plaintiffs dispute the correctness of portions of these letter rulings and contest the validity of the regulation that originally gave way to the “separately-stated” rule. Neither issue, however, is before us. In March 2007, defendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that Dell did not violate the DTPA as a matter of law, that the collection of sales tax was exempted from the act, that the collection of sales tax was neither deceptive nor unfair and finally, 6 According to the Division of Taxation, a letter ruling is: “A General Informational Letter, (commonly referred to as a ‘Letter Ruling’) is unlike a Declaratory Ruling in that it generally seeks an interpretation of tax law or regulation without applying it to a specific set of facts. A General Informational Letter may be issued where it appears that general information only is requested, or where a request for a Declaratory Ruling does not comply with all the requirements for a Declaratory Ruling. General Informational Letters may not be relied upon by any taxpayer other than the taxpayer who requested the information. General Informational letters [sic] are not binding on the Tax Division if there has been a misstatement or omission of material facts or, on a prospective basis, if there has been a change in law or applicable regulations or a decision on point is issued by the Rhode Island or Federal Courts.” -5- that defendants had no duty cognizable in tort.7 The plaintiffs, however, argued that the motion for summary judgment could not be heard until the tax administrator was given notice of the proceedings in accordance with G.L. 1956 § 44-1-13, which provides: “Whenever in any proceeding in court, by appeal or otherwise, the constitutionality or construction of any tax statute or the validity of the assessment of any tax is in question, the court before which the proceeding is pending shall not proceed with the hearing until notice, as the court may direct, has been given to the tax administrator of the pending of the proceeding, so that the tax administrator may appear and be heard with reference to the proceeding.” The tax administrator subsequently moved to intervene in the case, he filed a motion to dismiss, alleging that the Superior Court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to hear this case. On October 19, 2007, the hearing justice denied the tax administrator’s motion as to Ms. Ricci’s claims. On October 30, 2007, the hearing justice granted a stay of proceedings to allow defendants to seek review in this Court by way of certiorari. The hearing justice determined that based on this Court’s decision in Park v. Ford Motor Co., 844 A.2d 687, 694 (R.I. 2004), in which we held that the Superior Court has jurisdiction over claims that are joined to a DTPA claim, there was ancillary jurisdiction over Ms. Ricci’s negligence claim because the Court was vested with jurisdiction over the DTPA claim. The hearing justice also relied on our decision in Park v. Ford Motor Co., 928 A.2d 469, 473 (R.I. 2007), where we held that the Superior Court may exercise ancillary jurisdiction over other claims that a plaintiff may have, even if those claims would not meet the amount-in-controversy requirement, when those claims are joined with a DTPA claim. 7 The defendants also argued that plaintiff Long’s claim was improper because his purchase was for business purposes, rather than as a consumer, and that plaintiff Ricci could not receive equitable relief because she owed more tax to the state than she had paid. -6- Additionally, the hearing justice dismissed Mr. Long’s claim for lack of subject- matter jurisdiction because his use of the Dell computer was for business and as such, the DTPA was not available as a remedy. Consequently, the hearing justice found that the Superior Court did not have subject-matter jurisdiction over Mr. Long’s negligence claim because it could not possibly rise to the statutory threshold of $5,000. See G.L. 1956 § 8- 2-14(a) (the Superior Court has jurisdiction over all actions at law in which the amount in controversy exceeds $10,000 and has concurrent jurisdiction with the District Court in those actions at law in which the amount in controversy exceeds $5,000 but is less than $10,000). The plaintiffs conceded that Mr. Long could not bring a DTPA claim because his purchase was made for a business purpose. Accordingly, the Superior Court dismissed Mr. Long’s claims to the extent he sought damages arising from Dell’s alleged negligence.8 This Court granted petitions for writ of certiorari, filed by defendants and the tax administrator in order to review the paramount question of subject-matter jurisdiction. Standard of Review As we consistently have articulated, “a claim of lack of subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time.” Pollard v. Acer Group, 870 A.2d 429, 433 (R.I. 2005) (citing LaPetite Auberge, Inc. v. Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights, 419 A.2d 274, 280 (R.I. 1980) and Rule 12(b)(1) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure). This Court reviews de novo whether a court has subject-matter jurisdiction over a particular controversy. Newman v. Valleywood Associates, Inc., 874 A.2d 1286, 1288 (R.I. 2005). 8 It is possible that Mr. Long may have a claim for equitable or declaratory relief – an issue that is not before us. -7- Accordingly, because we are confronted with determining the correctness of the Superior Court’s decision finding subject-matter jurisdiction, our review is de novo. Analysis On appeal, plaintiffs argue that the hearing justice properly concluded that the Superior Court was vested with subject-matter jurisdiction over the issues in this case because there is both a negligence claim and an alleged violation of the DTPA, for which the Superior Court has exclusive jurisdiction in accordance with § 6-13.1-5.2(a). Conversely, defendants and the tax administrator, argue that in its essence, this case is a tax case and that plaintiffs should have made and then exhausted their administrative remedies, first with the Division of Taxation, followed by an appeal to the Sixth Division District Court, in accordance with G.L. 1956 § 44-19-18.9 In short, we are confronted with two appellate contentions: first, whether the Superior Court was vested with subject-matter jurisdiction to hear this case and second, whether the hearing justice erred in refusing to dismiss Ricci’s case for failure to exhaust her statutory and administrative remedies, relative to the tax claims. These issues inextricably are linked. In tax aggrievement cases, a party first must exhaust administrative remedies, including an appeal to the District Court and then may seek a 9 General Laws 1956 § 44-19-18 provides: “Appeals from administrative orders or decisions made pursuant to any provisions of this chapter are to the [S]ixth (6th) [D]ivision [D]istrict [C]ourt pursuant to chapter 8 of title 8. The taxpayer's right to appeal under this chapter is expressly made conditional upon prepayment of all taxes, interest, and penalties, unless the taxpayer moves for and is granted an exemption from the prepayment requirement pursuant to § 8-8-26.” -8- writ of certiorari to this Court. See § 44-19-18; G.L. 1956 § 8-8-32.10 Conversely, redress from a deceptive trade practice requires a party initially to file in Superior Court, in accordance with § 6-13.1-5.2(a) of the DTPA,11 as plaintiffs did in this case. The defendants and the tax administrator urge us to hold that the Superior Court has no jurisdiction to entertain a DTPA case that may require the trial justice to interpret taxation statutes. We deem their arguments without merit. As this Court has declared, “subject-matter jurisdiction is ‘an indispensable requisite in any judicial proceeding.’” Newman, 874 A.2d at 1288 (quoting Zarrella v. Minnesota Mutual Life Insurance Co., 824 A.2d 1249, 1256 (R.I. 2003)). Subject-matter jurisdiction is the very essence of the court’s power to hear and decide a case. Black’s Law Dictionary defines subject-matter jurisdiction as, “[j]urisdiction over the nature of the case and the type of relief sought; the extent to which a court can rule on the conduct of persons or the status of things.” Black’s Law Dictionary 931 (9th ed. 2009). It was conceded by the tax administrator that consumer purchases of Dell products and optional service contracts were not taxable purchases. This makes clear that all consumers, including Ms. Ricci, should not have been charged for those taxes, which 10 General Laws 1956 § 8-8-32 provides: “Any party in interest, if aggrieved by a final judgment rendered in proceedings brought under this chapter, may within twenty (20) days from the date of entry of the judgment petition the [S]upreme [C]ourt of the state of Rhode Island for a writ of certiorari to review any questions of law involved. The petition for writ of certiorari shall set forth the errors claimed. Upon the filing of such a petition with the clerk of the [S]upreme [C]ourt, the [S]upreme [C]ourt may, if it sees fit, issue its writ of certiorari to the [D]istrict [C]ourt to certify to the [S]upreme [C]ourt the record of the proceeding under review.” 11 Section 6-13.1-5.2(a) of the DTPA provides that, “Any person * * * may bring an action under Rules of Civil Procedure in the [S]uperior [C]ourt.” (Emphasis added.) -9- were collected from them. This is consistent with the tax regulation that was in effect both at the time Dell initially sought guidance from the State of Rhode Island (Regulation SU 89-126) and at the time plaintiffs purchased their products (Regulation SU 00-126).12 Most importantly, this case does not concern an appeal from a decision by the tax administrator, who was given notice of this case because Dell disputed the tax administrator’s regulations and letter rulings. The plaintiffs are aggrieved by the actions of defendants, not the tax administrator. Dell and the tax administrator point to our holding in Owner-Operators Independent Drivers Association of America v. State of Rhode Island, 541 A.2d 69, 73 (R.I. 1988) as support for their contention that this case is nothing more than a contested tax matter. We are satisfied, however, that Owner-Operators is distinguishable from the case before us. In that case, a foreign registered motor carrier was seeking a refund for a fuel decal tax imposed upon it by the Division of Taxation, individually and on behalf of others similarly situated. Id. at 70. The plaintiffs brought their class action in Superior Court against the State of Rhode Island, the Rhode Island Division of Taxation, its tax administrator, and the General Treasurer. Id. The plaintiffs’ complaint sought to have the fuel decal tax statute declared unconstitutional as a violation of both the commerce clause and the privileges and immunities clause of the United States Constitution. Id. Additionally, the plaintiffs were seeking a tax refund from the state. The tax administrator moved to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, and the Superior 12 The hearing justice noted that although Regulation SU 89-126 was superseded by SU 00-126, for all intents and purposes of this case, there is no material difference from its predecessor. The current regulation provides: “The charge for the optional service, maintenance or extended warranty contract is not subject to tax when such charge is separately stated by the retailer to the purchaser.” - 10 - Court granted the motion. Id. On appeal, this Court held that despite the presence of equitable claims for relief, Owner-Operators primarily was a tax case for which the District Court had exclusive jurisdiction. Id. at 73. The crucial teaching that we glean from that holding is: what is the gravamen of the claim? If the complaint raises an issue of taxation by a governmental body, then it should follow the administrative procedures laid out by the General Assembly and appeal to the District Court. However, if the claim sounds in tort, or alleges one or more regulatory violations, a plaintiff may proceed in Superior Court if the claim satisfies the threshold jurisdictional amount. The key factors that readily distinguish the current case from Owner-Operators are that the class action in Owner-Operators was against the tax administrator as a named defendant and that the remedy sought was tax abatement. Owner-Operators, 541 A.2d at 70. These facts make it abundantly clear that the gravamen of the complaint was a taxation aggrievement. Accordingly, we held that, in accordance with § 8-8-24 and § 8- 8-3, the appropriate venue was the District Court. Owner-Operators, 541 A.2d at 73. The case before us markedly differs from the issues raised in Owner-Operators. This is a negligence action coupled with a claim alleging deceptive trade practices. Here, the gravamen of plaintiffs’ complaint is whether Dell (not the tax administrator) committed a deceptive trade practice by collecting taxes on the purchase of optional service contracts. The plaintiffs argue that these service contracts are not taxable in Rhode Island and that Dell, not the tax administrator, ignored the relevant statutes and regulations when it collected the tax. The fact that Dell may have paid over the money to the Division of Taxation does not change this result. The plaintiffs filed this claim in Superior Court in accordance with chapter 13.1 of title 6 of the DTPA. “The General - 11 - Assembly, through the DTPA, has declared that ‘[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are * * * unlawful.’ Section 6-13.1-2. The DTPA provides a private right of action to recover actual and punitive damages and equitable relief for violations of its provisions. Section 6-13.1-5.2.” Chavers v. Fleet Bank (R.I.) N.A., 844 A.2d 666, 670 (R.I. 2004). The DTPA is a remedial act and it should be liberally construed. In Chavers, 844 A.2d at 670, we held that in cases in which the “complained of activity is subject to regulation by a government agency,” private causes of action are precluded. “Specifically, the exemption contained in § 6-13.1-4 of the DTPA provides: ‘Nothing in this chapter shall apply to actions or transactions permitted under laws administered by the department of business regulation or other regulatory body or officer acting under statutory authority of this state or the United States.’” Chavers, 844 A.2d at 670. We deem this holding distinguishable from the case before us because the DTPA does not exempt the fraudulent collection of taxes from its provisions. Further, it would lead to an absurd result if, as the case before us alleges, the collection of the tax is the deceptive trade practice and the DTPA was not available as a remedy. As we have suggested recently, “[t]his [C]ourt will not construe a statute to reach an absurd result.” Shepard v. Harleysville Worcester Ins. Co., 944 A.2d 167, 170 (R.I. 2008) (quoting Kaya v. Partington, 681 A.2d 256, 261 (R.I. 1996)). It is clear from its language that nothing in the DTPA requires exhaustion of administrative remedies and we decline to hold otherwise. Section 6-13.1-5.2(a) of the DTPA provides that: “Any person * * * may bring an action under Rules of Civil Procedure in the [S]uperior [C]ourt of the county in which the seller or lessor resides, is found, has his or her principal - 12 - place of business, or is doing business, or in the [S]uperior [C]ourt of the county as is otherwise provided by law, to recover actual damages or two hundred dollars ($200), whichever is greater. The court may, in its discretion, award punitive damages and may provide other equitable relief that it deems necessary or proper.” (Emphases added.) Accordingly, because the language of the statute is clear, we are of the opinion that the deceptive trade practice at issue in this case properly was brought in Superior Court, which was vested with subject-matter jurisdiction under the DTPA. Further, the Superior Court was correct in exercising ancillary jurisdiction over Ms. Ricci’s negligence claim. Conclusion In conclusion, we hold that the Superior Court was vested with subject-matter jurisdiction to hear this deceptive trade practice cause of action and has ancillary jurisdiction over the common-law negligence claim, notwithstanding the amount in controversy.13 We pause to note, however, that although the defendant, tax administrator was not an original party, as an intervenor, should the Superior Court’s decision on remand be adverse to the defendant tax administrator, he may appeal that ruling to this Court.14 13 The defendants expend great energy and urge us to pay attention to Ms. Ricci’s failure to pay any use tax on her Dell products. Essentially, their point is that whatever Ms. Ricci or any plaintiff, may collect in damages will have to be remitted for failure to pay the use tax. Although that issue is not before us – it is, however, clear that anyone who joins this putative class action most likely will be charged a tax since the Division of Taxation does not collect that tax in the first instance. In short, we note that the Taxman Cometh and that the representatives of the class, and their counsel, must apprise these parties of this eventually. 14 As we recently held in Shepard v. Harleysville, 944 A.2d 167, 170 (R.I. 2008), our Court is “the final arbiter on questions of statutory construction.” Therefore, if the Superior Court were to make any determination on remand about the tax issues involved, any of the litigants can appeal to our Court. - 13 - For the reasons stated, we quash the writ and affirm the judgment.

DeFontes, individually and on behalf of a class of similarly situated persons. She brought suit on May 16, 2003, alleging defendants collected an improper tax on the service contracts. Subsequently, Nicholas T. Long joined the suit as a plaintiff on July 16, 2003; he included a new allegation that defendants collected an improper tax on the shipping and handling (transportation) charges, in addition to the service contracts. It is important to note that Mr. Long purchased his Dell computer for business purposes.2 Also, it was discovered that Mary E. DeFontes was an employee of plaintiffs’ counsel and, we are informed, plaintiffs filed a “Substituted First Amended Class Action Complaint” that replaced 1', 'Shortly after this action was filed in Superior Court, defendants sought to stay proceedings and compel arbitration based on the “Terms and Conditions Agreement” between plaintiffs and Dell, which has a provision making arbitration mandatory for any content disputes. On January 29, 2004, the trial justice denied defendants’ motion, declined to order arbitration and directed the case to proceed to trial. The defendants subsequently appealed to this Court, seeking a review of the decision denying arbitration; they sought to consolidate both cases. We denied the motion to consolidate. Because we held that the arbitration clause was unenforceable in DeFontes v. Dell, Inc., No. 2004- 137-A., No. 2004-114-A., (R.I., filed Dec. 14, 2009) it is necessary for us to decide whether the Superior Court is vested with subject-matter jurisdiction over the issues raised by the parties. 2', 'This distinction is of consequence to the outcome here because the DTPA provides only for purchases “primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.” See G.L. 1956 § 6-13.1-5.2(a).', '-2- DeFontes with Julianne Ricci as named plaintiff, which the Superior Court granted. Ms. Ricci, unlike Mr. Long, purchased her Dell computer solely for personal use.', 'There are numerous defendants.', 'Dell is a national computer hardware and software corporation, located in Texas. Within the corporation, there exists Dell Catalog and Dell Marketing, both of which are responsible for selling products to individuals and businesses. Whenever Dell sells a product, it offers consumers optional service repair contracts to address any defects in its products. Dell then acts as an agent for third-party service providers to handle these repairs, among which are defendants, BancTec and QualxServ. Those consumers who elected to purchase the optional service contract were charged a tax on their purchase price, which then was paid to the State of Rhode Island or collected by one of the third-party service providers and subsequently remitted to the State of Rhode Island by that entity. The collection of these taxes is the central dispute in this case.', 'The plaintiffs purchased their Dell computers, as well as the optional service contracts, in October and December 2000. Also included in the purchase were charges designated as “ship. &/or handling.” The plaintiffs allege that the tax levied on the service contracts and the shipping and handling fees was illegal and should not have been collected, they argue, because taxes are payable only on sales of personal property. Because the service contracts and shipping and handling charges are not personalty, plaintiffs contend that they were improperly charged, and they brought claims for negligence and violation of the DTPA. The plaintiffs agree with Dell’s contention that the erroneous tax is approximately $50 for Mr. Long and Ms. Ricci combined.', '-3- However, they are seeking additional statutory damages of $200 per person under the DTPA.3 At the time of this appeal, the action had not yet been certified as a class action.', 'The defendants, on the other hand, argue that because the cost of the service contract and shipping and handling charges was not stated separately from the price of the hardware (the computer), then the tax must be computed on the entire transaction amount, as opposed to piecemeal taxation on only the hardware. This is the so-called “separately stated” concept of taxation, which was embodied in a former regulation of the Division of Taxation that was in effect at the time of the purchases in 2000.4 The defendants further contend that, in accordance with G.L. 1956 § 44-18-12(b)(5)(which has been amended), “shipping and handling” charges were taxable even if separately stated.5 3', 'Section 6-13.1-5.2(a) provides:', '“Any person who purchases or leases goods or services primarily for', 'personal, family, or household purposes and thereby suffers any', 'ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result of the', 'use or employment by another person of a method, act, or practice', 'declared unlawful by § 6-13.1-2, may bring an action under Rules of Civil', 'Procedure in the [S]uperior [C]ourt of the county in which the seller or', 'lessor resides, is found, has his or her principal place of business, or is', 'doing business, or in the [S]uperior [C]ourt of the county as is otherwise', 'provided by law, to recover actual damages or two hundred dollars ($200),', 'whichever is greater.

The tax administrator’s letter rulings declared that consumer transactions, such as Ricci’s purchase for personal use, should not have included tax on the service contract because the invoice separately stated the service-contract price. However, the letter rulings also declared that the taxes collected on commercial-use transactions, such as Mr. Long’s purchase, were proper because neither the service-contract price nor the “transportation” charges were stated separately. In short, the letter rulings found that the tax was properly collected on the entire amount for Long’s purchase and was correct concerning the shipping and handling charge for Ricci’s purchase. It should be noted that plaintiffs dispute the correctness of portions of these letter rulings and contest the validity of the regulation that originally gave way to the “separately-stated” rule. Neither issue, however, is before us.', 'In March 2007, defendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that Dell did not violate the DTPA as a matter of law, that the collection of sales tax was exempted from the act, that the collection of sales tax was neither deceptive nor unfair and finally, 6', 'According to the Division of Taxation, a letter ruling is:', '“A General Informational Letter, (commonly referred to as a ‘Letter', 'Ruling’) is unlike a Declaratory Ruling in that it generally seeks an', 'interpretation of tax law or regulation without applying it to a specific set', 'of facts.

On October 19, 2007, the hearing justice denied the tax administrator’s motion as to Ms. Ricci’s claims. On October 30, 2007, the hearing justice granted a stay of proceedings to allow defendants to seek review in this Court by way of certiorari. The hearing justice determined that based on this Court’s decision in Park v. Ford Motor Co., 844 A.2d 687, 694 (R.I. 2004), in which we held that the Superior Court has jurisdiction over claims that are joined to a DTPA claim, there was ancillary jurisdiction over Ms. Ricci’s negligence claim because the Court was vested with jurisdiction over the DTPA claim. The hearing justice also relied on our decision in Park v. Ford Motor Co., 928 A.2d 469, 473 (R.I. 2007), where we held that the Superior Court may exercise ancillary jurisdiction over other claims that a plaintiff may have, even if those claims would not meet the amount-in-controversy requirement, when those claims are joined with a DTPA claim. 7', 'The defendants also argued that plaintiff Long’s claim was improper because his purchase was for business purposes, rather than as a consumer, and that plaintiff Ricci could not receive equitable relief because she owed more tax to the state than she had paid.', '-6-', 'Additionally, the hearing justice dismissed Mr. Long’s claim for lack of subject- matter jurisdiction because his use of the Dell computer was for business and as such, the DTPA was not available as a remedy. Consequently, the hearing justice found that the Superior Court did not have subject-matter jurisdiction over Mr. Long’s negligence claim because it could not possibly rise to the statutory threshold of $5,000. See G.L. 1956 § 8- 2-14(a) (the Superior Court has jurisdiction over all actions at law in which the amount in controversy exceeds $10,000 and has concurrent jurisdiction with the District Court in those actions at law in which the amount in controversy exceeds $5,000 but is less than $10,000).

Conversely, defendants and the tax administrator, argue that in its essence, this case is a tax case and that plaintiffs should have made and then exhausted their administrative remedies, first with the Division of Taxation, followed by an appeal to the Sixth Division District Court, in accordance with G.L. 1956 § 44-19-18.9', 'In short, we are confronted with two appellate contentions: first, whether the Superior Court was vested with subject-matter jurisdiction to hear this case and second, whether the hearing justice erred in refusing to dismiss Ricci’s case for failure to exhaust her statutory and administrative remedies, relative to the tax claims.', 'These issues inextricably are linked.', 'In tax aggrievement cases, a party first must exhaust administrative remedies, including an appeal to the District Court and then may seek a 9', 'General Laws 1956 § 44-19-18 provides:', '“Appeals from administrative orders or decisions made pursuant to any', 'provisions of this chapter are to the [S]ixth (6th) [D]ivision [D]istrict', ""[C]ourt pursuant to chapter 8 of title 8.

The defendants and the tax administrator urge us to hold that the Superior Court has no jurisdiction to entertain a DTPA case that may require the trial justice to interpret taxation statutes. We deem their arguments without merit.', 'As this Court has declared, “subject-matter jurisdiction is ‘an indispensable requisite in any judicial proceeding.’” Newman, 874 A.2d at 1288 (quoting Zarrella v. Minnesota Mutual Life Insurance Co., 824 A.2d 1249, 1256 (R.I. 2003)). Subject-matter jurisdiction is the very essence of the court’s power to hear and decide a case. Black’s Law Dictionary defines subject-matter jurisdiction as, “[j]urisdiction over the nature of the case and the type of relief sought; the extent to which a court can rule on the conduct of persons or the status of things.” Black’s Law Dictionary 931 (9th ed. 2009).', 'It was conceded by the tax administrator that consumer purchases of Dell products and optional service contracts were not taxable purchases. This makes clear that all consumers, including Ms. Ricci, should not have been charged for those taxes, which 10', 'General Laws 1956 § 8-8-32 provides:', '“Any party in interest, if aggrieved by a final judgment rendered in', 'proceedings brought under this chapter, may within twenty (20) days from', 'the date of entry of the judgment petition the [S]upreme [C]ourt of the', 'state of Rhode Island for a writ of certiorari to review any questions of law', 'involved.

This is consistent with the tax regulation that was in effect both at the time Dell initially sought guidance from the State of Rhode Island (Regulation SU 89-126) and at the time plaintiffs purchased their products (Regulation SU 00-126).12 Most importantly, this case does not concern an appeal from a decision by the tax administrator, who was given notice of this case because Dell disputed the tax administrator’s regulations and letter rulings. The plaintiffs are aggrieved by the actions of defendants, not the tax administrator.', 'Dell and the tax administrator point to our holding in Owner-Operators Independent Drivers Association of America v. State of Rhode Island, 541 A.2d 69, 73 (R.I. 1988) as support for their contention that this case is nothing more than a contested tax matter. We are satisfied, however, that Owner-Operators is distinguishable from the case before us. In that case, a foreign registered motor carrier was seeking a refund for a fuel decal tax imposed upon it by the Division of Taxation, individually and on behalf of others similarly situated. Id. at 70. The plaintiffs brought their class action in Superior Court against the State of Rhode Island, the Rhode Island Division of Taxation, its tax administrator, and the General Treasurer. Id. The plaintiffs’ complaint sought to have the fuel decal tax statute declared unconstitutional as a violation of both the commerce clause and the privileges and immunities clause of the United States Constitution.

Id. On appeal, this Court held that despite the presence of equitable claims for relief, Owner-Operators primarily was a tax case for which the District Court had exclusive jurisdiction. Id. at 73. The crucial teaching that we glean from that holding is: what is the gravamen of the claim? If the complaint raises an issue of taxation by a governmental body, then it should follow the administrative procedures laid out by the General Assembly and appeal to the District Court. However, if the claim sounds in tort, or alleges one or more regulatory violations, a plaintiff may proceed in Superior Court if the claim satisfies the threshold jurisdictional amount.', 'The key factors that readily distinguish the current case from Owner-Operators are that the class action in Owner-Operators was against the tax administrator as a named defendant and that the remedy sought was tax abatement. Owner-Operators, 541 A.2d at 70. These facts make it abundantly clear that the gravamen of the complaint was a taxation aggrievement. Accordingly, we held that, in accordance with § 8-8-24 and § 8- 8-3, the appropriate venue was the District Court. Owner-Operators, 541 A.2d at 73.', 'The case before us markedly differs from the issues raised in Owner-Operators. This is a negligence action coupled with a claim alleging deceptive trade practices. Here, the gravamen of plaintiffs’ complaint is whether Dell (not the tax administrator) committed a deceptive trade practice by collecting taxes on the purchase of optional service contracts. The plaintiffs argue that these service contracts are not taxable in Rhode Island and that Dell, not the tax administrator, ignored the relevant statutes and regulations when it collected the tax. The fact that Dell may have paid over the money to the Division of Taxation does not change this result. The plaintiffs filed this claim in Superior Court in accordance with chapter 13.1 of title 6 of the DTPA. “The General', '- 11 - Assembly, through the DTPA, has declared that ‘[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are * * * unlawful.’ Section 6-13.1-2. The DTPA provides a private right of action to recover actual and punitive damages and equitable relief for violations of its provisions. Section 6-13.1-5.2.” Chavers v. Fleet Bank (R.I.) N.A., 844 A.2d 666, 670 (R.I. 2004). The DTPA is a remedial act and it should be liberally construed.', 'In Chavers, 844 A.2d at 670, we held that in cases in which the “complained of activity is subject to regulation by a government agency,” private causes of action are precluded. “Specifically, the exemption contained in § 6-13.1-4 of the DTPA provides: ‘Nothing in this chapter shall apply to actions or transactions permitted under laws administered by the department of business regulation or other regulatory body or officer acting under statutory authority of this state or the United States.’” Chavers, 844 A.2d at 670. We deem this holding distinguishable from the case before us because the DTPA does not exempt the fraudulent collection of taxes from its provisions. Further, it would lead to an absurd result if, as the case before us alleges, the collection of the tax is the deceptive trade practice and the DTPA was not available as a remedy. As we have suggested recently, “[t]his [C]ourt will not construe a statute to reach an absurd result.” Shepard v. Harleysville Worcester Ins. Co., 944 A.2d 167, 170 (R.I. 2008) (quoting Kaya v. Partington, 681 A.2d 256, 261 (R.I. 1996)). It is clear from its language that nothing in the DTPA requires exhaustion of administrative remedies and we decline to hold otherwise.', 'Section 6-13.1-5.2(a) of the DTPA provides that:', '“Any person * * * may bring an action under Rules of Civil', 'Procedure in the [S]uperior [C]ourt of the county in which', 'the seller or lessor resides, is found, has his or her principal', '- 12 -', 'place of business, or is doing business, or in the [S]uperior', '[C]ourt of the county as is otherwise provided by law, to', 'recover actual damages or two hundred dollars ($200),', 'whichever is greater. The court may, in its discretion,', 'award punitive damages and may provide other equitable', 'relief that it deems necessary or proper.” (Emphases', 'added.) Accordingly, because the language of the statute is clear, we are of the opinion that the deceptive trade practice at issue in this case properly was brought in Superior Court, which was vested with subject-matter jurisdiction under the DTPA. Further, the Superior Court was correct in exercising ancillary jurisdiction over Ms. Ricci’s negligence claim.', 'Conclusion', 'In conclusion, we hold that the Superior Court was vested with subject-matter jurisdiction to hear this deceptive trade practice cause of action and has ancillary jurisdiction over the common-law negligence claim, notwithstanding the amount in controversy.13 We pause to note, however, that although the defendant, tax administrator was not an original party, as an intervenor, should the Superior Court’s decision on remand be adverse to the defendant tax administrator, he may appeal that ruling to this Court.14 13', 'The defendants expend great energy and urge us to pay attention to Ms. Ricci’s failure to pay any use tax on her Dell products. Essentially, their point is that whatever Ms. Ricci or any plaintiff, may collect in damages will have to be remitted for failure to pay the use tax. Although that issue is not before us – it is, however, clear that anyone who joins this putative class action most likely will be charged a tax since the Division of Taxation does not collect that tax in the first instance. In short, we note that the Taxman Cometh and that the representatives of the class, and their counsel, must apprise these parties of this eventually. 14', 'As we recently held in Shepard v.

80,"Michael Medeiros : v. : Laura Sitrin et al. : Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty, and Robinson, JJ. OPINION Justice Flaherty, for the Court. Before this Court is an appeal by Michael Medeiros from a judgment as a matter of law entered in the Superior Court in favor of the defendants, Ronald Ford and the City of Newport. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on November 3, 2009, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After hearing the parties’ arguments and considering the memoranda submitted by counsel, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide this appeal at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. I Facts and Travel Medeiros fractured his ankle on February 1, 2002, when he was a twelfth-grade student at Rogers High School in Newport. The injury occurred after Medeiros’s tardy arrival to his -1- Marine Occupations class, which was taught by defendant Ronald Ford.1 The Marine Occupations class prepares students in a variety of endeavors, including boat building and painting, welding, and fisheries. Because the class has a practical component as well as traditional instruction, it is taught in both a classroom and an adjoining laboratory (lab) in which the students receive hands-on training in boat building and servicing. Instruction first began in the class, but to enter the classroom, students were required to first pass through the lab. The opening between the classroom and lab had no door, facilitating passage between the two rooms. Ford’s practice was to position himself near the entrance to the lab from the outside before his class was to begin. This allowed him to “monitor” the students coming into the Marine Occupations class and also to observe the students as they passed to their next classes. When it was time for this class to begin, Ford would look outside for any lingering students. He and the students in the lab would wait for any final students to enter and then they would all proceed directly from the lab to the adjoining classroom as Ford followed behind. Once in the classroom, Ford would take attendance and distribute any materials. He would also visually assess the students to determine whether any looked ill or appeared to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol and therefore not physically capable of working with equipment in the lab. Ford performed these duties from his desk within the classroom. From that vantage point, he had “limited” visibility into the lab and could not see its entrance. Because he lacked a view of the door connecting the lab to the outside, Ford purposely never oiled or greased the door, which had an audible squeak that alerted him when the door was opened, possibly by a tardy student. 1 Ford retired in 2003. -2- On February 1, 2002, Ford, in keeping with his typical classroom practices, waited a few seconds after the bell for late students and then accompanied his students into the classroom. Approximately a minute and a half after the class period commenced, Ford had “pretty much” completed taking attendance. As he distributed information and forms to the students in the classroom, he “heard a very[,] very loud crash and a bang” as the lab door opened. He then “heard a commotion that sounded like people were moving at a rapid rate” for two to three seconds; this was followed immediately by a “crashing sound.” Ford left the classroom immediately and went into the lab, where he saw Medeiros lying on the ground.2 After promptly summoning the school nurse, Ford observed two of his students in the lab who had not been in the classroom: Brandon Burd and Jared Carlton. Ford had never before encountered any disciplinary issues with either of them. Medeiros had arrived late to Marine Occupations class that day because, before he proceeded to class, he picked up his paycheck for an after-school job coordinated through the school.3 This was not the first time Medeiros had been late to class after retrieving his paycheck. Ford had discussed Medeiros’s tardiness with him, and he had never given him permission to be late. Medeiros said that he entered the classroom through the lab door and when he opened the door it squeaked but then crashed against the building because of the wind. As soon as he entered the lab, he saw two students, Burd and Carlton, at their lockers. Medeiros said that he had problems with Carlton in the past when Carlton “picked on” him. According to Medeiros, 2 Ford had the class accompany him to the lab because he didn’t “want them to be in the classroom alone.” 3 Medeiros picked up his paycheck at the main office every two weeks since November of 2001. It took him ten minutes to do so and he also purposely walked slowly on his way from the office to class to minimize the amount of time that he spent in class. -3- Burd “grabbed [his] paycheck out of [his] hand.” He attempted to retrieve the check from Burd, but Carlton “jumped on [his] back.” Medeiros attempted to hold on to a workbench but lost his balance and fell into a sawhorse. When he tried to get up from the floor, he realized that his foot was “pointing at a 90-degree angle” to his leg. About five seconds elapsed from the time Medeiros entered the lab until he fell to the floor. The school nurse came to Medeiros’s assistance.4 Emergency vehicles transported Medeiros to the hospital. There, an emergency room physician diagnosed Medeiros’s injury as a fracture and dislocation of his ankle. Four days after the initial injury, Medeiros underwent a procedure to place “a steel plate and several screws” in his ankle so that, according to Medeiros, it would “heal straight.” On October 8, 2004, Medeiros filed suit against defendants, Ford and the City of Newport. In count 1 of his complaint, plaintiff alleged that Ford and the City of Newport owed him “a duty of reasonable care in the supervision of students within their charge,” that they breached that duty to exercise reasonable care, and that the breach was the proximate cause of plaintiff’s injury. In count 2, plaintiff alleged that the City of Newport had “a duty to exercise a reasonable degree of care in the hiring, training and supervision” of Ford, that it breached this duty, and that this breach proximately caused plaintiff’s injury. A jury trial was held in Superior Court on April 28 and 29, 2008. After plaintiff rested, defendants moved for a judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. The trial justice granted the motion for 4 Medeiros’s father, Manuel Medeiros, is a police officer for the City of Newport, and was working the day of his son’s accident. He received a call that his son had been injured at school and he then went to the high school. According to Officer Medeiros, Ford told him “[t]hat this type of behavior had happened before; he was surprised that something like that had not happened sooner.” -4- judgment as a matter of law on count 2 after the parties agreed that no evidence had been presented on that count. As for the sole remaining count, defendants maintained that plaintiff had established neither a standard of care beyond a general duty of reasonable supervision nor Ford’s deviation from even that standard. The plaintiff argued that Ford had a “duty to supervise students within his charge” as established through Ford’s testimony and the direction in the Teacher’s Handbook that “[s]tudents must be supervised at all times.” The plaintiff contended that Ford therefore had a duty to supervise foreseeably late students who would have to travel through the lab to reach the classroom. The plaintiff further argued that Ford breached this duty because he was not present in the lab and was therefore unable to supervise Medeiros’s late arrival in class on the day of his injury. Also, plaintiff argued that Ford’s breach of the duty to supervise was the proximate cause of Medeiros’s injury because it was foreseeable that students would be entering the lab and “could get into some horseplay and someone could get injured.” The trial justice granted the motion. He found that there were “no * * * factual issues upon which reasonable persons might draw different conclusions.” The trial justice also found that Ford’s testimony as to his classroom practices was “clear cut” and “uncontradicted.” The trial justice held that Ford did not have a duty to supervise “at all times while he was doing different functions that must be performed by him,” such as fulfilling his obligation to take attendance. He determined that Ford was aware of his duty to supervise and that there was no evidence “that he was abrogating that duty.” Additionally, the trial justice determined that Ford could not have “anticipated” the incident that occurred among the three boys within a five- second time span. Therefore, the trial justice ruled that Ford did not breach his duty to supervise his students. Medeiros timely appealed. -5- II Analysis The sole issue on appeal is whether the trial justice erred when he granted defendants’ motion for judgment as a matter of law rather than submitting the case to the jury. The plaintiff argues that the jury could have assessed liability to Ford if it found he had breached his duty to supervise his students due to his absence from the lab when the incident that resulted in plaintiff’s injury took place. He argues that expert testimony was not necessary, because a teacher’s duty to supervise and the breach thereof are matters within the common knowledge of the jury. Finally, plaintiff contends that a jury could find that Ford’s breach of his duty to supervise was the proximate cause of Medeiros’s injury, rather than the acts of Burd and Carlton, because a ruckus among the tardy students in the lab while Ford was in the classroom was reasonably foreseeable to him. A Standard of Review Our review of a trial justice’s decision on a motion for judgment as a matter of law is de novo. Gianquitti v. Atwood Medical Associates, Ltd., 973 A.2d 580, 589 (R.I. 2009) (citing Franco v. Latina, 916 A.2d 1251, 1258 (R.I. 2007)). Therefore, “[t]his Court, like the trial justice, will examine ‘the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, without weighing the evidence or evaluating the credibility of witnesses, and draw from the record all reasonable inferences that support the position of the nonmoving party.’” Oliveira v. Jacobson, 846 A.2d 822, 829 (R.I. 2004) (quoting Estate of Fontes v. Salomone, 824 A.2d 433, 437 (R.I. 2003)). Rule 50(a)(1) provides: -6- “If during a trial by jury a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue, the court may determine the issue against that party and may grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law against that party with respect to a claim or defense that cannot under the controlling law be maintained or defeated without a favorable finding on that issue.” Accordingly, the trial justice may grant a Rule 50(a)(1) motion “if, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, she determines that the nonmoving party has not presented legally sufficient evidence to allow the trier of fact to arrive at a verdict in his favor.” Gianquitti, 973 A.2d at 589 (quoting Franco, 916 A.2d at 1259). However, the trial justice must deny the motion and submit the issues to the jury if there are factual issues on which reasonable people may draw different conclusions. DeChristofaro v. Machala, 685 A.2d 258, 262 (R.I. 1996). B Discussion To maintain a cause of action for negligence, the plaintiff must establish four elements: (1) a legally cognizable duty owed by defendant to plaintiff; (2) breach of that duty; (3) that the conduct proximately caused the injury; and (4) actual loss or damage. Santana v. Rainbow Cleaners, Inc., 969 A.2d 653, 658 (R.I. 2009) (citing Willis v. Omar, 954 A.2d 126, 129 (R.I. 2008)). A plaintiff who asserts a cause of action based on negligence has the burden to “establish a standard of care and prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant deviated from that standard of care.” Riley v. Stone, 900 A.2d 1087, 1095 (R.I. 2006) (citing Morales v. Town of Johnston, 895 A.2d 721, 732 (R.I. 2006)). We have examined the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff and have drawn all reasonable inferences that support his claim. After doing so, we are of the view that, although Ford had a duty to supervise his -7- students, plaintiff did not offer legally sufficient evidence that Ford breached this duty and, therefore, a reasonable jury could not find for plaintiff on the issue of negligence. As a result of the dearth of evidence to support an essential element of a cause of action for negligence, breach of a legally cognizable duty, we hold that the trial justice properly entered judgment as a matter of law in favor of defendants. 1 Duty to Supervise The plaintiff argues that Ford had a duty of “[c]onstant supervision” of the students and was required “to remain” with them. The plaintiff asserts that this duty is established by G.L. 1956 § 16-2-17, which provides that students have “a right to attend * * * a school which is safe and secure, and which is conducive to learning, and which is free from the threat, actual or implied, of physical harm by a disruptive student” and by the Rogers High School Teacher’s Handbook, which directs teachers to supervise students “at all times.” The plaintiff further directs our attention to case law from other jurisdictions, requiring schools and their faculties to exercise the care “’which a person of ordinary prudence, charged with [comparable] duties, would exercise under the same circumstances’” when they supervise students. Dailey v. Los Angeles Unified School District, 470 P.2d 360, 363 (Cal. 1970); see also Wyke v. Polk County School Board, 129 F.3d 560, 571 (11th Cir. 1997); Roberson v. Duval County School Board, 618 So.2d 360, 362 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1993); Collins v. School Board of Broward County, 471 So.2d 560, 564 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1985); Eisel v. Board of Education of Montgomery County, 597 A.2d 447, 451-52 (Md. 1991). The defendants concede that Ford had a duty to supervise his -8- students. Indeed, Ford testified that he was responsible for supervising the students in his class.5 Therefore, for the purposes of this appeal, we will assume, without deciding, that Ford had a duty to supervise Medeiros, Burd, and Carlton under the particular facts in this case. 2 Evidence of Ford’s Deviation from the Standard of Care The defendants argue that plaintiff failed to present evidence establishing that Ford breached his duty to supervise. The defendants assert that expert testimony was necessary because Ford’s teaching environment encompassed two adjoining rooms, one of which contained “potentially dangerous equipment” and was “a situation unique even for every day teachers, let alone the typical juror.” The defendants argue that Ford’s teaching situation further departed from the “regular classroom setting” because it was imperative that Ford assess the students’ fitness to work with the dangerous equipment prior to allowing them to leave the classroom and enter the lab. Conversely, plaintiff asserts that expert testimony is unnecessary to establish either a standard of care or a deviation therefrom, because the jury may apply its “common knowledge and experience” to determine whether Ford breached his duty to supervise his students. 5 “Q: * * * Now, you agree that as a teacher at Rogers High School, that you had a role in supervising students? “A: Yes. “* * * “Q: * * * So do you agree that your supervisory role over students in the marine occupations class extends to both students in the classroom and students in the laboratory? “A: Providing that they come in when they’re supposed to come in. *** “* * * my role in the laboratory upon entrance is as soon as they come in I’m responsible for their everything.” -9- After carefully reviewing the record, including Ford’s uncontradicted testimony about his classroom practices, it is our view that plaintiff failed to demonstrate in any way that Ford breached his duty of supervision. Although the handbook specifies the requirement that teachers must supervise the students “at all times,” plaintiff did not establish “a specific act or omission [of Ford] that indicated a deviation from the proper standard of care.” Morales, 895 A.2d at 732. For example, plaintiff did not offer any evidence about whether a teacher’s duty of supervision “at all times” requires the teacher’s constant physical presence with each student, as plaintiff suggests. Indeed, even the case law from other jurisdictions that plaintiff cites to support the proposed standard of care for teachers in supervising their students does not contemplate that a teacher’s physical absence from a student is necessarily a breach of the duty to supervise. See Collins, 471 So.2d at 564 (quoting Cirillo v. City of Milwaukee, 150 N.W.2d 460, 465 (Wis. 1967) (enumerating factors to consider when determining whether a teacher exercised “reasonable care” when supervising students, the fifth of which is “the reason for and duration of the teacher’s absence”). Additionally, plaintiff failed to offer any evidence about the supervisory expectations of teachers over late students, particularly in consideration of the unique nature of Ford’s duties and teaching environment in a shop-style class held in both a classroom and an adjoining lab, or of Ford’s deviation from the standard of care expected of teachers in such situations. Morales, 895 A.2d at 732. Although Officer Medeiros testified that Ford told him after the incident that he was surprised that it had not happened sooner, there was no evidence to suggest that Ford knew or should have known that the three students were in the laboratory at that particular moment. Indeed, Ford testified that “[i]f they came in the door unannounced late intentionally, how would I know they were there?” Therefore, the handbook’s unclarified and somewhat aspirational - 10 - directive to teachers to supervise students “at all times” and Ford’s uncontradicted testimony as to his long-standing classroom practices are insufficient to sustain plaintiff’s burden to any reasonable jury. Moreover, in our view, the cases plaintiff cites from other jurisdictions applying the standard of care “’which a person of ordinary prudence, charged with [comparable] duties, would exercise under the same circumstances’” offer little guidance to establish that Ford breached his duty of supervision because they are factually distinct from this case. Dailey, 470 P.2d at 363. We therefore disagree with plaintiff’s argument that “ample” evidence existed on which a reasonable jury could find that Ford breached his duty of supervision because plaintiff did not present any evidence about how an ordinarily prudent teacher would act in the same circumstances. After reviewing the case law from other jurisdictions holding that teachers breached a duty to supervise, it is our opinion that these cases do not support a conclusion that plaintiff established sufficient evidence that a reasonable jury could find that Ford breached his duty.6 For example, in Dailey, 470 P.2d at 362, a case from the Supreme Court of California, a student died after falling and fracturing his skull in the course of “slap box[ing]” with a friend during their free time after the lunch period and before their next class commenced. The event 6 Wyke v. Polk County School Board, 129 F.3d 560, 574 (11th Cir. 1997) (holding duty to supervise students includes informing parents about suicide attempts in school); Roberson v. Duval County School Board, 618 So.2d 360, 362 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1993) (holding jury issue presented as to whether teacher “exercised a reasonable standard of care in supervising the students” when a student punched a classmate in the face after she loudly told him within earshot of the teacher to stop trying to trip her as the class walked back to their classroom after lunch); Collins v. School Board of Broward County, 471 So.2d 560, 564-65 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1985) (holding duty to supervise breached where substitute teacher, who may have left the class unattended, did not notice a sexual assault of one student by another in the classroom during class time); Eisel v. Board of Education of Montgomery County, 597 A.2d 447, 456 (Md. 1991) (holding school counselor aware of suicide pact between students had a duty to communicate with parents regarding his knowledge of the pact). - 11 - lasted for five to ten minutes, and approximately thirty students gathered to observe. Id. The individual in the school department responsible for supervising the area where the injury occurred spent lunch time in the “gym office.” Id. He was seated “away from the office windows,” and a wall blocked his view of the area where the students’ boxing match transpired. Id. at 363. Further, he did not leave the office nor notice the crowd of students or hear anything unusual. Id. The court held that the evidence was such that “a jury could reasonably conclude that [the] employees * * * who were charged with the responsibility of providing supervision failed to exercise due care in performance of this duty.” Id. at 365. The court reasoned that the evidence supported the holding because the individual “did not station himself in the office in such a fashion as to maximize his ability to observe the students outside, but sat with his back to the window” and did not hear or see the match despite of the fact that it occurred “within a few feet of the gymnasium.” Id. Here, however, Ford did not isolate himself in his office like the supervising teacher in Dailey, in complete dereliction of the duty to supervise. Rather, Ford actively carried out his obligations when he took attendance and observed his students for signs that they were capable of safely participating in class. Although Ford also did not position himself to “maximize” his view of the lab because his desk was in a position that traded off an improved view of the lab for access to the overhead projector, he still had a partial view of the lab, unlike the supervisor in Dailey, who sat with his back to the window and thus had no view of the area where the students were. Additionally, Ford heard the just seconds-long altercation occur and was immediately in the laboratory to assist Medeiros, unlike the supervisor in Dailey who did not hear the boxing match as it was ongoing for five to ten minutes. When compared with the evidence of breach of the duty to supervise in the cases plaintiff cites to support a conclusion that Ford breached his - 12 - duty, the legally sufficient evidence presented in favor of the contention that a reasonable jury could find that Ford breached his duty of supervision is lacking. See also Wyke, 129 F.3d at 574; Roberson, 618 So.2d at 362; Collins, 471 So.2d at 565; Eisel, 597 A.2d at 456. After viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party as we must, we hold that there are no factual issues on which reasonable people might draw different conclusions. Accordingly, the plaintiff cannot prevail on a cause of action for negligence and the trial justice’s grant of the defendants’ motion for judgment as a matter of law was proper.7 III Conclusion For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court and remand the papers in this case to that tribunal. 7 The defendants also argued at trial to support their Super. R. Civ. P. 50 motion that the public duty doctrine supported judgment in their favor because the doctrine immunized defendants from any liability. The public-duty doctrine shields government municipalities “from tort liability arising out of discretionary governmental actions that by their nature are not ordinarily performed by private persons.” Morales v. Town of Johnston, 895 A.2d 721, 730 (R.I. 2006) (quoting Schultz v. Foster-Glocester Regional School District, 755 A.2d 153, 155 (R.I. 2000)). However, there are three exceptions to this liability shield, which impose “limitations on the immunity of government.” Quality Court Condominium Association v. Quality Hill Development Corp., 641 A.2d 746, 750 (R.I. 1994); see also Kuzniar v. Keach, 709 A.2d 1050, 1053 (R.I. 1998). Liability may attach “(1) when the governmental entity owes a ‘special duty’ to the plaintiff, (2) when the alleged act or omission on the part of the governmental entity was egregious, or (3) when the governmental entity engaged in activities normally undertaken by private individuals or corporations.” Schultz, 755 A.2d at 155 (quoting Kuzniar, 709 A.2d at 1053). The plaintiff argues that the public-duty doctrine is inapplicable because he was an “identifiable person” to whom defendants owed a “special duty.” The trial justice declined to address the issue. We need not and do not reach this issue because it is our view that plaintiff failed to prove liability in this case.",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. Before this Court is an appeal by Michael Medeiros from a judgment as a matter of law entered in the Superior Court in favor of the defendants, Ronald Ford and the City of Newport. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on November 3, 2009, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After hearing the parties’ arguments and considering the memoranda submitted by counsel, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide this appeal at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Medeiros fractured his ankle on February 1, 2002, when he was a twelfth-grade student at Rogers High School in Newport. The injury occurred after Medeiros’s tardy arrival to his', '-1- Marine Occupations class, which was taught by defendant Ronald Ford.1', 'The Marine Occupations class prepares students in a variety of endeavors, including boat building and painting, welding, and fisheries.', 'Because the class has a practical component as well as traditional instruction, it is taught in both a classroom and an adjoining laboratory (lab) in which the students receive hands-on training in boat building and servicing. Instruction first began in the class, but to enter the classroom, students were required to first pass through the lab. The opening between the classroom and lab had no door, facilitating passage between the two rooms. Ford’s practice was to position himself near the entrance to the lab from the outside before his class was to begin.', 'This allowed him to “monitor” the students coming into the Marine Occupations class and also to observe the students as they passed to their next classes.', 'When it was time for this class to begin, Ford would look outside for any lingering students. He and the students in the lab would wait for any final students to enter and then they would all proceed directly from the lab to the adjoining classroom as Ford followed behind. Once in the classroom, Ford would take attendance and distribute any materials. He would also visually assess the students to determine whether any looked ill or appeared to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol and therefore not physically capable of working with equipment in the lab. Ford performed these duties from his desk within the classroom. From that vantage point, he had “limited” visibility into the lab and could not see its entrance. Because he lacked a view of the door connecting the lab to the outside, Ford purposely never oiled or greased the door, which had an audible squeak that alerted him when the door was opened, possibly by a tardy student. 1', 'Ford retired in 2003.', '-2-', 'On February 1, 2002, Ford, in keeping with his typical classroom practices, waited a few seconds after the bell for late students and then accompanied his students into the classroom. Approximately a minute and a half after the class period commenced, Ford had “pretty much” completed taking attendance. As he distributed information and forms to the students in the classroom, he “heard a very[,] very loud crash and a bang” as the lab door opened. He then “heard a commotion that sounded like people were moving at a rapid rate” for two to three seconds; this was followed immediately by a “crashing sound.”', 'Ford left the classroom immediately and went into the lab, where he saw Medeiros lying on the ground.2 After promptly summoning the school nurse, Ford observed two of his students in the lab who had not been in the classroom: Brandon Burd and Jared Carlton. Ford had never before encountered any disciplinary issues with either of them.', 'Medeiros had arrived late to Marine Occupations class that day because, before he proceeded to class, he picked up his paycheck for an after-school job coordinated through the school.3 This was not the first time Medeiros had been late to class after retrieving his paycheck. Ford had discussed Medeiros’s tardiness with him, and he had never given him permission to be late.', 'Medeiros said that he entered the classroom through the lab door and when he opened the door it squeaked but then crashed against the building because of the wind. As soon as he entered the lab, he saw two students, Burd and Carlton, at their lockers. Medeiros said that he had problems with Carlton in the past when Carlton “picked on” him. According to Medeiros, 2', 'Ford had the class accompany him to the lab because he didn’t “want them to be in the classroom alone.” 3', 'Medeiros picked up his paycheck at the main office every two weeks since November of 2001. It took him ten minutes to do so and he also purposely walked slowly on his way from the office to class to minimize the amount of time that he spent in class.', '-3- Burd “grabbed [his] paycheck out of [his] hand.” He attempted to retrieve the check from Burd, but Carlton “jumped on [his] back.” Medeiros attempted to hold on to a workbench but lost his balance and fell into a sawhorse. When he tried to get up from the floor, he realized that his foot was “pointing at a 90-degree angle” to his leg. About five seconds elapsed from the time Medeiros entered the lab until he fell to the floor. The school nurse came to Medeiros’s assistance.4', 'Emergency vehicles transported Medeiros to the hospital. There, an emergency room physician diagnosed Medeiros’s injury as a fracture and dislocation of his ankle. Four days after the initial injury, Medeiros underwent a procedure to place “a steel plate and several screws” in his ankle so that, according to Medeiros, it would “heal straight.”', 'On October 8, 2004, Medeiros filed suit against defendants, Ford and the City of Newport. In count 1 of his complaint, plaintiff alleged that Ford and the City of Newport owed him “a duty of reasonable care in the supervision of students within their charge,” that they breached that duty to exercise reasonable care, and that the breach was the proximate cause of plaintiff’s injury. In count 2, plaintiff alleged that the City of Newport had “a duty to exercise a reasonable degree of care in the hiring, training and supervision” of Ford, that it breached this duty, and that this breach proximately caused plaintiff’s injury. A jury trial was held in Superior Court on April 28 and 29, 2008.', 'After plaintiff rested, defendants moved for a judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. The trial justice granted the motion for 4', 'Medeiros’s father, Manuel Medeiros, is a police officer for the City of Newport, and was working the day of his son’s accident. He received a call that his son had been injured at school and he then went to the high school. According to Officer Medeiros, Ford told him “[t]hat this type of behavior had happened before; he was surprised that something like that had not happened sooner.”', '-4- judgment as a matter of law on count 2 after the parties agreed that no evidence had been presented on that count. As for the sole remaining count, defendants maintained that plaintiff had established neither a standard of care beyond a general duty of reasonable supervision nor Ford’s deviation from even that standard. The plaintiff argued that Ford had a “duty to supervise students within his charge” as established through Ford’s testimony and the direction in the Teacher’s Handbook that “[s]tudents must be supervised at all times.” The plaintiff contended that Ford therefore had a duty to supervise foreseeably late students who would have to travel through the lab to reach the classroom. The plaintiff further argued that Ford breached this duty because he was not present in the lab and was therefore unable to supervise Medeiros’s late arrival in class on the day of his injury. Also, plaintiff argued that Ford’s breach of the duty to supervise was the proximate cause of Medeiros’s injury because it was foreseeable that students would be entering the lab and “could get into some horseplay and someone could get injured.”', 'The trial justice granted the motion. He found that there were “no * * * factual issues upon which reasonable persons might draw different conclusions.” The trial justice also found that Ford’s testimony as to his classroom practices was “clear cut” and “uncontradicted.” The trial justice held that Ford did not have a duty to supervise “at all times while he was doing different functions that must be performed by him,” such as fulfilling his obligation to take attendance. He determined that Ford was aware of his duty to supervise and that there was no evidence “that he was abrogating that duty.” Additionally, the trial justice determined that Ford could not have “anticipated” the incident that occurred among the three boys within a five- second time span. Therefore, the trial justice ruled that Ford did not breach his duty to supervise his students. Medeiros timely appealed.', '-5-', 'II', 'Analysis', 'The sole issue on appeal is whether the trial justice erred when he granted defendants’ motion for judgment as a matter of law rather than submitting the case to the jury. The plaintiff argues that the jury could have assessed liability to Ford if it found he had breached his duty to supervise his students due to his absence from the lab when the incident that resulted in plaintiff’s injury took place. He argues that expert testimony was not necessary, because a teacher’s duty to supervise and the breach thereof are matters within the common knowledge of the jury. Finally, plaintiff contends that a jury could find that Ford’s breach of his duty to supervise was the proximate cause of Medeiros’s injury, rather than the acts of Burd and Carlton, because a ruckus among the tardy students in the lab while Ford was in the classroom was reasonably foreseeable to him.', 'A', 'Standard of Review', 'Our review of a trial justice’s decision on a motion for judgment as a matter of law is de novo.

City of Milwaukee, 150 N.W.2d 460, 465 (Wis. 1967) (enumerating factors to consider when determining whether a teacher exercised “reasonable care” when supervising students, the fifth of which is “the reason for and duration of the teacher’s absence”).', 'Additionally, plaintiff failed to offer any evidence about the supervisory expectations of teachers over late students, particularly in consideration of the unique nature of Ford’s duties and teaching environment in a shop-style class held in both a classroom and an adjoining lab, or of Ford’s deviation from the standard of care expected of teachers in such situations. Morales, 895 A.2d at 732. Although Officer Medeiros testified that Ford told him after the incident that he was surprised that it had not happened sooner, there was no evidence to suggest that Ford knew or should have known that the three students were in the laboratory at that particular moment. Indeed, Ford testified that “[i]f they came in the door unannounced late intentionally, how would I know they were there?” Therefore, the handbook’s unclarified and somewhat aspirational', '- 10 - directive to teachers to supervise students “at all times” and Ford’s uncontradicted testimony as to his long-standing classroom practices are insufficient to sustain plaintiff’s burden to any reasonable jury.', 'Moreover, in our view, the cases plaintiff cites from other jurisdictions applying the standard of care “’which a person of ordinary prudence, charged with [comparable] duties, would exercise under the same circumstances’” offer little guidance to establish that Ford breached his duty of supervision because they are factually distinct from this case. Dailey, 470 P.2d at 363. We therefore disagree with plaintiff’s argument that “ample” evidence existed on which a reasonable jury could find that Ford breached his duty of supervision because plaintiff did not present any evidence about how an ordinarily prudent teacher would act in the same circumstances. After reviewing the case law from other jurisdictions holding that teachers breached a duty to supervise, it is our opinion that these cases do not support a conclusion that plaintiff established sufficient evidence that a reasonable jury could find that Ford breached his duty.6', 'For example, in Dailey, 470 P.2d at 362, a case from the Supreme Court of California, a student died after falling and fracturing his skull in the course of “slap box[ing]” with a friend during their free time after the lunch period and before their next class commenced.

He was seated “away from the office windows,” and a wall blocked his view of the area where the students’ boxing match transpired. Id. at 363. Further, he did not leave the office nor notice the crowd of students or hear anything unusual. Id. The court held that the evidence was such that “a jury could reasonably conclude that [the] employees * * * who were charged with the responsibility of providing supervision failed to exercise due care in performance of this duty.” Id. at 365. The court reasoned that the evidence supported the holding because the individual “did not station himself in the office in such a fashion as to maximize his ability to observe the students outside, but sat with his back to the window” and did not hear or see the match despite of the fact that it occurred “within a few feet of the gymnasium.” Id.', 'Here, however, Ford did not isolate himself in his office like the supervising teacher in Dailey, in complete dereliction of the duty to supervise. Rather, Ford actively carried out his obligations when he took attendance and observed his students for signs that they were capable of safely participating in class. Although Ford also did not position himself to “maximize” his view of the lab because his desk was in a position that traded off an improved view of the lab for access to the overhead projector, he still had a partial view of the lab, unlike the supervisor in Dailey, who sat with his back to the window and thus had no view of the area where the students were. Additionally, Ford heard the just seconds-long altercation occur and was immediately in the laboratory to assist Medeiros, unlike the supervisor in Dailey who did not hear the boxing match as it was ongoing for five to ten minutes. When compared with the evidence of breach of the duty to supervise in the cases plaintiff cites to support a conclusion that Ford breached his', '- 12 - duty, the legally sufficient evidence presented in favor of the contention that a reasonable jury could find that Ford breached his duty of supervision is lacking. See also Wyke, 129 F.3d at 574; Roberson, 618 So.2d at 362; Collins, 471 So.2d at 565; Eisel, 597 A.2d at 456.', 'After viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party as we must, we hold that there are no factual issues on which reasonable people might draw different conclusions. Accordingly, the plaintiff cannot prevail on a cause of action for negligence and the trial justice’s grant of the defendants’ motion for judgment as a matter of law was proper.7', 'III', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court and remand the papers in this case to that tribunal. 7', 'The defendants also argued at trial to support their Super. R. Civ. P. 50 motion that the public duty doctrine supported judgment in their favor because the doctrine immunized defendants from any liability.

Town of Johnston, 895 A.2d 721, 730 (R.I. 2006) (quoting Schultz v. Foster-Glocester Regional School District, 755 A.2d 153, 155 (R.I. 2000)). However, there are three exceptions to this liability shield, which impose “limitations on the immunity of government.”', 'Quality Court Condominium Association v. Quality Hill Development Corp., 641 A.2d 746, 750 (R.I. 1994); see also Kuzniar v. Keach, 709 A.2d 1050, 1053 (R.I. 1998). Liability may attach “(1) when the governmental entity owes a ‘special duty’ to the plaintiff, (2) when the alleged act or omission on the part of the governmental entity was egregious, or (3) when the governmental entity engaged in activities normally undertaken by private individuals or corporations.” Schultz, 755 A.2d at 155 (quoting Kuzniar, 709 A.2d at 1053). The plaintiff argues that the public-duty doctrine is inapplicable because he was an “identifiable person” to whom defendants owed a “special duty.” The trial justice declined to address the issue. We need not and do not reach this issue because it is our view that plaintiff failed to prove liability in this case.', '- 13 - ']"
81,"State : v. : Jerry Coleman. : Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty, Robinson, JJ., and Williams, C.J. (ret.). OPINION Chief Justice Williams (ret.), for the Court. The defendant, Jerry Coleman, appeals from a Superior Court order denying his motion to reduce sentence pursuant to Rule 35 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on September 30, 2009, pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After examining the written and oral submissions of the parties, we conclude that this appeal may be resolved without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the order of the Superior Court. I Facts and Travel The facts of this case are more elaborately presented in State v. Coleman, 909 A.2d 929 (R.I. 2006). We discuss only those facts relevant to Mr. Coleman’s present appeal. At approximately 9:30 p.m. on July 3, 2001, Mr. Coleman and his confederate, Jeffrey Alston a/k/a Kam Ausar,1 broke into the Warwick home of Dennis and Suzanne Laven. While the two were 1 Jeffrey Alston is also known as Kam Ausar. On November 2, 2005, this Court issued an order granting Mr. Alston’s motion to amend the record to reflect this name change. For the sake of -1- still inside, Mr. and Mrs. Laven returned home and noticed a suspicious car outside their house. Noticing that their front door was ajar and a light was on inside the house, Mr. Laven approached the house, yelling some approximation of “[g]et out of the house, we’re home.” Just then, he observed two men run out of his house and into the nearby woods. Mr. Laven briefly gave chase, but then returned to the suspicious vehicle parked out front and removed the keys from the ignition. Meanwhile, Mrs. Laven phoned 911 from a portable telephone that she had retrieved from inside the house. She then joined her husband to wait in the driveway for the two men to return from the woods, which they did a short time later. As Mr. Coleman and Mr. Alston emerged from the woods, Mr. Laven yelled to them that he had their keys and that the police were on their way. After confirming that the keys were not in the ignition, the larger of the two men charged Mr. Laven, stating that he had a knife and was going to stab him.2 As the larger man charged, Mr. Laven threw the keys into the woods and steeled himself for the altercation. As the fight between Mr. Laven and the larger man ensued, the smaller of the two men joined the fight and struck Mr. Laven in the head from behind and kicked him repeatedly. Mr. Laven and the two men continued to fight until the smaller man returned to the car to try to start it. A short time later, the larger man abruptly ceased fighting and joined the smaller man at the car. Just as suddenly, the larger man returned to Mr. Laven, this time declaring that he had a gun and was going to shoot him. Another fight between the two men ensued until the larger man turned his attention to Mrs. Laven and told her he was going to shoot her. In response, Mrs. Laven surrendered her own car keys and the larger man returned to simplicity, however, we will refer to Kam Ausar as Jeffrey Alston. See State v. Coleman, 909 A.2d 929, 931 n.1 (R.I. 2006). 2 The Lavens were unable to identify Mr. Alston and Mr. Coleman, however, the jury in Mr. Alston’s trial convicted him of felony assault, while, the jury in Mr. Coleman’s trial found him guilty of the lesser-included offense of simple assault. See State v. Alston, 900 A.2d 1212, 1217 (R.I. 2006); see also Coleman, 909 A.2d at 932. -2- his car believing the keys to be his. The smaller man then unsuccessfully attempted to start his car. Suddenly, the headlights from a neighbor’s car illuminated the street and both men fled back into the woods. The police arrived on the scene shortly thereafter. After an investigation into the incident, the state charged Mr. Coleman and Mr. Alston each with: (1) conspiracy to break and enter a dwelling in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-1-6; (2) breaking and entering a dwelling in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-8-2; (3) assault with a dangerous weapon in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2; (4) assault and battery resulting in serious bodily injury in violation of § 11-5-2; and (5) driving a motor vehicle without the consent of the owner in violation of G.L. 1956 § 31-9-1 and G.L. 1956 § 31-27-9. Mr. Alston and Mr. Coleman were tried separately. 3 A The Alston Trial Mr. Alston was tried and convicted of felony conspiracy, breaking and entering a dwelling, and felony assault. He was then sentenced to a total of seventeen years imprisonment, including consecutive terms of: (1) ten years on the conspiracy charge (five years to be served at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI) and five years suspended, with probation); (2) fifteen years on the breaking and entering charge (five years to be served at the ACI and ten years suspended, with probation); and (3) ten years on the assault charge (seven years to be served and three years suspended, with probation). In addition to his seventeen-year sentence, Mr. Alston had a previously suspended sentence revoked, resulting in an additional seven-year sentence. Subsequently, Mr. Alston appealed his conviction, which was vacated by this Court on the grounds that the trial justice erred by admitting Mr. Coleman’s confession into evidence at trial. State v. Alston, 900 A.2d 1212, 1221 (R.I. 2006). 3 Prior to trial, Mr. Alston successfully moved to sever his case. Coleman, 909 A.2d at 934 n.4. -3- Mr. Alston was retried in April 2008, and, for a second time, was convicted of felony conspiracy, breaking and entering, and felony assault. This time, Mr. Alston was sentenced to a total of forty years imprisonment, consisting of: (1) ten years for conspiracy to commit breaking and entering; (2) ten years for breaking and entering; and (3) twenty years for felony assault. He was sentenced to serve all terms consecutively. B The Coleman Trial In July 2003, a jury convicted Mr. Coleman of conspiracy to commit breaking and entering, breaking and entering, simple assault, and driving a motor vehicle without the consent of the owner. Mr. Coleman was sentenced to serve a total of twenty years imprisonment, including: (1) ten years on the conspiracy charge (five years to be served at the ACI and five years suspended, with probation); (2) fifteen years on the breaking and entering charge (twelve- and-a-half to be served and two-and-a-half suspended, with probation); (3) one year on the simple assault charge; and (4) five years on the charge of driving a motor vehicle without consent of the owner (eighteen months to serve, and three-and-a-half years suspended, with probation). Like Mr. Alston, Mr. Coleman also was sentenced to serve consecutive sentences. Mr. Coleman appealed his convictions on several grounds, none of which were successful. See Coleman, 909 A.2d at 934. On December 4, 2006, Mr. Coleman moved to reduce his sentence pursuant to Rule 35, arguing that: (1) his sentence was disproportionate to that of his confederate, Mr. Alston; (2) his sentence for breaking and entering exceeded the recommended sentence as set forth in the Superior Court Sentencing Benchmarks; and (3) that his sentences should run concurrently rather than consecutively. -4- II Standard of Review “[A] motion to reduce sentence under Rule 35 ‘is essentially a plea for leniency.’” State v. Ferrara, 818 A.2d 642, 644 (R.I. 2003) (quoting State v. Kilburn, 809 A.2d 476, 480 (R.I. 2002)). “This Court has maintained a ‘strong policy against interfering with a trial justice’s discretion in sentencing matters,’ and, therefore, we only will interfere with that discretion ‘in rare instances when the trial justice has imposed a sentence that is without justification and is grossly disparate from other sentences generally imposed for similar offenses.’” State v. Rossi, 771 A.2d 906, 908 (R.I. 2001) (mem.) (quoting State v. Mollicone, 746 A.2d 135, 137 (R.I. 2000)). “A manifestly excessive sentence is defined as one which is ‘disparate from sentence[s] generally imposed for similar offenses when the heavy sentence imposed is without justification.’” State v. Ortega, 755 A.2d 841, 841 (R.I. 2000) (mem.) (quoting State v. Ballard, 699 A.2d 14, 16 (R.I. 1997)). “It is the defendant’s burden to show that the sentence imposed violates this standard.” Id. (quoting State v. Cote, 736 A.2d 93, 94 (R.I. 1999)). III Analysis A The Breaking and Entering Sentence Mr. Coleman first argues that his twelve-and-a-half-year sentence for breaking and entering was grossly disproportionate to the five-year breaking and entering sentence that Mr. Alston received after his first trial. Initially, both Mr. Coleman and Mr. Alston received fifteen- year sentences for their breaking and entering convictions. Mr. Coleman, however, was ordered to serve twelve-and-a-half years, with two-and-a-half years suspended, while Mr. Alston was ordered to serve five years, with ten years suspended. Mr. Coleman’s argument relies on the initial seven-and-a-half-year disparity between Mr. Coleman’s time to serve and Mr. Alston’s -5- time to serve after his first trial. That comparison, however, is no longer meaningful because Mr. Alston’s first conviction was vacated, and his first sentence has become a nullity. After Mr. Alston’s first conviction was vacated, and after he was convicted a second time, he received a total of forty years imprisonment. Of that forty-year sentence, Mr. Alston was sentenced to serve ten years imprisonment on the breaking and entering charge. Thus, the difference between Mr. Coleman and Mr. Alston’s breaking and entering sentences is a mere two-and-a-half years. This Court has held that confederates need not receive equal sentences for the same crime. See State v. Flores, 637 A.2d 366, 366-67 (R.I. 1994) (disparity between confederates’ sentences permissible where sentence mirrored culpability); State v. Holley, 623 A.2d 973, 974 (R.I. 1993) (five year difference between sentences of two confederates not grossly disproportionate). Here, the two-and-a-half-year disparity between the sentences that Mr. Coleman and Mr. Alston received for breaking and entering is not grossly disproportionate. Further, although Mr. Coleman received two-and-a-half years more on the breaking and entering charge than Mr. Alston, Mr. Alston received a total of forty years imprisonment, compared with Mr. Coleman’s twenty years imprisonment. Mr. Coleman’s argument that his sentence was grossly disproportionate to Mr. Alston’s is therefore meritless. Next, Mr. Coleman argues that his fifteen-year breaking and entering sentence was excessive because it exceeds the sentence as set forth in the Superior Court Sentencing Benchmarks. The crime of unlawful breaking and entering of a dwelling house is punishable under § 11-8-2(a) by imprisonment for “not less than two (2) years and not more than ten (10) years for the first conviction, and for the second and subsequent conviction shall be imprisoned for not less than four (4) years and not more than fifteen (15) years * * *.” In addition to the sentence imposed by statute, the Superior Court Sentencing Benchmarks recommend a one-to -6- four-year sentence for breaking and entering into an unoccupied dwelling. Superior Court Sentencing Benchmark 3. Although, when sentencing a defendant, “a trial justice may use benchmarks as a guide to the proportionality of a term, [s]he is bound only by the statutory limits.” State v. Bettencourt, 766 A.2d 391, 394 (R.I. 2001) (quoting State v. Gordon, 539 A.2d 528, 530 (R.I. 1988)). “In formulating a fair sentence, a trial justice ‘considers various factors including the severity of the crime, the defendant’s personal, educational, and employment background, the potential for rehabilitation, social deterrence, and the appropriateness of the punishment.’” Id. (quoting State v. Brigham, 666 A.2d 405, 406 (R.I. 1995)). The sentencing benchmarks allow departure “when substantial and compelling circumstances exist.” Superior Court Sentencing Benchmarks, Using the Benchmarks 1. If a trial justice sentences a defendant outside the recommended range, the benchmarks instruct the trial justice to “give specific reasons for the departure on the record.” Id. Examples of compelling circumstances provided in the sentencing benchmarks include a defendant’s prior criminal record, lack of remorse, whether the defendant testified, and if he or she testified and gave patently false testimony, and “other substantial grounds which tend to mitigate or aggravate the offender’s culpability.” Id. at 1.(q). Further, the sentencing benchmarks explicitly allow for a sentencing departure based on a defendant’s criminal history. Superior Court Sentencing Benchmarks, Departure from Benchmarks. Here, because this was Mr. Coleman’s second breaking and entering conviction, the maximum sentence he could receive under § 11-8-2 was fifteen years, a term which the trial justice imposed. Acknowledging her departure from the benchmarks in sentencing Mr. Coleman to fifteen years with twelve and a half to serve, the trial justice listed myriad reasons for doing so: (1) that the breaking and entering by Mr. Coleman was not comparable to the breaking and -7- entering into an unoccupied dwelling because there was no indication that the house was going to remain vacant, as was demonstrated by the Lavens’ return home in the midst of the break-in; (2) that the breaking and entering turned into a crime of violence; (3) that Mr. Coleman was a career criminal and was a poor candidate for rehabilitation; (4) that he refused to take personal responsibility for his crimes; (5) that he lacked any remorse; and (6) that he lied on the stand at his trial. She further stated that she found it in the best interests of the community for Mr. Coleman to be removed from society for twenty years. These specific findings, in addition to the fact that this was Mr. Coleman’s second breaking and entering conviction more than fully justify the trial justice’s departure from the benchmarks. Thus, we see no reason to disturb the sentence imposed. B Consecutive Sentences Finally, Mr. Coleman argues that his sentences should have run concurrently, not consecutively. Relying on this Court’s holding in Ballard, 699 A.2d at 18, that “where * * * a criminal defendant commits multiple criminal endeavors concurrently, thereby giving rise to multiple convictions, that defendant ought to be committed to serve sentences for those convictions concurrently, absent the presence of extraordinary aggravating circumstances * * *.” In recent years, however, we have declined to treat our holding in Ballard as a bright-line rule with respect to consecutive sentences. See State v. Monteiro, 924 A.2d 784, 794 (R.I. 2007) (questioning whether Ballard still held precedential value); State v. Vieira, 883 A.2d 1146, 1150 n.3 (R.I. 2005) (reiterating that our holding in Ballard should be read narrowly as applying to the facts in that case); State v. Morris, 863 A.2d 1284, 1288 (R.I. 2004) (“Ballard did not establish a bright-line rule on consecutive sentences.”); see also Ferrara, 818 A.2d at 645 (distinguishing Ballard on its facts in upholding the defendant’s consecutive sentences). While we are aware -8- that “stare decisis serves a profoundly important purpose in our legal system,” we also firmly believe that “overruling precedent is justified if the motivating purpose is to eliminate inconsistency and anomalous results.” State v. Gautier, 871 A.2d 347, 358 (R.I. 2005) (quoting State v. Werner, 615 A.2d 1010, 1014 (R.I. 1992)). Recognizing that this Court’s holding in Ballard was an aberration, we now hold that Ballard is of little or no precedential value. At both Mr. Coleman’s sentencing and his motion to reduce hearing, the trial justice, in ordering Mr. Coleman to serve consecutive sentences, emphasized that Mr. Coleman’s crime was not just a run-of-the-mill breaking and entering. What the trial justice found most disturbing was that, rather than fleeing once the Lavens returned home, Mr. Coleman chose to stay and fight Mr. Laven for the keys to his getaway car. The trial justice also determined that the crime was “one of violence, * * * a premeditated crime, a cold-hearted crime, a crime for profit, with no regard, whatsoever, to the rights of Mr. and Mrs. Laven, and without regard to the law.” The trial justice further highlighted that this incident had changed the lives of both Mr. and Mrs. Laven by “interfere[ing] with their sense of comfort and security at home.” After noting that Mr. Coleman lied on the stand during his trial, that he lacked any remorse for his actions, and that he refused to take personal responsibility, the trial justice found that Mr. Coleman was a poor candidate for rehabilitation. Finally, the trial justice deemed Mr. Coleman to be a danger to society, given his long history of unlawful behavior and his inability to “function in society as a law-abiding and productive member of the community.” Given these factors, and the trial justice’s exhaustive explanation of her reasoning in sentencing Mr. Coleman, we hold it was not an abuse of her discretion to order Mr. Coleman to serve consecutive sentences. -9- IV Conclusion For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the Superior Court’s denial of Mr. Coleman’s motion to reduce his sentence. - 10 - Supreme Court No. 2007-223-C.A.

On December 4, 2006, Mr. Coleman moved to reduce his sentence pursuant to Rule 35, arguing that: (1) his sentence was disproportionate to that of his confederate, Mr. Alston; (2) his sentence for breaking and entering exceeded the recommended sentence as set forth in the Superior Court Sentencing Benchmarks; and (3) that his sentences should run concurrently rather than consecutively.', '-4-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“[A] motion to reduce sentence under Rule 35 ‘is essentially a plea for leniency.’” State v. Ferrara, 818 A.2d 642, 644 (R.I. 2003) (quoting State v. Kilburn, 809 A.2d 476, 480 (R.I. 2002)). “This Court has maintained a ‘strong policy against interfering with a trial justice’s discretion in sentencing matters,’ and, therefore, we only will interfere with that discretion ‘in rare instances when the trial justice has imposed a sentence that is without justification and is grossly disparate from other sentences generally imposed for similar offenses.’” State v. Rossi, 771 A.2d 906, 908 (R.I. 2001) (mem.) (quoting State v. Mollicone, 746 A.2d 135, 137 (R.I. 2000)). “A manifestly excessive sentence is defined as one which is ‘disparate from sentence[s] generally imposed for similar offenses when the heavy sentence imposed is without justification.’” State v. Ortega, 755 A.2d 841, 841 (R.I. 2000) (mem.) (quoting State v. Ballard, 699 A.2d 14, 16 (R.I. 1997)). “It is the defendant’s burden to show that the sentence imposed violates this standard.” Id. (quoting State v. Cote, 736 A.2d 93, 94 (R.I. 1999)).', 'III', 'Analysis', 'A', 'The Breaking and Entering Sentence', 'Mr. Coleman first argues that his twelve-and-a-half-year sentence for breaking and entering was grossly disproportionate to the five-year breaking and entering sentence that Mr. Alston received after his first trial. Initially, both Mr. Coleman and Mr. Alston received fifteen- year sentences for their breaking and entering convictions. Mr. Coleman, however, was ordered to serve twelve-and-a-half years, with two-and-a-half years suspended, while Mr. Alston was ordered to serve five years, with ten years suspended. Mr. Coleman’s argument relies on the initial seven-and-a-half-year disparity between Mr. Coleman’s time to serve and Mr. Alston’s', '-5- time to serve after his first trial. That comparison, however, is no longer meaningful because Mr. Alston’s first conviction was vacated, and his first sentence has become a nullity. After Mr. Alston’s first conviction was vacated, and after he was convicted a second time, he received a total of forty years imprisonment. Of that forty-year sentence, Mr. Alston was sentenced to serve ten years imprisonment on the breaking and entering charge. Thus, the difference between Mr. Coleman and Mr. Alston’s breaking and entering sentences is a mere two-and-a-half years.', 'This Court has held that confederates need not receive equal sentences for the same crime. See State v. Flores, 637 A.2d 366, 366-67 (R.I. 1994) (disparity between confederates’ sentences permissible where sentence mirrored culpability); State v. Holley, 623 A.2d 973, 974 (R.I. 1993) (five year difference between sentences of two confederates not grossly disproportionate).', 'Here, the two-and-a-half-year disparity between the sentences that Mr. Coleman and Mr. Alston received for breaking and entering is not grossly disproportionate. Further, although Mr. Coleman received two-and-a-half years more on the breaking and entering charge than Mr. Alston, Mr. Alston received a total of forty years imprisonment, compared with Mr. Coleman’s twenty years imprisonment. Mr. Coleman’s argument that his sentence was grossly disproportionate to Mr. Alston’s is therefore meritless.', 'Next, Mr. Coleman argues that his fifteen-year breaking and entering sentence was excessive because it exceeds the sentence as set forth in the Superior Court Sentencing Benchmarks. The crime of unlawful breaking and entering of a dwelling house is punishable under § 11-8-2(a) by imprisonment for “not less than two (2) years and not more than ten (10) years for the first conviction, and for the second and subsequent conviction shall be imprisoned for not less than four (4) years and not more than fifteen (15) years * * *.” In addition to the sentence imposed by statute, the Superior Court Sentencing Benchmarks recommend a one-to', '-6- four-year sentence for breaking and entering into an unoccupied dwelling. Superior Court Sentencing Benchmark 3.', 'Although, when sentencing a defendant, “a trial justice may use benchmarks as a guide to the proportionality of a term, [s]he is bound only by the statutory limits.” State v. Bettencourt, 766 A.2d 391, 394 (R.I. 2001) (quoting State v. Gordon, 539 A.2d 528, 530 (R.I. 1988)). “In formulating a fair sentence, a trial justice ‘considers various factors including the severity of the crime, the defendant’s personal, educational, and employment background, the potential for rehabilitation, social deterrence, and the appropriateness of the punishment.’” Id. (quoting State v. Brigham, 666 A.2d 405, 406 (R.I. 1995)). The sentencing benchmarks allow departure “when substantial and compelling circumstances exist.” Superior Court Sentencing Benchmarks, Using the Benchmarks 1. If a trial justice sentences a defendant outside the recommended range, the benchmarks instruct the trial justice to “give specific reasons for the departure on the record.” Id. Examples of compelling circumstances provided in the sentencing benchmarks include a defendant’s prior criminal record, lack of remorse, whether the defendant testified, and if he or she testified and gave patently false testimony, and “other substantial grounds which tend to mitigate or aggravate the offender’s culpability.”', 'Id. at 1.(q).', 'Further, the sentencing benchmarks explicitly allow for a sentencing departure based on a defendant’s criminal history. Superior Court Sentencing Benchmarks, Departure from Benchmarks.', 'Here, because this was Mr. Coleman’s second breaking and entering conviction, the maximum sentence he could receive under § 11-8-2 was fifteen years, a term which the trial justice imposed. Acknowledging her departure from the benchmarks in sentencing Mr. Coleman to fifteen years with twelve and a half to serve, the trial justice listed myriad reasons for doing so: (1) that the breaking and entering by Mr. Coleman was not comparable to the breaking and', '-7- entering into an unoccupied dwelling because there was no indication that the house was going to remain vacant, as was demonstrated by the Lavens’ return home in the midst of the break-in; (2) that the breaking and entering turned into a crime of violence; (3) that Mr. Coleman was a career criminal and was a poor candidate for rehabilitation; (4) that he refused to take personal responsibility for his crimes; (5) that he lacked any remorse; and (6) that he lied on the stand at his trial. She further stated that she found it in the best interests of the community for Mr. Coleman to be removed from society for twenty years. These specific findings, in addition to the fact that this was Mr. Coleman’s second breaking and entering conviction more than fully justify the trial justice’s departure from the benchmarks. Thus, we see no reason to disturb the sentence imposed.', 'B', 'Consecutive Sentences', 'Finally, Mr. Coleman argues that his sentences should have run concurrently, not consecutively. Relying on this Court’s holding in Ballard, 699 A.2d at 18, that “where * * * a criminal defendant commits multiple criminal endeavors concurrently, thereby giving rise to multiple convictions, that defendant ought to be committed to serve sentences for those convictions concurrently, absent the presence of extraordinary aggravating circumstances * * *.” In recent years, however, we have declined to treat our holding in Ballard as a bright-line rule with respect to consecutive sentences. See State v. Monteiro, 924 A.2d 784, 794 (R.I. 2007) (questioning whether Ballard still held precedential value); State v. Vieira, 883 A.2d 1146, 1150 n.3 (R.I. 2005) (reiterating that our holding in Ballard should be read narrowly as applying to the facts in that case); State v. Morris, 863 A.2d 1284, 1288 (R.I. 2004) (“Ballard did not establish a bright-line rule on consecutive sentences.”); see also Ferrara, 818 A.2d at 645 (distinguishing Ballard on its facts in upholding the defendant’s consecutive sentences). While we are aware', '-8- that “stare decisis serves a profoundly important purpose in our legal system,” we also firmly believe that “overruling precedent is justified if the motivating purpose is to eliminate inconsistency and anomalous results.” State v. Gautier, 871 A.2d 347, 358 (R.I. 2005) (quoting State v. Werner, 615 A.2d 1010, 1014 (R.I. 1992)). Recognizing that this Court’s holding in Ballard was an aberration, we now hold that Ballard is of little or no precedential value.', 'At both Mr. Coleman’s sentencing and his motion to reduce hearing, the trial justice, in ordering Mr. Coleman to serve consecutive sentences, emphasized that Mr. Coleman’s crime was not just a run-of-the-mill breaking and entering. What the trial justice found most disturbing was that, rather than fleeing once the Lavens returned home, Mr. Coleman chose to stay and fight Mr. Laven for the keys to his getaway car. The trial justice also determined that the crime was “one of violence, * * * a premeditated crime, a cold-hearted crime, a crime for profit, with no regard, whatsoever, to the rights of Mr. and Mrs. Laven, and without regard to the law.” The trial justice further highlighted that this incident had changed the lives of both Mr. and Mrs. Laven by “interfere[ing] with their sense of comfort and security at home.”', 'After noting that Mr. Coleman lied on the stand during his trial, that he lacked any remorse for his actions, and that he refused to take personal responsibility, the trial justice found that Mr. Coleman was a poor candidate for rehabilitation. Finally, the trial justice deemed Mr. Coleman to be a danger to society, given his long history of unlawful behavior and his inability to “function in society as a law-abiding and productive member of the community.” Given these factors, and the trial justice’s exhaustive explanation of her reasoning in sentencing Mr. Coleman, we hold it was not an abuse of her discretion to order Mr. Coleman to serve consecutive sentences.', '-9-', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the Superior Court’s denial of Mr. Coleman’s motion to reduce his sentence.', '- 10 -', 'Supreme Court', 'No. 2007-223-C.A.', '(K2/02-232B)', 'State', ':', 'v.', ':', 'Jerry Coleman.', ': NOTICE: This opinion is subject to formal revision before publication in the Rhode Island Reporter.

82,"v. : Michelle Bergin-Andrews et al. : City of Cranston : No. 2008-291-Appeal. (PC 08-4133) v. : School Committee of the City of Cranston : et al. Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty, Robinson, JJ., and Williams, C.J. (ret.). OPINION Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. This appeal arises from a morass of budgetary woe in the City of Cranston. The plaintiffs, the School Committee of the City of Cranston, and Superintendent of Schools, Peter L. Nero (hereinafter collectively referred to as the school committee), appeal from a judgment in favor of the defendants, the members of the Cranston City Council, Mayor Allan Fung, and Director of Finance Robert F. Strom (hereinafter collectively referred to as the city). 1 The school committee sought additional appropriations for the Cranston School Department for fiscal year (FY) 2007-2008 in what is commonly referred to as a “Caruolo action.” The school committee also appeals from a judgment in favor of the city in 1 This Court granted both parties’ motions to substitute names of elected officials on November 24, 2009. -1- the city’s separate action for declaratory, injunctive, and mandamus relief. The two actions were consolidated in the Superior Court and also have been consolidated for the purposes of this appeal. The school committee contends that the trial justice erred in concluding that the school committee did not meet the statutory prerequisites for filing a Caruolo action pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 16-2-21.4; it also alleges a bevy of other errors. For the reasons discussed in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. I Facts and Procedural History The school committee’s FY 2007-2008 financial travails can be traced to the spring of the previous school year. On February 28, 2007, the school committee requested from the city a budget of $129,865,082 for FY 2007-2008. The city council made an appropriation to the school department of $126,395,975 for FY 2007-2008 on May 9, 2007. The school committee then amended its budget to conform to this appropriation on June 19, 2007. At trial, Thomas Sweeney, Jr., a consultant retained by the school committee in April 2007, noted that the school department was already projecting a deficit for FY 2007-2008 at the time he was retained. When subsequent school aid from the state proved lower than expected in July 2007, the city council further reduced its appropriation to the school department to $125,328,548. However, the school committee failed to amend its budget to reflect the reduced appropriation. Instead, the school committee apparently attempted to account for the discrepancy when it included a “budget reconciliation” item of $1,651,202 in its November 2007 revised budget. Even before the insertion of this budget reconciliation item, Mr. Sweeney was estimating a -2- projected deficit of $3.5 million for FY 2007-2008 as early as September 2007. By December 6, 2007, the projected budget deficit totaled $3,888,190. On November 30, 2007, the superintendent instituted a purchasing freeze. According to Mr. Sweeney, however, it is doubtful that many savings were realized as a result of this freeze because most of the expenditures for FY 2007-2008 already had been made, and the freeze was not stringently enforced. By December 2007, the school committee was contemplating an action against the city pursuant to § 16-2-21.4—commonly referred to as the Caruolo Act. In a Caruolo action, a school committee may file a complaint in the Superior Court to seek additional appropriations for the school department if it believes it cannot adequately run the schools with the previously authorized appropriation. On December 26, 2007, the superintendent sent a letter to the commissioner of the Rhode Island Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, purportedly seeking alternatives or waivers with regard to certain legal and regulatory requirements, in an attempt to garner approximately $4 million in budget savings. Such requests are required before a Caruolo action may be brought. The superintendent’s proposals included requesting additional state funding for special and vocational education programs, as well as elimination of all non-special education student transportation and increasing special education class size. The commissioner denied the superintendent’s requests on January 15, 2008. On January 22, 2008, the school committee sent a letter to the city council requesting a supplemental appropriation of $3,839,190. The school committee indicated that if the city council did not respond within fifteen days, the school committee would “assume that [its] response is in the negative, and [the school committee] will proceed accordingly.” The city -3- council did not specifically respond to the school committee’s request within fifteen days, although the school committee and the city met on a number of occasions over the next few months in an effort to resolve the budget problems. In April 2008, the school committee made a presentation to the city council on the school department budget deficit. At this meeting, the school committee said that the school budget deficit was then projected to be approximately $4.9 million for FY 2007-2008. The city council then passed a resolution asking the mayor to seek a writ of mandamus requiring the school department to operate within its appropriated budget for the school year in accordance with state law. Thereafter, the school committee filed the instant Caruolo action against the city on May 13, 2008. Around this same time, the school committee submitted its budget for FY 2008-2009 to the city council. The school committee requested $132,810,730 for FY 2008-2009, including $93,884,319 in direct city appropriations. At some point after May 15, 2008, the city council level-funded the school committee for the coming school year, appropriating $125,340,048. In response, the school committee adopted a revised budget on June 16, 2008. This “revised” budget included a “budget reconciliation” item, however, similar to the one previously used in the FY 2007-2008 budget—except that this item now eliminated a $4,931,704 operating deficit. At trial, Joseph Balducci, the chief financial officer of the Cranston School Department, testified that the $4.9 million represented the reduction in expenditures to be realized as a result of the instant Caruolo action. In June 2008, the city filed an answer and a counterclaim asking the Superior Court to order the school committee to file corrective action plans for the FY 2007-2008 budget and to -4- refrain from certain expenditures. 2 The city subsequently filed a separate action against the school committee requesting the same relief as the counterclaim. On June 23, 2008, upon the request of the mayor, the city council passed a resolution directing the city finance director to create a deficit reduction/loan account, into which the city council appropriated approximately $4,138,000. This sum was intended for payment of outstanding school committee contractual obligations and invoices for FY 2007-2008. The city did not consider this loan to be an additional appropriation to the school department, nor did it agree to factor the sum into the city’s “maintenance of effort” for the next year under G.L. 1956 § 16-7-23. Thereafter, the city moved to consolidate the separate actions. On July 10, 2008, the trial justice granted the motion to consolidate, noting that evidence should be submitted for both actions and that the parties should identify specifically which lines of questioning were directed exclusively to the city’s counterclaim and complaint. She indicated that she would “save for another day” the issue of whether additional evidence might be needed for the city’s action. An order implementing the trial justice’s decision was not entered until July 21, 2008, in the midst of the bench trial. The order stated that both actions involved “common questions of law and fact, such that it would further the interests of judicial economy to have the two cases tried and decided together.” The order further stated that at the close of testimony, the trial justice would hear argument on whether additional testimony was necessary on the city’s complaint and counterclaims. The order also indicated that the trial justice “may decide the merits of the Caruolo action first and reserves the right to bifurcate for decision the legal issues raised in [the city’s] counterclaims and the [c]ity’s [c]omplaint.” 2 The mayor and finance director filed their answer on June 16, 2008. The city council filed its answer on September 2, 2008, after the conclusion of trial. -5- Shortly after trial commenced, the school committee filed an emergency motion for a writ of mandamus to compel the city to authorize the payment of certain FY 2007-2008 expenses, to be paid out of the FY 2008-2009 appropriation or out of the FY 2007-2008 cash reserves. On July 21, 2008, the trial justice issued a writ of mandamus requiring the city to release $559,143 from the FY 2007-2008 cash reserves. The trial justice did not authorize any expenditures to be made out of the FY 2008-2009 appropriation for the payment of FY 2007-2008 expenses, and noted that the authorized payments “would not be deemed an admission by the [d]efendants for any purpose in the instant action.” A Trial Testimony A bench trial was held in July 2008. The first witness, Mr. Sweeney, an education consultant for the school committee, testified that he was hired in April 2007 with the understanding that the school committee might have to file a Caruolo action for FY 2007-2008. He was hired to perform an in-house audit to examine all the school department’s programs, which audit eventually could be used to support a Caruolo action. Mr. Sweeney opined that all the school department expenses made in FY 2007-2008 (except for two programs 3 ) were required by law or pursuant to the basic education program (BEP) set by the Rhode Island Board of Regents for Elementary and Secondary Education. He testified that the school department still needed approximately $4.6 million to cover its expenses for FY 2007-2008. He noted that the instant case was unusual because most Caruolo actions attempt to project the amounts needed by the school department to finish the year, but in the instant case the school year was already 3 The two exceptions were the EPIC Program for gifted students and the Junior ROTC program at Cranston East High School. Mr. Sweeney qualified this statement, however, by noting that because the EPIC Program had been approved by the commissioner, it therefore could be considered a mandated program. -6- over and the school department was calculating its actual shortfall. During cross-examination, Mr. Sweeney testified that he did not recommend that any programs or personnel be reduced, reorganized, or eliminated, nor did he advise the school committee to file a corrective action plan with the auditor general or notify the city council that the school committee was anticipating a budget deficit as early as July 2007. He also did not recommend the filing of a corrective action plan for FY 2008-2009. Raymond Votto, Jr., the chief operating officer for the Cranston public school system, testified that the superintendent’s original FY 2007-2008 budget proposal was reduced by the school committee. Under cross-examination, he conceded that, under the teacher collective- bargaining agreement, the school committee was empowered to lay off up to 3 percent of teachers during FY 2007-2008, but the committee did not do so. It appears that the school committee laid off fifty-nine teachers in February 2007; forty-three of these teachers were later recalled, four resigned, one retired, and only eleven were discharged permanently. Mr. Votto further testified that the school department had laid off approximately ten additional personnel for FY 2008-2009, which amounted to about 1 percent of personnel. Peter Nero, then-assistant superintendent, testified that he had reviewed a report prepared by the Abrahams Group and Parmelee, Poirier & Associates (Abrahams report), which was prepared in 2004 as a result of a Caruolo action filed by the school committee in September 2003 regarding the FY 2003-2004 school budget. The Abrahams report consisted of a performance audit of the school department and operational recommendations. The recommendations contained various cost-saving measures that could have saved the school department up to approximately $12 million. Mr. Nero testified that the school department had implemented a number of the recommendations contained in the Abrahams report. He acknowledged, however, -7- that most of the implemented recommendations were adopted for FY 2008-2009, not FY 2007- 2008. Mr. Balducci, the school department’s chief financial officer, testified that he was not aware until April 1, 2007, that the city intended to level-fund the school department for FY 2007- 2008. Mr. Balducci stated a $3.1 million deficit was projected as early as July 2007. He indicated that the school department’s corrective action plan at that time was simply to seek additional funding from the city. He acknowledged that the FY 2007-2008 budget proposed by the school committee exceeded a statutory tax cap. Mr. Balducci further testified that a corrective action plan for the FY 2007-2008 deficit was not filed with the mayor, the city council, or the auditor general. Turning to the FY 2008-2009 budget, Mr. Balducci stated that the projected $4.9 million deficit from FY 2007-2008 was carried over into FY 2008-2009. He testified that he assumed that the instant Caruolo action would be successful, and thus the $4.9 million eventually would be paid. Mr. Balducci admitted that the FY 2008-2009 budget would immediately have a $4.9 million deficit if the school committee’s suit was not successful. According to Superintendent Richard Scherza, the school budget did not have much “fat,” and the school committee “had been very responsibl[e] in scrutinizing [the budget] and actually * * * making some painful cuts.” Mr. Scherza admitted that he presented a budget to the school committee in excess of a statutory tax cap. Although he was aware that the budget adopted by the city council would be insufficient to run the existing programs, operations, facilities, and personnel for FY 2007-2008, he did not institute austerity measures at that time. Indeed, such measures were not instituted until approximately eight months later. He noted that, as a cost-saving measure, fifteen citywide directors were eliminated for FY 2008-2009. Elimination of citywide directors was one of the recommendations of the 2004 Abrahams report -8- and resulted in a savings of approximately $100,000 per director. Mr. Scherza testified that there was no discussion of eliminating those positions in the winter of 2007. Walter Edge, another educational consultant retained by the school committee, opined that the school budget for FY 2007-2008 and its adjustments were reasonable. He stated that if the city had gotten $3.5 million through a tax increase and another $1 million from the state in aid, this essentially would have eliminated the $4.5 million deficit. Stephen Woerner, internal auditor for the city council, stated that although some members harbored concerns that the school committee might not be able to operate within the appropriated budget, the council was only definitively aware of a $4 million deficit in March or April of 2008. He noted that there had been errors on the FY 2007 tax bills and levy, and that a FY 2008 tax increase helped resolve those errors and did not support increases in the FY 2007- 2008 school budget. The city’s education consultant presented a different picture of the school department’s management of its deficit. Salvatore Augeri, a retired superintendent for Westerly, testified that a series of cuts could have been made to programs that exceeded the BEP and state and federal mandates. He calculated that the school department could have realized $7.5 million in savings by eliminating excessive personnel and other expenditures at the time it was developing the FY 2007-2008 budget, while still satisfying its various mandates and BEP requirements. Michael Traficante, chairman of the school committee, testified that he proposed consolidation considerations to the city in April 2008 that would have helped the school department to balance its budget. He also indicated that the “Mayor was informing the Superintendent at that time * * * to avoid [filing a] Caruolo action at all possible costs and that we could possibly work out a solution” to the deficit problem. -9- The final two witnesses to testify at trial were city finance director Corsino Delgado and Jeffrey Wadovick, a certified public accountant retained by the city’s counsel to review school financial documents. Mr. Delgado noted that the vast majority of a city tax increase for FY 2007-2008 plugged a $6 million hole incurred the previous year in areas not related to the school department. Mr. Wadovick testified that the budget for the school department was cumbersome and did not provide a clear summary of expenditures. He also faulted the school committee for not coming close to meeting the Abrahams report recommendations, especially those proposing better accounting and budgeting practices. He opined that the school department did not adhere to its budget because it overspent on 450 line item accounts out of a total of 2100 accounts. He further testified that the “budget reconciliation” line item in the FY 2007-2008 budget was “[a] very funny line item” and concluded that “[the school committee] could not take any money from anywhere else in the budget or reduce it on another line and therefore, they came up with the line called a ‘budget reconciliation’—[so that] total expenses would continue to be in line with what was originally appropriated.” Mr. Wadovick also opined that the school committee’s reliance on a Caruolo action for revenue was not a sound budgeting practice. He concluded that the school department had deficit spent its original appropriations by $4,496,344 during FY 2007-2008 “by not properly following what was given to them.” After the conclusion of Mr. Wadovick’s testimony, neither party indicated that it wished to submit additional testimony or evidence. The city then moved for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 52(c) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. The city advanced two grounds to support its motion—one jurisdictional and the other substantive. First, the city argued that the school committee had failed to demonstrate that several conditions precedent to properly - 10 - pursuing a Caruolo action had been met (namely, revision of the FY 2007-2008 budget to adhere to the city’s budget appropriation, timely pursuit of waivers from the commissioner, timely request for additional funds from the city, and timely commencement of a Caruolo action as soon as a deficit was likely). Second, the city argued that the school committee had failed to meet its burden of proof under the Caruolo Act because its experts did not establish that an additional $4.5 million was necessary to satisfy the BEP, state and federal mandates, and contracts. The school committee responded that the Caruolo Act is a stand-alone statutory enactment, and that none of the conditions precedent cited by the city are mentioned in the statute itself. The school committee further argued that it had satisfied the burden of proof under the act. The city also filed a motion for a mandatory injunction and/or a writ of mandamus to compel the school committee to prepare corrective action plans to cure the actual FY 2007-2008 budget deficit and the anticipated FY 2008-2009 deficit, as well as to submit those plans to the city and to the auditor general under §§ 16-2-9 and 16-2-21. The city further requested that the court order the school committee to refrain from certain expenditures until final resolution of the case, unless necessary to comply with state and federal mandates. Finally, the city asked that a special master be appointed to assume fiscal management of the school department and to identify potential efficiencies that could be realized for FY 2008-2009. After arguments on the merits of these motions, the parties agreed to conduct a joint program and performance audit for FY 2008-2009, and the trial justice so ordered. When asked whether this joint audit would affect the city’s claims, the city’s counsel suggested that the trial justice could still bifurcate her decision by deciding the Caruolo action first, and then deciding the city’s claims. - 11 - B Trial Justice’s Decision The Superior Court issued a written decision on August 25, 2008. The trial justice dismissed the school committee’s Caruolo action because she determined that the school committee failed to comply with numerous statutory prerequisites to filing a Caruolo action. Specifically, the trial justice noted that the school committee (1) failed to file a corrective action plan; (2) did not amend its budget to conform to the city council’s lowered appropriation; (3) failed to timely petition the commissioner for waivers from state regulations and requirements; (4) failed to minimize expenses; (5) failed to timely alert the mayor and city council about the expected school budget deficit; and (6) failed to file its Caruolo action in a timely fashion. She observed that the school committee’s Caruolo action was the latest Caruolo action ever filed in the Superior Court. Indeed, the school year was nearly complete by the time the action was filed. The trial justice further noted that by the time the matter was heard before the Superior Court, the school committee had received most of the money it sought through a $4.1 million loan from the city. The trial justice also granted, in part, the requests for relief in the city’s complaint and counterclaim. She issued a writ of mandamus ordering the school committee to file a corrective action plan to address the budget deficit for FY 2007-2008. The writ instructed the school committee to detail how the school committee intends to repay the $4.1 million loan from the city and replenish the $550,000 from its cash reserves that was used to cover school department expenses. In addition, she issued a writ of mandamus, ordering the school committee to file a corrective action plan for the FY 2008-2009 budget in light of the fact that it already showed a deficit as a result of the carryover of the FY 2007-2008 debt. The trial justice held the city’s - 12 - request for a court-ordered freeze on school department spending and a declaration with regard to the school committee’s compliance with a statutory cap on spending in abeyance, subject to the filing of corrective action plans, the joint program audit for FY 2008-2009, and any further proceedings. The trial justice additionally reserved decision on the city’s request for the appointment of a special master, subject to the same conditions. The trial justice concluded that the Caruolo Act was intended “to aid a school [committee] immediately after it determines that it will not be able to meet its mandates without incurring a deficit, in order to finish out the school year with a balanced budget.” As the trial justice observed: “A Caruolo action is not intended to be used as an end of the year budget plug to fix a deficit that the school committee had anticipated for months before the school year began.” In the instant case, the trial justice found that the school committee was not proactive about preventing or possibly curing its deficit. Specifically, she found that the school committee was aware of the possibility of a deficit in the spring of 2007 and projected a $3.5 million deficit in October 2007, yet it did not immediately file a corrective action plan or notify the city. She also noted that the school committee’s untimely filing of its Caruolo action left no time for the city to perform a program audit. C Post-Trial Motions The school committee thereafter filed a “Motion for Reconsideration/Amendment of its Decision and Alternative Motion for New Trial.” In the event the trial justice denied the motion for reconsideration, the school committee also filed a motion for a stay and a motion for entry of judgment. A hearing on the motions was held on September 17, 2008. At the hearing, the trial justice first entered judgment in favor of the city on the school committee’s Caruolo action and - 13 - entered judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure on the mandamus portions of the city’s complaint. The school committee stated that it was not aware that the trial on the Caruolo action was also a trial on five out of six counts in the city’s complaint. It argued that the trial justice therefore erred in ruling upon the city’s claims without adequate notice. The school committee also noted that the trial justice’s written opinion erroneously stated that the school committee had not filed answers and affirmative defenses to the city’s counterclaim and complaint. It indicated that the parties did not dispute that the school committee answered the city’s complaint and counterclaim. The city countered that the cases were consolidated by order of the court and that, at trial, certain questions pertained exclusively to the city’s complaint. The city also argued that both parties had an opportunity to present additional evidence, but both declined to do so. The trial justice denied the school committee’s motion for reconsideration. She stated that there was a “significant overlap of testimony and legal issues between the Caruolo action and the [c]ity’s counterclaim and complaint[,]” and her principal concern in consolidating the two cases “was making sure that witnesses who are in Court for purposes of the Caruolo action in the first instance would not need to be recalled [at] any later proceeding.” She indicated that extensive evidence was presented on both the FY 2007-2008 and the FY 2008-2009 budgets, and she concluded that the city’s complaint and counterclaim had been tried by implication. The trial justice also noted that the school committee never sought to present additional evidence, nor had it indicated what other evidence it would present if given the opportunity. The trial justice additionally stated that her failure to read the school committee’s answers to the city’s counterclaim and complaint had no effect on her decision because she approached the case as though the school committee had denied all of the city’s allegations. The - 14 - trial justice concluded that “[t]here is nothing in the answers or affirmative defenses * * * that in [any way] changes this Court’s decision.” For these reasons, the school committee’s motion for reconsideration and/or amendment of the decision was denied. The trial justice also denied the school committee’s motion for a stay of the order requiring the development of a corrective action plan for the FY 2007-2008 budget. Final judgment in the school committee’s action and partial final judgment under Rule 54(b) in the city’s action were entered on September 17, 2008. The school committee filed notices of appeal from those judgments on September 19, 2008. This Court granted the city’s motion to consolidate the appeals and denied the school committee’s motion to stay the writ of mandamus pertaining to FY 2007-2008. The consolidated appeals were also ordered to be expedited. D Issues on Appeal On appeal the school committee advances numerous arguments: (1) the trial justice erred in concluding that the school committee did not comply with the statutory prerequisites to filing a Caruolo action; (2) the trial justice erred in considering other education-related statutes besides the Caruolo Act because the Caruolo Act is a stand-alone statute; (3) the trial justice erred in looking beyond FY 2007-2008 in fashioning remedies; (4) the trial justice erred in consolidating the two actions; (5) there was insufficient notice to alert the school committee that the July 2008 proceedings were intended to be a full trial on the city’s complaint and counterclaim; (6) the trial justice erred in rendering a decision without reading the school committee’s answers to the city’s complaint and counterclaim; (7) the trial justice erred in speculating about the potential effect of implementing the recommendations of the Abrahams report in her decision; (8) the trial justice - 15 - made numerous findings that were erroneous or unsupported by the evidence; (9) the trial justice failed to make the proper findings needed to order injunctive relief; and (10) the trial justice erroneously denied its motion for reconsideration. The city responds that although the school committee nominally met the requirements of § 16-2-21.4, it did so in such a dilatory and ineffectual fashion as to be in noncompliance with the Caruolo Act. The city also contends that the other statutory obligations contained in chapter 2 of title 16 are relevant on the issue of whether the school committee acted in a timely fashion. It notes that § 16-2-21 requires a balanced school budget and § 16-2-9 requires a school committee not to incur debt. The city argues that the trial justice did not find a program audit to be a prerequisite, but merely referred to such an audit as evidence that the school committee’s Caruolo action was not timely filed. On the issue of consolidation of the two cases, the city argues that the Caruolo Act does not preclude the consideration of other issues and counterclaims. The city further argues that the school committee was on fair notice that both of the consolidated cases were before the Superior Court for disposition. On the issue of the school committee’s filed, but apparently overlooked, answers, the city argues that the trial justice’s failure to read the pleading had no effect on the outcome of the case. The city also argues that the trial justice did not err in her findings. The city contends that the trial justice simply highlighted the Abrahams report in discussing the school committee’s budgeting deficiencies and that the record supported the trial justice’s findings that the Caruolo action was untimely. The city further argues that the school committee’s motion for reconsideration was properly denied because the school committee presented no new evidence. The city contends that the trial justice did not need to make findings on the elements for injunctive relief because it actually granted a writ of mandamus. - 16 - II Discussion A Procedure for Bringing a Caruolo Action 1. Standard of Review It is well established that “[w]hen presented with questions of statutory interpretation this Court engages in a de novo review.” Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. v. Kaya, 947 A.2d 869, 872 (R.I. 2008) (quoting State v. LaRoche, 925 A.2d 885, 887 (R.I. 2007)). “[W]hen the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, [this Court] must interpret the statute literally and must give the words of the statute their plain and ordinary meanings.” LaRoche, 925 A.2d at 887 (quoting State v. Oliveira, 882 A.2d 1097, 1110 (R.I. 2005)). When interpreting a statute, however, this Court’s “ultimate goal is to give effect to the purpose of the act as intended by the Legislature.” Hanley v. State, 837 A.2d 707, 711 (R.I. 2003) (quoting Oliveira v. Lombardi, 794 A.2d 453, 457 (R.I. 2002)). 2. The Purpose of the Caruolo Act Section 16-2-21.4 provides in pertinent part as follows: “(a) Notwithstanding any provision of the general or public laws to the contrary, whenever a city, town, or regional school committee determines that its budget is insufficient to comply with the provisions of [§]§ 16-2-21, 16-7-23, or 16-7-24, the city, town, or regional school committee shall adhere to the appropriated budget * * *. The chairperson of the city, town, or regional school committee, in accordance with the provisions of § 16-2-9, shall be required to petition the commissioner, in writing, to seek alternatives for the district to comply with state regulations and/or provide waivers to state regulations and, in particular, those which are more restrictive than federal regulations that allow the school committee to operate with a balanced budget. * * * In the petition to the commissioner, the school committee shall be required to identify the alternatives to meet regulations and/or identify the - 17 - waivers it seeks in order to provide the commissioner with the revised budget which allows it to have a balanced budget within the previously authorized appropriation. The commissioner shall respond within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of the written petition from the school committee. If the commissioner does not approve of the alternatives to meet regulations or the waivers from regulations which are sought by the school committee, or if the commissioner does not approve of the modified expenditure plan submitted by the school committee, then: (1) within ten (10) days of receiving the commissioner’s response, the school committee may submit a written request to the city or town council for the council of the municipality to decide whether to increase the appropriation for schools to meet expenditures. * * *. “(b) In the event of a negative vote by the appropriating authority, the school committee shall have the right to seek additional appropriations by bringing an action in the superior court for the county of Providence and shall be required to demonstrate that the school committee lacks the ability to adequately run the schools for that school year with a balanced budget within the previously authorized appropriation or in accordance with §§ 16-2-21, 16-2-23, 16-7-23, and 16-7-24. In no event shall any court order obtained by the school committee have force and effect for any period longer than the fiscal year for which the litigation is brought. * * * Upon the bringing of an action in the superior court by the school committee to increase appropriations, the chief executive officer of the municipality, or in the case of a regional school district the chief elected officials from each of the member municipalities, shall cause to have a financial and program audit of the school department conducted by the auditor general, the bureau of audits, or a certified public accounting firm qualified in program audits.” (Emphasis added.) The school committee relies on the phrase “[n]otwithstanding any provision of the general or public laws to the contrary” in § 16-2-21.4(a), to support its argument that the General Assembly intended the Caruolo Act to be applied without reference to any other section of the General Laws. The Caruolo Act itself, however, explicitly refers to several other sections of chapters 2 and 7 of title 16, which require, inter alia, that school appropriations satisfy the BEP, that the school committee amend its budget to match its appropriation, and that the school - 18 - committee promptly notify the city council if the school department is operating outside its budget. This Court has recently had occasion to construe the statutory meaning of the word “notwithstanding.” In Planned Environments Management Corp. v. Robert, 966 A.2d 117 (R.I. 2009), this Court interpreted “notwithstanding” to mean “‘regardless of hindrance by.’” Id. at 123 (quoting Defenders of Animals, Inc. v. Department of Environmental Management, 553 A.2d 541, 543 (R.I. 1989)). The use of this term in a statute does not automatically imply that a section should be considered in a vacuum. Rather, this Court has held that “if two statutes are found not to be inconsistent with one another and relate to the same subject matter, they are deemed ‘in pari materia and should be considered together so that they will harmonize with each other and be consistent with their general object and scope * * *.’” Berthiaume v. School Committee of Woonsocket, 121 R.I. 243, 249, 397 A.2d 889, 893 (1979) (quoting Providence Teachers’ Union, Local 958 v. School Committee of Providence, 108 R.I. 444, 449, 276 A.2d 762, 765 (1971)). Upon careful examination of the Caruolo Act, as well as the other pertinent sections of title 16, we are satisfied that § 16-2-21.4 is in no way “hindered by” the requirements of these other sections. Therefore, all relevant sections should be construed to harmonize with each other to give full force and effect to the intention of the Legislature. Under § 16-2-21(b), which is explicitly referred to in the Caruolo Act, “[i]f the amount appropriated by * * * the city or town council * * * is either more or less than the amount recommended and requested by the school committee, the school committee shall, within thirty (30) days after the appropriation is made, amend its estimates and recommendations so that expenses are no greater than the total of all revenue appropriated by the state or town or provided for public schools under the care, control, and management of the school committee.” - 19 - In the same vein, § 16-2-18 provides in part: “If, in any fiscal year a school committee is notified that estimated expenses may exceed total available appropriations, the school committee shall adopt and implement a plan to maintain a balanced school budget, which plan shall provide for continuous regular public school operations consistent with the requirements of § 16- 2-2; provided, that in no fiscal year shall a deficit be permitted for school operations.” Similarly, § 16-2-9 sets forth certain duties incumbent upon the school committees—inter alia, “[t]o adopt a school budget to submit to the local appropriating authority[,]” § 16-2-9(a)(9), “[t]o adopt any changes in the school budget during the course of the school year[,]” § 16-2- 9(a)(10), to “maintain[] a school budget which does not result in a debt[,]” § 16-2-9(d), and to, “within thirty (30) days after the close of the first and second quarters of the state’s fiscal year, adopt a budget as may be necessary to enable it to operate without incurring a debt,” § 16-2-9(e). Moreover, “[i]n the event that any obligation, encumbrance, or expenditure by a superintendent of schools or a school committee is in excess of the amount budgeted or that any revenue is less than the amount budgeted, the school committee shall within five (5) working days of its discovery of potential or actual over expenditure or revenue deficiency submit a written statement of the amount of and cause for the over obligation or over expenditure or revenue deficiency to the city or town council president and any other person who by local charter or statute serves as the city or town’s executive officer; the statement shall further include a statement of the school committee’s plan for corrective actions necessary to meet the requirements of subsection (d). The plan shall be approved by the auditor general.” Section 16-2-9(f). The requirements of § 16-2-9(d) apply “[n]otwithstanding any provisions of the general laws to the contrary,” and it is eminently consistent with the manifest purpose of the Caruolo Act that they do so. - 20 - In light of the language of the Caruolo Act itself, as well as the other pertinent provisions of chapters 2 and 7 of title 16, it is clear that the General Assembly intended school committees to amend their budgets, request waivers, and request additional appropriations from their host municipalities at the first indication of a possible or actual deficit. The General Assembly’s intent to encourage expeditious action in instances of potential school deficit spending is both practical as a matter of public policy and indisputable as a matter of statutory construction. 3. Timing of the School Committee’s Caruolo Action In essence, it appears the trial justice’s decision was partially based on the equitable defense of laches, an argument that was advanced during argument on the city’s motion to dismiss under Rule 52(c). For the purposes of appellate review, “the application of the defense of laches is generally committed to the discretion of the trial justice.” O’Reilly v. Town of Glocester, 621 A.2d 697, 703 (R.I. 1993). We will not reverse the trial justice’s decision on what constitutes laches on appeal “unless it is clearly wrong.” Arcand v. Haley, 95 R.I. 357, 364, 187 A.2d 142, 146 (1963) (quoting Lombardi v. Lombardi, 90 R.I. 205, 209, 156 A.2d 911, 913 (1959)). As this Court has explained, “[l]aches is an equitable defense that precludes a lawsuit by a plaintiff who has negligently sat on his or her rights to the detriment of a defendant. * * * A court applying the defense of laches must use a two-part test. First, there must be negligence on the part of the plaintiff that leads to a delay in the prosecution of the case. * * * Second, this delay must prejudice the defendant. “Laches, in legal significance, is not mere delay, but delay that works a disadvantage to another. So long as parties are in the same condition, it matters little whether one presses a right promptly or slowly, within limits allowed by law; but when, knowing his rights, he takes no steps to enforce them until the condition of the other party has, in good faith, become so changed that he cannot be restored to his former state, if the right be then enforced, delay becomes inequitable and operates as an estoppel against the assertion of the right.” O’Reilly, 621 A.2d at 702 - 21 - (quoting Chase v. Chase, 20 R.I. 202, 203-04, 37 A. 804, 805 (1897)). In recent years, this Court has repeatedly observed that the defense of laches is not as limited in scope as it once was. See, e.g., Raso v. Wall, 884 A.2d 391, 394 n.8 (R.I. 2005) (“Although the concept of laches originated in the courts of chancery, it is today often employed in situations in which the relief sought is not readily classifiable as equitable in nature.”). The timeliness of a school committee’s actions cannot be an inapposite consideration in light of the Caruolo Act and title 16’s overarching intention that school committees ensure comprehensive and uninterrupted educational services within appropriated budget amounts. School committees and school department administrators are exhorted to act quickly when they discover actual or potential budget problems, see, e.g., §§ 16-2-9(f), 16-2-21, and the Caruolo action itself is entitled to expedited procedures in the Superior Court under § 16-2-21.4. See generally Puleio v. Vose, 830 F.2d 1197, 1203 (1st Cir. 1987) (“The law ministers to the vigilant not to those who sleep upon perceptible rights.”). We therefore affirm the trial justice’s interpretation of § 16-2-21.4 as requiring that a Caruolo action “be brought in a timely manner from when a school committee discovers that it cannot operate in a non-deficit position while complying with its mandates and contracts. * * * [A] Caruolo action is intended to aid a school immediately after it determines that it will not be able to meet its mandates without incurring a deficit * * *.” Likewise, we concur that “it is contrary to the intent of the Legislature to allow a school committee to knowingly incur an end of the year deficit where corrective action can no longer be taken, only to be appropriated additional funds under the Caruolo Act.” Far from being clearly wrong, the trial justice’s application of the doctrine of laches in the instant case was eminently justified. - 22 - 4. Conditions Precedent to a Caruolo Action A school committee may file a Caruolo action “in instances where the school committee determines that its annual appropriated budget is not sufficient to meet state imposed educational mandates while satisfying the school committee’s statutory obligation to maintain a ‘balanced’ budget.” Beil v. Chariho School Committee, 667 A.2d 1259, 1259 (R.I. 1995) (mem.). This Court has set forth the following prerequisites that a school committee must meet before filing a Caruolo action: “The first prerequisite is that the school committee must adhere to the budget that the town has appropriated. Second, the school committee is required to petition the commissioner of education in writing to seek alternatives and/or waivers to state regulations that would allow the school committee to operate with a balanced budget. Third, if the commissioner denies the requested alternatives and/or requests for waivers, the school committee may request that the city council reconsider whether to increase the appropriation for schools to meet expenditures. If the efforts outlined above fail to conform to the school budget or fail to increase the appropriation sought by the school committee, the committee may file an action in the Superior Court.” School Committee of Johnston v. Santilli, 912 A.2d 941, 941 n.1 (R.I. 2007) (mem.) (internal citations omitted). As already discussed, each of these prerequisites inherently requires timely action. Under § 16-2-21.4, the school committee is required to adhere to its appropriated budget while it pursues additional funding. Upon review of the record, we are convinced that ample evidence was adduced at trial to support the trial justice’s conclusion that the school committee failed to amend its budget to conform to the city council’s appropriation. 4 This failure supports the trial justice’s conclusion that the school committee did not make a good-faith or timely effort to operate within the city council’s school budget appropriation. 4 Mr. Balducci testified that the school committee did not immediately amend its budget to match the city’s reduced appropriation in July 2007. The “budget reconciliation” line item added to the school department budget in November 2007 strikes us more as financial legerdemain than a genuine attempt to conform to the actual appropriation. - 23 - Turning to the second prerequisite set forth in Santilli, the Caruolo Act requires the school committee to petition the commissioner of education in writing to seek alternatives and/or waivers to state regulations that would allow the school committee to operate with a balanced budget without violating law, regulation, or contract. See Santilli, 912 A.2d at 941 n.1. We agree with the trial justice that this prerequisite necessarily incorporates a timeliness requirement. We further note that, in its letter to the commissioner, the school committee apparently did not request substantial alternatives or waivers. Indeed, the school department’s primary “alternatives” were simply requests for supplementary state funding. This Court finds ample evidence in the record to support the trial justice’s conclusion that the school committee did not make a good-faith effort to analyze areas where savings could be found in the school budget that would allow the school department to operate within its appropriation. Moreover, by waiting until December 2007 to seek alternatives and waivers, there is evidence that the school committee missed opportunities to suggest additional possibilities for savings. 5. The Corrective Action Plan and the Caruolo Action Program Audit The school committee contends that the trial justice erroneously cited the filing of a corrective action plan as a prerequisite to the bringing of a Caruolo action. Upon review of the Superior Court’s decision, we do not agree that the trial justice ever identified such a prerequisite. Rather, the trial justice accurately observed that under § 16-2-9(f) the school committee was required to “submit a written statement of the amount of and cause for the over obligation or over expenditure or revenue deficiency to the city or town council president” within five working days of discovering its “potential or actual” budget deficit. Such notification must also “include a statement of the school committee’s plan for corrective actions necessary to meet - 24 - the requirements of subsection (d). The plan shall be approved by the auditor general.” Section 16-2-9(f). Upon review of the record, it is clear that the school committee failed to file such a corrective action plan in a timely manner. Superintendent Scherza and Mr. Balducci both testified that they were aware of the potential for a substantial deficit after the city council reduced the school department appropriation in July 2007. Mr. Sweeney further testified that at the time he was retained in the spring of 2007, he understood that the superintendent anticipated a substantial deficit for FY 2007-2008. By November of 2007, Mr. Sweeney had informed the school committee of a potential $3.5 million deficit. Yet in spite of this, the school committee did not inform the city council of its budget problems until January 2008. 5 The trial justice did not base her decision to dismiss the school committee’s suit on its failure to properly or timely file a corrective action plan, however. The trial justice simply considered the failure as evidence that the school committee did not attempt to amend its budget with any true intention to adhere to its appropriated budget as required under the Caruolo Act. We do not consider such a use of this evidence to be an abuse of discretion. The school committee also argues that the trial justice erroneously considered the performance of a program audit by the school committee a statutory prerequisite to the bringing 5 The school committee contends that Mr. Balducci submitted monthly budget reports to the city’s finance director and controller. These monthly reports included FY 2007-2008 deficit projections as early as July 2007. Each report included a “corrective action plan”—namely “to seek additional funding from local municipality.” Mr. Balducci testified that these reports were, in turn, incorporated into monthly city finance reports transmitted to city council members. This Court agrees with the trial justice that these reports do not rise to the level of affirmative action required of the school committee under G.L. 1956 § 16-2-9. First, these monthly fiscal reports do not provide “a written statement of * * * the cause for the over obligation or over expenditure or revenue deficiency” as required under § 16-2-9(f). Second, the reports were not transmitted “to the city or town council president,” nor were the so-called corrective action plans “approved by the auditor general.” Id. For these reasons, we do not consider the monthly fiscal reports to be timely or adequate notice to the city council of the school department’s budget deficit. - 25 - of a Caruolo action. Specifically, the school committee argues that it is the responsibility of the city to perform such program audits. Upon review of the trial justice’s decision, it is clear that her references to a program audit related to the timeliness of the school committee’s action, not to any statutory prerequisite. The performance of a program audit pertains less to any condition precedent to filing a Caruolo suit than to the school committee’s ability to satisfy its burden of proof before the Superior Court. Without the benefit of a program audit, it may be difficult for the trial justice to determine whether the school committee was doing all it could to live within its means while complying with its legal obligations. Accordingly, we discern no error in the trial justice’s comments on this issue. B Consolidation of the Cases 1. Standard of Review Rule 42(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure allows the consolidation of actions “involving a common question of law or fact * * * [in cases where it would] tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.” As this Court has previously observed, “the trial court has inherent power to order that several cases pending before it be tried together where they are of the same nature, arise from the same act or transaction, involve the same or like issues, depend substantially upon the same evidence, even though it may vary in its details in fixing responsibility, and where such a trial will not prejudice the substantial rights of any party.” Giguere v. Yellow Cab Co., 59 R.I. 248, 256, 195 A. 214, 216 (1937); see also Rich v. Rich, 94 R.I. 220, 222, 179 A.2d 498, 500 (1962). We review the trial justice’s decision to consolidate pending cases for abuse of discretion. - 26 - 2. The Propriety and Scope of Consolidation The school committee contends that the trial justice erred in consolidating the Caruolo action and the city’s counterclaim and equitable suit. The school committee notes that, by its plain language, any order by the Superior Court in a Caruolo action may have force and effect only for the fiscal year at issue in the case. The school committee argues that by consolidating the cases, the trial justice’s decision improperly affected FY 2008-2009 in addition to FY 2007- 2008—the fiscal year at issue in the instant case. We are convinced that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion in consolidating the instant cases. Both involve common issues of fact and law, and the resolution of the school committee’s Caruolo action has an immediate and profound effect on the FY 2008-2009 budget at issue in the city’s complaint and counterclaim. As this Court has observed, “[t]he causes of action remain distinct throughout * * * a [consolidated] trial and every legal right is preserved to the respective parties as fully as if the cases had been tried separately.” Giguere, 59 R.I. at 251, 195 A. at 216. The trial justice therefore was able to issue a separate judgment on the Caruolo action, which pertained only to FY 2007-2008, thus satisfying the terms of the Caruolo Act. In addition, we agree with the trial justice when she observed that, in light of the Superior Court’s consolidation order as well as the evidence adduced at trial, it appears that the school committee was adequately on notice that the two actions would be tried together and could be decided simultaneously. - 27 - C The Writ of Mandamus 1. Standard of Review Although mandamus is an extreme remedy, this Court employs its “usual standard of review to the findings of the trial court.” Muschiano v. Travers, 973 A.2d 515, 521 (R.I. 2009). A trial justice’s findings will not be overturned unless she overlooked material evidence, was clearly wrong, or her decision fails to do substantial justice between the parties. Grady v. Narragansett Electric Co., 962 A.2d 34, 41 (R.I. 2009). 2. Issuance of the Writ The school committee contends that the trial justice erred in granting injunctive relief 6 ordering it to prepare a corrective action plan for FY 2007-2008. In actuality, however, the trial justice ordered the school committee to file the corrective action plan by writ of mandamus. A writ of mandamus may be issued when: “(1) the petitioner has a clear legal right to the relief sought, (2) the respondent has a ministerial duty to perform the requested act without discretion to refuse, and (3) the petitioner has no adequate remedy at law.” New England Development, LLC v. Berg, 913 A.2d 363, 368 (R.I. 2007). As previously discussed, under § 16-2-9(f) the school committee had a clear obligation to file a corrective action plan with the city council within five days of the discovery of an actual or potential budget deficit. At the time the trial justice issued the writ, there was no doubt that a deficit existed for the FY 2007-2008 budget, that the school committee had been aware of the potential for such a deficit since November 2007 at the latest, and that the school committee had not filed a corrective action plan that comported with statutory requirements. In essence, the trial 6 Contrary to what the school committee argues, there was no disposition of the city’s injunctive relief claims on the merits. - 28 - justice merely compelled the school committee to adhere to its preexisting statutory obligations. Not only did the school committee have a duty to file this corrective action plan, but compliance with such duty was long overdue. We discern no error. D The Superior Court’s Findings of Fact 1. Standard of Review It is well settled that “[t]his Court will not disturb the findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury unless such findings are clearly erroneous or unless the trial justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence * * *.” Haydon v. Stamas, 900 A.2d 1104, 1113 (R.I. 2006) (quoting Imperial Casualty and Indemnity Co. v. Bellini, 888 A.2d 957, 961 (R.I. 2005)). If on review “it becomes clear to us that ‘the record indicates that competent evidence supports the trial justice’s findings, we shall not substitute our view of the evidence for his [or hers] even though a contrary conclusion could have been reached.’” Grady, 962 A.2d at 41 (quoting Tim Hennigan Co. v. Anthony A. Nunes, Inc., 437 A.2d 1355, 1357 (R.I. 1981)). 2. The Propriety of the Findings The school committee cites the trial justice’s following findings as erroneous or unsupported by the evidence: (1) the Caruolo action was untimely; (2) the school committee did not reduce expenses and waited as late as possible to file the Caruolo action; (3) the school committee might have prevented the institution of the Caruolo action if it had filed a corrective action plan; (4) the school committee could cut programs without violating its contractual obligations; and (5) the school committee engaged in poor budgeting practices and “simply continued to spend money until it had grossly overspent its budget.” - 29 - In light of this Court’s deference to the findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury, it does not appear that the trial justice misconceived the evidence or was clearly wrong in making any of these findings. There is ample evidence in the record before us establishing that the school committee failed to align its budgeting practices with the city’s fiscal reality, that it should have pursued a resolution by filing a corrective action plan, that it could have cut programs without violating its contractual obligations, and that it did not act in a timely fashion to reduce expenses. E Motion for Reconsideration/Alternative Motion for New Trial 1. Standard of Review The Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, similar to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, do not provide for a motion to reconsider. This Court, however, applies a liberal interpretation of the rules to “look to substance, not labels.” Sarni v. Meloccaro, 113 R.I. 630, 636, 324 A.2d 648, 651 (1974). Historically, we have allowed “motions to reconsider” to be treated as motions to vacate under Rule 60(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, and the school committee indicates in its brief that it intended its motion to be considered as such. See, e.g., Keystone Elevator Co. v. Johnson & Wales University, 850 A.2d 912, 916 (R.I. 2004). “A Rule 60(b) motion to vacate is addressed to the trial justice’s sound judicial discretion and ‘will not be disturbed on appeal, absent a showing of abuse of discretion.’” Id. (quoting Crystal Restaurant Management Corp. v. Calcagni, 732 A.2d 706, 710 (R.I. 1999)). 2. Denial of the Motion for Reconsideration/Motion for New Trial The school committee argues that the trial justice should have granted its motion for reconsideration and amended her decision pertaining to the Caruolo action and the city’s - 30 - complaint and counterclaim. The school committee contends that it was not afforded proper notice or an opportunity for a full trial on the merits concerning either the counterclaim or the city’s complaint. As we have already discussed, the trial justice granted the city’s request for writs of mandamus requiring the school committee to file corrective action plans for FY 2007-2008 and FY 2008-2009. The trial justice did not dispose of the city’s requests for injunctive relief on the merits, and she denied the city’s request for declaratory judgment. Upon review of the record, we find the trial justice’s issuance of the writs to be adequately supported by the evidence adduced at trial, and we perceive no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial justice in denying the school committee’s motion to reconsider. F Other Allegations of Error The school committee also alleges that the trial justice’s failure to consider its answers to the city’s counterclaim and complaint rendered her decision “fatally flawed on due process grounds” and “fundamentally unfair.” This Court cannot conclude that the slightest bit of prejudice inhered in the trial justice’s failure to consider the school committee’s answers. 7 The trial justice stated that, because she was unable to locate the school committee’s answers in the record, she addressed the issues in the case as though the school committee had denied all the city’s allegations. She later considered the answers and affirmative defenses when deciding the school committee’s motion for reconsideration/amendment of its decision and alternative motion for new trial, but concluded that “[t]here is nothing in the answers or affirmative defenses * * * 7 The trial justice apparently did not overlook or ignore the school committee’s answers, but rather they could not be found in the record. The school committee states that its answers were mailed to the Providence County Superior Court, but the trial was conducted in Washington County Superior Court. The school committee suggests that its papers may have been “lost in the shuffle” between the two clerks’ offices. - 31 - that in [any way] changes this [c]ourt’s decision.” This Court has no reason to doubt the accuracy of her statements. Finally, the school committee suggests that the trial justice erred in considering the potential effect of implementing the recommendations of the Abrahams report. In reviewing the trial justice’s decision, it is clear that the trial justice did not rely on the Abrahams report as a substantial factor in her ruling. Rather, she refers to the report only to highlight the deficiencies in the school committee’s approach to budgeting and the deficiencies in the financial review conducted by the school committee’s consultants. This, in itself, does not constitute reversible error. III Conclusion For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. The papers in this case may be remanded to the Superior Court. - 32 - Supreme Court School Committee of the City of Cranston : No. 2008-289-Appeal. et al.

(PC 08-4133) v. : School Committee of the City of Cranston : et al.",non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. This appeal arises from a morass of budgetary woe in the City of Cranston. The plaintiffs, the School Committee of the City of Cranston, and Superintendent of Schools, Peter L. Nero (hereinafter collectively referred to as the school committee), appeal from a judgment in favor of the defendants, the members of the Cranston City Council, Mayor Allan Fung, and Director of Finance Robert F. Strom (hereinafter collectively referred to as the city). 1 The school committee sought additional appropriations for the Cranston School Department for fiscal year (FY) 2007-2008 in what is commonly referred to as a “Caruolo action.” The school committee also appeals from a judgment in favor of the city in 1', 'This Court granted both parties’ motions to substitute names of elected officials on November 24, 2009.', '-1- the city’s separate action for declaratory, injunctive, and mandamus relief. The two actions were consolidated in the Superior Court and also have been consolidated for the purposes of this appeal.', 'The school committee contends that the trial justice erred in concluding that the school committee did not meet the statutory prerequisites for filing a Caruolo action pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 16-2-21.4; it also alleges a bevy of other errors. For the reasons discussed in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'The school committee’s FY 2007-2008 financial travails can be traced to the spring of the previous school year. On February 28, 2007, the school committee requested from the city a budget of $129,865,082 for FY 2007-2008. The city council made an appropriation to the school department of $126,395,975 for FY 2007-2008 on May 9, 2007. The school committee then amended its budget to conform to this appropriation on June 19, 2007.', 'At trial, Thomas Sweeney, Jr., a consultant retained by the school committee in April 2007, noted that the school department was already projecting a deficit for FY 2007-2008 at the time he was retained.', 'When subsequent school aid from the state proved lower than expected in July 2007, the city council further reduced its appropriation to the school department to $125,328,548. However, the school committee failed to amend its budget to reflect the reduced appropriation. Instead, the school committee apparently attempted to account for the discrepancy when it included a “budget reconciliation” item of $1,651,202 in its November 2007 revised budget. Even before the insertion of this budget reconciliation item, Mr. Sweeney was estimating a', '-2- projected deficit of $3.5 million for FY 2007-2008 as early as September 2007. By December 6, 2007, the projected budget deficit totaled $3,888,190.', 'On November 30, 2007, the superintendent instituted a purchasing freeze. According to Mr. Sweeney, however, it is doubtful that many savings were realized as a result of this freeze because most of the expenditures for FY 2007-2008 already had been made, and the freeze was not stringently enforced.', 'By December 2007, the school committee was contemplating an action against the city pursuant to § 16-2-21.4—commonly referred to as the Caruolo Act. In a Caruolo action, a school committee may file a complaint in the Superior Court to seek additional appropriations for the school department if it believes it cannot adequately run the schools with the previously authorized appropriation.', 'On December 26, 2007, the superintendent sent a letter to the commissioner of the Rhode Island Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, purportedly seeking alternatives or waivers with regard to certain legal and regulatory requirements, in an attempt to garner approximately $4 million in budget savings. Such requests are required before a Caruolo action may be brought. The superintendent’s proposals included requesting additional state funding for special and vocational education programs, as well as elimination of all non-special education student transportation and increasing special education class size. The commissioner denied the superintendent’s requests on January 15, 2008.', 'On January 22, 2008, the school committee sent a letter to the city council requesting a supplemental appropriation of $3,839,190. The school committee indicated that if the city council did not respond within fifteen days, the school committee would “assume that [its] response is in the negative, and [the school committee] will proceed accordingly.” The city', '-3- council did not specifically respond to the school committee’s request within fifteen days, although the school committee and the city met on a number of occasions over the next few months in an effort to resolve the budget problems.', 'In April 2008, the school committee made a presentation to the city council on the school department budget deficit. At this meeting, the school committee said that the school budget deficit was then projected to be approximately $4.9 million for FY 2007-2008. The city council then passed a resolution asking the mayor to seek a writ of mandamus requiring the school department to operate within its appropriated budget for the school year in accordance with state law. Thereafter, the school committee filed the instant Caruolo action against the city on May 13, 2008.', 'Around this same time, the school committee submitted its budget for FY 2008-2009 to the city council. The school committee requested $132,810,730 for FY 2008-2009, including $93,884,319 in direct city appropriations. At some point after May 15, 2008, the city council level-funded the school committee for the coming school year, appropriating $125,340,048. In response, the school committee adopted a revised budget on June 16, 2008. This “revised” budget included a “budget reconciliation” item, however, similar to the one previously used in the FY 2007-2008 budget—except that this item now eliminated a $4,931,704 operating deficit. At trial, Joseph Balducci, the chief financial officer of the Cranston School Department, testified that the $4.9 million represented the reduction in expenditures to be realized as a result of the instant Caruolo action.', 'In June 2008, the city filed an answer and a counterclaim asking the Superior Court to order the school committee to file corrective action plans for the FY 2007-2008 budget and to', '-4- refrain from certain expenditures. 2 The city subsequently filed a separate action against the school committee requesting the same relief as the counterclaim.', 'On June 23, 2008, upon the request of the mayor, the city council passed a resolution directing the city finance director to create a deficit reduction/loan account, into which the city council appropriated approximately $4,138,000.', 'This sum was intended for payment of outstanding school committee contractual obligations and invoices for FY 2007-2008. The city did not consider this loan to be an additional appropriation to the school department, nor did it agree to factor the sum into the city’s “maintenance of effort” for the next year under G.L. 1956 § 16-7-23.', 'Thereafter, the city moved to consolidate the separate actions. On July 10, 2008, the trial justice granted the motion to consolidate, noting that evidence should be submitted for both actions and that the parties should identify specifically which lines of questioning were directed exclusively to the city’s counterclaim and complaint. She indicated that she would “save for another day” the issue of whether additional evidence might be needed for the city’s action. An order implementing the trial justice’s decision was not entered until July 21, 2008, in the midst of the bench trial. The order stated that both actions involved “common questions of law and fact, such that it would further the interests of judicial economy to have the two cases tried and decided together.” The order further stated that at the close of testimony, the trial justice would hear argument on whether additional testimony was necessary on the city’s complaint and counterclaims. The order also indicated that the trial justice “may decide the merits of the Caruolo action first and reserves the right to bifurcate for decision the legal issues raised in [the city’s] counterclaims and the [c]ity’s [c]omplaint.” 2', 'The mayor and finance director filed their answer on June 16, 2008. The city council filed its answer on September 2, 2008, after the conclusion of trial.', '-5-', 'Shortly after trial commenced, the school committee filed an emergency motion for a writ of mandamus to compel the city to authorize the payment of certain FY 2007-2008 expenses, to be paid out of the FY 2008-2009 appropriation or out of the FY 2007-2008 cash reserves. On July 21, 2008, the trial justice issued a writ of mandamus requiring the city to release $559,143 from the FY 2007-2008 cash reserves. The trial justice did not authorize any expenditures to be made out of the FY 2008-2009 appropriation for the payment of FY 2007-2008 expenses, and noted that the authorized payments “would not be deemed an admission by the [d]efendants for any purpose in the instant action.”', 'A', 'Trial Testimony', 'A bench trial was held in July 2008. The first witness, Mr. Sweeney, an education consultant for the school committee, testified that he was hired in April 2007 with the understanding that the school committee might have to file a Caruolo action for FY 2007-2008. He was hired to perform an in-house audit to examine all the school department’s programs, which audit eventually could be used to support a Caruolo action. Mr. Sweeney opined that all the school department expenses made in FY 2007-2008 (except for two programs 3 ) were required by law or pursuant to the basic education program (BEP) set by the Rhode Island Board of Regents for Elementary and Secondary Education. He testified that the school department still needed approximately $4.6 million to cover its expenses for FY 2007-2008. He noted that the instant case was unusual because most Caruolo actions attempt to project the amounts needed by the school department to finish the year, but in the instant case the school year was already 3', 'The two exceptions were the EPIC Program for gifted students and the Junior ROTC program at Cranston East High School. Mr. Sweeney qualified this statement, however, by noting that because the EPIC Program had been approved by the commissioner, it therefore could be considered a mandated program.', '-6- over and the school department was calculating its actual shortfall. During cross-examination, Mr. Sweeney testified that he did not recommend that any programs or personnel be reduced, reorganized, or eliminated, nor did he advise the school committee to file a corrective action plan with the auditor general or notify the city council that the school committee was anticipating a budget deficit as early as July 2007. He also did not recommend the filing of a corrective action plan for FY 2008-2009.', 'Raymond Votto, Jr., the chief operating officer for the Cranston public school system, testified that the superintendent’s original FY 2007-2008 budget proposal was reduced by the school committee. Under cross-examination, he conceded that, under the teacher collective- bargaining agreement, the school committee was empowered to lay off up to 3 percent of teachers during FY 2007-2008, but the committee did not do so. It appears that the school committee laid off fifty-nine teachers in February 2007; forty-three of these teachers were later recalled, four resigned, one retired, and only eleven were discharged permanently. Mr. Votto further testified that the school department had laid off approximately ten additional personnel for FY 2008-2009, which amounted to about 1 percent of personnel.', 'Peter Nero, then-assistant superintendent, testified that he had reviewed a report prepared by the Abrahams Group and Parmelee, Poirier & Associates (Abrahams report), which was prepared in 2004 as a result of a Caruolo action filed by the school committee in September 2003 regarding the FY 2003-2004 school budget. The Abrahams report consisted of a performance audit of the school department and operational recommendations.', 'The recommendations contained various cost-saving measures that could have saved the school department up to approximately $12 million. Mr. Nero testified that the school department had implemented a number of the recommendations contained in the Abrahams report. He acknowledged, however,', '-7- that most of the implemented recommendations were adopted for FY 2008-2009, not FY 2007- 2008.', 'Mr. Balducci, the school department’s chief financial officer, testified that he was not aware until April 1, 2007, that the city intended to level-fund the school department for FY 2007- 2008. Mr. Balducci stated a $3.1 million deficit was projected as early as July 2007. He indicated that the school department’s corrective action plan at that time was simply to seek additional funding from the city. He acknowledged that the FY 2007-2008 budget proposed by the school committee exceeded a statutory tax cap.', 'Mr. Balducci further testified that a corrective action plan for the FY 2007-2008 deficit was not filed with the mayor, the city council, or the auditor general. Turning to the FY 2008-2009 budget, Mr. Balducci stated that the projected $4.9 million deficit from FY 2007-2008 was carried over into FY 2008-2009. He testified that he assumed that the instant Caruolo action would be successful, and thus the $4.9 million eventually would be paid. Mr. Balducci admitted that the FY 2008-2009 budget would immediately have a $4.9 million deficit if the school committee’s suit was not successful.', 'According to Superintendent Richard Scherza, the school budget did not have much “fat,” and the school committee “had been very responsibl[e] in scrutinizing [the budget] and actually * * * making some painful cuts.” Mr. Scherza admitted that he presented a budget to the school committee in excess of a statutory tax cap. Although he was aware that the budget adopted by the city council would be insufficient to run the existing programs, operations, facilities, and personnel for FY 2007-2008, he did not institute austerity measures at that time. Indeed, such measures were not instituted until approximately eight months later. He noted that, as a cost-saving measure, fifteen citywide directors were eliminated for FY 2008-2009. Elimination of citywide directors was one of the recommendations of the 2004 Abrahams report', '-8- and resulted in a savings of approximately $100,000 per director. Mr. Scherza testified that there was no discussion of eliminating those positions in the winter of 2007.', 'Walter Edge, another educational consultant retained by the school committee, opined that the school budget for FY 2007-2008 and its adjustments were reasonable. He stated that if the city had gotten $3.5 million through a tax increase and another $1 million from the state in aid, this essentially would have eliminated the $4.5 million deficit.', 'Stephen Woerner, internal auditor for the city council, stated that although some members harbored concerns that the school committee might not be able to operate within the appropriated budget, the council was only definitively aware of a $4 million deficit in March or April of 2008. He noted that there had been errors on the FY 2007 tax bills and levy, and that a FY 2008 tax increase helped resolve those errors and did not support increases in the FY 2007- 2008 school budget.', 'The city’s education consultant presented a different picture of the school department’s management of its deficit. Salvatore Augeri, a retired superintendent for Westerly, testified that a series of cuts could have been made to programs that exceeded the BEP and state and federal mandates. He calculated that the school department could have realized $7.5 million in savings by eliminating excessive personnel and other expenditures at the time it was developing the FY 2007-2008 budget, while still satisfying its various mandates and BEP requirements.', 'Michael Traficante, chairman of the school committee, testified that he proposed consolidation considerations to the city in April 2008 that would have helped the school department to balance its budget.', 'He also indicated that the “Mayor was informing the Superintendent at that time * * * to avoid [filing a] Caruolo action at all possible costs and that we could possibly work out a solution” to the deficit problem.', '-9-', 'The final two witnesses to testify at trial were city finance director Corsino Delgado and Jeffrey Wadovick, a certified public accountant retained by the city’s counsel to review school financial documents. Mr. Delgado noted that the vast majority of a city tax increase for FY 2007-2008 plugged a $6 million hole incurred the previous year in areas not related to the school department.', 'Mr. Wadovick testified that the budget for the school department was cumbersome and did not provide a clear summary of expenditures. He also faulted the school committee for not coming close to meeting the Abrahams report recommendations, especially those proposing better accounting and budgeting practices. He opined that the school department did not adhere to its budget because it overspent on 450 line item accounts out of a total of 2100 accounts. He further testified that the “budget reconciliation” line item in the FY 2007-2008 budget was “[a] very funny line item” and concluded that “[the school committee] could not take any money from anywhere else in the budget or reduce it on another line and therefore, they came up with the line called a ‘budget reconciliation’—[so that] total expenses would continue to be in line with what was originally appropriated.” Mr. Wadovick also opined that the school committee’s reliance on a Caruolo action for revenue was not a sound budgeting practice. He concluded that the school department had deficit spent its original appropriations by $4,496,344 during FY 2007-2008 “by not properly following what was given to them.”', 'After the conclusion of Mr. Wadovick’s testimony, neither party indicated that it wished to submit additional testimony or evidence. The city then moved for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 52(c) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. The city advanced two grounds to support its motion—one jurisdictional and the other substantive. First, the city argued that the school committee had failed to demonstrate that several conditions precedent to properly', '- 10 - pursuing a Caruolo action had been met (namely, revision of the FY 2007-2008 budget to adhere to the city’s budget appropriation, timely pursuit of waivers from the commissioner, timely request for additional funds from the city, and timely commencement of a Caruolo action as soon as a deficit was likely). Second, the city argued that the school committee had failed to meet its burden of proof under the Caruolo Act because its experts did not establish that an additional $4.5 million was necessary to satisfy the BEP, state and federal mandates, and contracts. The school committee responded that the Caruolo Act is a stand-alone statutory enactment, and that none of the conditions precedent cited by the city are mentioned in the statute itself. The school committee further argued that it had satisfied the burden of proof under the act.', 'The city also filed a motion for a mandatory injunction and/or a writ of mandamus to compel the school committee to prepare corrective action plans to cure the actual FY 2007-2008 budget deficit and the anticipated FY 2008-2009 deficit, as well as to submit those plans to the city and to the auditor general under §§ 16-2-9 and 16-2-21. The city further requested that the court order the school committee to refrain from certain expenditures until final resolution of the case, unless necessary to comply with state and federal mandates. Finally, the city asked that a special master be appointed to assume fiscal management of the school department and to identify potential efficiencies that could be realized for FY 2008-2009.', 'After arguments on the merits of these motions, the parties agreed to conduct a joint program and performance audit for FY 2008-2009, and the trial justice so ordered. When asked whether this joint audit would affect the city’s claims, the city’s counsel suggested that the trial justice could still bifurcate her decision by deciding the Caruolo action first, and then deciding the city’s claims.', '- 11 -', 'B', 'Trial Justice’s Decision', 'The Superior Court issued a written decision on August 25, 2008. The trial justice dismissed the school committee’s Caruolo action because she determined that the school committee failed to comply with numerous statutory prerequisites to filing a Caruolo action. Specifically, the trial justice noted that the school committee (1) failed to file a corrective action plan; (2) did not amend its budget to conform to the city council’s lowered appropriation; (3) failed to timely petition the commissioner for waivers from state regulations and requirements; (4) failed to minimize expenses; (5) failed to timely alert the mayor and city council about the expected school budget deficit; and (6) failed to file its Caruolo action in a timely fashion. She observed that the school committee’s Caruolo action was the latest Caruolo action ever filed in the Superior Court. Indeed, the school year was nearly complete by the time the action was filed. The trial justice further noted that by the time the matter was heard before the Superior Court, the school committee had received most of the money it sought through a $4.1 million loan from the city.', 'The trial justice also granted, in part, the requests for relief in the city’s complaint and counterclaim. She issued a writ of mandamus ordering the school committee to file a corrective action plan to address the budget deficit for FY 2007-2008. The writ instructed the school committee to detail how the school committee intends to repay the $4.1 million loan from the city and replenish the $550,000 from its cash reserves that was used to cover school department expenses. In addition, she issued a writ of mandamus, ordering the school committee to file a corrective action plan for the FY 2008-2009 budget in light of the fact that it already showed a deficit as a result of the carryover of the FY 2007-2008 debt. The trial justice held the city’s', '- 12 - request for a court-ordered freeze on school department spending and a declaration with regard to the school committee’s compliance with a statutory cap on spending in abeyance, subject to the filing of corrective action plans, the joint program audit for FY 2008-2009, and any further proceedings.', 'The trial justice additionally reserved decision on the city’s request for the appointment of a special master, subject to the same conditions.', 'The trial justice concluded that the Caruolo Act was intended “to aid a school [committee] immediately after it determines that it will not be able to meet its mandates without incurring a deficit, in order to finish out the school year with a balanced budget.” As the trial justice observed: “A Caruolo action is not intended to be used as an end of the year budget plug to fix a deficit that the school committee had anticipated for months before the school year began.” In the instant case, the trial justice found that the school committee was not proactive about preventing or possibly curing its deficit. Specifically, she found that the school committee was aware of the possibility of a deficit in the spring of 2007 and projected a $3.5 million deficit in October 2007, yet it did not immediately file a corrective action plan or notify the city. She also noted that the school committee’s untimely filing of its Caruolo action left no time for the city to perform a program audit.', 'C', 'Post-Trial Motions', 'The school committee thereafter filed a “Motion for Reconsideration/Amendment of its Decision and Alternative Motion for New Trial.” In the event the trial justice denied the motion for reconsideration, the school committee also filed a motion for a stay and a motion for entry of judgment. A hearing on the motions was held on September 17, 2008. At the hearing, the trial justice first entered judgment in favor of the city on the school committee’s Caruolo action and', '- 13 - entered judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure on the mandamus portions of the city’s complaint.', 'The school committee stated that it was not aware that the trial on the Caruolo action was also a trial on five out of six counts in the city’s complaint. It argued that the trial justice therefore erred in ruling upon the city’s claims without adequate notice. The school committee also noted that the trial justice’s written opinion erroneously stated that the school committee had not filed answers and affirmative defenses to the city’s counterclaim and complaint. It indicated that the parties did not dispute that the school committee answered the city’s complaint and counterclaim. The city countered that the cases were consolidated by order of the court and that, at trial, certain questions pertained exclusively to the city’s complaint. The city also argued that both parties had an opportunity to present additional evidence, but both declined to do so.', 'The trial justice denied the school committee’s motion for reconsideration. She stated that there was a “significant overlap of testimony and legal issues between the Caruolo action and the [c]ity’s counterclaim and complaint[,]” and her principal concern in consolidating the two cases “was making sure that witnesses who are in Court for purposes of the Caruolo action in the first instance would not need to be recalled [at] any later proceeding.” She indicated that extensive evidence was presented on both the FY 2007-2008 and the FY 2008-2009 budgets, and she concluded that the city’s complaint and counterclaim had been tried by implication. The trial justice also noted that the school committee never sought to present additional evidence, nor had it indicated what other evidence it would present if given the opportunity.', 'The trial justice additionally stated that her failure to read the school committee’s answers to the city’s counterclaim and complaint had no effect on her decision because she approached the case as though the school committee had denied all of the city’s allegations. The', '- 14 - trial justice concluded that “[t]here is nothing in the answers or affirmative defenses * * * that in [any way] changes this Court’s decision.” For these reasons, the school committee’s motion for reconsideration and/or amendment of the decision was denied. The trial justice also denied the school committee’s motion for a stay of the order requiring the development of a corrective action plan for the FY 2007-2008 budget.', 'Final judgment in the school committee’s action and partial final judgment under Rule 54(b) in the city’s action were entered on September 17, 2008. The school committee filed notices of appeal from those judgments on September 19, 2008. This Court granted the city’s motion to consolidate the appeals and denied the school committee’s motion to stay the writ of mandamus pertaining to FY 2007-2008. The consolidated appeals were also ordered to be expedited.', 'D', 'Issues on Appeal', 'On appeal the school committee advances numerous arguments: (1) the trial justice erred in concluding that the school committee did not comply with the statutory prerequisites to filing a Caruolo action; (2) the trial justice erred in considering other education-related statutes besides the Caruolo Act because the Caruolo Act is a stand-alone statute; (3) the trial justice erred in looking beyond FY 2007-2008 in fashioning remedies; (4) the trial justice erred in consolidating the two actions; (5) there was insufficient notice to alert the school committee that the July 2008 proceedings were intended to be a full trial on the city’s complaint and counterclaim; (6) the trial justice erred in rendering a decision without reading the school committee’s answers to the city’s complaint and counterclaim; (7) the trial justice erred in speculating about the potential effect of implementing the recommendations of the Abrahams report in her decision; (8) the trial justice', '- 15 - made numerous findings that were erroneous or unsupported by the evidence; (9) the trial justice failed to make the proper findings needed to order injunctive relief; and (10) the trial justice erroneously denied its motion for reconsideration.', 'The city responds that although the school committee nominally met the requirements of § 16-2-21.4, it did so in such a dilatory and ineffectual fashion as to be in noncompliance with the Caruolo Act. The city also contends that the other statutory obligations contained in chapter 2 of title 16 are relevant on the issue of whether the school committee acted in a timely fashion. It notes that § 16-2-21 requires a balanced school budget and § 16-2-9 requires a school committee not to incur debt. The city argues that the trial justice did not find a program audit to be a prerequisite, but merely referred to such an audit as evidence that the school committee’s Caruolo action was not timely filed. On the issue of consolidation of the two cases, the city argues that the Caruolo Act does not preclude the consideration of other issues and counterclaims. The city further argues that the school committee was on fair notice that both of the consolidated cases were before the Superior Court for disposition. On the issue of the school committee’s filed, but apparently overlooked, answers, the city argues that the trial justice’s failure to read the pleading had no effect on the outcome of the case.', 'The city also argues that the trial justice did not err in her findings. The city contends that the trial justice simply highlighted the Abrahams report in discussing the school committee’s budgeting deficiencies and that the record supported the trial justice’s findings that the Caruolo action was untimely.', 'The city further argues that the school committee’s motion for reconsideration was properly denied because the school committee presented no new evidence. The city contends that the trial justice did not need to make findings on the elements for injunctive relief because it actually granted a writ of mandamus.', '- 16 -', 'II', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Procedure for Bringing a Caruolo Action', '1.

The Caruolo Act itself, however, explicitly refers to several other sections of chapters 2 and 7 of title 16, which require, inter alia, that school appropriations satisfy the BEP, that the school committee amend its budget to match its appropriation, and that the school', '- 18 - committee promptly notify the city council if the school department is operating outside its budget.', 'This Court has recently had occasion to construe the statutory meaning of the word “notwithstanding.” In Planned Environments Management Corp. v.

Therefore, all relevant sections should be construed to harmonize with each other to give full force and effect to the intention of the Legislature.', 'Under § 16-2-21(b), which is explicitly referred to in the Caruolo Act,', '“[i]f the amount appropriated by * * * the city or town', 'council * * * is either more or less than the amount recommended', 'and requested by the school committee, the school committee', 'shall, within thirty (30) days after the appropriation is made,', 'amend its estimates and recommendations so that expenses are no', 'greater than the total of all revenue appropriated by the state or', 'town or provided for public schools under the care, control, and', 'management of the school committee.”', '- 19 -', 'In the same vein, § 16-2-18 provides in part:', '“If, in any fiscal year a school committee is notified that estimated', 'expenses may exceed total available appropriations, the school', 'committee shall adopt and implement a plan to maintain a balanced', 'school budget, which plan shall provide for continuous regular', 'public school operations consistent with the requirements of § 16-', '2-2; provided, that in no fiscal year shall a deficit be permitted for', 'school operations.”', 'Similarly, § 16-2-9 sets forth certain duties incumbent upon the school committees—inter alia, “[t]o adopt a school budget to submit to the local appropriating authority[,]” § 16-2-9(a)(9), “[t]o adopt any changes in the school budget during the course of the school year[,]” § 16-2- 9(a)(10), to “maintain[] a school budget which does not result in a debt[,]” § 16-2-9(d), and to, “within thirty (30) days after the close of the first and second quarters of the state’s fiscal year, adopt a budget as may be necessary to enable it to operate without incurring a debt,” § 16-2-9(e).

The General Assembly’s intent to encourage expeditious action in instances of potential school deficit spending is both practical as a matter of public policy and indisputable as a matter of statutory construction.', '3. Timing of the School Committee’s Caruolo Action', 'In essence, it appears the trial justice’s decision was partially based on the equitable defense of laches, an argument that was advanced during argument on the city’s motion to dismiss under Rule 52(c). For the purposes of appellate review, “the application of the defense of laches is generally committed to the discretion of the trial justice.” O’Reilly v. Town of Glocester, 621 A.2d 697, 703 (R.I. 1993). We will not reverse the trial justice’s decision on what constitutes laches on appeal “unless it is clearly wrong.” Arcand v. Haley, 95 R.I. 357, 364, 187 A.2d 142, 146 (1963) (quoting Lombardi v. Lombardi, 90 R.I. 205, 209, 156 A.2d 911, 913 (1959)). As this Court has explained,', '“[l]aches is an equitable defense that precludes a lawsuit by', 'a plaintiff who has negligently sat on his or her rights to the', 'detriment of a defendant. * * * A court applying the defense of', 'laches must use a two-part test. First, there must be negligence on', 'the part of the plaintiff that leads to a delay in the prosecution of', 'the case. * * * Second, this delay must prejudice the defendant.', '“Laches, in legal significance, is not mere delay, but delay', 'that works a disadvantage to another. So long as parties are in the', 'same condition, it matters little whether one presses a right', 'promptly or slowly, within limits allowed by law; but when,', 'knowing his rights, he takes no steps to enforce them until the', 'condition of the other party has, in good faith, become so changed', 'that he cannot be restored to his former state, if the right be then', 'enforced, delay becomes inequitable and operates as an estoppel', 'against the assertion of the right.” O’Reilly, 621 A.2d at 702', '- 21 -', '(quoting Chase v. Chase, 20 R.I. 202, 203-04, 37 A. 804, 805', '(1897)).', 'In recent years, this Court has repeatedly observed that the defense of laches is not as limited in scope as it once was. See, e.g., Raso v. Wall, 884 A.2d 391, 394 n.8 (R.I. 2005) (“Although the concept of laches originated in the courts of chancery, it is today often employed in situations in which the relief sought is not readily classifiable as equitable in nature.”).', 'The timeliness of a school committee’s actions cannot be an inapposite consideration in light of the Caruolo Act and title 16’s overarching intention that school committees ensure comprehensive and uninterrupted educational services within appropriated budget amounts. School committees and school department administrators are exhorted to act quickly when they discover actual or potential budget problems, see, e.g., §§ 16-2-9(f), 16-2-21, and the Caruolo action itself is entitled to expedited procedures in the Superior Court under § 16-2-21.4. See generally Puleio v. Vose, 830 F.2d 1197, 1203 (1st Cir. 1987) (“The law ministers to the vigilant not to those who sleep upon perceptible rights.”).', 'We therefore affirm the trial justice’s interpretation of § 16-2-21.4 as requiring that a Caruolo action “be brought in a timely manner from when a school committee discovers that it cannot operate in a non-deficit position while complying with its mandates and contracts. * * * [A] Caruolo action is intended to aid a school immediately after it determines that it will not be able to meet its mandates without incurring a deficit * * *.” Likewise, we concur that “it is contrary to the intent of the Legislature to allow a school committee to knowingly incur an end of the year deficit where corrective action can no longer be taken, only to be appropriated additional funds under the Caruolo Act.” Far from being clearly wrong, the trial justice’s application of the doctrine of laches in the instant case was eminently justified.', '- 22 -', '4. Conditions Precedent to a Caruolo Action', 'A school committee may file a Caruolo action “in instances where the school committee determines that its annual appropriated budget is not sufficient to meet state imposed educational mandates while satisfying the school committee’s statutory obligation to maintain a ‘balanced’ budget.” Beil v. Chariho School Committee, 667 A.2d 1259, 1259 (R.I. 1995) (mem.).', 'This Court has set forth the following prerequisites that a school committee must meet before filing a Caruolo action:', '“The first prerequisite is that the school committee must', 'adhere to the budget that the town has appropriated.

Third, if the commissioner denies the requested', 'alternatives and/or requests for waivers, the school committee may', 'request that the city council reconsider whether to increase the', 'appropriation for schools to meet expenditures.

Santilli, 912 A.2d 941, 941 n.1 (R.I.', '2007) (mem.) (internal citations omitted). As already discussed, each of these prerequisites inherently requires timely action.', 'Under § 16-2-21.4, the school committee is required to adhere to its appropriated budget while it pursues additional funding. Upon review of the record, we are convinced that ample evidence was adduced at trial to support the trial justice’s conclusion that the school committee failed to amend its budget to conform to the city council’s appropriation. 4 This failure supports the trial justice’s conclusion that the school committee did not make a good-faith or timely effort to operate within the city council’s school budget appropriation. 4', 'Mr. Balducci testified that the school committee did not immediately amend its budget to match the city’s reduced appropriation in July 2007. The “budget reconciliation” line item added to the school department budget in November 2007 strikes us more as financial legerdemain than a genuine attempt to conform to the actual appropriation.', '- 23 -', 'Turning to the second prerequisite set forth in Santilli, the Caruolo Act requires the school committee to petition the commissioner of education in writing to seek alternatives and/or waivers to state regulations that would allow the school committee to operate with a balanced budget without violating law, regulation, or contract. See Santilli, 912 A.2d at 941 n.1. We agree with the trial justice that this prerequisite necessarily incorporates a timeliness requirement.', 'We further note that, in its letter to the commissioner, the school committee apparently did not request substantial alternatives or waivers. Indeed, the school department’s primary “alternatives” were simply requests for supplementary state funding. This Court finds ample evidence in the record to support the trial justice’s conclusion that the school committee did not make a good-faith effort to analyze areas where savings could be found in the school budget that would allow the school department to operate within its appropriation. Moreover, by waiting until December 2007 to seek alternatives and waivers, there is evidence that the school committee missed opportunities to suggest additional possibilities for savings.', '5. The Corrective Action Plan and the Caruolo Action Program Audit', 'The school committee contends that the trial justice erroneously cited the filing of a corrective action plan as a prerequisite to the bringing of a Caruolo action. Upon review of the Superior Court’s decision, we do not agree that the trial justice ever identified such a prerequisite. Rather, the trial justice accurately observed that under § 16-2-9(f) the school committee was required to “submit a written statement of the amount of and cause for the over obligation or over expenditure or revenue deficiency to the city or town council president” within five working days of discovering its “potential or actual” budget deficit. Such notification must also “include a statement of the school committee’s plan for corrective actions necessary to meet', '- 24 - the requirements of subsection (d). The plan shall be approved by the auditor general.” Section 16-2-9(f).', 'Upon review of the record, it is clear that the school committee failed to file such a corrective action plan in a timely manner. Superintendent Scherza and Mr. Balducci both testified that they were aware of the potential for a substantial deficit after the city council reduced the school department appropriation in July 2007. Mr. Sweeney further testified that at the time he was retained in the spring of 2007, he understood that the superintendent anticipated a substantial deficit for FY 2007-2008. By November of 2007, Mr. Sweeney had informed the school committee of a potential $3.5 million deficit. Yet in spite of this, the school committee did not inform the city council of its budget problems until January 2008. 5', 'The trial justice did not base her decision to dismiss the school committee’s suit on its failure to properly or timely file a corrective action plan, however. The trial justice simply considered the failure as evidence that the school committee did not attempt to amend its budget with any true intention to adhere to its appropriated budget as required under the Caruolo Act. We do not consider such a use of this evidence to be an abuse of discretion.', 'The school committee also argues that the trial justice erroneously considered the performance of a program audit by the school committee a statutory prerequisite to the bringing 5', 'The school committee contends that Mr. Balducci submitted monthly budget reports to the city’s finance director and controller. These monthly reports included FY 2007-2008 deficit projections as early as July 2007. Each report included a “corrective action plan”—namely “to seek additional funding from local municipality.” Mr. Balducci testified that these reports were, in turn, incorporated into monthly city finance reports transmitted to city council members. This Court agrees with the trial justice that these reports do not rise to the level of affirmative action required of the school committee under G.L. 1956 § 16-2-9. First, these monthly fiscal reports do not provide “a written statement of * * * the cause for the over obligation or over expenditure or revenue deficiency” as required under § 16-2-9(f). Second, the reports were not transmitted “to the city or town council president,” nor were the so-called corrective action plans “approved by the auditor general.” Id. For these reasons, we do not consider the monthly fiscal reports to be timely or adequate notice to the city council of the school department’s budget deficit.', '- 25 - of a Caruolo action. Specifically, the school committee argues that it is the responsibility of the city to perform such program audits.', 'Upon review of the trial justice’s decision, it is clear that her references to a program audit related to the timeliness of the school committee’s action, not to any statutory prerequisite. The performance of a program audit pertains less to any condition precedent to filing a Caruolo suit than to the school committee’s ability to satisfy its burden of proof before the Superior Court. Without the benefit of a program audit, it may be difficult for the trial justice to determine whether the school committee was doing all it could to live within its means while complying with its legal obligations. Accordingly, we discern no error in the trial justice’s comments on this issue.', 'B', 'Consolidation of the Cases', '1. Standard of Review', 'Rule 42(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure allows the consolidation of actions “involving a common question of law or fact * * * [in cases where it would] tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay.” As this Court has previously observed,', '“the trial court has inherent power to order that several cases', 'pending before it be tried together where they are of the same', 'nature, arise from the same act or transaction, involve the same or', 'like issues, depend substantially upon the same evidence, even', 'though it may vary in its details in fixing responsibility, and where', 'such a trial will not prejudice the substantial rights of any party.”', 'Giguere v.

The school committee notes that, by its plain language, any order by the Superior Court in a Caruolo action may have force and effect only for the fiscal year at issue in the case. The school committee argues that by consolidating the cases, the trial justice’s decision improperly affected FY 2008-2009 in addition to FY 2007- 2008—the fiscal year at issue in the instant case.', 'We are convinced that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion in consolidating the instant cases. Both involve common issues of fact and law, and the resolution of the school committee’s Caruolo action has an immediate and profound effect on the FY 2008-2009 budget at issue in the city’s complaint and counterclaim.

83,"Christine C. Chiappone : v. : Harry Chiappone. : Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty, and Robinson, JJ. OPINION Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The defendant, Harry Chiappone, appeals from a Family Court decision pending entry of final judgment of divorce. The plaintiff, Christine C. Chiappone, cross-appeals from the same decision. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After examining the written and oral submissions of the parties, we conclude that this appeal may be resolved without further briefing or argument. For the reasons hereinafter set forth, we affirm the Family Court decision in part and reverse in part. I Facts and Procedural History The defendant, Harry, 1 and plaintiff, Christine, were married on June 17, 1989. They have two daughters, only one of whom is still a minor. The parties separated in July 1999, and Christine filed a complaint for divorce on October 1, 1999, to which Harry filed an answer and a counterclaim. 1 We identify the parties by their first names solely for the sake of clarity. No disrespect is intended. -1- On December 31, 1999, a hearing justice entered a temporary support order, granting Christine temporary custody of the children. The order further provided, inter alia, for visitation between the children and Harry, to be supervised by Peter Kosseff, Ph.D., a psychologist, and for cooperation by the parties with him. Harry was required to pay all marital bills, including insurance premiums, automobile payments, utilities, and the children’s extracurricular activities. He was also ordered to pay weekly child support, along with counseling costs and other medical and dental expenses, not covered by insurance, for Christine and the children. The order stated that Harry was not to alienate any assets at that time nor change the beneficiaries of any of his insurance policies. The trial began on December 2, 2002, and concluded on June 23, 2003. 2 Harry testified that, during the parties’ marriage, he was employed at Foxwoods Resort and Casino as a high- stakes dealer, and he also owned a clothing business, Torino Designs. He considered himself the sole proprietor of his clothing business and considered Christine a business partner. Other than her involvement in Torino Designs, Christine did not work outside the home after the birth of the parties’ youngest daughter, and she served as the children’s primary caretaker. Christine cited health problems that she endured throughout her marriage as being among the reasons she did not work outside the home. Harry testified that Christine was a good wife and mother. At trial, a laundry list of defendant’s misdeeds, during both the parties’ marriage and separation, came to light. Christine testified extensively as to Harry’s unkind treatment during their marriage. She described, for example, how he would reproach her for spending money on groceries and necessities, while he purchased luxury and designer items for himself. 2 This Court notes with some concern the amount of time this case has been pending. The trial did not commence until three years after the temporary support order entered, and it took nearly sixteen months to conclude. Bankruptcy proceedings further delayed the matter; nevertheless, this case is now over ten years old. -2- After the parties separated, defendant repeatedly violated the Family Court’s temporary support order. Harry testified that he unilaterally discontinued Christine as his life insurance beneficiary, allowed two insurance policies to lapse, and failed to make automobile payments. Harry also failed to make payments for utilities, child support, and the children’s extracurricular activities. As a result, utilities were shut off, and many of their daughters’ extracurricular activities were stopped for failure to pay. The defendant also violated the temporary support order by dissipating marital assets. The trial justice found that, after the parties separated, Harry withdrew $64,000 from a bank account and deposited it elsewhere. Harry submitted a breakdown of his expenses for “survival, support and welfare” totaling $103,218.37 for the period of July 15, 1999 to November 1, 2002. Despite stating that he did not have the money to make additional temporary support payments after August 3, 2000, defendant admitted that, in addition to his income from Foxwoods, he had approximately $70,000 in a bank account as of January 31, 1999. On February 16, 2004, the trial justice rendered her decision from the bench. The trial justice found that Harry willfully failed to comply with the temporary support order and that Harry admitted that he continued to violate the order until the time of trial. Among other things, Harry was found in contempt for failing to pay more than $16,000 in car payments, over $5,700 in debt to therapists, and more than $8,000 in other debts. The trial justice found that plaintiff and their children had been relying on her family, charity, and social service agencies to provide support when Harry failed to do so. The trial justice identified the marital assets available for equitable distribution, including: a business account with an approximate value of $64,000, stock in Christine’s name with an approximate value of $20,000, Harry’s 401(k) account valued at approximately $80,000, -3- Christine’s automobile, and miscellaneous household items, furnishings, and effects. The trial justice also included in the marital assets, and equitably divided, stock held in a custodial account for the children. She then awarded 65 percent of the marital estate to Christine and 35 percent to Harry. A decision pending entry of final judgment entered on March 29, 2004. Harry timely filed a notice of appeal, raising four specifications of error in his pre- briefing statement; viz., (1) the trial justice erred in the valuation of certain marital assets subject to equitable distribution; (2) she failed to consider the statutory factors in equitably distributing the marital assets; (3) she erred in failing to consider the children’s best interests and in deferring to Dr. Kosseff on the issue of visitation; and (4) she failed to rule on defendant’s motion to modify the temporary support order. The plaintiff cross-appealed, asserting that the trial justice erred by including assets in the marital estate that were intended for the parties’ minor children, under the Uniform Transfer to Minors Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 7 of title 18. On September 22, 2005, Harry filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Connecticut (the Bankruptcy Court). On November 15, 2006, this Court ordered that the appeal from the Family Court decision be held in abeyance pending the Bankruptcy Court’s judgment. On November 21, 2007, the Bankruptcy Court entered a judgment ordering the discharge of the “Business Share and the Bank Account,” comprising the debt owed to Christine for her share of the marital business and her share of a bank account dissipated by Harry. 3 The Bankruptcy Court’s judgment denied discharge of the following: award of attorney’s fees to Christine, payment of temporary support order arrearages, 65 percent of Harry’s 401(k) owed to Christine, and rehabilitative alimony. The Bankruptcy 3 The facts about the Bankruptcy Court’s decision are taken from the parties’ briefs and the Bankruptcy Court’s judgment. We were not provided with a copy of the full memorandum of decision referenced in the judgment. -4- Court found that the alimony award was, however, unenforceable. Thereafter, on February 5, 2009, this Court vacated the order holding the case in abeyance pending the judgment of the Bankruptcy Court. We discuss additional facts in the context of the issues raised on appeal. II Discussion The first issue raised on appeal by Harry is now moot, as the bankruptcy judgment has discharged the debt owed by Harry to Christine for her share of the marital business and her share of the bank account dissipated by Harry. Moreover, Harry has conceded that the trial justice erred in including the custodial account, composed of stock, in the marital estate. 4 Both parties agree that the account was opened under the Uniform Transfer to Minors Act. Paragraph 12 on page 7 of the decision pending entry of final judgment, therefore, may be vacated in its entirety. 5 We proceed to address the remaining issues raised by defendant. A Equitable Distribution The defendant argues that the trial justice failed to consider the twelve factors set forth in G.L. 1956 § 15-5-16.1(a), and instead relied exclusively on defendant’s conduct during the parties’ marriage in ruling on the equitable distribution of the marital estate. Specifically, Harry asserts that the trial justice abused her discretion because she did not address or discuss each of the statutory factors in turn. 4 There is some confusion about whether the Uniform Transfer to Minors Act assets consist of a single account or two accounts. The trial justice indicates in her decision that there is a single account, whereas defendant and plaintiff refer to two accounts. 5 Paragraph 12 of the decision pending entry of final judgment provides: “That the * * * stock account for the children shall be divided 65% to Plaintiff and 35% to Defendant within 90 days of this date.” -5- “The equitable distribution of marital assets is within the discretion of the trial justice.” Koziol v. Koziol, 720 A.2d 230, 233 (R.I. 1998) (quoting Thompson v. Thompson, 642 A.2d 1160, 1162 (R.I. 1994)). “This Court will not disturb a trial justice’s findings unless it can be shown that the justice was clearly wrong or has overlooked or misconceived material evidence.” Mattera v. Mattera, 669 A.2d 538, 543 (R.I. 1996). It is well settled that the equitable distribution of property involves a three-step process. Olivieri v. Olivieri, 760 A.2d 1246, 1248 (R.I. 2000). The first step requires the trial justice to “determine which assets are ‘marital property’ and which are ‘non-marital property.’” Id. (quoting Lancellotti v. Lancellotti, 481 A.2d 7, 10 (R.I. 1984)). Second, the trial justice must take into consideration the factors set forth in § 15-5-16.1(a). Olivieri, 760 A.2d at 1248. The third step requires the trial justice to distribute the estate. Id. A trial justice may equitably divide the marital property based on the statutory factors without explicitly listing his or her findings on each factor, “[a]s long as this Court is able to review a lower court’s decision and to determine therefrom that all the necessary facts and statutory factors were considered.” Id. (quoting Gervais v. Gervais, 688 A.2d 1303, 1308 (R.I. 1997)). In addition, this Court has held that where “a trial justice fails to expressly articulate findings of fact we shall not refuse to accord the decision the persuasive force usually accorded such decisions on review, for the reason that implicit in a decision are such findings of fact necessary to support it.” Koutroumanos v. Tzeremes, 865 A.2d 1091, 1098 (R.I. 2005) (quoting Mattera, 669 A.2d at 541). The defendant’s contention that the trial justice failed to consider the statutory factors in § 15-5-16.1(a) is without merit. The record reflects that the trial justice clearly considered factors other than the conduct of the parties in dividing the marital estate. For example, the trial -6- justice considered, inter alia, the length of the marriage, the conduct of both parties, plaintiff’s health, the parties’ current income, the parties’ future earning power, the contributions of each party as caregiver, homemaker, and breadwinner, and defendant’s dissipation of assets. There is no dispute that the trial justice considered what she aptly termed a “veritable litany of misdeeds” on Harry’s part. Much of her decision is devoted to outlining the egregious behavior Harry exhibited in dissipating marital assets, failing to make payments as required by the temporary support order, and failing to exercise his right to visit his children. We reject defendant’s contention, that, by focusing on defendant’s behavior and misconduct, the trial justice overlooked or failed to consider the other statutory factors. B Visitation Harry next argues that the trial justice erred (1) by deferring to Dr. Kosseff on the issue of future visitation, 6 and (2) by not considering the best interests of the children. Specifically, Harry contends that the trial justice incorrectly conditioned future visitation between Harry and the children on the psychologist’s approval, and notes that the trial justice never used the words “best interests of the child” in her decision. “[T]he paramount consideration in cases involving visitation rights or custody disputes is the best interests of the child.” Riedeman v. Petrella, 828 A.2d 538, 540 (R.I. 2003) (quoting Pacheco v. Bedford, 787 A.2d 1210, 1213 (R.I. 2002)). “If the Family Court has properly considered what custody arrangements are in the best interests of the child, [this Court] will not disturb such a discretionary decision.” Id. (quoting Pacheco, 787 A.2d at 1213). 6 The older of the parties’ two children turned eighteen years old while this appeal was pending. Thus, this issue is moot as it concerns her; we will consider only the issue as it concerns the one remaining minor child. See Recard v. Polite, 935 A.2d 101, 101 n.1 (R.I. 2007) (mem.) (finding an appeal from a motion to modify visitation concerning a child who had since turned eighteen moot). -7- Although the trial justice never explicitly used the words “best interests of the child,” there is no doubt, upon review of the record, that her primary concern was the best interests of the children. The incantation of the phrase the “best interests of the child” is not necessary, as long as the trial justice clearly articulates the basis of her decision and as long as the decision demonstrates that paramount consideration is given to the best interests of the child. In the instant case, the trial justice indicated in her decision that Harry had not seen his children in three years at the time of the decision and that he was responsible for his lack of a relationship with them. The trial justice further detailed the psychiatric and psychological needs of the children and the negative impact of defendant’s failure to see his children in a supervised setting, as recommended by Dr. Kosseff. Finally, the trial justice summarized her in camera interview with the children, specifically noting their expressed desire not to see defendant. In light of the record, we are satisfied that the trial justice’s decision was grounded in her consideration of the best interests of the children; thus, we find no abuse of discretion. The defendant also challenges what he calls the trial justice’s delegation of future visitation decision-making to Dr. Kosseff. Harry argues that the trial justice granted Dr. Kosseff the authority to make all future decisions concerning visitation between Harry and his children and that it was improper for the trial justice to vest such authority in a therapist, rather than a judicial officer. In the temporary support order, the Family Court ordered the parties to cooperate with the psychologist for an evaluation and supervised visitation between defendant and the children. The court further requested recommendations about visitation from Dr. Kosseff. On July 24, 2000, after receiving Dr. Kosseff’s recommendations, the court ordered defendant to participate in supervised visitation with the children and to comply with Dr. Kosseff’s recommendations for -8- individual counseling between himself and the parties’ older daughter. Christine later testified that meeting with Dr. Kosseff had been futile; Harry and Christine were unable to arrange visitation in accordance with the psychologist’s recommendations, and Harry had not scheduled appointments with Dr. Kosseff. Christine, through her trial testimony, asked the trial justice to reaffirm the prior order requiring defendant to participate with Dr. Kosseff and requesting that he make recommendations about contact between defendant and the children. In her decision, the trial justice summarized the facts surrounding the deterioration of the relationship between Harry and his children and indicated that defendant could write letters to them, but that ultimately the children could decide whether they wished to respond. The trial justice then stated that, “[s]hould the [d]efendant, however, agree to revisit Dr. Kosseff and attempt reconciliation with the children, that issue will be left to the therapist and not to the Court.” Without question, the wording of the last clause is error. The issues of custody and visitation fall squarely within the realm of judicial responsibility and may not be delegated to a therapist, no matter how qualified or well-intentioned the therapist may be. In the context of this case, however, we deem it to be an error that does not justify a remedy. In light of Dr. Kosseff’s involvement with the two minor children at the time the decision pending entry of final judgment entered and the trial justice’s findings of fact, it was perfectly appropriate that defendant’s visitation be conditioned upon his willingness to attempt reconciliation through Dr. Kosseff. Specifically, the trial justice found that: defendant had not seen his children for well over three years; he was ordered to see his children in a supervised setting through Dr. Kosseff but he had not done so; his older daughter expressed in an in camera interview her strong desire not to see him, and his younger daughter seemed to follow her sister’s -9- lead; and his daughters’ alienation from him was a result of his conduct and behavior. Clearly, Dr. Kosseff’s recommendations would be an important consideration in any attempt to reestablish visitation. At oral argument it was represented that defendant’s three-year lapse in visitation now exceeds ten years. And yet, at no time during the intervening years has defendant either contacted Dr. Kosseff or sought to modify the visitation order by showing that visitation, no matter how restricted, would be in the children’s best interests. Thus, neither the trial justice nor any other Family Court justice has had occasion to consider the application of the visitation order as set forth in the decision pending entry of final judgment. We are confident that the language of the order is a result of inartful draftsmanship rather than an abdication of judicial authority by the veteran trial justice. Although we are suspect of defendant’s protestations concerning his lack of visitation, we emphasize that any modification to the custody and/or visitation orders with respect to the one remaining minor child is to be made by a Family Court justice based upon the best interests of said child. C Motion to Modify the Temporary Support Order The defendant next argues that the trial justice erred by failing to hold a hearing on his motion to modify the temporary support order and by thereafter holding defendant in contempt for violating the same. The plaintiff counters that defendant did not present any evidence in support of his motion to modify and did not pursue the motion at trial. After reviewing the record that has been provided to us, we are satisfied that there was no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial justice. The record reflects that defendant filed a motion to modify the temporary support order on February 3, 2000. On March 29, 2000, a hearing was held on the motion to modify, but it - 10 - was expressly limited to the issue of supervised visitation. On August 2, 2000, a hearing justice adjudged Harry in contempt of the temporary support order, after making findings of fact about Harry’s finances. An order, date stamped August 15, 2000 and entered on August 23, 2000, continued the hearing on defendant’s motion to modify and ordered defendant to file a DR-6 prior to a September 11, 2000 hearing date. Harry filed a DR-6 on August 15, 2000. The September 11, 2000 hearing was subsequently continued by stipulation. Almost two years passed; the divorce trial commenced, and, on December 4, 2002, plaintiff called the motion to modify, among other motions, to the trial justice’s attention. The defendant agreed that the motion was pending, and plaintiff offered to identify the several motions that were still pending at the next hearing date. The next hearing was held on January 9, 2003, but neither party pressed the pending motions. Nothing in the record indicates that defendant further pursued his first motion to modify. 7 Assuming a hearing on the defendant’s motion to modify was never held, exploration of the record reveals that Harry failed to press the motion and failed to provide evidence suggesting changed circumstances. 8 See Healey v. Healey, 591 A.2d 1216, 1218 (R.I. 1991) (noting that it was the movant’s responsibility to press his motion to modify the temporary support order and further noting that any prejudice resulting from the passage of time was due to the movant’s “lack of diligence”). Therefore, this Court is satisfied there was no abuse of discretion. 7 This Court cannot state definitively whether the issue was raised thereafter. There were off- the-record bench conferences held on January 9, 2003, February 6, 2003, February 21, 2003, and March 28, 2003, and other hearings appear to have taken place, but the parties have not provided this Court with the pertinent transcripts. We proceed to discern the events that occurred below as best we can; however, we note that it is an appellant’s responsibility to order a transcript of such parts of the proceedings as he or she deems necessary for inclusion in the record. See Article I, Rule 10(b)(1) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure. 8 The defendant filed a second motion to modify the temporary support order on May 20, 2004. This motion was denied and dismissed on July 6, 2004. - 11 - III Conclusion For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the decision pending entry of final judgment in part and we reverse said decision in part. The papers shall be returned to the Family Court. Upon remand, the Family Court shall vacate paragraph 12 of said decision.

The trial justice found that plaintiff and their children had been relying on her family, charity, and social service agencies to provide support when Harry failed to do so.', 'The trial justice identified the marital assets available for equitable distribution, including: a business account with an approximate value of $64,000, stock in Christine’s name with an approximate value of $20,000, Harry’s 401(k) account valued at approximately $80,000,', '-3- Christine’s automobile, and miscellaneous household items, furnishings, and effects. The trial justice also included in the marital assets, and equitably divided, stock held in a custodial account for the children. She then awarded 65 percent of the marital estate to Christine and 35 percent to Harry. A decision pending entry of final judgment entered on March 29, 2004.', 'Harry timely filed a notice of appeal, raising four specifications of error in his pre- briefing statement; viz., (1) the trial justice erred in the valuation of certain marital assets subject to equitable distribution; (2) she failed to consider the statutory factors in equitably distributing the marital assets; (3) she erred in failing to consider the children’s best interests and in deferring to Dr. Kosseff on the issue of visitation; and (4) she failed to rule on defendant’s motion to modify the temporary support order. The plaintiff cross-appealed, asserting that the trial justice erred by including assets in the marital estate that were intended for the parties’ minor children, under the Uniform Transfer to Minors Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 7 of title 18.', 'On September 22, 2005, Harry filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Connecticut (the Bankruptcy Court). On November 15, 2006, this Court ordered that the appeal from the Family Court decision be held in abeyance pending the Bankruptcy Court’s judgment. On November 21, 2007, the Bankruptcy Court entered a judgment ordering the discharge of the “Business Share and the Bank Account,” comprising the debt owed to Christine for her share of the marital business and her share of a bank account dissipated by Harry. 3 The Bankruptcy Court’s judgment denied discharge of the following: award of attorney’s fees to Christine, payment of temporary support order arrearages, 65 percent of Harry’s 401(k) owed to Christine, and rehabilitative alimony. The Bankruptcy 3', 'The facts about the Bankruptcy Court’s decision are taken from the parties’ briefs and the Bankruptcy Court’s judgment. We were not provided with a copy of the full memorandum of decision referenced in the judgment.', '-4- Court found that the alimony award was, however, unenforceable. Thereafter, on February 5, 2009, this Court vacated the order holding the case in abeyance pending the judgment of the Bankruptcy Court.', 'We discuss additional facts in the context of the issues raised on appeal.', 'II', 'Discussion', 'The first issue raised on appeal by Harry is now moot, as the bankruptcy judgment has discharged the debt owed by Harry to Christine for her share of the marital business and her share of the bank account dissipated by Harry. Moreover, Harry has conceded that the trial justice erred in including the custodial account, composed of stock, in the marital estate. 4 Both parties agree that the account was opened under the Uniform Transfer to Minors Act. Paragraph 12 on page 7 of the decision pending entry of final judgment, therefore, may be vacated in its entirety. 5 We proceed to address the remaining issues raised by defendant.', 'A', 'Equitable Distribution', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice failed to consider the twelve factors set forth in G.L. 1956 § 15-5-16.1(a), and instead relied exclusively on defendant’s conduct during the parties’ marriage in ruling on the equitable distribution of the marital estate. Specifically, Harry asserts that the trial justice abused her discretion because she did not address or discuss each of the statutory factors in turn. 4', 'There is some confusion about whether the Uniform Transfer to Minors Act assets consist of a single account or two accounts. The trial justice indicates in her decision that there is a single account, whereas defendant and plaintiff refer to two accounts. 5', 'Paragraph 12 of the decision pending entry of final judgment provides: “That the * * * stock account for the children shall be divided 65% to Plaintiff and 35% to Defendant within 90 days of this date.”', '-5-', '“The equitable distribution of marital assets is within the discretion of the trial justice.” Koziol v. Koziol, 720 A.2d 230, 233 (R.I. 1998) (quoting Thompson v. Thompson, 642 A.2d 1160, 1162 (R.I. 1994)). “This Court will not disturb a trial justice’s findings unless it can be shown that the justice was clearly wrong or has overlooked or misconceived material evidence.” Mattera v. Mattera, 669 A.2d 538, 543 (R.I. 1996).', 'It is well settled that the equitable distribution of property involves a three-step process. Olivieri v. Olivieri, 760 A.2d 1246, 1248 (R.I. 2000). The first step requires the trial justice to “determine which assets are ‘marital property’ and which are ‘non-marital property.’” Id. (quoting Lancellotti v. Lancellotti, 481 A.2d 7, 10 (R.I. 1984)). Second, the trial justice must take into consideration the factors set forth in § 15-5-16.1(a). Olivieri, 760 A.2d at 1248.

Id.', 'A trial justice may equitably divide the marital property based on the statutory factors without explicitly listing his or her findings on each factor, “[a]s long as this Court is able to review a lower court’s decision and to determine therefrom that all the necessary facts and statutory factors were considered.” Id. (quoting Gervais v. Gervais, 688 A.2d 1303, 1308 (R.I. 1997)). In addition, this Court has held that where “a trial justice fails to expressly articulate findings of fact we shall not refuse to accord the decision the persuasive force usually accorded such decisions on review, for the reason that implicit in a decision are such findings of fact necessary to support it.” Koutroumanos v. Tzeremes, 865 A.2d 1091, 1098 (R.I. 2005) (quoting Mattera, 669 A.2d at 541).', 'The defendant’s contention that the trial justice failed to consider the statutory factors in § 15-5-16.1(a) is without merit. The record reflects that the trial justice clearly considered factors other than the conduct of the parties in dividing the marital estate. For example, the trial', '-6- justice considered, inter alia, the length of the marriage, the conduct of both parties, plaintiff’s health, the parties’ current income, the parties’ future earning power, the contributions of each party as caregiver, homemaker, and breadwinner, and defendant’s dissipation of assets.', 'There is no dispute that the trial justice considered what she aptly termed a “veritable litany of misdeeds” on Harry’s part. Much of her decision is devoted to outlining the egregious behavior Harry exhibited in dissipating marital assets, failing to make payments as required by the temporary support order, and failing to exercise his right to visit his children. We reject defendant’s contention, that, by focusing on defendant’s behavior and misconduct, the trial justice overlooked or failed to consider the other statutory factors.', 'B', 'Visitation', 'Harry next argues that the trial justice erred (1) by deferring to Dr. Kosseff on the issue of future visitation, 6 and (2) by not considering the best interests of the children. Specifically, Harry contends that the trial justice incorrectly conditioned future visitation between Harry and the children on the psychologist’s approval, and notes that the trial justice never used the words “best interests of the child” in her decision.', '“[T]he paramount consideration in cases involving visitation rights or custody disputes is the best interests of the child.” Riedeman v. Petrella, 828 A.2d 538, 540 (R.I. 2003) (quoting Pacheco v. Bedford, 787 A.2d 1210, 1213 (R.I. 2002)). “If the Family Court has properly considered what custody arrangements are in the best interests of the child, [this Court] will not disturb such a discretionary decision.” Id. (quoting Pacheco, 787 A.2d at 1213). 6', 'The older of the parties’ two children turned eighteen years old while this appeal was pending. Thus, this issue is moot as it concerns her; we will consider only the issue as it concerns the one remaining minor child. See Recard v. Polite, 935 A.2d 101, 101 n.1 (R.I. 2007) (mem.) (finding an appeal from a motion to modify visitation concerning a child who had since turned eighteen moot).', '-7-', 'Although the trial justice never explicitly used the words “best interests of the child,” there is no doubt, upon review of the record, that her primary concern was the best interests of the children. The incantation of the phrase the “best interests of the child” is not necessary, as long as the trial justice clearly articulates the basis of her decision and as long as the decision demonstrates that paramount consideration is given to the best interests of the child.', 'In the instant case, the trial justice indicated in her decision that Harry had not seen his children in three years at the time of the decision and that he was responsible for his lack of a relationship with them. The trial justice further detailed the psychiatric and psychological needs of the children and the negative impact of defendant’s failure to see his children in a supervised setting, as recommended by Dr. Kosseff. Finally, the trial justice summarized her in camera interview with the children, specifically noting their expressed desire not to see defendant. In light of the record, we are satisfied that the trial justice’s decision was grounded in her consideration of the best interests of the children; thus, we find no abuse of discretion.', 'The defendant also challenges what he calls the trial justice’s delegation of future visitation decision-making to Dr. Kosseff. Harry argues that the trial justice granted Dr. Kosseff the authority to make all future decisions concerning visitation between Harry and his children and that it was improper for the trial justice to vest such authority in a therapist, rather than a judicial officer.', 'In the temporary support order, the Family Court ordered the parties to cooperate with the psychologist for an evaluation and supervised visitation between defendant and the children. The court further requested recommendations about visitation from Dr. Kosseff. On July 24, 2000, after receiving Dr. Kosseff’s recommendations, the court ordered defendant to participate in supervised visitation with the children and to comply with Dr. Kosseff’s recommendations for', '-8- individual counseling between himself and the parties’ older daughter. Christine later testified that meeting with Dr. Kosseff had been futile; Harry and Christine were unable to arrange visitation in accordance with the psychologist’s recommendations, and Harry had not scheduled appointments with Dr. Kosseff. Christine, through her trial testimony, asked the trial justice to reaffirm the prior order requiring defendant to participate with Dr. Kosseff and requesting that he make recommendations about contact between defendant and the children.', 'In her decision, the trial justice summarized the facts surrounding the deterioration of the relationship between Harry and his children and indicated that defendant could write letters to them, but that ultimately the children could decide whether they wished to respond. The trial justice then stated that, “[s]hould the [d]efendant, however, agree to revisit Dr. Kosseff and attempt reconciliation with the children, that issue will be left to the therapist and not to the Court.”', 'Without question, the wording of the last clause is error. The issues of custody and visitation fall squarely within the realm of judicial responsibility and may not be delegated to a therapist, no matter how qualified or well-intentioned the therapist may be. In the context of this case, however, we deem it to be an error that does not justify a remedy.', 'In light of Dr. Kosseff’s involvement with the two minor children at the time the decision pending entry of final judgment entered and the trial justice’s findings of fact, it was perfectly appropriate that defendant’s visitation be conditioned upon his willingness to attempt reconciliation through Dr. Kosseff. Specifically, the trial justice found that: defendant had not seen his children for well over three years; he was ordered to see his children in a supervised setting through Dr. Kosseff but he had not done so; his older daughter expressed in an in camera interview her strong desire not to see him, and his younger daughter seemed to follow her sister’s', '-9- lead; and his daughters’ alienation from him was a result of his conduct and behavior. Clearly, Dr. Kosseff’s recommendations would be an important consideration in any attempt to reestablish visitation.', 'At oral argument it was represented that defendant’s three-year lapse in visitation now exceeds ten years.', 'And yet, at no time during the intervening years has defendant either contacted Dr. Kosseff or sought to modify the visitation order by showing that visitation, no matter how restricted, would be in the children’s best interests. Thus, neither the trial justice nor any other Family Court justice has had occasion to consider the application of the visitation order as set forth in the decision pending entry of final judgment.', 'We are confident that the language of the order is a result of inartful draftsmanship rather than an abdication of judicial authority by the veteran trial justice. Although we are suspect of defendant’s protestations concerning his lack of visitation, we emphasize that any modification to the custody and/or visitation orders with respect to the one remaining minor child is to be made by a Family Court justice based upon the best interests of said child.', 'C', 'Motion to Modify the Temporary Support Order', 'The defendant next argues that the trial justice erred by failing to hold a hearing on his motion to modify the temporary support order and by thereafter holding defendant in contempt for violating the same. The plaintiff counters that defendant did not present any evidence in support of his motion to modify and did not pursue the motion at trial. After reviewing the record that has been provided to us, we are satisfied that there was no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial justice.', 'The record reflects that defendant filed a motion to modify the temporary support order on February 3, 2000. On March 29, 2000, a hearing was held on the motion to modify, but it', '- 10 - was expressly limited to the issue of supervised visitation. On August 2, 2000, a hearing justice adjudged Harry in contempt of the temporary support order, after making findings of fact about Harry’s finances.', 'An order, date stamped August 15, 2000 and entered on August 23, 2000, continued the hearing on defendant’s motion to modify and ordered defendant to file a DR-6 prior to a September 11, 2000 hearing date. Harry filed a DR-6 on August 15, 2000. The September 11, 2000 hearing was subsequently continued by stipulation. Almost two years passed; the divorce trial commenced, and, on December 4, 2002, plaintiff called the motion to modify, among other motions, to the trial justice’s attention. The defendant agreed that the motion was pending, and plaintiff offered to identify the several motions that were still pending at the next hearing date. The next hearing was held on January 9, 2003, but neither party pressed the pending motions. Nothing in the record indicates that defendant further pursued his first motion to modify. 7', 'Assuming a hearing on the defendant’s motion to modify was never held, exploration of the record reveals that Harry failed to press the motion and failed to provide evidence suggesting changed circumstances. 8 See Healey v. Healey, 591 A.2d 1216, 1218 (R.I. 1991) (noting that it was the movant’s responsibility to press his motion to modify the temporary support order and further noting that any prejudice resulting from the passage of time was due to the movant’s “lack of diligence”). Therefore, this Court is satisfied there was no abuse of discretion. 7', 'This Court cannot state definitively whether the issue was raised thereafter. There were off- the-record bench conferences held on January 9, 2003, February 6, 2003, February 21, 2003, and March 28, 2003, and other hearings appear to have taken place, but the parties have not provided this Court with the pertinent transcripts. We proceed to discern the events that occurred below as best we can; however, we note that it is an appellant’s responsibility to order a transcript of such parts of the proceedings as he or she deems necessary for inclusion in the record. See Article I, Rule 10(b)(1) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure. 8', 'The defendant filed a second motion to modify the temporary support order on May 20, 2004.

84,"Charles Vaillancourt : v. : Richard Motta et al. : Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty, Robinson, JJ., and Williams, C.J. (ret.). OPINION Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. A shared sewer pipe is the cause of this dispute between neighboring Newport property owners. The defendants, Daniel Greer, Sarah Greer, and Rebecca Bartlett f/k/a Rebecca Durand, appeal from a Superior Court summary judgment entered in favor of the plaintiff, Charles Vaillancourt. The judgment permanently restrained and enjoined the defendants from maintaining the sewer pipe across the plaintiff’s property. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After reviewing the record and considering the parties’ submissions, we are satisfied that the appeal may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court. -1- I Facts and Procedural History The material facts are not in dispute. The plaintiff owns a parcel of real estate at 31 Mount Vernon Street in Newport, Rhode Island. The defendants own two of six units in the Joseph Bailey House Condominium located on a lot directly to the east of plaintiff’s property at 30 Kay Street. The plaintiff’s lot and the condominium lot were a single parcel until 1954, when the property was subdivided. At the time of the subdivision, the parcel contained a main house on defendants’ future property and a carriage house on plaintiff’s future property. Both buildings were served by a single sewer line, which runs from the main house to Mount Vernon Street, traversing what is now plaintiff’s property. The residents of both properties continued to use the existing sewer line after the property was subdivided. The present controversy arose when plaintiff purchased the Mount Vernon Street property in 2007 and tore down the carriage house to build a new house on a different portion of the property. While the house was under construction, plaintiff applied to the city for a permit to install a new sewer pipe that would tie into the city sewer line under Mount Vernon Street. Newport’s Public Works Department denied his request because of the presence of the original sewer pipe. The plaintiff then demanded that defendants remove the existing pipe and relocate their line to Kay Street, but defendants refused. Thereafter, plaintiff relocated the original sewer pipe to accommodate his new home at a cost of $7,970. On August 16, 2007, plaintiff filed the current action against the six owners of the condominium units. In his complaint he sought a declaration from the Superior Court -2- that the existence of the sewer pipe on his property was an unlawful trespass. The plaintiff also sought to enjoin defendants from maintaining the sewer pipe on his property. Daniel and Sarah Greer answered, 1 alleging that they had an implied easement for the sewer line. Thereafter, plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted on April 14, 2008. Judgment was entered for plaintiff on April 21, 2008. After the motion justice denied defendants’ motion to reconsider, defendants timely appealed to this Court. II Standard of Review We review a trial justice’s decision to grant summary judgment de novo. United Lending Corp. v. City of Providence, 827 A.2d 626, 631 (R.I. 2003). “Summary judgment is appropriate when, viewing the facts and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, the [C]ourt determines that there are no issues of material fact in dispute, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Delta Airlines, Inc. v. Neary, 785 A.2d 1123, 1126 (R.I. 2001). The party opposing a motion for summary judgment “carries the burden of proving by competent evidence the existence of a disputed material issue of fact and cannot rest on allegations or denials in the pleadings or on conclusions or legal opinions.” Accent Store Design, Inc. v. Marathon House, Inc., 674 A.2d 1223, 1225 (R.I. 1996). 1 The attorney for the Greers thereafter entered an appearance on behalf of Rebecca Bartlett. The record does not indicate that Ms. Bartlett ever joined the answer, or filed her own answer. Nonetheless, plaintiff did not raise this issue, and so it is waived for the purposes of the instant appeal. See, e.g., Saber v. Dan Angelone Chevrolet, Inc., 811 A.2d 644, 649 (R.I. 2002). -3- III Analysis On appeal, defendants assign error to the motion justice’s entry of summary judgment in favor of plaintiff. 2 First, defendants contend that the existence vel non of an easement by implication requires a fact-intensive inquiry and that genuine issues of material fact remain, specifically with respect to circumstances present at the time of subdivision in 1954, that preclude the granting of summary judgment. Second, defendants argue that the motion justice erred by not finding that an easement by implication existed. Finally, defendants contend that plaintiff failed to serve the other unit owners in the Joseph Bailey House Condominium, and thus he failed to join indispensable parties. A Easement by Implication Both parties recognize that this Court was confronted with a factually similar case in Wiesel v. Smira, 49 R.I. 246, 142 A. 148 (1928). The issue in Wiesel was also whether the defendants acquired an easement by implication for a sewer line on the plaintiff’s property after a severance. In that case, this Court concluded that an implied easement for the sewer line did exist. Mr. Vaillancourt attempts to distinguish the present case from Wiesel by arguing that defendants in this case failed to demonstrate current necessity. 3 2 Although defendants refer to a cross-motion for summary judgment in their brief to this Court, the record does not disclose that defendants ever filed such a motion. 3 The plaintiff does not dispute that the sewer pipe meets the other elements of an implied easement. -4- It is well established that “[a]n implied easement is predicated upon the theory that when a person conveys property, he or she includes or intends to include in the conveyance whatever is necessary for the use and the enjoyment of the land retained.” Hilley v. Lawrence, 972 A.2d 643, 650 (R.I. 2009) (quoting Bovi v. Murray, 601 A.2d 960, 962 (R.I. 1992)). “[T]he test of necessity is whether the easement is reasonably necessary for the convenient and comfortable enjoyment of the property as it existed when the severance was made.” 4 Wiesel, 49 R.I. at 250, 142 A. at 150; see also Ondis v. City of Woonsocket ex rel. Touzin, 934 A.2d 799, 805 (R.I. 2007) (citing Nunes v. Meadowbrook Development Co., 824 A.2d 421, 424 (R.I. 2003)). Further, as we said in Weisel, when a property is “sold fully equipped with visible plumbing and appliances to carry off waste and water, there can be no serious dispute that the use of [a] drain pipe was reasonably necessary for * * * convenient and comfortable enjoyment of the property.” Wiesel, 49 R.I. at 250-51, 142 A. at 150. The plaintiff provided evidence that it would be possible, today, for defendants to tie into the Kay Street sewer line, and therefore he asserts that the easement is unnecessary. The proper inquiry for the existence of an easement by implication, however, focuses on the facts and circumstances at the time of severance. See Ondis, 934 A.2d at 805. In the case under review, plaintiff did not offer any evidence concerning the facts and circumstances present in 1954. Specifically, plaintiff did not submit any 4 This Court recently noted that, in the majority of states, implied easements require a showing of continued necessity. Ondis v. City of Woonsocket ex rel. Touzin, 934 A.2d 799, 805 (R.I. 2007). However, in that same case, we reaffirmed our test for easements by necessity under which necessity is determined as of the time of severance, and therefore a showing of current necessity is not required. Id. at 805. -5- evidence tending to demonstrate that defendants’ predecessor in title could have tied into the Kay Street sewer line in 1954. Although defendants would have the burden of proving their affirmative defense of an implied easement at trial, plaintiff had the burden to show there were no issues of material fact in controversy on his motion for summary judgment. We are satisfied that he failed to carry that burden. B Indispensable Parties The defendants also argue that summary judgment was improper because plaintiff failed to serve all of the unit owners in the Joseph Bailey House Condominium. They contend that all of the unit owners are indispensable parties because they all would be bound by the Superior Court’s judgment requiring the removal of the sewer line. Although our rules of procedure do not provide for motions to reconsider, such motions may be treated as motions for relief from judgment under Rule 60(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. See Tonetti Enterprises, LLC v. Mendon Road Leasing Corp., 943 A.2d 1063, 1068 (R.I. 2008). It appears from the record that the defendants advanced this argument for the first time in their motion to reconsider.5 The record is clear, however, that the defendants appealed only from the grant of summary judgment and not from the denial of the motion to reconsider. The defendants filed a notice of appeal on May 8, 2008, one day before the entry of the order denying their motion to reconsider. We decline, therefore, to address the merits of this argument. 5 The defendants did not provide this Court with any transcripts. -6- IV Conclusion For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the grant of summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff. The papers in the case shall be returned to the Superior Court for further proceedings. -7- Supreme Court No. 2008-310-Appeal.

85,"George Waterman : v. : Frank Caprio, in his capacity as Treasurer : of the State of Rhode Island et al.1 Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty, and Robinson, JJ. OPINION Justice Goldberg, for the Court. This case comes before us on the plaintiff’s appeal from summary judgment entered in the Superior Court in favor of the defendants, Frank Caprio and Frank J. Karpinski (defendants), in their capacities as Rhode Island state treasurer and as executive director of the Rhode Island Employees Retirement System, respectively. The plaintiff, George Waterman (plaintiff), argues three issues on appeal. First, he alleges that the defendants misapplied G.L. 1956 § 36-10-31 in conjunction with G.L. 1956 § 28-33-25.1, and that he is entitled to workers’ compensation benefits that erroneously were offset against his disability retirement benefit payments. In the alternative, the plaintiff argues that the defendants should be estopped from offsetting the funds based on erroneous representations that the defendants’ employee made to the plaintiff’s attorney. Finally, the plaintiff argues that this Court should allow him to resurrect both his workers’ compensation and accidental 1 By operation of Rule 25(d) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, the successors to the Rhode Island state treasurer and the executive director of the Rhode Island Employees Retirement System automatically have been substituted for the prior office holders. -1- disability retirement claims. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the Superior Court’s grant of summary judgment. Facts and Travel The facts of this case are not in dispute. The plaintiff began employment with the State of Rhode Island in 1977 and worked as a correctional officer with the Department of Corrections from 1982 until October 1999. In February 1998, during a “cell extraction”2 exercise at the Adult Correctional Institutions, plaintiff suffered severe chest pain; he ultimately required a cardiac stent implant. He returned to work for a short period, but stopped working the following year. In January 2000, plaintiff filed a petition with the Workers’ Compensation Court, alleging that he was disabled with heart disease and that the illness was related to his employment as a correctional officer. The state opposed the petition, arguing that heart disease was not job related. The plaintiff also filed a claim for an accidental disability retirement from the state. A few months later, the parties began workers’ compensation settlement negotiations as contemplated by § 28-33-25.1. During this time, plaintiff’s attorney contacted James Reilly (Reilly), the then-assistant executive director of the Rhode Island Employees Retirement System, to inquire whether any workers’ compensation settlement that was paid in accordance with § 28-33-25.1 would be offset against plaintiff’s disability retirement payments. Reilly told plaintiff’s counsel that as long as the settlement was not considered a workers’ compensation payment or benefit, the offset provision set forth in § 36-10-31 of the retirement act would not apply. Shortly after this 2 The plaintiff practiced techniques to remove and transport prisoners. -2- conversation, plaintiff amended his accidental disability claim with the retirement system and instead applied for ordinary disability retirement benefits.3 In June 2000, plaintiff settled the workers’ compensation claim based on § 28-33- 25.1, and the state paid him $21,250.4 In September 2000, plaintiff was notified that his retirement payments would not commence until the entire $21,250 was offset against the pension benefits.5 The plaintiff filed a two-count complaint for declaratory judgment in January 2001. The first count alleged that defendants misapplied § 36-10-31’s6 offset provision to plaintiff’s § 28-33-25.17 workers’ compensation settlement. The second count alleged 3 An accidental disability claim requires that the disability is the result of a work-related injury, whereas ordinary disability does not require a work-related injury. See G.L. 1956 §§ 36-10-12 and 36-10-14. 4 $25,000 minus 15 percent counsel fee. 5 The plaintiff did not receive any disability payments until 2002. 6 Section 36-10-31 provides in pertinent part: “Any amount paid or payable under the provisions of any workers’ compensation law or as the result of any action for damages for personal injuries against the state of Rhode Island on account of the death or disability of a member [of the retirement system] shall be offset against and payable in lieu of any benefits payable out of funds provided by the state under the provisions of this chapter on account of the death or disability of the member.” 7 General Laws 1956 § 28-33-25.1 provides in pertinent part: “Notwithstanding the provisions of §§ 28-33-25 and 28-33-26, in cases where liability of the employer for payment of workers’ compensation benefits has not been finally established, the parties may submit a settlement proposal to the workers’ compensation court for approval. If, upon consideration, a judge of the workers’ compensation court deems the settlement proposal to be in the best interest of the parties, the judge may approve the settlement. Payment by the employer or insurer shall not be -3- that plaintiff detrimentally relied on Reilly’s statements; he requested that defendants be estopped from offsetting the disability benefits. The plaintiff moved for summary judgment in August 2001, but the Superior Court denied the motion. A few years later, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Addressing count one of the complaint, alleging a misapplication of § 36-10-31, the hearing justice noted that the statute “is not only clear and unambiguous, it has a very, very broad reach” because the Legislature used the phrase “[a]ny amount paid or payable under any workers’ compensation law.” (Emphasis added.) The hearing justice stated that the offset contemplated by § 36-10-31 would apply to any money received under any type of workers’ compensation payment, including a settlement in accordance with § 28- 33-25.1, regardless of whether or not it is considered the “payment of workers’ compensation benefits.” Section 28-33-25.1. Additionally, the hearing justice noted that plaintiff’s estoppel argument failed – not only because Reilly’s statements were erroneous and conflicted with state law, but also because there was no evidence that Reilly made the statements with the intention of inducing plaintiff to act. The Superior Court granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment during a May 2007 hearing, and this timely appealed ensued. Standard of Review It is well established that this Court uses a de novo standard to review a hearing justice’s decision to grant summary judgment. Lynch v. Spirit Rent-A-Car, Inc., 965 deemed to be the payment of workers’ compensation benefits, but shall be considered a compromise payment of a disputed claim.” The Legislature amended the statute in 2004 (P.L. 2004, ch. 293, § 3), but the amendment has no bearing on the case at bar. -4- A.2d 417, 424 (R.I. 2009); Lamarque v. Fairbanks Capital Corp., 927 A.2d 753, 756 (R.I. 2007). The facts in this case are not in dispute; therefore, we are confronted only with a question of law. Lamarque, 927 A.2d at 756. This Court also uses a de novo standard to review a trial justice’s rulings on questions of law. Hilley v. Lawrence, 972 A.2d 643, 649 (R.I. 2009). Additionally, we review issues of statutory interpretation de novo. See Town of North Kingstown v. Albert, 767 A.2d 659, 662 (R.I. 2001) (recognizing that questions of statutory interpretation are questions of law and are therefore reviewed de novo); see also Lynch, 965 A.2d at 425; State v. Greenberg, 951 A.2d 481, 489 (R.I. 2008). “It is well settled that when the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, this Court must interpret the statute literally and must give the words of the statute their plain and ordinary meanings.” Iselin v. Retirement Board of the Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island, 943 A.2d 1045, 1049 (R.I. 2008) (quoting Accent Store Design, Inc. v. Marathon House, Inc., 674 A.2d 1223, 1226 (R.I. 1996)); see also Lynch, 965 A.2d at 425; In re Matter of Falstaff Brewing Corp. Re: Narragansett Brewery Fire, 637 A.2d 1047, 1049 (R.I. 1994). When this Court examines an unambiguous statute, “there is no room for statutory construction and we must apply the statute as written.” Greenberg, 951 A.2d at 489 (quoting State v. DiCicco, 707 A.2d 251, 253 (R.I. 1998)); Iselin, 943 A.2d at 1049 (noting that, when statutory language is clear and unambiguous, this Court cannot extend the statute’s scope). Statutory Construction The first issue on appeal is whether a payment made in accordance with a workers’ compensation settlement reached under § 28-33-25.1, constitutes an “amount -5- paid or payable under the provision of any workers’ compensation law” for purposes of the offset required by § 36-10-31. Section 36-10-31 requires that “[a]ny amount paid or payable under the provisions of any workers’ compensation law * * * shall be offset against and payable in lieu of any benefits payable out of funds provided by the state * * * on account of the death or disability of the member.” (Emphasis added.) The plaintiff contends that payments made under § 28-33-25.1 are not settlements under the Workers’ Compensation Act as contemplated by that statute.8 The hearing justice disagreed with plaintiff – correctly, we conclude. Section 28-33-25.1 provides in pertinent part: “[I]n cases where liability of the employer for payment of workers’ compensation benefits has not been finally established, the parties may submit a settlement proposal to the workers’ compensation court for approval. If, upon consideration, a judge of the workers’ compensation court deems the settlement proposal to be in the best interest of the parties, the judge may approve the settlement. Payment by the employer or insurer shall not be deemed to be the payment of workers’ compensation benefits, but shall be considered a compromise payment of a disputed claim.” The plaintiff contends that, because § 28-33-25.1 provides that settlements made under the statute “shall not be deemed to be the payment of workers’ compensation benefits,” such settlements are not within the reach of § 36-10-31. Mindful that this Court is the final arbiter on questions of statutory construction, we are of the opinion that settlements pursuant to § 28-33-25.1 are included among the payments contemplated by § 36-10-31. Matter of Falstaff Brewery Corp., 637 A.2d at 1049. 8 The plaintiff raises numerous issues on appeal about the alleged misapplication and misinterpretation of § 36-10-31 and § 28-33-25.1. We will address only those arguments we deem appropriate. -6- The terms of § 36-10-31 are not only clear and unambiguous, but also very broad. Section 36-10-31 requires offsets to “[a]ny amount paid or payable under the provisions of any workers’ compensation law.” Section 28-33-25.1 is found in the Workers’ Compensation Act. See G.L. 1956 § 28-29-1 (noting “Chapters 29—38 of this title may be cited as the ‘Workers’ Compensation Act’”). Additionally, this Court previously has recognized that § 28-33-25.1 is a part of this state’s workers’ compensation law. See Manzi v. State, 687 A.2d 461, 462 (R.I. 1997) (mem.) (opining that the workers’ compensation exclusivity clause is triggered by a workers’ compensation settlement under § 28-33-25.1). Although plaintiff suggests otherwise, the offset required by § 36- 10-31 simply is not limited to traditional workers’ compensation benefits. If the Legislature wanted to so limit the offsets, it could have done so when it enacted the statute; however, the broader terminology of the enactment embraces, “any workers’ compensation law.” (Emphasis added.) This leads us to conclude that settlement payments made pursuant to § 28-33-25.1 are payable under the state’s workers’ compensation scheme. We are of the opinion that the Legislature used this broad language to ensure that money received under any workers’ compensation claim is offset against disability retirement payments to prevent a state employee from recovering twice. We interpreted similar language used in the City of Providence Code of Ordinances in Ruggiero v. City of Providence, 889 A.2d 691, 694 (R.I. 2005). The ordinance provided: “Any amounts paid or payable under the provisions of any worker’s [sic] compensation law * * * on account of death or disability of a member, shall be offset against and payable in lieu of any benefits payable out of funds provided by the city * * * on account of the death or -7- disability of the member.” Id. at 694 n.5 (citing Article VI section 17-191). This Court recognized that the city’s offset provision “prevent[ed] employees from receiving a windfall by collecting twice from the city for the same injury.” Id. The Legislature’s use of similarly broad language in this instance regarding § 36-10-31 leads us to the same conclusion. Estoppel The plaintiff argues in the alternative that defendants should be estopped from invoking the offset provision of § 36-10-31 because plaintiff relied to his detriment on the statements that Reilly made to plaintiff’s attorney. The record reflects that in the spring of 2000 plaintiff’s attorney spoke with Reilly and asked him whether § 36-10-31 would apply to a potential workers’ compensation settlement under § 28-33-25.1. Reilly indicated that because money received from a § 28-33-25.1 settlement was not workers’ compensation benefits or payments, the offset of § 36-10-31 would not apply. The plaintiff argues that he settled his workers’ compensation claim and relinquished his accidental disability retirement benefits in exchange for ordinary disability benefits based on Reilly’s representations.9 “[E]stoppel is ‘extraordinary’ relief, which ‘will not be applied unless the equities clearly [are] balanced in favor of the part[y] seeking relief.’” Sturbridge Home Builders, Inc. v. Downing Seaport, Inc., 890 A.2d 58, 67 (R.I. 2005) (quoting Southex Exhibitions, Inc. v. Rhode Island Builders Association, Inc., 279 F.3d 94, 104 (1st Cir. 2002) (applying Rhode Island law)). This Court will not entertain an estoppel claim when a 9 The plaintiff argues that had he claimed accidental disability, he would have been awarded 25 percent more than he received by claiming ordinary disability. -8- governmental employee’s actions clearly are ultra vires. See Romano v. Retirement Board of the Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island, 767 A.2d 35, 39-40 (R.I. 2001) (noting that estoppel does not apply when governmental officers act in conflict with state law); Technology Investors v. Town of Westerly, 689 A.2d 1060, 1062 (R.I. 1997) (refusing to apply estoppel when municipality enacted an ordinance in clear contravention of state law). In the case at bar, it is our opinion that because Reilly’s comments were both erroneous and ultra vires, plaintiff cannot prevail on his claim of equitable estoppel. The situation here is very similar to that of Romano. In that case, the plaintiff retired from the Department of Transportation based on an incentive package offered by the state. Romano, 767 A.2d at 36. However, before retiring, plaintiff asked a retirement counselor if there would be any restrictions concerning his retirement benefits if, upon retirement, he began working for the Town of Bristol. Id. The counselor told plaintiff that she did not know of any restrictions, but that, if he wanted to make sure, he should ask the retirement board. Id. Additionally, Bristol’s town administrator spoke to the then- executive director of the retirement system about plaintiff’s situation; the executive director told the town administrator that there were no restrictions. Id. Almost simultaneously, plaintiff retired from the DOT and started his new job; eventually, the retirement board realized that plaintiff was collecting a pension while employed by a municipality that was a member of the retirement system, a situation sometimes referred to as “double-dipping.” Id. at 37. The defendants notified plaintiff that his pension benefits were going to be canceled. Id. -9- We held then, as we do now, that plaintiff’s estoppel claim must fail. The statements made by the retirement system employees were not within their authority to make because they contradicted state law. Romano, 767 A.2d at 38 (noting that the applicable statute required that “‘[p]ension payments shall be suspended’ (emphasis added) whenever any state retiree is reemployed by a municipality”) (quoting § 36-10- 36). In our opinion, Reilly lacked either actual or implied authority to waive, modify, or ignore applicable state law that conflicted with his statements to plaintiff’s counsel. The record discloses that, as the assistant executive director of the Employees Retirement System of Rhode Island, Reilly’s duties at the time included overseeing the retirement system’s operation and taking orders from the executive director; he was neither a member of the retirement board, nor was he an advisor. Although he admitted that he told plaintiff’s attorney § 28-33-25.1 did not fall within the scope of § 36-10-31, this error does not alter the fact that he had no authority to make binding representations about statutory construction. Additionally, an estoppel claim requires two elements: “first, an affirmative representation * * * on the part of the person against whom the estoppel is claimed which is directed to another for the purpose of inducing the other to act or fail to act in reliance thereon; and secondly, that such representation or conduct in fact did induce the other to act or fail to act to his injury.” Providence Teachers Union v. Providence School Board, 689 A.2d 388, 391-92 (R.I. 1997). See also El Marocco Club, Inc. v. Richardson, 746 A.2d 1228, 1233 (R.I. 2000). Furthermore, “[t]he key element of an estoppel is intentionally induced prejudicial - 10 - reliance.” El Marocco Club, 746 A.2d at 1234 (quoting East Greenwich Yacht Club v. Coastal Resources Management Council, 118 R.I. 559, 568, 376 A.2d 682, 686 (1977)). There is nothing in the record to suggest that Reilly made his statement with the purpose of inducing plaintiff to act in reliance on the representation. The plaintiff’s counsel asked Reilly a question and Reilly answered it, albeit erroneously. This does not constitute conduct on Reilly’s part indicating that he deliberately induced plaintiff into believing that the settlement would not be offset against the disability payments when state law clearly specifies otherwise. Resurrection Finally, the plaintiff argues that this Court should allow him to resurrect his workers’ compensation claim and accidental disability pension claim because he forfeited them because of Reilly’s statements. The plaintiff admits that the Superior Court never addressed this issue. After careful review of the record in this case, the only reference to this claim is found in the last sentence of the plaintiff’s memorandum supporting summary judgment. The plaintiff did not request this relief in his complaint, nor did he present this argument to the hearing justice. Further, the plaintiff failed to cite any applicable caselaw or statutory support for this claim. According to our oft-repeated “raise or waive” rule, we will not address an issue that was not presented to the trial court. State v. Swindell, 895 A.2d 100, 105 (R.I. 2006). Additionally, this Court will not consider issues that were not preserved by sufficiently focusing the trial justice’s attention on the matter. See State v. Wiggins, 919 A.2d 987, 990 (R.I. 2007); see also State v. Ibrahim, 862 A.2d 787, 797 (R.I. 2004) (recognizing that merely mentioning an - 11 - issue during trial is not sufficient to preserve the issue under the “raise or waive” doctrine); State v. Morris, 744 A.2d 850, 859 (R.I. 2000). Conclusion For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants. The record may be remanded to the Superior Court. - 12 - Supreme Court No. 2007-312-Appeal.

The Superior Court granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment during a May 2007 hearing, and this timely appealed ensued.', 'Standard of Review', 'It is well established that this Court uses a de novo standard to review a hearing justice’s decision to grant summary judgment.

The plaintiff contends that payments made under § 28-33-25.1 are not settlements under the Workers’ Compensation Act as contemplated by that statute.8 The hearing justice disagreed with plaintiff – correctly, we conclude.', 'Section 28-33-25.1 provides in pertinent part:', '“[I]n cases where liability of the employer for payment of', 'workers’ compensation benefits has not been finally', 'established, the parties may submit a settlement proposal to', 'the workers’ compensation court for approval.

Payment', 'by the employer or insurer shall not be deemed to be the', 'payment of workers’ compensation benefits, but shall be', 'considered a compromise payment of a disputed claim.” The plaintiff contends that, because § 28-33-25.1 provides that settlements made under the statute “shall not be deemed to be the payment of workers’ compensation benefits,” such settlements are not within the reach of § 36-10-31. Mindful that this Court is the final arbiter on questions of statutory construction, we are of the opinion that settlements pursuant to § 28-33-25.1 are included among the payments contemplated by § 36-10-31.

See G.L. 1956 § 28-29-1 (noting “Chapters 29—38 of this title may be cited as the ‘Workers’ Compensation Act’”). Additionally, this Court previously has recognized that § 28-33-25.1 is a part of this state’s workers’ compensation law. See Manzi v. State, 687 A.2d 461, 462 (R.I. 1997) (mem.) (opining that the workers’ compensation exclusivity clause is triggered by a workers’ compensation settlement under § 28-33-25.1). Although plaintiff suggests otherwise, the offset required by § 36- 10-31 simply is not limited to traditional workers’ compensation benefits.', 'If the Legislature wanted to so limit the offsets, it could have done so when it enacted the statute; however, the broader terminology of the enactment embraces, “any workers’ compensation law.” (Emphasis added.)', 'This leads us to conclude that settlement payments made pursuant to § 28-33-25.1 are payable under the state’s workers’ compensation scheme.', 'We are of the opinion that the Legislature used this broad language to ensure that money received under any workers’ compensation claim is offset against disability retirement payments to prevent a state employee from recovering twice.

The record reflects that in the spring of 2000 plaintiff’s attorney spoke with Reilly and asked him whether § 36-10-31 would apply to a potential workers’ compensation settlement under § 28-33-25.1.', 'Reilly indicated that because money received from a § 28-33-25.1 settlement was not workers’ compensation benefits or payments, the offset of § 36-10-31 would not apply.

The situation here is very similar to that of Romano. In that case, the plaintiff retired from the Department of Transportation based on an incentive package offered by the state. Romano, 767 A.2d at 36. However, before retiring, plaintiff asked a retirement counselor if there would be any restrictions concerning his retirement benefits if, upon retirement, he began working for the Town of Bristol. Id. The counselor told plaintiff that she did not know of any restrictions, but that, if he wanted to make sure, he should ask the retirement board. Id. Additionally, Bristol’s town administrator spoke to the then- executive director of the retirement system about plaintiff’s situation; the executive director told the town administrator that there were no restrictions.

86,"State : v. : Timothy Scanlon. : Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty, Robinson, JJ., and Williams, C.J. (ret.). OPINION I Justice Flaherty, for the Court. Sometime after midnight on March 2, 2003, Janet S.1 left Buddy’s, a bar in Woonsocket. Janet, an admitted drug addict and prostitute, had spent most of the previous afternoon and evening consuming drugs, including cocaine, as well as a prodigious amount of alcohol.2 She was, in her own words, “wasted” and having trouble walking. Despite her condition, Janet was on her way home to meet one of her drug suppliers, from whom she intended to procure a “seventy piece,” an amount of cocaine that costs $70.3 1 We identify the complaining witness by pseudonym to protect her privacy. 2 In addition to the alcohol she consumed during the day, Janet testified that she drank three or four pitchers of beer at Buddy’s over a four-to-five hour period. 3 Besides using alcohol and illicit drugs, Janet testified that she ingested an impressive array of prescription drugs, including: Depro, Catrinal, Stellco, Zoloft, Lipitor, Morpass, Puridipass, Lantiss, and Flexor; she did not specify the dosages. Doctor Daniel Asiedu’s medical record of his physical examination of Janet on, March 2, 2003, lists her medications as Effexor, Seroquel, Cardizem, Paxil, and nitroglycerin; all with unknown doses. -1- As Janet made her way along Arnold Street, a vehicle, possibly a Jeep Cherokee or a Ford Bronco, slowed to the curb and a man asked her if she “wanted to party.” Janet understood that to mean that she would have sex with the man for money, or use drugs with him, or both, and so she got into the truck. Once inside, she and the driver quickly agreed that she would provide him with sexual services in exchange for $40. Although she did not initially recognize the driver, Janet later remembered that about two months before March 2, 2003, she had been hired for sex by the same man in exchange for $40. Also, Janet remembered that although the driver drove the same truck on that earlier occasion, she said the vehicle’s color had been changed. She was, however, unable to recall whether the vehicle was red or gray on March 2, 2003. After Janet got into the vehicle, the driver proceeded to the Sovereign Bank on Social Street in Woonsocket where he withdrew $100 from the automatic teller machine (ATM). Once the couple left the Sovereign Bank, however, Janet’s fortunes took a decided turn for the worse. Because she suddenly felt “weird” and desired to just go home, Janet asked the driver to drive her to her home rather than party. She directed the driver to take a left toward Providence Street. Instead, however, the driver took a sharp right toward Blackstone Street, and he suddenly became enraged at Janet. Just as suddenly, the driver began to stab Janet with a screwdriver in the head, face, and neck. As he assaulted her, the driver pressed Janet’s head to the seat and yelled at her to “shut up you whore you,” also calling her a “no good crack head whore.” Eventually the assailant brought the truck to a stop among several abandoned mills in northwestern Woonsocket. He continued to persistently prod the screwdriver into Janet’s head, face, and neck—which were now bleeding profusely—and he ordered her to remove the money -2- from her pocket. Janet complied. Next, the driver ordered Janet to remove her clothing. She took everything off except her socks. The driver penetrated Janet digitally, all the while berating and threatening her. Eventually the driver ceased these actions, reached across Janet to open the passenger’s door, and then literally kicked her out of the truck into the cold, snowy March night, wearing nothing but her socks. Unfortunately, this was not the end of Janet’s troubles that night because the driver followed her out of the truck. Although she struggled to resist her assailant, the man threw Janet down on the ground and sexually assaulted her again. Then, the assailant dragged her over to the truck and forced Janet to get on her knees in the snow and perform oral sex on him. Throughout this entire encounter, the driver continued to punch Janet with his fists. He also pulled the hair out of her scalp, and repeatedly stabbed her with the screwdriver. Finally, the attacker grabbed her right arm, yanking it back with enough force so that she could feel her shoulder snap. The assailant turned a deaf ear to Janet’s pleas to return at least some of her clothes as a protection against the cold and snow. After threatening to kill her if she talked to the police, he left the scene. Janet crawled into the middle of the road, where a passing motorist saw her and called the police. Officer George McMann of the Woonsocket Police Department arrived in the mill area between 2 a.m. and 2:20 a.m. to find Janet bleeding and sitting naked in the middle of Singleton Street. Janet told the officer that she had been raped and battered. Janet was taken by rescue to Landmark Medical Center emergency room. Daniel Asiedu, M.D., conducted a physical examination of Janet on March 2, 2003. He noted that Janet had “bruises and bleeding on the center of her scalp” and “lacerations and marks on her right cheek and her right side of her neck,” along with bruising of her knees and shins. The doctor’s -3- examination also revealed that her right arm was dislocated from her shoulder, requiring pain medication and the use of a sling. Although she initially was reluctant to do so, Janet made a statement to police shortly after she arrived at the hospital. In her statement, Janet said the driver sexually assaulted her by forcing her to perform oral sex and by forcibly penetrating her digitally. Significantly, however, she said she never had vaginal intercourse with her assailant.4 As to the identity of her assailant, on March 2, 2003, Janet told the officers that the driver was a blond white male. Initially, she did not remember that the driver had stopped at the Sovereign Bank ATM on Social Street. When the officers suggested the driver could be a John T.,5 Janet responded affirmatively that he was the one who committed the sexual assaults against her. In her later testimony, Janet admitted that she first told the officers that John had assaulted her because she thought it was he, and that she “just wanted it over.” But, when the officers later showed Janet a photo array containing John’s photograph, Janet did not identify him. Instead, she told the officers that she had been attacked by a younger, heavier man who did not wear glasses. It was not until April 2003 that Janet remembered that her attacker had stopped at the Sovereign Bank on Social Street and that he had withdrawn $100. She then realized that the bank surveillance camera may have photographed him as he withdrew his money. She notified the police, who quickly learned that a withdrawal had been made at 12:55 a.m. on March 2, 4 According to Dr. Asiedu’s record of examination of Janet, her account of the assault differed somewhat from her initial statement to the police. According to his record, Janet performed oral sex on her attacker in exchange for money. Then, the man became violent after he demanded vaginal intercourse and she refused. She said that the driver responded by stabbing her with the screwdriver. 5 We also identify this individual by pseudonym to protect his privacy. -4- 2003, from the Sovereign Bank ATM from an account linked to defendant, Timothy Scanlon. A photo of the individual making the withdrawal was obtained and that photograph was included in a new photo array shown to Janet. After reviewing the array, Janet instantly picked out defendant, Timothy Scanlon, as the man who sexually assaulted her. On April 15, 2003, Mr. Scanlon was arrested. He spoke with police, and denied that he attacked Janet. The defendant volunteered to provide a sample of his DNA; a later analysis proved that his DNA matched that extracted from Janet by anal and vaginal swabs. Further investigation by the police revealed that on April 10, 2003, Mr. Scanlon sold a 1988 GMC Jimmy to Dennis Fleurant of Privilege Auto Parts in Woonsocket for use as scrap metal. Mr. Fleurant described the vehicle as gray or silver, with some blue. When the police seized the 1988 GMC Jimmy, however, it was determined that the vehicle’s original paint color had been red (because the door jams and the hood’s interior were red), but that the truck had been repainted gray or silver. In April or May 2003 Lieutenant Timothy Paul, who then worked for the Woonsocket Bureau of Criminal Investigations, conducted a forensic analysis of the vehicle. Lieutenant Paul took photographs and administered a “luminol test” of the vehicle’s interior.6 The results of the luminol testing were negative; no traces of blood were found in the vehicle. A grand jury returned a ten-count indictment against Timothy Scanlon.7 Counts 1, 2, and 3 alleged that Timothy Scanlon violated G.L. 1956 §§ 11-37-2 and 11-37-3 by committing 6 Luminol is a substance that reacts to the chemicals in blood. If there is blood on the tested surface, such as the vehicle’s interior, the luminol will appear fluorescent and glow in total darkness. If there is no blood on the tested surface, the luminol will not glow. 7 Counts 7, 8, 9, and 10 alleged the kidnapping and assault with a dangerous weapon on a separate victim. The Attorney General dismissed counts 7 through 10 based on Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. A different person confessed to committing these offenses. -5- first-degree sexual assault against Janet. Count 4 alleged that Timothy Scanlon committed first degree robbery against Janet in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-39-1(a). Count 5 charged Timothy Scanlon with assaulting Janet with a dangerous weapon in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2. Count 6 alleged that Timothy Scanlon committed an assault and battery on Janet that resulted in serious bodily injury, also in violation of § 11-5-2. At trial the state offered testimony from Janet, Officer George McMann, Lt. Timothy Paul, Det. Todd Fernandes, salvage yard owner Dennis Fleurant, and Sharon Elizabeth Mallard, an analyst with the Rhode Island Department of Health. The defense offered testimony from Dr. Daniel Asiedu, Gale Lescarbeau (defendant’s mother), Roxanne Pare (the mother of defendant’s two children),8 and Charlotte Hopejoy Danis (a nurse at Landmark Medical Center). The trial justice granted the state’s motion in limine to exclude the testimony of proposed defense witness Richard Miles, Janet’s boyfriend at the time the crimes were committed. On July 28, 2005, a jury found Timothy Scanlon guilty on all remaining counts of the indictment that had been submitted to them. On September 28, 2005, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial. On November 25, 2005, the trial justice sentenced Timothy Scanlon to serve fifty years concurrently on counts 1, 2, 3, and 4 and a suspended sentence of twenty years with twenty years probation on counts 5 and 6, to be served consecutively to counts 1, 2, 3, and 4. The defendant timely appealed to this Court. On appeal, defendant asserts first, that the trial justice committed reversible error when he granted the prosecution’s motion in limine to exclude the testimony of Richard Miles. Second, defendant says that he was entitled to judgment of acquittal on count 6, felony assault. 8 Ms. Pare testified that defendant called her at 1:20 a.m. on March 2, 2003, and then came over to her home in Woonsocket shortly afterward. She also testified that defendant admitted to her, after his arrest for the sexual assaults on Janet, that he had a sexual encounter with Janet on March 2, 2003, but that he denied that he sexually assaulted her. -6- Third, defendant argues that he cannot be convicted on both counts 5 and 6, because these counts merged into a single count under double-jeopardy principles, and the trial justice erred in ruling otherwise. Fourth, defendant maintains that he is entitled to a new trial because the late disclosure of evidence by the prosecution constituted a violation of his due-process rights. We affirm the judgments of conviction. II A Exclusion of Richard Miles’s Testimony When she was cross-examined after being offered as a witness by the state, Janet testified that she spent the afternoon preceding her attack ingesting cocaine with her boyfriend, Richard Miles, just before Miles was to report to the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI) to begin serving a sentence. The defense then proffered that Miles would testify that he already was incarcerated on the morning of March 1, 2003, and that it therefore was not possible that Janet had shared cocaine with Miles later that day. In response, the state moved in limine, before defendant called his first witness, to exclude Richard Miles’s testimony, arguing that Rule 608(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence precluded the admissibility of Miles’s testimony because the proposed testimony was collateral to the central issues in the case and was offered solely to impeach Janet’s testimony through extrinsic evidence. Rule 608(b) states in relevant part “[s]pecific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness’ credibility * * * may not be proved by extrinsic evidence.”9 The state maintained that the identity of the person with 9 Rule 608(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence provides: “Specific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness’ credibility, other than -7- whom Janet used cocaine at 3 p.m. on March 1, 2003, was not material evidence as to who assaulted her in the early morning of the next day. The defendant argued at trial that Richard Miles’s testimony was material and not collateral because it would suggest who the perpetrator was. The defendant implied that Janet lied about the person with whom she used cocaine in an effort to protect her attacker. The defendant also maintained that because evidence indicating who her attacker may have been was material to defendant’s guilt or innocence, Rule 608(b) should not apply. After hearing argument, the trial justice granted the motion in limine because he concluded that the testimony was collateral, and that extrinsic evidence may not be used to impeach a complaining witness. The trial justice ruled that the identity of Janet’s cocaine partner ten hours prior to the sexual assault was irrelevant to determining who perpetrated the assaults on her. Significantly, the trial justice emphasized that the complainant admitted to using cocaine and to being with other male customers after the cocaine use, but before she was assaulted. The trial justice reasoned that the break in time and the complainant’s interaction with multiple people after her cocaine use rendered the identity of her companion at 3 p.m. the preceding afternoon collateral to the issue of who attacked her in the early hours of the following morning. conviction of crime as provided in Rule 609, or, in the discretion of the trial judge, evidence of prior similar false accusations, may not be proved by extrinsic evidence. They may, however, in the discretion of the court, if probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness, be inquired into on cross-examination of the witness (1) concerning the witness’ character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, or (2) concerning the character for truthfulness or untruthfulness of another witness as to which character the witness being cross-examined has testified.” -8- On appeal, defendant renews his argument that the trial justice erred in granting the state’s motion in limine because Richard Miles’s testimony was material, not collateral, and therefore Rule 608(b) was not a basis for excluding this testimony.10 Standard of Review “When reviewing the grant or denial of a motion in limine, this Court will consider only whether the challenged evidence was proper and admissible and, if not, whether there was sufficient prejudice to constitute reversible error.” State v. Gomes, 881 A.2d 97, 111 (R.I. 2005). In light of this standard, this Court must determine whether Richard Miles’s proposed testimony that he was imprisoned on March 1, 2003, and therefore could not have used cocaine in Woonsocket at 3 p.m., as Janet testified, was proper and admissible at defendant’s criminal trial. If this Court were to conclude that the trial justice erred by excluding Richard Miles’s testimony, then we must determine whether the exclusion of this testimony was sufficiently prejudicial to warrant reversing the jury’s verdict. See Gomes, 881 A.2d at 111. Rule 608(b) The defendant argues that Richard Miles’s testimony was material and relevant, and therefore not barred by Rule 608(b), because it would focus the jury’s attention on the possibility that one of Janet’s companions that afternoon later may have attacked her, or, alternatively, that one of her several drug dealers may have assaulted her. 10 The defendant also raised, for the first time on appeal, an additional argument that the trial justice’s refusal to allow defendant to call Richard Miles to the stand denied him his Sixth Amendment right to present an effective defense. This Court will not address defendant’s contention that his Sixth Amendment right to present an effective defense was violated because this issue never was raised at trial and therefore is waived on appeal. See State v. Merida, 960 A.2d 228, 236 (R.I. 2008) (holding defendant’s Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause argument waived, and therefore not reviewable on appeal, because it never was presented at trial). Even if we were to consider defendant’s argument, it is axiomatic that a defendant has no right to introduce evidence that is inadmissible under our well-developed rules of evidence. -9- This Court has consistently held that “[a] witness may not be impeached on collateral matters by the introduction of extrinsic evidence. The cross-examiner is restricted to the answers of the witness.” State v. Martinez, 824 A.2d 443, 449 (R.I. 2003) (quoting State v. Tutt, 622 A.2d 459, 462 (R.I. 1993) and State v. Brown, 574 A.2d 745, 749 (R.I. 1990)). Evidence is not collateral if the evidence is admissible for a reason other than to contradict the witness’s testimony. Id. (citing State v. Souza, 708 A.2d 899, 904 (R.I. 1998)). In Martinez, this Court held that proffered testimony concerning what occurred several hours before a sexual assault occurred, that was unrelated to the sexual assault at issue, was collateral because the testimony’s “sole purpose was to impeach [the complainant] on collateral matters.” Martinez, 824 A.2d at 449. When a criminal defendant accuses someone else of committing the crime with which he is charged, the defendant must make some reasonably specific offer of proof as to who the perpetrator might be. Gomes, 881 A.2d at 111 (citing State v. Gazerro, 420 A.2d 816, 824-25 (R.I. 1980)). Absent such an offer of proof, this evidence could constitute “an impermissible invitation to the jury to speculate on a collateral matter.” Id. at 112 (quoting Gazerro, 420 A.2d at 825). In Gomes, the state filed a motion in limine to exclude a police report, prepared one month before the victim’s murder, in which the victim alleged that her former boyfriend was harassing her. Id. at 109-10. The defendant, who was not the former boyfriend, wanted the police report admitted to show that the former boyfriend had a motive to murder the victim. Id. at 111. We affirmed the trial justice’s grant of the motion in limine, in part because the defendant failed to provide any evidence that would demonstrate that the former boyfriend murdered the victim, or that this person was even in the area where the murder occurred. Id. at 111-12. - 10 - Here, the proffered testimony of Richard Miles could be used only to impeach Janet’s credibility on a collateral issue. We are not persuaded by defendant’s argument that the identity of the person with whom Janet used drugs at 3 p.m. on March 1, 2003, sheds any light on the issue of defendant’s guilt or innocence. Scanlon’s suggestion about who else may have committed the crime is demonstrably thinner than that in Gomes. The defendant does not imply that any particular individual may have committed these crimes, other than unnamed drug dealers, nor does he advance any theory as to why someone else would have assaulted Janet. In our opinion, Rule 608(b) barred defendant’s use of Richard Miles’s testimony to impeach Janet’s recollection of the identity of her cocaine-using partner. Therefore, the trial justice did not err when he granted the state’s motion in limine.11 B Felony Assault Conviction The defendant raises two challenges with respect to his conviction for felony assault based upon the dislocation of Janet’s shoulder. First, he argues that his motion for judgment of acquittal pursuant to Rule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure should have been granted because, as a matter of law, the injury to Janet’s shoulder fails to satisfy § 11-5- 2(c)(2)’s requirement that the bodily injury involve a “protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily part, member or organ.” Second, defendant argues that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution and of article 1, section 7, of the Rhode Island Constitution bar his convictions for both count 5 (felony assault—assault with a dangerous 11 We continue to cast a jaundiced eye to the overuse of motions in limine. See State v. Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 563-64, 563 n.1 (R.I. 2009) (“admonish[ing] the state to wield its in limine sword carefully” to preserve defendant’s constitutional safeguards). - 11 - weapon) and count 6 (felony assault—assault or battery resulting in serious bodily injury). We conclude, however, that defendant failed to preserve either argument for appeal. 1 Rule 29 Motion for Judgment of Acquittal As we have said on numerous occasions, to preserve a right to appeal the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal under Rule 29 made at the close of the state’s case, a defendant must renew the motion after he presents his own case. See State v. Andreozzi, 798 A.2d 372, 374 (R.I. 2002). Although defendant appropriately moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the state’s case, he failed to renew his motion after he called his own witnesses. Consequently, defendant’s failure to renew his motion for judgment of acquittal forecloses his right to seek review of the trial justice’s denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal. Id.12 Yet, even if defendant had preserved his right to appeal the denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal, we nonetheless would agree with the trial justice’s adverse ruling. The defendant argues that he was entitled to a judgment of acquittal on count 6, felony assault in violation of § 11-5-2, because the injuries to Janet’s arm and shoulder did not rise to the level of severity necessary to support a conviction. Section 11-5-2(c) defines a “serious bodily injury” as a: 12 The waiver of a right to appeal a denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal pursuant to Rule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure does not operate as a waiver of the right to appeal the denial of a motion for new trial if the motion for a new trial is premised upon an insufficient evidence of guilt claim. See State v. Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 568-69 (R.I. 2009); State v. Colbert, 549 A.2d 1021, 1023 (R.I. 1988) (determining the defendant did not waive right to have sufficiency of evidence reviewed in motion for new trial even though the defendant failed to renew motion for acquittal). No such motion is made here because defendant failed to properly raise, either in Superior Court or in this Court on appeal, that the evidence was insufficient to convict him. - 12 - “physical injury that: (1) [c]reates a substantial risk of death; (2) [c]auses protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily part, member or organ; or (3) [c]auses serious permanent disfigurement or circumcises, excises or infibulates the whole or any part of the labia majora or labia minora or clitoris of a person.” The defendant argues that Janet’s dislocated right arm, for which she was required to use a sling for six weeks, along with pain medications, is insufficient to constitute a “protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily part” under the statute. Recently, in State v. Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 573 (R.I. 2009), we were asked to determine what constitutes a serious permanent disfigurement under subsection (c)(3) of the definition of serious bodily injury in § 11-5-2. In that case, we held that the question of “[w]hether the injuries inflicted * * * were serious and disfiguring were factual matters for the jury’s consideration.” Clark, 974 A.2d at 573. It is similarly our opinion that what constitutes a “protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily part, member or organ” under subsection (c)(2) of 11-5-2 is a factual matter left for the jury’s determination. The jury instructions appropriately required the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt “that the defendant assaulted [Janet] and that in doing so he seriously injured her shoulder area such that she lost the functional use of her shoulder or arm for a protracted period of time, that is to say a prolonged or extended period of time.” The defendant never objected to this jury instruction. The jury heard evidence from Janet that she felt her shoulder break when defendant grabbed her arm and that it was necessary for her to wear a sling for six weeks and take pain medications. Further, Dr. Asiedu testified that Janet suffered a dislocation of her right arm. Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the state, there is no question that Janet’s injury cleared the statutory hurdle and properly was submitted to the jury. 2 - 13 - Merger of Counts 5 and 6 Although we also are satisfied that whether count 6 (felony assault—assault or battery resulting in serious bodily injury) merged with count 5 (felony assault—assault with a dangerous weapon), therefore implicating the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions was not preserved, we nonetheless address this argument. We have held that a defense based upon double jeopardy must be raised in a pretrial motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(2) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. See State v. Day, 925 A.2d 962, 977 (R.I. 2007). Rule 12(b)(2) provides that “[t]he defense of double jeopardy * * * may be raised only by motion before trial.” See also Day, 925 A.2d at 977; State v. Grayhurst, 852 A.2d 491, 500 (R.I. 2004). Rule 12(b)(2) further states that “[f]ailure to present any such defense or objection as herein provided constitutes a waiver thereof, but the court for cause shown may grant relief from the waiver.” See also State v. McGuy, 841 A.2d 1109, 1115 (R.I. 2003) (stressing defendant needs to demonstrate “some compelling reason to grant relief from the waiver sanction of Rule 12(b)(2)”).13 In this case, defendant did not file a Rule 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss. Therefore, defendant is barred from raising double jeopardy as a defense unless he can demonstrate some extraordinary justification for not doing so earlier. On the other hand, defendant’s trial occurred in 2005, almost two years before the Day decision made the law explicitly clear. Cf Day, 925 A.2d at 977 (holding that cause existed in part because of murkiness in the case law on this issue). Further, although no motion was filed under Rule 12, the trial justice nonetheless 13 In State v. Day, 925 A.2d 962, 977 (R.I. 2007), we determined that cause existed because this Court previously had not “focused with maximal explicitness on the necessity of bringing a merger argument to the attention of the trial court through a pretrial [Super.R.Crim.P.] 12(b)(2) motion” and because the trial justice dealt with the merger issue when considering the defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal. - 14 - entertained argument on this issue when he heard defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal and he ruled on the issue. Under all the circumstances present here, it is our opinion that defendant’s double-jeopardy claim, although not properly raised, should be considered by this Court. To determine whether a criminal defendant is imperiled by double jeopardy, this Court applies the “same evidence” test first pronounced in Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299 (1932). See State v. Davis, 120 R.I. 82, 86, 384 A.2d 1061, 1064 (1978) (acknowledging adoption of Blockburger test). Under the same-evidence test, “where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.” Davis, 120 R.I. at 86, 384 A.2d at 1064 (quoting Blockburger, 284 U.S. at 304); see also State v. Bolarinho, 850 A.2d 907, 909 (R.I. 2004). This is not the first time that we have addressed the issue of whether multiple assault convictions merged after a double-jeopardy analysis. In Bolarinho, 850 A.2d at 911, the defendant, in a single incident, repeatedly kicked the complainant. From this single occurrence, the defendant was charged with two counts of felony assault in violation of § 11-5-2; one count for committing a felony assault by use of a dangerous weapon, to wit a shod foot, and one count for committing a felony assault that resulted in serious bodily injury. Bolarinho, 850 A.2d at 908-09. We considered whether “a conviction for both assault with a dangerous weapon and assault resulting in serious bodily injury resulting from the same transaction may stand.” Id. at 911. The Court held that when the evidence used to convict the defendant of assault with a dangerous weapon and assault resulting in serious bodily injury is identical, the counts merge under a double-jeopardy analysis. Id. - 15 - Alternatively, in State v. Haney, 842 A.2d 1083, 1084-85 (R.I. 2004), we considered whether a defendant’s two domestic-assault convictions on the same complainant on the same night could withstand scrutiny under a double-jeopardy analysis. The incidents were separated by fifteen minutes, and one assault occurred in Burrillville while the other assault occurred in Glocester. Id. The defendant argued that, because he and the complainant were together in a car throughout the entire fifteen-minute interval between assaults, both were part of a continuing transaction. Id. at 1085. We rejected the defendant’s double-jeopardy argument because the acts underlying the two convictions were separate acts. Id. The victim was identical, but the assaults occurred at different times and in different towns, and the defendant had “sufficient opportunity to reflect on his assaultive conduct and to forbear from committing another crime” before he committed the second assault. Id. Applying the Blockburger “same-evidence” test to the case before us, we first consider whether the facts underlying counts 5 and 6 constitute the “same act or transaction.” Davis, 120 R.I. at 86, 384 A.2d at 1064 (quoting Blockburger, 284 U.S. at 304). Count 5 alleged that defendant assaulted the complainant with a screwdriver, a dangerous weapon. Conversely, count 6 alleged that defendant committed a felony assault on the complainant by later grabbing her arm and dislocating it. On their face, the facts alleged in each count do not constitute the “same act or transaction,” because each assault arises from a different act. Nothing in the record indicates that the use of the screwdriver caused the complainant’s right arm to dislocate. Unlike in Bolarinho, in which the same evidence of kicking the victim was used to support both an assault with a dangerous weapon and an assault resulting in serious bodily injury, here the two counts are supported by different evidence. See Bolarinho, 850 A.2d at 911. Therefore, the trial justice - 16 - was correct when he ruled that counts 5 and 6 did not merge and did not violate defendant’s constitutional protection against being placed into double jeopardy. C Motion for New Trial In his motion for a new trial before the trial justice, and now on appeal, defendant advances two theories of relief. First, he says that the evidence introduced at his trial was not sufficient to support a conviction. Second, defendant claims that he is entitled to a new trial because the state twice violated its discovery obligations by failing to disclose, until the eve of trial, evidence that was critical to his defense. Therefore, he says, he was denied an “ample and sufficient opportunity to establish the best and fullest defense available to him.” State v. Scurry, 636 A.2d 719, 725 (R.I. 1994). Standard of Review We review a trial justice’s decision on a motion for a new trial with deference. See State v. Flori, 963 A.2d 932, 937 (R.I. 2009). If the trial justice communicates a passable rationale for his decision, his ruling “is entitled to great weight.” Id. (quoting State v. Bergevine, 942 A.2d 974, 981 (R.I. 2008)). We will not overturn the trial justice’s denial of a motion for new trial “unless the trial justice was clearly wrong or * * * overlooked or misconceived material and relevant evidence that related to a critical issue in the case.” Id. After carefully reviewing the record in this case, we conclude that neither of defendant’s arguments have merit and that the trial justice was correct when he denied the motion. We address each argument individually. 1 Claim of Innocence - 17 - The trial justice clearly articulated his rationale when he denied the motion for a new trial. He said that he did not disagree with the jury’s finding of guilt on all six counts. Reviewing the testimony, the complainant’s injuries, and her medical records, the trial justice ruled that the assaults had occurred just as she said they did. Despite the conflicts between Janet’s earlier statements to the police and medical personnel and her trial testimony, he nonetheless found her to be a credible witness. Further, the trial justice said that he understood why the jury would discount the testimony of Roxanne Pare, defendant’s former girlfriend and the mother of his two children, with respect to the 1:20 a.m. phone call and subsequent visit by defendant. Finally, the trial justice stated “the credible evidence fairly and beyond a reasonable doubt pointed to this defendant, Tim Scanlon, as the man who abused [Janet].” The trial justice’s decision on the motion for a new trial is not clearly wrong, nor did he overlook material evidence. See Flori, 963 A.2d at 937. We agree with his decision and will not disturb it. 2 Discovery Violations The defendant argues that two issues, the late disclosure of the complainant’s delayed memory of sexual intercourse with her attacker, and the tardy notice on Lt. Paul’s forensic examination of the 1988 GMC Jimmy, warrant a new trial in the interests of justice. The defendant contends that he was denied “ample and sufficient opportunity to establish the best and fullest defense available to him.” As a threshold matter, the state argues that defendant has failed to preserve his right to appeal the two alleged discovery violations because he failed to seasonably object to the introduction of this testimony. The state argues that, even though Rule 33 of the Superior Court - 18 - Rules of Criminal Procedure permits a court to order a new trial “in the interest of justice,” it does not remove the burden from defendant to contemporaneously object at trial.14 First we consider the state’s contention that defendant waived his right to appeal the late disclosure of both Janet’s recovered memory and Lt. Paul’s forensic examination of the 1988 GMC Jimmy. The state is correct that defendant never objected to the complainant’s recovered memory, either when it was first disclosed to him, or when Janet was on the witness stand. Likewise, defendant never objected to the state’s calling of Lt. Paul to testify about the processing of the 1988 GMC Jimmy with luminol.15 The defendant’s only objection on the record occurred when Lt. Paul testified regarding false positive results from luminol testing.16 14 The Committee Notes for the 2002 Amendment to Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure state that “[i]t is not intended nor anticipated that the ability to raise an error of law on a motion for new trial will change the * * * harmless error, plain error, and contemporaneous objection rules generally applicable to trials.” 15 At trial, Lt. Paul testified that luminol testing can result in false positives in which the luminol test is positive but not as a result of blood. For example, some cleaning products may result in a false positive. Lieutenant Paul also testified that no hair or fibers that would connect the truck to Janet were found in the vehicle. After completing his forensic examination, Lt. Paul determined that nothing was found in the truck that should be sent to the state crime lab for further testing. The state did not disclose Lt. Paul’s examination of the vehicle or its negative results until just before the trial began. 16 The record of defendant’s objection is as follows: “[Prosecutor]: What do you mean by that? “[Lieutenant Paul]: What I mean by that is luminal [ sic ] will react with certain cleaning based product cleansers. Seeing the vehicle was crushed in a pile of other vehicles, we were getting many pieces of things that fluoresce without a positive reaction for being a pool of blood or for what we were looking for any kind of evidentiary value. “[Prosecutor]: But if there is blood in the car at one point and then cleaned it would be a false positive? “[Defense Counsel]: Objection. “[Lieutenant Paul]: It’s possible, I believe. “[Court]: I’ll permit. “[Prosecutor]: Sorry. I didn’t hear your answer. “[Lieutenant Paul]: It’s possible.” - 19 - The defendant never requested a continuance so that he could evaluate or prepare for the tardily provided material. When defendant raised his alleged discovery violations arguments before the trial justice in defendant’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice noted in his ruling that defendant “did not object * * * during the course of the trial.” This Court has held that a “defendant may not press * * * objections [on appeal] when they were available for him to raise before or at the trial, yet he neglected to do so.” Cronan ex rel. State v. Cronan, 774 A.2d 866, 879 (R.I. 2001) (citing State v. Anderson, 752 A.2d 946, 948 (R.I. 2000)). In State v. Crudup, 842 A.2d 1069, 1073 (R.I. 2004), we held that even a due process argument is waived for appeal if defendant had an opportunity to raise this argument in a hearing but failed to do so. After a careful review of the record in this case, we hold that the defendant was precluded from raising a claim in his motion for a new trial, and here on appeal, that the late discovery of Janet’s recovered memory and Lt. Paul’s testing of the 1988 GMC Jimmy prejudiced him because he failed to object either at the time this evidence was disclosed to him or introduced at trial. III Conclusion For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgments of convictions in this case. The record shall be returned to the Superior Court.",criminal,affirm,"['I', 'Justice Flaherty, for the Court. Sometime after midnight on March 2, 2003, Janet S.1 left Buddy’s, a bar in Woonsocket. Janet, an admitted drug addict and prostitute, had spent most of the previous afternoon and evening consuming drugs, including cocaine, as well as a prodigious amount of alcohol.2 She was, in her own words, “wasted” and having trouble walking. Despite her condition, Janet was on her way home to meet one of her drug suppliers, from whom she intended to procure a “seventy piece,” an amount of cocaine that costs $70.3 1', 'We identify the complaining witness by pseudonym to protect her privacy. 2', 'In addition to the alcohol she consumed during the day, Janet testified that she drank three or four pitchers of beer at Buddy’s over a four-to-five hour period. 3', 'Besides using alcohol and illicit drugs, Janet testified that she ingested an impressive array of prescription drugs, including: Depro, Catrinal, Stellco, Zoloft, Lipitor, Morpass, Puridipass, Lantiss, and Flexor; she did not specify the dosages. Doctor Daniel Asiedu’s medical record of his physical examination of Janet on, March 2, 2003, lists her medications as Effexor, Seroquel, Cardizem, Paxil, and nitroglycerin; all with unknown doses.', '-1-', 'As Janet made her way along Arnold Street, a vehicle, possibly a Jeep Cherokee or a Ford Bronco, slowed to the curb and a man asked her if she “wanted to party.” Janet understood that to mean that she would have sex with the man for money, or use drugs with him, or both, and so she got into the truck. Once inside, she and the driver quickly agreed that she would provide him with sexual services in exchange for $40. Although she did not initially recognize the driver, Janet later remembered that about two months before March 2, 2003, she had been hired for sex by the same man in exchange for $40. Also, Janet remembered that although the driver drove the same truck on that earlier occasion, she said the vehicle’s color had been changed. She was, however, unable to recall whether the vehicle was red or gray on March 2, 2003. After Janet got into the vehicle, the driver proceeded to the Sovereign Bank on Social Street in Woonsocket where he withdrew $100 from the automatic teller machine (ATM).', 'Once the couple left the Sovereign Bank, however, Janet’s fortunes took a decided turn for the worse. Because she suddenly felt “weird” and desired to just go home, Janet asked the driver to drive her to her home rather than party. She directed the driver to take a left toward Providence Street. Instead, however, the driver took a sharp right toward Blackstone Street, and he suddenly became enraged at Janet. Just as suddenly, the driver began to stab Janet with a screwdriver in the head, face, and neck. As he assaulted her, the driver pressed Janet’s head to the seat and yelled at her to “shut up you whore you,” also calling her a “no good crack head whore.”', 'Eventually the assailant brought the truck to a stop among several abandoned mills in northwestern Woonsocket. He continued to persistently prod the screwdriver into Janet’s head, face, and neck—which were now bleeding profusely—and he ordered her to remove the money', '-2- from her pocket. Janet complied. Next, the driver ordered Janet to remove her clothing. She took everything off except her socks.', 'The driver penetrated Janet digitally, all the while berating and threatening her. Eventually the driver ceased these actions, reached across Janet to open the passenger’s door, and then literally kicked her out of the truck into the cold, snowy March night, wearing nothing but her socks.', 'Unfortunately, this was not the end of Janet’s troubles that night because the driver followed her out of the truck. Although she struggled to resist her assailant, the man threw Janet down on the ground and sexually assaulted her again. Then, the assailant dragged her over to the truck and forced Janet to get on her knees in the snow and perform oral sex on him. Throughout this entire encounter, the driver continued to punch Janet with his fists. He also pulled the hair out of her scalp, and repeatedly stabbed her with the screwdriver. Finally, the attacker grabbed her right arm, yanking it back with enough force so that she could feel her shoulder snap.', 'The assailant turned a deaf ear to Janet’s pleas to return at least some of her clothes as a protection against the cold and snow. After threatening to kill her if she talked to the police, he left the scene. Janet crawled into the middle of the road, where a passing motorist saw her and called the police. Officer George McMann of the Woonsocket Police Department arrived in the mill area between 2 a.m. and 2:20 a.m. to find Janet bleeding and sitting naked in the middle of Singleton Street. Janet told the officer that she had been raped and battered.', 'Janet was taken by rescue to Landmark Medical Center emergency room. Daniel Asiedu, M.D., conducted a physical examination of Janet on March 2, 2003. He noted that Janet had “bruises and bleeding on the center of her scalp” and “lacerations and marks on her right cheek and her right side of her neck,” along with bruising of her knees and shins. The doctor’s', '-3- examination also revealed that her right arm was dislocated from her shoulder, requiring pain medication and the use of a sling.', 'Although she initially was reluctant to do so, Janet made a statement to police shortly after she arrived at the hospital. In her statement, Janet said the driver sexually assaulted her by forcing her to perform oral sex and by forcibly penetrating her digitally. Significantly, however, she said she never had vaginal intercourse with her assailant.4', 'As to the identity of her assailant, on March 2, 2003, Janet told the officers that the driver was a blond white male. Initially, she did not remember that the driver had stopped at the Sovereign Bank ATM on Social Street. When the officers suggested the driver could be a John T.,5 Janet responded affirmatively that he was the one who committed the sexual assaults against her. In her later testimony, Janet admitted that she first told the officers that John had assaulted her because she thought it was he, and that she “just wanted it over.” But, when the officers later showed Janet a photo array containing John’s photograph, Janet did not identify him. Instead, she told the officers that she had been attacked by a younger, heavier man who did not wear glasses.', 'It was not until April 2003 that Janet remembered that her attacker had stopped at the Sovereign Bank on Social Street and that he had withdrawn $100. She then realized that the bank surveillance camera may have photographed him as he withdrew his money. She notified the police, who quickly learned that a withdrawal had been made at 12:55 a.m. on March 2, 4', 'According to Dr. Asiedu’s record of examination of Janet, her account of the assault differed somewhat from her initial statement to the police. According to his record, Janet performed oral sex on her attacker in exchange for money. Then, the man became violent after he demanded vaginal intercourse and she refused. She said that the driver responded by stabbing her with the screwdriver. 5', 'We also identify this individual by pseudonym to protect his privacy.', '-4- 2003, from the Sovereign Bank ATM from an account linked to defendant, Timothy Scanlon. A photo of the individual making the withdrawal was obtained and that photograph was included in a new photo array shown to Janet.', 'After reviewing the array, Janet instantly picked out defendant, Timothy Scanlon, as the man who sexually assaulted her.', 'On April 15, 2003, Mr. Scanlon was arrested. He spoke with police, and denied that he attacked Janet. The defendant volunteered to provide a sample of his DNA; a later analysis proved that his DNA matched that extracted from Janet by anal and vaginal swabs.', 'Further investigation by the police revealed that on April 10, 2003, Mr. Scanlon sold a 1988 GMC Jimmy to Dennis Fleurant of Privilege Auto Parts in Woonsocket for use as scrap metal. Mr. Fleurant described the vehicle as gray or silver, with some blue. When the police seized the 1988 GMC Jimmy, however, it was determined that the vehicle’s original paint color had been red (because the door jams and the hood’s interior were red), but that the truck had been repainted gray or silver.', 'In April or May 2003 Lieutenant Timothy Paul, who then worked for the Woonsocket Bureau of Criminal Investigations, conducted a forensic analysis of the vehicle. Lieutenant Paul took photographs and administered a “luminol test” of the vehicle’s interior.6 The results of the luminol testing were negative; no traces of blood were found in the vehicle.', 'A grand jury returned a ten-count indictment against Timothy Scanlon.7', 'Counts 1, 2, and 3 alleged that Timothy Scanlon violated G.L. 1956 §§ 11-37-2 and 11-37-3 by committing 6', 'Luminol is a substance that reacts to the chemicals in blood.

If there is no blood on the tested surface, the luminol will not glow. 7', 'Counts 7, 8, 9, and 10 alleged the kidnapping and assault with a dangerous weapon on a separate victim. The Attorney General dismissed counts 7 through 10 based on Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. A different person confessed to committing these offenses.', '-5- first-degree sexual assault against Janet. Count 4 alleged that Timothy Scanlon committed first degree robbery against Janet in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-39-1(a). Count 5 charged Timothy Scanlon with assaulting Janet with a dangerous weapon in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2. Count 6 alleged that Timothy Scanlon committed an assault and battery on Janet that resulted in serious bodily injury, also in violation of § 11-5-2.', 'At trial the state offered testimony from Janet, Officer George McMann, Lt. Timothy Paul, Det. Todd Fernandes, salvage yard owner Dennis Fleurant, and Sharon Elizabeth Mallard, an analyst with the Rhode Island Department of Health. The defense offered testimony from Dr. Daniel Asiedu, Gale Lescarbeau (defendant’s mother), Roxanne Pare (the mother of defendant’s two children),8 and Charlotte Hopejoy Danis (a nurse at Landmark Medical Center).

On September 28, 2005, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial.

She also testified that defendant admitted to her, after his arrest for the sexual assaults on Janet, that he had a sexual encounter with Janet on March 2, 2003, but that he denied that he sexually assaulted her.', '-6- Third, defendant argues that he cannot be convicted on both counts 5 and 6, because these counts merged into a single count under double-jeopardy principles, and the trial justice erred in ruling otherwise.', 'Fourth, defendant maintains that he is entitled to a new trial because the late disclosure of evidence by the prosecution constituted a violation of his due-process rights. We affirm the judgments of conviction.', 'II', 'A', 'Exclusion of Richard Miles’s Testimony', 'When she was cross-examined after being offered as a witness by the state, Janet testified that she spent the afternoon preceding her attack ingesting cocaine with her boyfriend, Richard Miles, just before Miles was to report to the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI) to begin serving a sentence. The defense then proffered that Miles would testify that he already was incarcerated on the morning of March 1, 2003, and that it therefore was not possible that Janet had shared cocaine with Miles later that day.', 'In response, the state moved in limine, before defendant called his first witness, to exclude Richard Miles’s testimony, arguing that Rule 608(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence precluded the admissibility of Miles’s testimony because the proposed testimony was collateral to the central issues in the case and was offered solely to impeach Janet’s testimony through extrinsic evidence. Rule 608(b) states in relevant part “[s]pecific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness’ credibility * * * may not be proved by extrinsic evidence.”9 The state maintained that the identity of the person with 9', 'Rule 608(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence provides:', '“Specific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of', 'attacking or supporting the witness’ credibility, other than', '-7- whom Janet used cocaine at 3 p.m. on March 1, 2003, was not material evidence as to who assaulted her in the early morning of the next day.', 'The defendant argued at trial that Richard Miles’s testimony was material and not collateral because it would suggest who the perpetrator was. The defendant implied that Janet lied about the person with whom she used cocaine in an effort to protect her attacker. The defendant also maintained that because evidence indicating who her attacker may have been was material to defendant’s guilt or innocence, Rule 608(b) should not apply.', 'After hearing argument, the trial justice granted the motion in limine because he concluded that the testimony was collateral, and that extrinsic evidence may not be used to impeach a complaining witness. The trial justice ruled that the identity of Janet’s cocaine partner ten hours prior to the sexual assault was irrelevant to determining who perpetrated the assaults on her.', 'Significantly, the trial justice emphasized that the complainant admitted to using cocaine and to being with other male customers after the cocaine use, but before she was assaulted. The trial justice reasoned that the break in time and the complainant’s interaction with multiple people after her cocaine use rendered the identity of her companion at 3 p.m. the preceding afternoon collateral to the issue of who attacked her in the early hours of the following morning.', 'conviction of crime as provided in Rule 609, or, in the discretion of', 'the trial judge, evidence of prior similar false accusations, may not', 'be proved by extrinsic evidence.

Gomes, 881 A.2d 97, 111 (R.I. 2005). In light of this standard, this Court must determine whether Richard Miles’s proposed testimony that he was imprisoned on March 1, 2003, and therefore could not have used cocaine in Woonsocket at 3 p.m., as Janet testified, was proper and admissible at defendant’s criminal trial. If this Court were to conclude that the trial justice erred by excluding Richard Miles’s testimony, then we must determine whether the exclusion of this testimony was sufficiently prejudicial to warrant reversing the jury’s verdict. See Gomes, 881 A.2d at 111.', 'Rule 608(b)', 'The defendant argues that Richard Miles’s testimony was material and relevant, and therefore not barred by Rule 608(b), because it would focus the jury’s attention on the possibility that one of Janet’s companions that afternoon later may have attacked her, or, alternatively, that one of her several drug dealers may have assaulted her. 10', 'The defendant also raised, for the first time on appeal, an additional argument that the trial justice’s refusal to allow defendant to call Richard Miles to the stand denied him his Sixth Amendment right to present an effective defense. This Court will not address defendant’s contention that his Sixth Amendment right to present an effective defense was violated because this issue never was raised at trial and therefore is waived on appeal. See State v. Merida, 960 A.2d 228, 236 (R.I. 2008) (holding defendant’s Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause argument waived, and therefore not reviewable on appeal, because it never was presented at trial). Even if we were to consider defendant’s argument, it is axiomatic that a defendant has no right to introduce evidence that is inadmissible under our well-developed rules of evidence.', '-9-', 'This Court has consistently held that “[a] witness may not be impeached on collateral matters by the introduction of extrinsic evidence. The cross-examiner is restricted to the answers of the witness.” State v. Martinez, 824 A.2d 443, 449 (R.I. 2003) (quoting State v. Tutt, 622 A.2d 459, 462 (R.I. 1993) and State v. Brown, 574 A.2d 745, 749 (R.I. 1990)). Evidence is not collateral if the evidence is admissible for a reason other than to contradict the witness’s testimony. Id. (citing State v. Souza, 708 A.2d 899, 904 (R.I. 1998)). In Martinez, this Court held that proffered testimony concerning what occurred several hours before a sexual assault occurred, that was unrelated to the sexual assault at issue, was collateral because the testimony’s “sole purpose was to impeach [the complainant] on collateral matters.” Martinez, 824 A.2d at 449.', 'When a criminal defendant accuses someone else of committing the crime with which he is charged, the defendant must make some reasonably specific offer of proof as to who the perpetrator might be.

Absent such an offer of proof, this evidence could constitute “an impermissible invitation to the jury to speculate on a collateral matter.” Id. at 112 (quoting Gazerro, 420 A.2d at 825). In Gomes, the state filed a motion in limine to exclude a police report, prepared one month before the victim’s murder, in which the victim alleged that her former boyfriend was harassing her. Id. at 109-10. The defendant, who was not the former boyfriend, wanted the police report admitted to show that the former boyfriend had a motive to murder the victim. Id. at 111. We affirmed the trial justice’s grant of the motion in limine, in part because the defendant failed to provide any evidence that would demonstrate that the former boyfriend murdered the victim, or that this person was even in the area where the murder occurred. Id. at 111-12.', '- 10 -', 'Here, the proffered testimony of Richard Miles could be used only to impeach Janet’s credibility on a collateral issue. We are not persuaded by defendant’s argument that the identity of the person with whom Janet used drugs at 3 p.m. on March 1, 2003, sheds any light on the issue of defendant’s guilt or innocence.', 'Scanlon’s suggestion about who else may have committed the crime is demonstrably thinner than that in Gomes. The defendant does not imply that any particular individual may have committed these crimes, other than unnamed drug dealers, nor does he advance any theory as to why someone else would have assaulted Janet.', 'In our opinion, Rule 608(b) barred defendant’s use of Richard Miles’s testimony to impeach Janet’s recollection of the identity of her cocaine-using partner. Therefore, the trial justice did not err when he granted the state’s motion in limine.11', 'B', 'Felony Assault Conviction', 'The defendant raises two challenges with respect to his conviction for felony assault based upon the dislocation of Janet’s shoulder. First, he argues that his motion for judgment of acquittal pursuant to Rule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure should have been granted because, as a matter of law, the injury to Janet’s shoulder fails to satisfy § 11-5- 2(c)(2)’s requirement that the bodily injury involve a “protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily part, member or organ.” Second, defendant argues that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution and of article 1, section 7, of the Rhode Island Constitution bar his convictions for both count 5 (felony assault—assault with a dangerous 11', 'We continue to cast a jaundiced eye to the overuse of motions in limine.

We conclude, however, that defendant failed to preserve either argument for appeal.', '1', 'Rule 29 Motion for Judgment of Acquittal', 'As we have said on numerous occasions, to preserve a right to appeal the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal under Rule 29 made at the close of the state’s case, a defendant must renew the motion after he presents his own case. See State v. Andreozzi, 798 A.2d 372, 374 (R.I. 2002). Although defendant appropriately moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the state’s case, he failed to renew his motion after he called his own witnesses. Consequently, defendant’s failure to renew his motion for judgment of acquittal forecloses his right to seek review of the trial justice’s denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal. Id.12', 'Yet, even if defendant had preserved his right to appeal the denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal, we nonetheless would agree with the trial justice’s adverse ruling.', 'The defendant argues that he was entitled to a judgment of acquittal on count 6, felony assault in violation of § 11-5-2, because the injuries to Janet’s arm and shoulder did not rise to the level of severity necessary to support a conviction.

See State v. Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 568-69 (R.I. 2009); State v. Colbert, 549 A.2d 1021, 1023 (R.I. 1988) (determining the defendant did not waive right to have sufficiency of evidence reviewed in motion for new trial even though the defendant failed to renew motion for acquittal).

Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 573 (R.I. 2009), we were asked to determine what constitutes a serious permanent disfigurement under subsection (c)(3) of the definition of serious bodily injury in § 11-5-2. In that case, we held that the question of “[w]hether the injuries inflicted * * * were serious and disfiguring were factual matters for the jury’s consideration.” Clark, 974 A.2d at 573. It is similarly our opinion that what constitutes a “protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily part, member or organ” under subsection (c)(2) of 11-5-2 is a factual matter left for the jury’s determination.', 'The jury instructions appropriately required the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt “that the defendant assaulted [Janet] and that in doing so he seriously injured her shoulder area such that she lost the functional use of her shoulder or arm for a protracted period of time, that is to say a prolonged or extended period of time.” The defendant never objected to this jury instruction.', 'The jury heard evidence from Janet that she felt her shoulder break when defendant grabbed her arm and that it was necessary for her to wear a sling for six weeks and take pain medications. Further, Dr. Asiedu testified that Janet suffered a dislocation of her right arm. Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the state, there is no question that Janet’s injury cleared the statutory hurdle and properly was submitted to the jury.', '2', '- 13 -', 'Merger of Counts 5 and 6', 'Although we also are satisfied that whether count 6 (felony assault—assault or battery resulting in serious bodily injury) merged with count 5 (felony assault—assault with a dangerous weapon), therefore implicating the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions was not preserved, we nonetheless address this argument. We have held that a defense based upon double jeopardy must be raised in a pretrial motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(2) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. See State v. Day, 925 A.2d 962, 977 (R.I. 2007). Rule 12(b)(2) provides that “[t]he defense of double jeopardy * * * may be raised only by motion before trial.” See also Day, 925 A.2d at 977; State v. Grayhurst, 852 A.2d 491, 500 (R.I. 2004). Rule 12(b)(2) further states that “[f]ailure to present any such defense or objection as herein provided constitutes a waiver thereof, but the court for cause shown may grant relief from the waiver.” See also State v. McGuy, 841 A.2d 1109, 1115 (R.I. 2003) (stressing defendant needs to demonstrate “some compelling reason to grant relief from the waiver sanction of Rule 12(b)(2)”).13', 'In this case, defendant did not file a Rule 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss.', 'Therefore, defendant is barred from raising double jeopardy as a defense unless he can demonstrate some extraordinary justification for not doing so earlier. On the other hand, defendant’s trial occurred in 2005, almost two years before the Day decision made the law explicitly clear. Cf Day, 925 A.2d at 977 (holding that cause existed in part because of murkiness in the case law on this issue). Further, although no motion was filed under Rule 12, the trial justice nonetheless 13', 'In State v. Day, 925 A.2d 962, 977 (R.I. 2007), we determined that cause existed because this Court previously had not “focused with maximal explicitness on the necessity of bringing a merger argument to the attention of the trial court through a pretrial [Super.R.Crim.P.] 12(b)(2) motion” and because the trial justice dealt with the merger issue when considering the defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal.', '- 14 - entertained argument on this issue when he heard defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal and he ruled on the issue. Under all the circumstances present here, it is our opinion that defendant’s double-jeopardy claim, although not properly raised, should be considered by this Court.', 'To determine whether a criminal defendant is imperiled by double jeopardy, this Court applies the “same evidence” test first pronounced in Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299 (1932). See State v. Davis, 120 R.I. 82, 86, 384 A.2d 1061, 1064 (1978) (acknowledging adoption of Blockburger test). Under the same-evidence test, “where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.” Davis, 120 R.I. at 86, 384 A.2d at 1064 (quoting Blockburger, 284 U.S. at 304); see also State v. Bolarinho, 850 A.2d 907, 909 (R.I. 2004).', 'This is not the first time that we have addressed the issue of whether multiple assault convictions merged after a double-jeopardy analysis.', 'In Bolarinho, 850 A.2d at 911, the defendant, in a single incident, repeatedly kicked the complainant. From this single occurrence, the defendant was charged with two counts of felony assault in violation of § 11-5-2; one count for committing a felony assault by use of a dangerous weapon, to wit a shod foot, and one count for committing a felony assault that resulted in serious bodily injury. Bolarinho, 850 A.2d at 908-09. We considered whether “a conviction for both assault with a dangerous weapon and assault resulting in serious bodily injury resulting from the same transaction may stand.” Id. at 911. The Court held that when the evidence used to convict the defendant of assault with a dangerous weapon and assault resulting in serious bodily injury is identical, the counts merge under a double-jeopardy analysis. Id.', '- 15 -', 'Alternatively, in State v. Haney, 842 A.2d 1083, 1084-85 (R.I. 2004), we considered whether a defendant’s two domestic-assault convictions on the same complainant on the same night could withstand scrutiny under a double-jeopardy analysis. The incidents were separated by fifteen minutes, and one assault occurred in Burrillville while the other assault occurred in Glocester. Id. The defendant argued that, because he and the complainant were together in a car throughout the entire fifteen-minute interval between assaults, both were part of a continuing transaction. Id. at 1085. We rejected the defendant’s double-jeopardy argument because the acts underlying the two convictions were separate acts. Id. The victim was identical, but the assaults occurred at different times and in different towns, and the defendant had “sufficient opportunity to reflect on his assaultive conduct and to forbear from committing another crime” before he committed the second assault. Id.', 'Applying the Blockburger “same-evidence” test to the case before us, we first consider whether the facts underlying counts 5 and 6 constitute the “same act or transaction.” Davis, 120 R.I. at 86, 384 A.2d at 1064 (quoting Blockburger, 284 U.S. at 304). Count 5 alleged that defendant assaulted the complainant with a screwdriver, a dangerous weapon. Conversely, count 6 alleged that defendant committed a felony assault on the complainant by later grabbing her arm and dislocating it. On their face, the facts alleged in each count do not constitute the “same act or transaction,” because each assault arises from a different act. Nothing in the record indicates that the use of the screwdriver caused the complainant’s right arm to dislocate. Unlike in Bolarinho, in which the same evidence of kicking the victim was used to support both an assault with a dangerous weapon and an assault resulting in serious bodily injury, here the two counts are supported by different evidence. See Bolarinho, 850 A.2d at 911.

First, he says that the evidence introduced at his trial was not sufficient to support a conviction. Second, defendant claims that he is entitled to a new trial because the state twice violated its discovery obligations by failing to disclose, until the eve of trial, evidence that was critical to his defense.

Despite the conflicts between Janet’s earlier statements to the police and medical personnel and her trial testimony, he nonetheless found her to be a credible witness. Further, the trial justice said that he understood why the jury would discount the testimony of Roxanne Pare, defendant’s former girlfriend and the mother of his two children, with respect to the 1:20 a.m. phone call and subsequent visit by defendant. Finally, the trial justice stated “the credible evidence fairly and beyond a reasonable doubt pointed to this defendant, Tim Scanlon, as the man who abused [Janet].”', 'The trial justice’s decision on the motion for a new trial is not clearly wrong, nor did he overlook material evidence.

87,"City of East Providence : v. : International Association of Firefighters Local 850. : Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty, Robinson, JJ., and Williams, C.J. (ret.). OPINION Chief Justice Williams (ret.), for the Court. After successfully undergoing treatment for prostate cancer, East Providence Fire Department Battalion Chief, James Moniz (Chief Moniz), requested that his sick leave be restored and that he be given the full benefits pursuant to G.L. 1956 chapter 19.1 of title 45, entitled “Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters.” After his request was denied by the City of East Providence (the city), the International Association of Firefighters, Local 850 (Local 850), filed a grievance on his behalf alleging that the denial of the request to restore Chief Moniz’s sick time violated the parties’ collective-bargaining agreement. The parties submitted to arbitration, and the arbitrator issued a decision granting the restoration of Chief Moniz’s forty-four days of sick time. The Superior Court confirmed the award, and the city timely appealed. In this case we are called upon to determine whether the arbitrator exceeded his authority in determining that East Providence firefighters are entitled to injured on- duty benefits through the application of the “Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters” statute. For the -1- reasons set forth in this opinion, we conclude that the “Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters” statute does indeed provide injured on-duty benefits to East Providence firefighters. I Facts and Travel The facts in this case are largely undisputed. Chief Moniz, a thirty-year veteran of the East Providence Fire Department, was diagnosed with prostate cancer in August 2002. As a result of his diagnosis, Chief Moniz underwent surgery and treatment while on sick leave from August 22, 2002, until November 18, 2002, after which he returned to active duty. Upon returning to active duty, Chief Moniz wrote to the chief of the East Providence Fire Department requesting that the forty-four duty days of which he was absent receiving cancer treatment be converted to “injured on duty” time. By requesting that his sick leave be converted to injured on-duty time, Chief Moniz sought to have the forty-four days of sick leave credited back to his sick leave reserve. 1 Under Article X, Section 10.02 of the collective-bargaining agreement between the City of East Providence and Local 850, “In-line-of-duty illness” time shall be in conformity with G.L. 1956 § 45-19-1 (IOD statute). The relevant provisions of the parties’ collective-bargaining agreement are as follows: “10.03 IN-LINE-OF-DUTY INJURY “(A) Members of the fire department, covered by this contract who are injured in the line of duty including non-civic details to which they are assigned, shall receive full salary while their incapacity exists or until they are placed on a disability retirement (This section is in conformance with General Laws of Rhode Island, 1956, as amended, Section 45-19-1).” 1 Chief Moniz did not seek compensation from the city because he was paid his usual salary while on leave pursuant to the sick leave provision, Article X, Section 10.02 of the collective- bargaining agreement between the city and Local 850. Therefore, the only issue before this Court is whether Chief Moniz’s leave for treatment of his prostate cancer should have been deducted from his sick leave reserve or whether that time should have been restored because his leave fell within the ambit of G.L. 1956 § 45-19-1.3. -2- In his request letter to the chief of the department, Chief Moniz referenced two other firefighters who had also been diagnosed with cancer and “had their sick leave time converted to injured on-duty time prior to their retirement from active duty.” Those two firefighters, however, did not return to active duty following their cancer diagnoses, and both retired from the East Providence Fire Department while on sick leave. The department chief denied Chief Moniz’s request, and the union filed a grievance pursuant to the collective-bargaining agreement. The human resources director denied Chief Moniz’s grievance, in part because he was able to return to active duty, whereas other firefighters’ cancer diagnoses resulted in their disability retirements. 2 In his letter denying Chief Moniz’s request, the human resources director acknowledged that: “It is the City’s policy to evaluate each request that cancer be presumed to be work related on a case-by-case basis. In the past, the City has ruled in two cases, based on the type of cancer and the fact that the cancer led directly to disability retirements, that the sick leave taken immediately prior to the disability pension should be converted to injury on duty leave. In your case, based on the type of cancer and the fact that you have recovered sufficiently to return to active duty, it is the City’s position that your sick leave not be converted to injured on duty status.” After the city denied Chief Moniz’s grievance, Local 850 submitted the grievance to arbitration on Chief Moniz’s behalf pursuant to Article XVI of the parties’ collective-bargaining agreement. At the arbitration hearing, the city argued that its firefighters were not entitled to benefits under the “Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters” statute because it applied only to municipalities participating in the optional retirement plan under G.L. 1956 chapter 21 of title 45. Local 850 argued that the “Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters” statute was incorporated into 2 We commend Chief Moniz for returning to active duty after battling cancer, and for his continuing service to the East Providence community, when he could have retired. In effect, in so doing, he saved the city from incurring expenses related to the chief’s retirement, as well as hiring a replacement for him. -3- the parties’ collective-bargaining agreement through the adoption of § 45-19-1. 3 Local 850 argues, in the alternative, that the city’s previous grant of the cancer benefit to two of its firefighters constituted a past practice, entitling Chief Moniz to benefits under the “Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters” statute. On December 9, 2004, the arbitrator issued a decision in favor of Local 850, and awarded Chief Moniz forty-four days of sick leave back to his reserve. In his decision, the arbitrator concluded that the parties had incorporated the IOD statute into the collective-bargaining agreement. He further found that, by enacting the “Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters” statute, the General Assembly amended the IOD statute to include cancer as an occupational injury for Rhode Island firefighters. In the alternative, the arbitrator found that any ambiguity regarding the applicability of the “Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters” statute to the collective-bargaining agreement should be resolved by looking at the parties’ prior application of the contract language. In doing so, the arbitrator found that the city had provided benefits through the “Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters” statute to two other firefighters. The arbitrator used these two prior applications to determine that the parties had intended to incorporate the “Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters” statute into the agreement. After the arbitrator filed his award, the city filed a motion to vacate the award in Superior Court. The hearing justice determined that the arbitrator had “appropriately assessed the 3 Section 45-19-1(a) reads in relevant part: “Whenever any *** fire fighter *** of any city, town, fire district, or the state of Rhode Island is wholly or partially incapacitated by reason of injuries received or sickness contracted in the performance of his or her duties *** the respective city, town, fire district, state of Rhode Island or Rhode Island Airport Corporation by which the *** fire fighter *** is employed, shall during the period of the incapacity, pay the *** fire fighter *** the salary or wage and benefits to which the *** fire fighter *** would be entitled had he or she not been incapacitated *** .” -4- collective-bargaining agreement and state statutes and made appropriate findings of fact and conclusions of law.” Accordingly, on May 12, 2006, the hearing justice denied the City’s motion to vacate, from which it timely appealed. II Analysis On appeal, the city argues that the arbitrator exceeded his authority by finding that the “Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters” statute applied to its firefighters because (1) the city had established its own retirement system pursuant to P.L. 1925, ch. 715, and therefore was exempt from the provisions of the “Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters” statute; (2) that implementation of the arbitrator’s award would cause irreparable harm because the city had not contemplated nor funded the conferral of benefits under the “Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters” statute to its firefighters; and (3) the application of the “Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters” statute to East Providence created new injured-on-duty and pension benefits that were not the result of collective-bargaining. In response, Local 850 avers that the parties incorporated the IOD statute into their collective-bargaining agreement, that the “Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters” statute amended the IOD statute, and that the plain language of the “Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters” statute applies to all Rhode Island firefighters.

North Providence Federation of Teachers, Local 920, American Federation of Teachers, 945 A.2d 339, 344 (R.I. 2008). Public policy favors the finality of arbitration awards, and such awards enjoy a presumption of validity. Pierce v. Rhode Island Hospital, 875 A.2d 424, 426 (R.I. 2005). “[A]s -5- long as an arbitrator’s award ‘draws its essence’ from the contract and is based upon a ‘passably plausible’ interpretation of the contract, it is within the arbitrator’s authority and our review must end.” Town of Coventry v.

It is well settled that an arbitrator may “make rulings concerning the applicable law and *** interpret the law according to the facts before him or her.” Vose v. Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional Officers, 587 A.2d 913, 914 (R.I. 1991). “[L]ike a judge sitting without a jury, an arbitrator is called upon not only to make findings of fact but also to apply the law to the facts.” Id. Not only may an arbitrator make rulings on the applicable law, but an arbitrator’s award will be upheld even if he or she makes a mistake or error in interpreting the law. Pier House Inn, Inc. v. 421 Corporation, Inc., 812 A.2d 799, 803 (R.I. 2002). “[A]rbitrators may and should decide questions of relevant state law and the interpretation thereof in resolving a grievance brought pursuant [to] a [collective-bargaining agreement].” Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional Officers v. State, 643 A.2d 817, 821 (R.I. 1994). This Court will overturn an arbitration award only “if the award was irrational or if the arbitrator manifestly disregarded the law.” Purvis Systems, Inc. v. American Systems Corp., 788 A.2d 1112, 1115 (R.I. 2002). “[A] manifest disregard of the law requires ‘something beyond and different from a mere error in the law or failure on the part of the arbitrators to understand or apply the law.’” North Providence School Committee, 945 A.2d at 344 (quoting Westminster Construction Corp. v. PPG Industries, Inc., 119 R.I. 205, 211, 376 A.2d 708, 711 (1977)). Rather, “[a] manifest disregard of the law occurs when an arbitrator understands and correctly articulates the law, but then proceeds to disregard it.” Id. (citing Purvis Systems, Inc., 788 A.2d at 1115). -6- The city contends that the arbitrator exceeded his authority by construing the “Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters” statute to be an amendment to the IOD statute. This argument ignores this Court’s precedent that, in resolving grievances among parties to a collective-bargaining agreement, an arbitrator should decide questions of state law. Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional Officers, 643 A.2d at 821. First, it would be impossible for the arbitrator to resolve the dispute without looking to the “Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters” statute because its application to East Providence firefighters is the central issue. Additionally, the parties’ dispute also was based on whether Chief Moniz was entitled to injured on-duty sick time under the IOD statute, incorporated in Article X, Section 10.02 of the parties’ collective-bargaining agreement. Thus, the arbitrator clearly was within his authority to review and interpret the relevant state law because the application of it was essential in resolving the parties’ dispute. Next, the city argues that the arbitrator’s award was irrational because conferring IOD benefits on firefighters diagnosed with cancer would cause the city irreparable fiscal harm. This argument is not persuasive. First, the “Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters” statute specifically provides benefits under the IOD statute to cancer-stricken firefighters. Next, the parties collectively bargained for the benefits of the IOD statute. Finally, this Court has held that parties cannot waive the benefits under the IOD statute in the collective-bargaining process. See Town of Burrillville v. Rhode Island State Labor Relations Board, 921 A.2d 113, 121 n. 6 (R.I. 2007) (citing Vose, 587 A.2d at 915). Therefore, the city’s assertion that providing IOD benefits for cancer-stricken firefighters would cause irreparable harm is implausible, considering that the city not only was contractually, but statutorily, obligated to provide benefits to its firefighters who suffer on-duty injuries. Cancer, under the “Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters” statute, is simply a type of on-duty injury for which firefighters are to be paid IOD benefits, along with the many -7- other on-duty injuries that firefighters can suffer in the performance of their jobs. Thus, any argument that providing IOD benefits would cause the city irreparable fiscal harm is not persuasive. B Application of G.L. 1956 Chapter 19.1 of Title 45 The city argues that the language of the “Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters” statute limits its application to “a municipality that participates in the optional retirement plan for police officers and fire fighters provided in [45-21.2]” and that, because the city does not participate in the optional retirement program, its firefighters are not entitled to benefits under the provisions of the “Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters” statute. Local 850 contends that the language, “any fire fighter” within the “Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters” statute should be construed to include any firefighter in any city or town regardless of whether that city or town participates in the optional retirement program. Section 45-19.1-1, entitled “Legislative findings,” provides: “(a) The general assembly finds and declares that by reason of their employment: “(1) Fire fighters are required to work in the midst of, and are subject to, smoke, fumes, or carcinogenic, poisonous, toxic, or chemical substances; “(2) Fire fighters are continually exposed to a vast and expanding field of hazardous substances through hazardous waste sites and the transportation of those substances; “(3) Fire fighters are constantly entering uncontrolled environments to save lives and reduce property damage and are frequently not aware of potential toxic and carcinogenic substances that they may be exposed to; “(4) Fire fighters, unlike other workers, are often exposed simultaneously to multiple carcinogens, and the rise in occupational cancer among fire fighters can be related to the rapid proliferation of thousands of toxic substances in our every day environment; and “(5) The onset of cancers in fire fighters can develop very slowly, usually manifesting themselves from five (5) years to forty (40) years after exposure to the cancer-causing agent. -8- “(b) The general assembly further finds and declares that all of the previously stated conditions exist and arise out of or in the course of that employment.” Section 45-19.1-2 entitled, “Definitions,” provides: “The following terms when used in this chapter have the following meanings: “(a) ‘Disability’ means a condition of physical incapacity to perform any assigned duty or duties in the fire department. “(b) ‘Fire department’ means service groups (paid or volunteer) that are organized and trained for the prevention and control of loss of life and property from any fire or disaster. “(c) ‘Fire fighter’ means an individual, paid or volunteer, who is assigned to a fire department and is required to respond to alarms and performs emergency action. “(d) ‘Occupational cancer’ means a cancer arising out of his or her employment as a fire fighter, due to injury from exposures to smoke, fumes, or carcinogenic, poisonous, toxic, or chemical substances while in the performance of active duty in the fire department.” Section 45-19.1-3 entitled, “Occupational cancer disability for fire fighters,” provides: “(a) Any fire fighter, including one employed by the state, or a municipal fire fighter employed by a municipality that participates in the optional retirement for police officers and fire fighters, as provided in chapter 21.2 of this title, who is unable to perform his or her duties in the fire department by reason of a disabling occupational cancer which develops or manifests itself during a period while the fire fighter is in the service of the department, and any retired member of the fire department of any city or town who develops occupational cancer, is entitled to receive an occupational cancer disability, and he or she is entitled to all of the benefits provided for in chapters 19, 21 and 21.2 of this title and chapter 10 of title 36 if the fire fighter is employed by the state. “(b) The provisions of this section apply retroactively in the case of any retired member of the fire department of any city or town.” “It is well settled that when the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, this Court must interpret the statute literally and must give the words of the statute their plain and ordinary meanings.” Accent Store Design, Inc. v. Marathon House, Inc., 674 A.2d 1223, 1226 -9- (R.I. 1996); see also State v. Greenberg, 951 A.2d 481, 489 (R.I. 2008). “The plain meaning of the statute is the best indication of the General Assembly’s intent.” Park v. Rizzo Ford, Inc., 893 A.2d 216, 221 (R.I. 2006). Therefore, “when a statute is unambiguous on its face we do not search behind the language to determine legislative intent.” Angell v. Union Fire District of South Kingstown, 935 A.2d 943, 946 (R.I. 2007). It is only when a statute is ambiguous and susceptible to more than one interpretation does this Court have the responsibility to “glean the intent and purpose of the Legislature ‘from a consideration of the entire statute, keeping in mind [the] nature, object, language, and arrangement’ of the provision to be construed.” Algiere v. Fox, 122 R.I. 55, 58, 404 A.2d 72, 74 (1979). Upon a reading of the statute, it is evident that the General Assembly intended to ensure that firefighters diagnosed with cancer receive injured on-duty benefits in accordance with the IOD statute, § 45-19-1, the Retirement of Municipal Employees statute, chapter 21 of title 45, the Optional Retirement for Members of Police Force and Fire Fighters statute, G.L. 1956 chapter 21.2 of title 45, and the Retirement System—Contributions and Benefits statute, G.L. 1956 chapter 10 of title 36. The enactment of the “Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters” statute specifically designated cancer among firefighters as an on-duty illness, based on the General Assembly’s findings that firefighters are exposed to “a vast and expanding field of hazardous substances” and that the “rise in occupational cancer among fire fighters can be related to the rapid proliferation of thousands of toxic substances.” Section 45-19.1-1(a)(3)-(4). Simply put, the “Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters” statute acknowledges the unfortunate fact that in the performance of their duties, firefighters develop cancer at a disproportionate rate, and provides a partial remedy by entitling them to “all of the benefits provided for in chapters 19, 21 and 21.2 of this title and chapter 10 of title 36.” Section 45-19.1-3(a). - 10 - The city’s argument that the General Assembly intended to restrict the “Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters” statute to firefighters participating in the municipal retirement system is inconsistent with the express language of the statute. Nothing in § 45-19.1-3 restricts the statute’s application to firefighters participating in the optional retirement plan. Indeed, the statute uses the all inclusive phrase, “any fire fighter.” We find no merit in the city’s contention that the statutory language, “including [a firefighter] employed by the state, or a municipal fire fighter employed by a municipality that participates in the optional retirement for police officers and fire fighters,” limits its application. The word, “any,” followed by the term, “including,” is all encompassing. This language does not indicate any intent on the part of the General Assembly to restrict these cancer benefits to only certain firefighters. Had the General Assembly intended to limit the statute’s application to municipal firefighters participating in the optional retirement program, it could have done so. See Brown & Sharpe Manufacturing Co. v. Dean, 89 R.I. 108, 116-17, 151 A.2d 354, 358 (1959) (“if the language of a statute is free from ambiguity and expresses a definite and sensible meaning, that meaning is conclusively presumed to be the one which the legislature intended”). Thus, we conclude that the language of the “Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters” statute expressly provides injured on-duty benefits provided by chapters 19, 21, and 21.2 of title 45, and chapter 10 of title 36. In light of our reading of the “Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters” statute, we conclude that the arbitrator did not exceed his authority in finding that the city is obligated to provide injured on-duty benefits to Chief Moniz. The “Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters” statute explicitly provides injured on-duty benefits as governed by § 45-19-1 to firefighters who are diagnosed with cancer. Because of Chief Moniz’s cancer diagnosis, he is entitled to have the forty-four days of sick leave at issue restored to him in accordance with § 45-19-1. - 11 - III Conclusion For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court and remand the file thereto. - 12 - Supreme Court No.2007-277-Appeal. (PM 05-899) City of East Providence : v. : International Association of Firefighters Local 850. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Williams (ret.), for the Court. After successfully undergoing treatment for prostate cancer, East Providence Fire Department Battalion Chief, James Moniz (Chief Moniz), requested that his sick leave be restored and that he be given the full benefits pursuant to G.L. 1956 chapter 19.1 of title 45, entitled “Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters.” After his request was denied by the City of East Providence (the city), the International Association of Firefighters, Local 850 (Local 850), filed a grievance on his behalf alleging that the denial of the request to restore Chief Moniz’s sick time violated the parties’ collective-bargaining agreement. The parties submitted to arbitration, and the arbitrator issued a decision granting the restoration of Chief Moniz’s forty-four days of sick time. The Superior Court confirmed the award, and the city timely appealed. In this case we are called upon to determine whether the arbitrator exceeded his authority in determining that East Providence firefighters are entitled to injured on- duty benefits through the application of the “Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters” statute. For the', '-1- reasons set forth in this opinion, we conclude that the “Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters” statute does indeed provide injured on-duty benefits to East Providence firefighters.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The facts in this case are largely undisputed. Chief Moniz, a thirty-year veteran of the East Providence Fire Department, was diagnosed with prostate cancer in August 2002. As a result of his diagnosis, Chief Moniz underwent surgery and treatment while on sick leave from August 22, 2002, until November 18, 2002, after which he returned to active duty. Upon returning to active duty, Chief Moniz wrote to the chief of the East Providence Fire Department requesting that the forty-four duty days of which he was absent receiving cancer treatment be converted to “injured on duty” time. By requesting that his sick leave be converted to injured on-duty time, Chief Moniz sought to have the forty-four days of sick leave credited back to his sick leave reserve. 1 Under Article X, Section 10.02 of the collective-bargaining agreement between the City of East Providence and Local 850, “In-line-of-duty illness” time shall be in conformity with G.L. 1956 § 45-19-1 (IOD statute).

Finally, this Court has held that parties cannot waive the benefits under the IOD statute in the collective-bargaining process. See Town of Burrillville v. Rhode Island State Labor Relations Board, 921 A.2d 113, 121 n. 6 (R.I. 2007) (citing Vose, 587 A.2d at 915). Therefore, the city’s assertion that providing IOD benefits for cancer-stricken firefighters would cause irreparable harm is implausible, considering that the city not only was contractually, but statutorily, obligated to provide benefits to its firefighters who suffer on-duty injuries. Cancer, under the “Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters” statute, is simply a type of on-duty injury for which firefighters are to be paid IOD benefits, along with the many', '-7- other on-duty injuries that firefighters can suffer in the performance of their jobs. Thus, any argument that providing IOD benefits would cause the city irreparable fiscal harm is not persuasive.', 'B', 'Application of G.L. 1956 Chapter 19.1 of Title 45', 'The city argues that the language of the “Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters” statute limits its application to “a municipality that participates in the optional retirement plan for police officers and fire fighters provided in [45-21.2]” and that, because the city does not participate in the optional retirement program, its firefighters are not entitled to benefits under the provisions of the “Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters” statute. Local 850 contends that the language, “any fire fighter” within the “Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters” statute should be construed to include any firefighter in any city or town regardless of whether that city or town participates in the optional retirement program.

Greenberg, 951 A.2d 481, 489 (R.I. 2008). “The plain meaning of the statute is the best indication of the General Assembly’s intent.” Park v. Rizzo Ford, Inc., 893 A.2d 216, 221 (R.I. 2006). Therefore, “when a statute is unambiguous on its face we do not search behind the language to determine legislative intent.” Angell v. Union Fire District of South Kingstown, 935 A.2d 943, 946 (R.I. 2007). It is only when a statute is ambiguous and susceptible to more than one interpretation does this Court have the responsibility to “glean the intent and purpose of the Legislature ‘from a consideration of the entire statute, keeping in mind [the] nature, object, language, and arrangement’ of the provision to be construed.” Algiere v. Fox, 122 R.I. 55, 58, 404 A.2d 72, 74 (1979).', 'Upon a reading of the statute, it is evident that the General Assembly intended to ensure that firefighters diagnosed with cancer receive injured on-duty benefits in accordance with the IOD statute, § 45-19-1, the Retirement of Municipal Employees statute, chapter 21 of title 45, the Optional Retirement for Members of Police Force and Fire Fighters statute, G.L. 1956 chapter 21.2 of title 45, and the Retirement System—Contributions and Benefits statute, G.L. 1956 chapter 10 of title 36. The enactment of the “Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters” statute specifically designated cancer among firefighters as an on-duty illness, based on the General Assembly’s findings that firefighters are exposed to “a vast and expanding field of hazardous substances” and that the “rise in occupational cancer among fire fighters can be related to the rapid proliferation of thousands of toxic substances.” Section 45-19.1-1(a)(3)-(4). Simply put, the “Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters” statute acknowledges the unfortunate fact that in the performance of their duties, firefighters develop cancer at a disproportionate rate, and provides a partial remedy by entitling them to “all of the benefits provided for in chapters 19, 21 and 21.2 of this title and chapter 10 of title 36.” Section 45-19.1-3(a).', '- 10 -', 'The city’s argument that the General Assembly intended to restrict the “Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters” statute to firefighters participating in the municipal retirement system is inconsistent with the express language of the statute. Nothing in § 45-19.1-3 restricts the statute’s application to firefighters participating in the optional retirement plan. Indeed, the statute uses the all inclusive phrase, “any fire fighter.” We find no merit in the city’s contention that the statutory language, “including [a firefighter] employed by the state, or a municipal fire fighter employed by a municipality that participates in the optional retirement for police officers and fire fighters,” limits its application. The word, “any,” followed by the term, “including,” is all encompassing.', 'This language does not indicate any intent on the part of the General Assembly to restrict these cancer benefits to only certain firefighters. Had the General Assembly intended to limit the statute’s application to municipal firefighters participating in the optional retirement program, it could have done so. See Brown & Sharpe Manufacturing Co. v. Dean, 89 R.I. 108, 116-17, 151 A.2d 354, 358 (1959) (“if the language of a statute is free from ambiguity and expresses a definite and sensible meaning, that meaning is conclusively presumed to be the one which the legislature intended”). Thus, we conclude that the language of the “Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters” statute expressly provides injured on-duty benefits provided by chapters 19, 21, and 21.2 of title 45, and chapter 10 of title 36.', 'In light of our reading of the “Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters” statute, we conclude that the arbitrator did not exceed his authority in finding that the city is obligated to provide injured on-duty benefits to Chief Moniz. The “Cancer Benefits for Fire Fighters” statute explicitly provides injured on-duty benefits as governed by § 45-19-1 to firefighters who are diagnosed with cancer.

88,"Peter Boranian : v. : Elaine Richer et al. : Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty, Robinson, JJ., and Williams, C.J. (ret.). OPINION Chief Justice Williams (ret.), for the Court. The plaintiff, Peter Boranian, appeals from a Superior Court order allowing the defendants, Elaine Richer and C. Real Richer 1 (defendants) to file a rejection of a court-annexed arbitration award out of time. Mr. Boranian contends that defendants failed to demonstrate excusable neglect with respect to their failure to reject the arbitration award within twenty days as prescribed by Rule 5 of the Superior Court Rules Governing Arbitration of Civil Actions. This matter came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on September 29, 2009, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the 1 Another defendant, Amica Mutual Insurance Company was voluntarily dismissed from the case on August 31, 2006. -1- opinion that this appeal may be decided at this time, without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth below, we reverse the order of the Superior Court. I Facts and Travel The underlying facts leading up to arbitration are not in dispute. On April 26, 2006, Mr. Boranian filed suit against defendants for injuries suffered in a rear-end automobile collision. The defendants did not dispute liability, and on March 18, 2008, the parties were referred to court-annexed arbitration. On April 21, 2008, an arbitrator awarded Mr. Boranian $45,000, plus interest and costs for injuries suffered as a result of the accident. The arbitrator filed the award with the Superior Court on April 22, 2008. On May 13, 2008, defendants filed a rejection of the arbitrator’s award under Rule 5(a). That same day, the Superior Court Arbitration Office notified defendants that they had filed their rejection one day past the twenty-day filing deadline. Thereafter, defendants moved for leave to file their rejection of the court-annexed arbitration award out of time, which motion was heard on June 27, 2008. The hearing justice found that defendants’ late rejection was caused by their attorney’s miscalculation of the rejection deadline, in that counsel’s secretary had miscounted the days and entered the deadline on the calendar as falling on May 13, 2008, rather than the actual date of May 12, 2008. In their memorandum to support their motion to file a rejection out of time, defendants argued that the Superior Court, in its discretion, could grant relief due to mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect under Rule 60(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. The defendants averred that the error in entering the incorrect deadline date was the product of an “inadvertence” and that, therefore, they were entitled to relief under Rule 60(b). The hearing justice did not determine whether the one-day miscalculation qualified as an “inadvertence;” rather he found that it was “excusable neglect,” stating, “if the present case doesn’t fit the -2- meaning of excusable neglect, I don’t know what case would.” The hearing justice then entered an order allowing defendants to file their rejection out of time, and Mr. Boranian appealed. II Analysis On appeal, Mr. Boranian argues that the hearing justice abused his discretion by allowing defendants to file their rejection of the arbitrator’s award out of time. Mr. Boranian contends that the failure of defendants’ counsel to properly calendar the rejection deadline date did not fit within this Court’s definition of “excusable neglect.” In response, defendants argue that Mr. Boranian’s appeal is not properly before this Court because it is interlocutory, that their late rejection of the arbitrator’s award was excusable neglect, and that Rule 6(d) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure provides an additional day to file a rejection, making their rejection timely. A Standard of Review Motions to enlarge time are confided to the sound discretion of the trial justice. Astors’ Beechwood v. People Coal Co., 659 A.2d 1109, 1115 (R.I. 1995). Rule 6(b)(1) states that “the court may at any time in its discretion *** order the period enlarged.” (Emphasis added.) Therefore, this Court reviews such decisions for abuse of discretion or error of law. Astors’ Beechwood, 659 A.2d at 1115 (citing Iddings v. McBurney, 657 A.2d 550, 553 (R.I. 1995)). “The burden of proof is on the moving party *** and although our review must be deferential, ‘deferential review cannot be equated with no review at all.’” Id. (quoting In re Scheri, 51 F.3d 71, 75 (7th Cir. 1995)). -3- B Appeal of the Superior Court Order We must first determine whether this appeal is properly before this Court. It is well settled in this jurisdiction that appeals from interlocutory orders are not permitted unless they fall within certain well-defined exceptions. DeMaria v. Sabetta, 121 R.I. 648, 649, 402 A.2d 738, 739 (1979). There are two exceptions to this general rule: the first is statutory, and the second is judicial in origin. See G.L. 1956 § 9-24-7; McAuslan v. McAuslan, 34 R.I. 462, 472, 83 A. 837, 841 (1912). The first exception allows an appeal from an interlocutory decree that grants or continues an injunction, or orders a receiver, or orders a sale of real or personal property. Section 9-24-7. The second exception, first announced in McAuslan, 34 R.I. at 472, 83 A. at 841, permits appellate review of an “order or decree which, although in a strict sense interlocutory, does possess such an element of finality that action is called for before the case is finally terminated in order to prevent clearly imminent and irreparable harm.” Town of Lincoln v. Cournoyer, 118 R.I. 644, 648, 375 A.2d 410, 412-13 (1977). We have previously held that when an arbitrator’s jurisdiction is in question, a Superior Court order compelling arbitration has an element of finality that may be heard on appeal. Forte Brothers., Inc. v. Rhode Island Department of Transportation, 541 A.2d 1194, 1196 (R.I. 1988). In the present case, plaintiff challenges the Superior Court order allowing defendants to reject the arbitration award out of time and proceed with a trial in Superior Court. We view such an order, compelling parties to litigate in Superior Court after the twenty-day period in which to reject has expired, as analogous to the facts presented in Forte. Accordingly, we shall address the issues raised in this appeal. -4- C Rule 60(b) Inadvertence Although defendants failed to point to the proper rule in their motion, a motion to reject an arbitrator’s award out of time is governed by Rule 6(b). Rule 6(b)(2) allows a party to act after a time period has expired, if the failure to act was the result of “excusable neglect.” 2 Instead, defendants argued that their deadline miscalculation was the product of an “inadvertence” under Rule 60(b), and should, therefore, be excused. 3 Rule 6(b) does not provide a party relief due to an “inadvertence.” Rather, such relief is provided for under Rule 60(b). In the present case, upon notification that the twenty-day deadline to reject had expired, defendants moved for leave to reject the arbitrator’s award out of time. At no time was a judgment or a final order entered, from which defendants could seek relief under Rule 60(b). Because defendants sought additional time to reject the award beyond the twenty-day period specified in Rule 5(a) of the Superior Court Rules Governing Arbitration of Civil Actions, 4 they could not avail 2 Rule 6(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure provides in relevant part: “When by these rules or by a notice given thereunder or by order of court an act is required or allowed to be done at or within a specified time, the court for cause shown may at any time in its discretion *** (2) upon motion made after the expiration of the specified period permit the act to be done where the failure to act was the result of excusable neglect *** .” 3 Rule 60(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure provides in relevant part: “On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or a party’s legal representative from final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect ***.” 4 Rule 5(a) of the Superior Court Rules Governing Arbitration of Civil Actions provides: “Trial as of Right. Any party not in default for a reason which may result in judgment by default who is dissatisfied with an arbitrator’s award may have a trial as of right upon filing a written rejection of the award on an approved form within 20 days after the arbitrator’s ward has been filed, or within 20 days after an adverse determination of a Rule 3(j) motion to rehear.” -5- themselves to the Rule 60(b) “inadvertence” provision. Accordingly, defendants may obtain relief only if they satisfy the “excusable neglect” standard set forth in Rule 6(b). D Excusable Neglect “It is well settled that unexplained neglect, whether by a party or its counsel, standing alone, will not automatically excuse noncompliance with orderly procedural requirements.” Astors’ Beechwood, 659 A.2d at 1115 (citing Iddings, 657 A.2d at 553; Vitale v. Elliot, 120 R.I. 328, 331, 387 A.2d 1379, 1381 (1978)). We have defined “excusable neglect” as “[a] failure to take the proper steps at the proper time, not in consequence of the party’s own carelessness, inattention, or willful disregard of the process of the court, but in consequence of some unexpected or unavoidable hindrance or accident, or reliance on the care and vigilance of his counsel or on promises made by the adverse party.” Pleasant Management, LLC v. Carrasco, 960 A.2d 216, 224-25 (R.I. 2008) (quoting Jacksonbay Builders, Inc. v. Azarmi, 869 A.2d 580, 584 (R.I. 2005)). “Relief from a counsel’s failure to comply with procedural requirements will not be granted ‘unless it is first factually established that his [or her] neglect was occasioned by some extenuating circumstance of sufficient significance to render it excusable.’” Astors’ Beechwood, 659 A.2d at 1115 (quoting King v. Brown, 103 R.I. 154, 157, 235 A.2d 874, 875 (1967)). This Court has been steadfast in its resolve to adhere to the “established rules of procedure, ‘adherence to which is necessary [so] that parties may know their rights, that the real issues in controversy may be presented and determined, and that the business of the courts may be carried on with reasonable dispatch.’” Gray v. Stillman White Co., 522 A.2d 737, 741 (R.I. 1987) (quoting O’Connor v. Solomon, 131 A. 736, 736 (Conn. 1926)). Therefore, “[e]xcusable neglect that would qualify for relief from judgment is generally that course of conduct that a -6- reasonably prudent person would have taken under similar circumstances.” Astors’ Beechwood, 659 A.2d at 1115 (quoting Pari v. Pari, 558 A.2d 632, 635 (R.I. 1989). Moreover, “[t]he determination of excusable neglect ‘is at bottom an equitable one, taking account of all relevant circumstances surrounding the party’s omission.’” Pleasant Management, LLC, 960 A.2d at 225 (quoting Pioneer Investment Services Co. v. Brunswick Associates Limited Partnership, 507 U.S. 380, 395 (1993)). “These include *** the length of delay and its potential impact on judicial proceedings, the reason for the delay, including whether it was within the reasonable control of the movant, and whether the movant acted in good faith.” Id.; 960 A.2d at 225 (quoting Conetta v. National Hair Care Centers, Inc., 182 F.R.D. 403, 406 (D.R.I. 1998)). This Court previously has addressed a party’s late rejection of an arbitrator’s award in Astors’ Beechwood, 659 A.2d at 1115-16, in which we reversed the lower court’s finding of excusable neglect based on counsel’s busy schedule. There, counsel had tried an unrelated case in front of the same hearing justice during the rejection time period within which the award had to be rejected. Id. at 1112. Acknowledging his awareness that counsel had been engaged in a complex bench trial, the hearing justice found that his late rejection amounted to excusable neglect. Id. Reversing the hearing justice’s decision, this Court held that counsel’s justification for overlooking the filing deadline was not an “extenuating circumstance of sufficient significance” because counsel’s excuse that his heavy workload caused him to miss the deadline could be used truthfully in almost every situation. Id. at 1115-16. In another case addressing an attorney’s failure to timely reject an arbitrator’s award, this Court held that counsel’s explanation that he missed the filing deadline because he had been waiting to receive a copy of the award in the mail, was insufficient to warrant excusable neglect. Coutu v. Porter, 744 A.2d 405, 406 (R.I. 1999) (mem.). In that case, we held that the attorney’s -7- failure to file the rejection was “fully within his control,” and “[h]e had a responsibility to know the rules and procedures governing arbitration.” Id. And in yet another case dealing with a late rejection of a court-annexed arbitration award, this Court held that a pro se litigant’s lack of knowledge of the arbitration award rejection deadline did not amount to excusable neglect. Jacksonbay Builders, Inc., 869 A.2d at 584-85. Finally, a review of our cases in which we have found excusable neglect suggests that a calendaring error is insufficient to warrant such a finding. See, e.g., Pleasant Management, LLC, 960 A.2d at 225 (excusable neglect when attorney violated anti-contact rule by telling opposing party to “forget about court,” causing the default judgment against them); Gardner v. Baird, 871 A.2d 949, 952-53 (R.I. 2005) (excusable neglect where plaintiff’s failure to pay appellate court fees was immediately recognized and corrected before hearing date); State v. Dominguez, 679 A.2d 873, 874-75 (R.I. 1996) (finding excusable neglect when defendant missed ten-day motion to dismiss deadline because his counsel was not appointed until after deadline expired). These cases demonstrate that excusable neglect must involve something more than a careless deviation from standard office procedure or the failure to remember a deadline. Instead, for a party to establish excusable neglect, the party generally must show that the circumstances that caused the party to miss a deadline were out of that party or counsel’s control. In the present situation, the error in computing the number of days to file the rejection was entirely under defendants’ attorney’s control. So, too, was his decision to wait until the eleventh hour to file the rejection. The defendants do not proffer sufficient evidence that would justify rejecting on what they thought was the very last day. Moreover, defendants’ counsel had more than twenty days to reject the arbitrator’s award because the arbitrator initially had filed the award improperly. The defendants’ counsel noticed the arbitrator’s mistake and notified both him and Mr. Boranian that -8- the arbitrator needed to properly refile the award in accordance with the court-annexed arbitration rules. For this reason, defendants’ counsel not only had the twenty days from the arbitrator’s actual filing date of April 22, 2008, but also had additional time before the arbitrator properly filed the award in which to prepare his rejection. Upon reviewing the facts and circumstances surrounding defendants’ late rejection, we conclude that, despite the fact that defendants missed the deadline by a mere day, their justification for missing the deadline was not an “extenuating circumstance of sufficient significance.” Therefore, we hold that it was an abuse of discretion by the hearing justice to allow defendants to file their rejection out of time. E Superior Court Rule of Civil Procedure 6(d) Lastly, defendants argue that Rule 6(d) provides them with an additional day to reject the arbitrator’s award and that this additional day made their rejection timely. Rule 6(d) states, “[w]henever a party has the right or is required to do some act *** within a prescribed period after the service of a notice or other paper upon the party, and the notice or paper is served upon the party by mail, 1 day shall be added to the prescribed period.” (Emphasis added.) In contrast, Rule 5(a) of the Superior Court Rules Governing Arbitration of Civil Actions provides, “[a]ny party not in default *** who is dissatisfied with an arbitrator’s award may have a trial as of right upon filing a written rejection of the award on an approved form within 20 days after the arbitrator’s award has been filed ***.” (Emphasis added.) Rule 6(d) provides an additional day for a party to take action when the prescribed period begins once a party has been served by mail. Superior Court Arbitration Rule 5(a), however, requires a party to act within twenty days after the arbitration award has been filed with the Superior Court Arbitration Office. Rule 6(d) does not provide for service of the arbitrator’s -9- award upon the parties. Thus, defendants cannot avail themselves of the additional day provided by Rule 6(d) to enlarge the twenty-day rejection time period. See 1 Moore’s Federal Practice § 6.05 (Matthew Bender 3d ed. 2008). III Conclusion For the reasons stated herein, we reverse the order of the Superior Court. The record shall be remanded to the Superior Court for proceedings consistent with this opinion. - 10 - Supreme Court No. 2008-324-Appeal.

89,"State : v. : Timothy Scanlon. : Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty, Robinson, JJ., and Williams, C.J. (ret.). OPINION I Justice Flaherty, for the Court. Sometime after midnight on March 2, 2003, Janet S.1 left Buddy’s, a bar in Woonsocket. Janet, an admitted drug addict and prostitute, had spent most of the previous afternoon and evening consuming drugs, including cocaine, as well as a prodigious amount of alcohol.2 She was, in her own words, “wasted” and having trouble walking. Despite her condition, Janet was on her way home to meet one of her drug suppliers, from whom she intended to procure a “seventy piece,” an amount of cocaine that costs $70.3 1 We identify the complaining witness by pseudonym to protect her privacy. 2 In addition to the alcohol she consumed during the day, Janet testified that she drank three or four pitchers of beer at Buddy’s over a four-to-five hour period. 3 Besides using alcohol and illicit drugs, Janet testified that she ingested an impressive array of prescription drugs, including: Depro, Catrinal, Stellco, Zoloft, Lipitor, Morpass, Puridipass, Lantiss, and Flexor; she did not specify the dosages. Doctor Daniel Asiedu’s medical record of his physical examination of Janet on, March 2, 2003, lists her medications as Effexor, Seroquel, Cardizem, Paxil, and nitroglycerin; all with unknown doses. -1- As Janet made her way along Arnold Street, a vehicle, possibly a Jeep Cherokee or a Ford Bronco, slowed to the curb and a man asked her if she “wanted to party.” Janet understood that to mean that she would have sex with the man for money, or use drugs with him, or both, and so she got into the truck. Once inside, she and the driver quickly agreed that she would provide him with sexual services in exchange for $40. Although she did not initially recognize the driver, Janet later remembered that about two months before March 2, 2003, she had been hired for sex by the same man in exchange for $40. Also, Janet remembered that although the driver drove the same truck on that earlier occasion, she said the vehicle’s color had been changed. She was, however, unable to recall whether the vehicle was red or gray on March 2, 2003. After Janet got into the vehicle, the driver proceeded to the Sovereign Bank on Social Street in Woonsocket where he withdrew $100 from the automatic teller machine (ATM). Once the couple left the Sovereign Bank, however, Janet’s fortunes took a decided turn for the worse. Because she suddenly felt “weird” and desired to just go home, Janet asked the driver to drive her to her home rather than party. She directed the driver to take a left toward Providence Street. Instead, however, the driver took a sharp right toward Blackstone Street, and he suddenly became enraged at Janet. Just as suddenly, the driver began to stab Janet with a screwdriver in the head, face, and neck. As he assaulted her, the driver pressed Janet’s head to the seat and yelled at her to “shut up you whore you,” also calling her a “no good crack head whore.” Eventually the assailant brought the truck to a stop among several abandoned mills in northwestern Woonsocket. He continued to persistently prod the screwdriver into Janet’s head, face, and neck—which were now bleeding profusely—and he ordered her to remove the money -2- from her pocket. Janet complied. Next, the driver ordered Janet to remove her clothing. She took everything off except her socks. The driver penetrated Janet digitally, all the while berating and threatening her. Eventually the driver ceased these actions, reached across Janet to open the passenger’s door, and then literally kicked her out of the truck into the cold, snowy March night, wearing nothing but her socks. Unfortunately, this was not the end of Janet’s troubles that night because the driver followed her out of the truck. Although she struggled to resist her assailant, the man threw Janet down on the ground and sexually assaulted her again. Then, the assailant dragged her over to the truck and forced Janet to get on her knees in the snow and perform oral sex on him. Throughout this entire encounter, the driver continued to punch Janet with his fists. He also pulled the hair out of her scalp, and repeatedly stabbed her with the screwdriver. Finally, the attacker grabbed her right arm, yanking it back with enough force so that she could feel her shoulder snap. The assailant turned a deaf ear to Janet’s pleas to return at least some of her clothes as a protection against the cold and snow. After threatening to kill her if she talked to the police, he left the scene. Janet crawled into the middle of the road, where a passing motorist saw her and called the police. Officer George McMann of the Woonsocket Police Department arrived in the mill area between 2 a.m. and 2:20 a.m. to find Janet bleeding and sitting naked in the middle of Singleton Street. Janet told the officer that she had been raped and battered. Janet was taken by rescue to Landmark Medical Center emergency room. Daniel Asiedu, M.D., conducted a physical examination of Janet on March 2, 2003. He noted that Janet had “bruises and bleeding on the center of her scalp” and “lacerations and marks on her right cheek and her right side of her neck,” along with bruising of her knees and shins. The doctor’s -3- examination also revealed that her right arm was dislocated from her shoulder, requiring pain medication and the use of a sling. Although she initially was reluctant to do so, Janet made a statement to police shortly after she arrived at the hospital. In her statement, Janet said the driver sexually assaulted her by forcing her to perform oral sex and by forcibly penetrating her digitally. Significantly, however, she said she never had vaginal intercourse with her assailant.4 As to the identity of her assailant, on March 2, 2003, Janet told the officers that the driver was a blond white male. Initially, she did not remember that the driver had stopped at the Sovereign Bank ATM on Social Street. When the officers suggested the driver could be a John T.,5 Janet responded affirmatively that he was the one who committed the sexual assaults against her. In her later testimony, Janet admitted that she first told the officers that John had assaulted her because she thought it was he, and that she “just wanted it over.” But, when the officers later showed Janet a photo array containing John’s photograph, Janet did not identify him. Instead, she told the officers that she had been attacked by a younger, heavier man who did not wear glasses. It was not until April 2003 that Janet remembered that her attacker had stopped at the Sovereign Bank on Social Street and that he had withdrawn $100. She then realized that the bank surveillance camera may have photographed him as he withdrew his money. She notified the police, who quickly learned that a withdrawal had been made at 12:55 a.m. on March 2, 4 According to Dr. Asiedu’s record of examination of Janet, her account of the assault differed somewhat from her initial statement to the police. According to his record, Janet performed oral sex on her attacker in exchange for money. Then, the man became violent after he demanded vaginal intercourse and she refused. She said that the driver responded by stabbing her with the screwdriver. 5 We also identify this individual by pseudonym to protect his privacy. -4- 2003, from the Sovereign Bank ATM from an account linked to defendant, Timothy Scanlon. A photo of the individual making the withdrawal was obtained and that photograph was included in a new photo array shown to Janet. After reviewing the array, Janet instantly picked out defendant, Timothy Scanlon, as the man who sexually assaulted her. On April 15, 2003, Mr. Scanlon was arrested. He spoke with police, and denied that he attacked Janet. The defendant volunteered to provide a sample of his DNA; a later analysis proved that his DNA matched that extracted from Janet by anal and vaginal swabs. Further investigation by the police revealed that on April 10, 2003, Mr. Scanlon sold a 1988 GMC Jimmy to Dennis Fleurant of Privilege Auto Parts in Woonsocket for use as scrap metal. Mr. Fleurant described the vehicle as gray or silver, with some blue. When the police seized the 1988 GMC Jimmy, however, it was determined that the vehicle’s original paint color had been red (because the door jams and the hood’s interior were red), but that the truck had been repainted gray or silver. In April or May 2003 Lieutenant Timothy Paul, who then worked for the Woonsocket Bureau of Criminal Investigations, conducted a forensic analysis of the vehicle. Lieutenant Paul took photographs and administered a “luminal test” of the vehicle’s interior.6 The results of the luminal testing were negative; no traces of blood were found in the vehicle. A grand jury returned a ten-count indictment against Timothy Scanlon.7 Counts 1, 2, and 3 alleged that Timothy Scanlon violated G.L. 1956 §§ 11-37-2 and 11-37-3 by committing 6 Luminal is a substance that reacts to the chemicals in blood. If there is blood on the tested surface, such as the vehicle’s interior, the luminal will appear fluorescent and glow in total darkness. If there is no blood on the tested surface, the luminal will not glow. 7 Counts 7, 8, 9, and 10 alleged the kidnapping and assault with a dangerous weapon on a separate victim. The Attorney General dismissed counts 7 through 10 based on Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. A different person confessed to committing these offenses. -5- first-degree sexual assault against Janet. Count 4 alleged that Timothy Scanlon committed first degree robbery against Janet in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-39-1(a). Count 5 charged Timothy Scanlon with assaulting Janet with a dangerous weapon in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2. Count 6 alleged that Timothy Scanlon committed an assault and battery on Janet that resulted in serious bodily injury, also in violation of § 11-5-2. At trial the state offered testimony from Janet, Officer George McMann, Lt. Timothy Paul, Det. Todd Fernandes, salvage yard owner Dennis Fleurant, and Sharon Elizabeth Mallard, an analyst with the Rhode Island Department of Health. The defense offered testimony from Dr. Daniel Asiedu, Gale Lescarbeau (defendant’s mother), Roxanne Pare (the mother of defendant’s two children),8 and Charlotte Hopejoy Danis (a nurse at Landmark Medical Center). The trial justice granted the state’s motion in limine to exclude the testimony of proposed defense witness Richard Miles, Janet’s boyfriend at the time the crimes were committed. On July 28, 2005, a jury found Timothy Scanlon guilty on all remaining counts of the indictment that had been submitted to them. On September 28, 2005, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial. On November 25, 2005, the trial justice sentenced Timothy Scanlon to serve fifty years concurrently on counts 1, 2, 3, and 4 and a suspended sentence of twenty years with twenty years probation on counts 5 and 6, to be served consecutively to counts 1, 2, 3, and 4. The defendant timely appealed to this Court. On appeal, defendant asserts first, that the trial justice committed reversible error when he granted the prosecution’s motion in limine to exclude the testimony of Richard Miles. Second, defendant says that he was entitled to judgment of acquittal on count 6, felony assault. 8 Ms. Pare testified that defendant called her at 1:20 a.m. on March 2, 2003, and then came over to her home in Woonsocket shortly afterward. She also testified that defendant admitted to her, after his arrest for the sexual assaults on Janet, that he had a sexual encounter with Janet on March 2, 2003, but that he denied that he sexually assaulted her. -6- Third, defendant argues that he cannot be convicted on both counts 5 and 6, because these counts merged into a single count under double-jeopardy principles, and the trial justice erred in ruling otherwise. Fourth, defendant maintains that he is entitled to a new trial because the late disclosure of evidence by the prosecution constituted a violation of his due-process rights. We affirm the judgments of conviction. II A Exclusion of Richard Miles’s Testimony When she was cross-examined after being offered as a witness by the state, Janet testified that she spent the afternoon preceding her attack ingesting cocaine with her boyfriend, Richard Miles, just before Miles was to report to the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI) to begin serving a sentence. The defense then proffered that Miles would testify that he already was incarcerated on the morning of March 1, 2003, and that it therefore was not possible that Janet had shared cocaine with Miles later that day. In response, the state moved in limine, before defendant called his first witness, to exclude Richard Miles’s testimony, arguing that Rule 608(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence precluded the admissibility of Miles’s testimony because the proposed testimony was collateral to the central issues in the case and was offered solely to impeach Janet’s testimony through extrinsic evidence. Rule 608(b) states in relevant part “[s]pecific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness’ credibility * * * may not be proved by extrinsic evidence.”9 The state maintained that the identity of the person with 9 Rule 608(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence provides: “Specific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking or supporting the witness’ credibility, other than -7- whom Janet used cocaine at 3 p.m. on March 1, 2003, was not material evidence as to who assaulted her in the early morning of the next day. The defendant argued at trial that Richard Miles’s testimony was material and not collateral because it would suggest who the perpetrator was. The defendant implied that Janet lied about the person with whom she used cocaine in an effort to protect her attacker. The defendant also maintained that because evidence indicating who her attacker may have been was material to defendant’s guilt or innocence, Rule 608(b) should not apply. After hearing argument, the trial justice granted the motion in limine because he concluded that the testimony was collateral, and that extrinsic evidence may not be used to impeach a complaining witness. The trial justice ruled that the identity of Janet’s cocaine partner ten hours prior to the sexual assault was irrelevant to determining who perpetrated the assaults on her. Significantly, the trial justice emphasized that the complainant admitted to using cocaine and to being with other male customers after the cocaine use, but before she was assaulted. The trial justice reasoned that the break in time and the complainant’s interaction with multiple people after her cocaine use rendered the identity of her companion at 3 p.m. the preceding afternoon collateral to the issue of who attacked her in the early hours of the following morning. conviction of crime as provided in Rule 609, or, in the discretion of the trial judge, evidence of prior similar false accusations, may not be proved by extrinsic evidence. They may, however, in the discretion of the court, if probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness, be inquired into on cross-examination of the witness (1) concerning the witness’ character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, or (2) concerning the character for truthfulness or untruthfulness of another witness as to which character the witness being cross-examined has testified.” -8- On appeal, defendant renews his argument that the trial justice erred in granting the state’s motion in limine because Richard Miles’s testimony was material, not collateral, and therefore Rule 608(b) was not a basis for excluding this testimony.10 Standard of Review “When reviewing the grant or denial of a motion in limine, this Court will consider only whether the challenged evidence was proper and admissible and, if not, whether there was sufficient prejudice to constitute reversible error.” State v. Gomes, 881 A.2d 97, 111 (R.I. 2005). In light of this standard, this Court must determine whether Richard Miles’s proposed testimony that he was imprisoned on March 1, 2003, and therefore could not have used cocaine in Woonsocket at 3 p.m., as Janet testified, was proper and admissible at defendant’s criminal trial. If this Court were to conclude that the trial justice erred by excluding Richard Miles’s testimony, then we must determine whether the exclusion of this testimony was sufficiently prejudicial to warrant reversing the jury’s verdict. See Gomes, 881 A.2d at 111. Rule 608(b) The defendant argues that Richard Miles’s testimony was material and relevant, and therefore not barred by Rule 608(b), because it would focus the jury’s attention on the possibility that one of Janet’s companions that afternoon later may have attacked her, or, alternatively, that one of her several drug dealers may have assaulted her. 10 The defendant also raised, for the first time on appeal, an additional argument that the trial justice’s refusal to allow defendant to call Richard Miles to the stand denied him his Sixth Amendment right to present an effective defense. This Court will not address defendant’s contention that his Sixth Amendment right to present an effective defense was violated because this issue never was raised at trial and therefore is waived on appeal. See State v. Merida, 960 A.2d 228, 236 (R.I. 2008) (holding defendant’s Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause argument waived, and therefore not reviewable on appeal, because it never was presented at trial). Even if we were to consider defendant’s argument, it is axiomatic that a defendant has no right to introduce evidence that is inadmissible under our well-developed rules of evidence. -9- This Court has consistently held that “[a] witness may not be impeached on collateral matters by the introduction of extrinsic evidence. The cross-examiner is restricted to the answers of the witness.” State v. Martinez, 824 A.2d 443, 449 (R.I. 2003) (quoting State v. Tutt, 622 A.2d 459, 462 (R.I. 1993) and State v. Brown, 574 A.2d 745, 749 (R.I. 1990)). Evidence is not collateral if the evidence is admissible for a reason other than to contradict the witness’s testimony. Id. (citing State v. Souza, 708 A.2d 899, 904 (R.I. 1998)). In Martinez, this Court held that proffered testimony concerning what occurred several hours before a sexual assault occurred, that was unrelated to the sexual assault at issue, was collateral because the testimony’s “sole purpose was to impeach [the complainant] on collateral matters.” Martinez, 824 A.2d at 449. When a criminal defendant accuses someone else of committing the crime with which he is charged, the defendant must make some reasonably specific offer of proof as to who the perpetrator might be. Gomes, 881 A.2d at 111 (citing State v. Gazerro, 420 A.2d 816, 824-25 (R.I. 1980)). Absent such an offer of proof, this evidence could constitute “an impermissible invitation to the jury to speculate on a collateral matter.” Id. at 112 (quoting Gazerro, 420 A.2d at 825). In Gomes, the state filed a motion in limine to exclude a police report, prepared one month before the victim’s murder, in which the victim alleged that her former boyfriend was harassing her. Id. at 109-10. The defendant, who was not the former boyfriend, wanted the police report admitted to show that the former boyfriend had a motive to murder the victim. Id. at 111. We affirmed the trial justice’s grant of the motion in limine, in part because the defendant failed to provide any evidence that would demonstrate that the former boyfriend murdered the victim, or that this person was even in the area where the murder occurred. Id. at 111-12. - 10 - Here, the proffered testimony of Richard Miles could be used only to impeach Janet’s credibility on a collateral issue. We are not persuaded by defendant’s argument that the identity of the person with whom Janet used drugs at 3 p.m. on March 1, 2003, sheds any light on the issue of defendant’s guilt or innocence. Scanlon’s suggestion about who else may have committed the crime is demonstrably thinner than that in Gomes. The defendant does not imply that any particular individual may have committed these crimes, other than unnamed drug dealers, nor does he advance any theory as to why someone else would have assaulted Janet. In our opinion, Rule 608(b) barred defendant’s use of Richard Miles’s testimony to impeach Janet’s recollection of the identity of her cocaine-using partner. Therefore, the trial justice did not err when he granted the state’s motion in limine.11 B Felony Assault Conviction The defendant raises two challenges with respect to his conviction for felony assault based upon the dislocation of Janet’s shoulder. First, he argues that his motion for judgment of acquittal pursuant to Rule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure should have been granted because, as a matter of law, the injury to Janet’s shoulder fails to satisfy § 11-5- 2(c)(2)’s requirement that the bodily injury involve a “protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily part, member or organ.” Second, defendant argues that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution and of article 1, section 7, of the Rhode Island Constitution bar his convictions for both count 5 (felony assault—assault with a dangerous 11 We continue to cast a jaundiced eye to the overuse of motions in limine. See State v. Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 563-64, 563 n.1 (R.I. 2009) (“admonish[ing] the state to wield its in limine sword carefully” to preserve defendant’s constitutional safeguards). - 11 - weapon) and count 6 (felony assault—assault or battery resulting in serious bodily injury). We conclude, however, that defendant failed to preserve either argument for appeal. 1 Rule 29 Motion for Judgment of Acquittal As we have said on numerous occasions, to preserve a right to appeal the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal under Rule 29 made at the close of the state’s case, a defendant must renew the motion after he presents his own case. See State v. Andreozzi, 798 A.2d 372, 374 (R.I. 2002). Although defendant appropriately moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the state’s case, he failed to renew his motion after he called his own witnesses. Consequently, defendant’s failure to renew his motion for judgment of acquittal forecloses his right to seek review of the trial justice’s denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal. Id.12 Yet, even if defendant had preserved his right to appeal the denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal, we nonetheless would agree with the trial justice’s adverse ruling. The defendant argues that he was entitled to a judgment of acquittal on count 6, felony assault in violation of § 11-5-2, because the injuries to Janet’s arm and shoulder did not rise to the level of severity necessary to support a conviction. Section 11-5-2(c) defines a “serious bodily injury” as a: 12 The waiver of a right to appeal a denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal pursuant to Rule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure does not operate as a waiver of the right to appeal the denial of a motion for new trial if the motion for a new trial is premised upon an insufficient evidence of guilt claim. See State v. Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 568-69 (R.I. 2009); State v. Colbert, 549 A.2d 1021, 1023 (R.I. 1988) (determining the defendant did not waive right to have sufficiency of evidence reviewed in motion for new trial even though the defendant failed to renew motion for acquittal). No such motion is made here because defendant failed to properly raise, either in Superior Court or in this Court on appeal, that the evidence was insufficient to convict him. - 12 - “physical injury that: (1) [c]reates a substantial risk of death; (2) [c]auses protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily part, member or organ; or (3) [c]auses serious permanent disfigurement or circumcises, excises or infibulates the whole or any part of the labia majora or labia minora or clitoris of a person.” The defendant argues that Janet’s dislocated right arm, for which she was required to use a sling for six weeks, along with pain medications, is insufficient to constitute a “protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily part” under the statute. Recently, in State v. Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 573 (R.I. 2009), we were asked to determine what constitutes a serious permanent disfigurement under subsection (c)(3) of the definition of serious bodily injury in § 11-5-2. In that case, we held that the question of “[w]hether the injuries inflicted * * * were serious and disfiguring were factual matters for the jury’s consideration.” Clark, 974 A.2d at 573. It is similarly our opinion that what constitutes a “protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily part, member or organ” under subsection (c)(2) of 11-5-2 is a factual matter left for the jury’s determination. The jury instructions appropriately required the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt “that the defendant assaulted [Janet] and that in doing so he seriously injured her shoulder area such that she lost the functional use of her shoulder or arm for a protracted period of time, that is to say a prolonged or extended period of time.” The defendant never objected to this jury instruction. The jury heard evidence from Janet that she felt her shoulder break when defendant grabbed her arm and that it was necessary for her to wear a sling for six weeks and take pain medications. Further, Dr. Asiedu testified that Janet suffered a dislocation of her right arm. Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the state, there is no question that Janet’s injury cleared the statutory hurdle and properly was submitted to the jury. 2 - 13 - Merger of Counts 5 and 6 Although we also are satisfied that whether count 6 (felony assault—assault or battery resulting in serious bodily injury) merged with count 5 (felony assault—assault with a dangerous weapon), therefore implicating the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions was not preserved, we nonetheless address this argument. We have held that a defense based upon double jeopardy must be raised in a pretrial motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(2) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. See State v. Day, 925 A.2d 962, 977 (R.I. 2007). Rule 12(b)(2) provides that “[t]he defense of double jeopardy * * * may be raised only by motion before trial.” See also Day, 925 A.2d at 977; State v. Grayhurst, 852 A.2d 491, 500 (R.I. 2004). Rule 12(b)(2) further states that “[f]ailure to present any such defense or objection as herein provided constitutes a waiver thereof, but the court for cause shown may grant relief from the waiver.” See also State v. McGuy, 841 A.2d 1109, 1115 (R.I. 2003) (stressing defendant needs to demonstrate “some compelling reason to grant relief from the waiver sanction of Rule 12(b)(2)”).13 In this case, defendant did not file a Rule 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss. Therefore, defendant is barred from raising double jeopardy as a defense unless he can demonstrate some extraordinary justification for not doing so earlier. On the other hand, defendant’s trial occurred in 2005, almost two years before the Day decision made the law explicitly clear. Cf Day, 925 A.2d at 977 (holding that cause existed in part because of murkiness in the case law on this issue). Further, although no motion was filed under Rule 12, the trial justice nonetheless 13 In State v. Day, 925 A.2d 962, 977 (R.I. 2007), we determined that cause existed because this Court previously had not “focused with maximal explicitness on the necessity of bringing a merger argument to the attention of the trial court through a pretrial [Super.R.Crim.P.] 12(b)(2) motion” and because the trial justice dealt with the merger issue when considering the defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal. - 14 - entertained argument on this issue when he heard defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal and he ruled on the issue. Under all the circumstances present here, it is our opinion that defendant’s double-jeopardy claim, although not properly raised, should be considered by this Court. To determine whether a criminal defendant is imperiled by double jeopardy, this Court applies the “same evidence” test first pronounced in Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299 (1932). See State v. Davis, 120 R.I. 82, 86, 384 A.2d 1061, 1064 (1978) (acknowledging adoption of Blockburger test). Under the same-evidence test, “where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.” Davis, 120 R.I. at 86, 384 A.2d at 1064 (quoting Blockburger, 284 U.S. at 304); see also State v. Bolarinho, 850 A.2d 907, 909 (R.I. 2004). This is not the first time that we have addressed the issue of whether multiple assault convictions merged after a double-jeopardy analysis. In Bolarinho, 850 A.2d at 911, the defendant, in a single incident, repeatedly kicked the complainant. From this single occurrence, the defendant was charged with two counts of felony assault in violation of § 11-5-2; one count for committing a felony assault by use of a dangerous weapon, to wit a shod foot, and one count for committing a felony assault that resulted in serious bodily injury. Bolarinho, 850 A.2d at 908-09. We considered whether “a conviction for both assault with a dangerous weapon and assault resulting in serious bodily injury resulting from the same transaction may stand.” Id. at 911. The Court held that when the evidence used to convict the defendant of assault with a dangerous weapon and assault resulting in serious bodily injury is identical, the counts merge under a double-jeopardy analysis. Id. - 15 - Alternatively, in State v. Haney, 842 A.2d 1083, 1084-85 (R.I. 2004), we considered whether a defendant’s two domestic-assault convictions on the same complainant on the same night could withstand scrutiny under a double-jeopardy analysis. The incidents were separated by fifteen minutes, and one assault occurred in Burrillville while the other assault occurred in Glocester. Id. The defendant argued that, because he and the complainant were together in a car throughout the entire fifteen-minute interval between assaults, both were part of a continuing transaction. Id. at 1085. We rejected the defendant’s double-jeopardy argument because the acts underlying the two convictions were separate acts. Id. The victim was identical, but the assaults occurred at different times and in different towns, and the defendant had “sufficient opportunity to reflect on his assaultive conduct and to forbear from committing another crime” before he committed the second assault. Id. Applying the Blockburger “same-evidence” test to the case before us, we first consider whether the facts underlying counts 5 and 6 constitute the “same act or transaction.” Davis, 120 R.I. at 86, 384 A.2d at 1064 (quoting Blockburger, 284 U.S. at 304). Count 5 alleged that defendant assaulted the complainant with a screwdriver, a dangerous weapon. Conversely, count 6 alleged that defendant committed a felony assault on the complainant by later grabbing her arm and dislocating it. On their face, the facts alleged in each count do not constitute the “same act or transaction,” because each assault arises from a different act. Nothing in the record indicates that the use of the screwdriver caused the complainant’s right arm to dislocate. Unlike in Bolarinho, in which the same evidence of kicking the victim was used to support both an assault with a dangerous weapon and an assault resulting in serious bodily injury, here the two counts are supported by different evidence. See Bolarinho, 850 A.2d at 911. Therefore, the trial justice - 16 - was correct when he ruled that counts 5 and 6 did not merge and did not violate defendant’s constitutional protection against being placed into double jeopardy. C Motion for New Trial In his motion for a new trial before the trial justice, and now on appeal, defendant advances two theories of relief. First, he says that the evidence introduced at his trial was not sufficient to support a conviction. Second, defendant claims that he is entitled to a new trial because the state twice violated its discovery obligations by failing to disclose, until the eve of trial, evidence that was critical to his defense. Therefore, he says, he was denied an “ample and sufficient opportunity to establish the best and fullest defense available to him.” State v. Scurry, 636 A.2d 719, 725 (R.I. 1994). Standard of Review We review a trial justice’s decision on a motion for a new trial with deference. See State v. Flori, 963 A.2d 932, 937 (R.I. 2009). If the trial justice communicates a passable rationale for his decision, his ruling “is entitled to great weight.” Id. (quoting State v. Bergevine, 942 A.2d 974, 981 (R.I. 2008)). We will not overturn the trial justice’s denial of a motion for new trial “unless the trial justice was clearly wrong or * * * overlooked or misconceived material and relevant evidence that related to a critical issue in the case.” Id. After carefully reviewing the record in this case, we conclude that neither of defendant’s arguments have merit and that the trial justice was correct when he denied the motion. We address each argument individually. 1 Claim of Innocence - 17 - The trial justice clearly articulated his rationale when he denied the motion for a new trial. He said that he did not disagree with the jury’s finding of guilt on all six counts. Reviewing the testimony, the complainant’s injuries, and her medical records, the trial justice ruled that the assaults had occurred just as she said they did. Despite the conflicts between Janet’s earlier statements to the police and medical personnel and her trial testimony, he nonetheless found her to be a credible witness. Further, the trial justice said that he understood why the jury would discount the testimony of Roxanne Pare, defendant’s former girlfriend and the mother of his two children, with respect to the 1:20 a.m. phone call and subsequent visit by defendant. Finally, the trial justice stated “the credible evidence fairly and beyond a reasonable doubt pointed to this defendant, Tim Scanlon, as the man who abused [Janet].” The trial justice’s decision on the motion for a new trial is not clearly wrong, nor did he overlook material evidence. See Flori, 963 A.2d at 937. We agree with his decision and will not disturb it. 2 Discovery Violations The defendant argues that two issues, the late disclosure of the complainant’s delayed memory of sexual intercourse with her attacker, and the tardy notice on Lt. Paul’s forensic examination of the 1988 GMC Jimmy, warrant a new trial in the interests of justice. The defendant contends that he was denied “ample and sufficient opportunity to establish the best and fullest defense available to him.” As a threshold matter, the state argues that defendant has failed to preserve his right to appeal the two alleged discovery violations because he failed to seasonably object to the introduction of this testimony. The state argues that, even though Rule 33 of the Superior Court - 18 - Rules of Criminal Procedure permits a court to order a new trial “in the interest of justice,” it does not remove the burden from defendant to contemporaneously object at trial.14 First we consider the state’s contention that defendant waived his right to appeal the late disclosure of both Janet’s recovered memory and Lt. Paul’s forensic examination of the 1988 GMC Jimmy. The state is correct that defendant never objected to the complainant’s recovered memory, either when it was first disclosed to him, or when Janet was on the witness stand. Likewise, defendant never objected to the state’s calling of Lt. Paul to testify about the processing of the 1988 GMC Jimmy with luminal.15 The defendant’s only objection on the record occurred when Lt. Paul testified regarding false positive results from luminal testing.16 14 The Committee Notes for the 2002 Amendment to Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure state that “[i]t is not intended nor anticipated that the ability to raise an error of law on a motion for new trial will change the * * * harmless error, plain error, and contemporaneous objection rules generally applicable to trials.” 15 At trial, Lt. Paul testified that luminal testing can result in false positives in which the luminal test is positive but not as a result of blood. For example, some cleaning products may result in a false positive. Lieutenant Paul also testified that no hair or fibers that would connect the truck to Janet were found in the vehicle. After completing his forensic examination, Lt. Paul determined that nothing was found in the truck that should be sent to the state crime lab for further testing. The state did not disclose Lt. Paul’s examination of the vehicle or its negative results until just before the trial began. 16 The record of defendant’s objection is as follows: “[Prosecutor]: What do you mean by that? “[Lieutenant Paul]: What I mean by that is luminal will react with certain cleaning based product cleansers. Seeing the vehicle was crushed in a pile of other vehicles, we were getting many pieces of things that fluoresce without a positive reaction for being a pool of blood or for what we were looking for any kind of evidentiary value. “[Prosecutor]: But if there is blood in the car at one point and then cleaned it would be a false positive? “[Defense Counsel]: Objection. “[Lieutenant Paul]: It’s possible, I believe. “[Court]: I’ll permit. “[Prosecutor]: Sorry. I didn’t hear your answer. “[Lieutenant Paul]: It’s possible.” - 19 - The defendant never requested a continuance so that he could evaluate or prepare for the tardily provided material. When defendant raised his alleged discovery violations arguments before the trial justice in defendant’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice noted in his ruling that defendant “did not object * * * during the course of the trial.” This Court has held that a “defendant may not press * * * objections [on appeal] when they were available for him to raise before or at the trial, yet he neglected to do so.” Croan ex rel. State v. Cronan, 774 A.2d 866, 879 (R.I. 2001) (citing State v. Anderson, 752 A.2d 946, 948 (R.I. 2000)). In State v. Crudup, 842 A.2d 1069, 1073 (R.I. 2004), we held that even a due process argument is waived for appeal if defendant had an opportunity to raise this argument in a hearing but failed to do so. After a careful review of the record in this case, we hold that the defendant was precluded from raising a claim in his motion for a new trial, and here on appeal, that the late discovery of Janet’s recovered memory and Lt. Paul’s testing of the 1988 GMC Jimmy prejudiced him because he failed to object either at the time this evidence was disclosed to him or introduced at trial. III Conclusion For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgments of convictions in this case. The record shall be returned to the Superior Court. - 20 - Supreme Court No. 2007-330-C.A. (P1/03-3328A) State : v. : Timothy Scanlon. :",criminal,affirm,"['I', 'Justice Flaherty, for the Court. Sometime after midnight on March 2, 2003, Janet S.1 left Buddy’s, a bar in Woonsocket. Janet, an admitted drug addict and prostitute, had spent most of the previous afternoon and evening consuming drugs, including cocaine, as well as a prodigious amount of alcohol.2 She was, in her own words, “wasted” and having trouble walking. Despite her condition, Janet was on her way home to meet one of her drug suppliers, from whom she intended to procure a “seventy piece,” an amount of cocaine that costs $70.3 1', 'We identify the complaining witness by pseudonym to protect her privacy. 2', 'In addition to the alcohol she consumed during the day, Janet testified that she drank three or four pitchers of beer at Buddy’s over a four-to-five hour period. 3', 'Besides using alcohol and illicit drugs, Janet testified that she ingested an impressive array of prescription drugs, including: Depro, Catrinal, Stellco, Zoloft, Lipitor, Morpass, Puridipass, Lantiss, and Flexor; she did not specify the dosages. Doctor Daniel Asiedu’s medical record of his physical examination of Janet on, March 2, 2003, lists her medications as Effexor, Seroquel, Cardizem, Paxil, and nitroglycerin; all with unknown doses.', '-1-', 'As Janet made her way along Arnold Street, a vehicle, possibly a Jeep Cherokee or a Ford Bronco, slowed to the curb and a man asked her if she “wanted to party.” Janet understood that to mean that she would have sex with the man for money, or use drugs with him, or both, and so she got into the truck. Once inside, she and the driver quickly agreed that she would provide him with sexual services in exchange for $40. Although she did not initially recognize the driver, Janet later remembered that about two months before March 2, 2003, she had been hired for sex by the same man in exchange for $40. Also, Janet remembered that although the driver drove the same truck on that earlier occasion, she said the vehicle’s color had been changed. She was, however, unable to recall whether the vehicle was red or gray on March 2, 2003. After Janet got into the vehicle, the driver proceeded to the Sovereign Bank on Social Street in Woonsocket where he withdrew $100 from the automatic teller machine (ATM).', 'Once the couple left the Sovereign Bank, however, Janet’s fortunes took a decided turn for the worse. Because she suddenly felt “weird” and desired to just go home, Janet asked the driver to drive her to her home rather than party. She directed the driver to take a left toward Providence Street. Instead, however, the driver took a sharp right toward Blackstone Street, and he suddenly became enraged at Janet. Just as suddenly, the driver began to stab Janet with a screwdriver in the head, face, and neck. As he assaulted her, the driver pressed Janet’s head to the seat and yelled at her to “shut up you whore you,” also calling her a “no good crack head whore.”', 'Eventually the assailant brought the truck to a stop among several abandoned mills in northwestern Woonsocket. He continued to persistently prod the screwdriver into Janet’s head, face, and neck—which were now bleeding profusely—and he ordered her to remove the money', '-2- from her pocket. Janet complied. Next, the driver ordered Janet to remove her clothing. She took everything off except her socks.', 'The driver penetrated Janet digitally, all the while berating and threatening her. Eventually the driver ceased these actions, reached across Janet to open the passenger’s door, and then literally kicked her out of the truck into the cold, snowy March night, wearing nothing but her socks.', 'Unfortunately, this was not the end of Janet’s troubles that night because the driver followed her out of the truck. Although she struggled to resist her assailant, the man threw Janet down on the ground and sexually assaulted her again. Then, the assailant dragged her over to the truck and forced Janet to get on her knees in the snow and perform oral sex on him. Throughout this entire encounter, the driver continued to punch Janet with his fists. He also pulled the hair out of her scalp, and repeatedly stabbed her with the screwdriver. Finally, the attacker grabbed her right arm, yanking it back with enough force so that she could feel her shoulder snap.', 'The assailant turned a deaf ear to Janet’s pleas to return at least some of her clothes as a protection against the cold and snow. After threatening to kill her if she talked to the police, he left the scene. Janet crawled into the middle of the road, where a passing motorist saw her and called the police. Officer George McMann of the Woonsocket Police Department arrived in the mill area between 2 a.m. and 2:20 a.m. to find Janet bleeding and sitting naked in the middle of Singleton Street. Janet told the officer that she had been raped and battered.', 'Janet was taken by rescue to Landmark Medical Center emergency room. Daniel Asiedu, M.D., conducted a physical examination of Janet on March 2, 2003. He noted that Janet had “bruises and bleeding on the center of her scalp” and “lacerations and marks on her right cheek and her right side of her neck,” along with bruising of her knees and shins. The doctor’s', '-3- examination also revealed that her right arm was dislocated from her shoulder, requiring pain medication and the use of a sling.', 'Although she initially was reluctant to do so, Janet made a statement to police shortly after she arrived at the hospital. In her statement, Janet said the driver sexually assaulted her by forcing her to perform oral sex and by forcibly penetrating her digitally. Significantly, however, she said she never had vaginal intercourse with her assailant.4', 'As to the identity of her assailant, on March 2, 2003, Janet told the officers that the driver was a blond white male. Initially, she did not remember that the driver had stopped at the Sovereign Bank ATM on Social Street. When the officers suggested the driver could be a John T.,5 Janet responded affirmatively that he was the one who committed the sexual assaults against her. In her later testimony, Janet admitted that she first told the officers that John had assaulted her because she thought it was he, and that she “just wanted it over.” But, when the officers later showed Janet a photo array containing John’s photograph, Janet did not identify him. Instead, she told the officers that she had been attacked by a younger, heavier man who did not wear glasses.', 'It was not until April 2003 that Janet remembered that her attacker had stopped at the Sovereign Bank on Social Street and that he had withdrawn $100. She then realized that the bank surveillance camera may have photographed him as he withdrew his money. She notified the police, who quickly learned that a withdrawal had been made at 12:55 a.m. on March 2, 4', 'According to Dr. Asiedu’s record of examination of Janet, her account of the assault differed somewhat from her initial statement to the police. According to his record, Janet performed oral sex on her attacker in exchange for money. Then, the man became violent after he demanded vaginal intercourse and she refused. She said that the driver responded by stabbing her with the screwdriver. 5', 'We also identify this individual by pseudonym to protect his privacy.', '-4- 2003, from the Sovereign Bank ATM from an account linked to defendant, Timothy Scanlon. A photo of the individual making the withdrawal was obtained and that photograph was included in a new photo array shown to Janet.', 'After reviewing the array, Janet instantly picked out defendant, Timothy Scanlon, as the man who sexually assaulted her.', 'On April 15, 2003, Mr. Scanlon was arrested. He spoke with police, and denied that he attacked Janet. The defendant volunteered to provide a sample of his DNA; a later analysis proved that his DNA matched that extracted from Janet by anal and vaginal swabs.', 'Further investigation by the police revealed that on April 10, 2003, Mr. Scanlon sold a 1988 GMC Jimmy to Dennis Fleurant of Privilege Auto Parts in Woonsocket for use as scrap metal. Mr. Fleurant described the vehicle as gray or silver, with some blue. When the police seized the 1988 GMC Jimmy, however, it was determined that the vehicle’s original paint color had been red (because the door jams and the hood’s interior were red), but that the truck had been repainted gray or silver.', 'In April or May 2003 Lieutenant Timothy Paul, who then worked for the Woonsocket Bureau of Criminal Investigations, conducted a forensic analysis of the vehicle. Lieutenant Paul took photographs and administered a “luminal test” of the vehicle’s interior.6 The results of the luminal testing were negative; no traces of blood were found in the vehicle.', 'A grand jury returned a ten-count indictment against Timothy Scanlon.7', 'Counts 1, 2, and 3 alleged that Timothy Scanlon violated G.L. 1956 §§ 11-37-2 and 11-37-3 by committing 6', 'Luminal is a substance that reacts to the chemicals in blood. If there is blood on the tested surface, such as the vehicle’s interior, the luminal will appear fluorescent and glow in total darkness. If there is no blood on the tested surface, the luminal will not glow. 7', 'Counts 7, 8, 9, and 10 alleged the kidnapping and assault with a dangerous weapon on a separate victim.

The trial justice ruled that the identity of Janet’s cocaine partner ten hours prior to the sexual assault was irrelevant to determining who perpetrated the assaults on her.', 'Significantly, the trial justice emphasized that the complainant admitted to using cocaine and to being with other male customers after the cocaine use, but before she was assaulted. The trial justice reasoned that the break in time and the complainant’s interaction with multiple people after her cocaine use rendered the identity of her companion at 3 p.m. the preceding afternoon collateral to the issue of who attacked her in the early hours of the following morning.', 'conviction of crime as provided in Rule 609, or, in the discretion of', 'the trial judge, evidence of prior similar false accusations, may not', 'be proved by extrinsic evidence.

Gomes, 881 A.2d 97, 111 (R.I. 2005). In light of this standard, this Court must determine whether Richard Miles’s proposed testimony that he was imprisoned on March 1, 2003, and therefore could not have used cocaine in Woonsocket at 3 p.m., as Janet testified, was proper and admissible at defendant’s criminal trial. If this Court were to conclude that the trial justice erred by excluding Richard Miles’s testimony, then we must determine whether the exclusion of this testimony was sufficiently prejudicial to warrant reversing the jury’s verdict. See Gomes, 881 A.2d at 111.', 'Rule 608(b)', 'The defendant argues that Richard Miles’s testimony was material and relevant, and therefore not barred by Rule 608(b), because it would focus the jury’s attention on the possibility that one of Janet’s companions that afternoon later may have attacked her, or, alternatively, that one of her several drug dealers may have assaulted her. 10', 'The defendant also raised, for the first time on appeal, an additional argument that the trial justice’s refusal to allow defendant to call Richard Miles to the stand denied him his Sixth Amendment right to present an effective defense. This Court will not address defendant’s contention that his Sixth Amendment right to present an effective defense was violated because this issue never was raised at trial and therefore is waived on appeal. See State v. Merida, 960 A.2d 228, 236 (R.I. 2008) (holding defendant’s Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause argument waived, and therefore not reviewable on appeal, because it never was presented at trial). Even if we were to consider defendant’s argument, it is axiomatic that a defendant has no right to introduce evidence that is inadmissible under our well-developed rules of evidence.', '-9-', 'This Court has consistently held that “[a] witness may not be impeached on collateral matters by the introduction of extrinsic evidence. The cross-examiner is restricted to the answers of the witness.” State v. Martinez, 824 A.2d 443, 449 (R.I. 2003) (quoting State v. Tutt, 622 A.2d 459, 462 (R.I. 1993) and State v.

Souza, 708 A.2d 899, 904 (R.I. 1998)). In Martinez, this Court held that proffered testimony concerning what occurred several hours before a sexual assault occurred, that was unrelated to the sexual assault at issue, was collateral because the testimony’s “sole purpose was to impeach [the complainant] on collateral matters.” Martinez, 824 A.2d at 449.', 'When a criminal defendant accuses someone else of committing the crime with which he is charged, the defendant must make some reasonably specific offer of proof as to who the perpetrator might be.

Absent such an offer of proof, this evidence could constitute “an impermissible invitation to the jury to speculate on a collateral matter.” Id. at 112 (quoting Gazerro, 420 A.2d at 825). In Gomes, the state filed a motion in limine to exclude a police report, prepared one month before the victim’s murder, in which the victim alleged that her former boyfriend was harassing her. Id. at 109-10. The defendant, who was not the former boyfriend, wanted the police report admitted to show that the former boyfriend had a motive to murder the victim. Id. at 111. We affirmed the trial justice’s grant of the motion in limine, in part because the defendant failed to provide any evidence that would demonstrate that the former boyfriend murdered the victim, or that this person was even in the area where the murder occurred. Id. at 111-12.', '- 10 -', 'Here, the proffered testimony of Richard Miles could be used only to impeach Janet’s credibility on a collateral issue. We are not persuaded by defendant’s argument that the identity of the person with whom Janet used drugs at 3 p.m. on March 1, 2003, sheds any light on the issue of defendant’s guilt or innocence.', 'Scanlon’s suggestion about who else may have committed the crime is demonstrably thinner than that in Gomes. The defendant does not imply that any particular individual may have committed these crimes, other than unnamed drug dealers, nor does he advance any theory as to why someone else would have assaulted Janet.', 'In our opinion, Rule 608(b) barred defendant’s use of Richard Miles’s testimony to impeach Janet’s recollection of the identity of her cocaine-using partner. Therefore, the trial justice did not err when he granted the state’s motion in limine.11', 'B', 'Felony Assault Conviction', 'The defendant raises two challenges with respect to his conviction for felony assault based upon the dislocation of Janet’s shoulder. First, he argues that his motion for judgment of acquittal pursuant to Rule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure should have been granted because, as a matter of law, the injury to Janet’s shoulder fails to satisfy § 11-5- 2(c)(2)’s requirement that the bodily injury involve a “protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily part, member or organ.” Second, defendant argues that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution and of article 1, section 7, of the Rhode Island Constitution bar his convictions for both count 5 (felony assault—assault with a dangerous 11', 'We continue to cast a jaundiced eye to the overuse of motions in limine.

We conclude, however, that defendant failed to preserve either argument for appeal.', '1', 'Rule 29 Motion for Judgment of Acquittal', 'As we have said on numerous occasions, to preserve a right to appeal the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal under Rule 29 made at the close of the state’s case, a defendant must renew the motion after he presents his own case. See State v. Andreozzi, 798 A.2d 372, 374 (R.I. 2002). Although defendant appropriately moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the state’s case, he failed to renew his motion after he called his own witnesses. Consequently, defendant’s failure to renew his motion for judgment of acquittal forecloses his right to seek review of the trial justice’s denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal. Id.12', 'Yet, even if defendant had preserved his right to appeal the denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal, we nonetheless would agree with the trial justice’s adverse ruling.', 'The defendant argues that he was entitled to a judgment of acquittal on count 6, felony assault in violation of § 11-5-2, because the injuries to Janet’s arm and shoulder did not rise to the level of severity necessary to support a conviction.

See State v. Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 568-69 (R.I. 2009); State v. Colbert, 549 A.2d 1021, 1023 (R.I. 1988) (determining the defendant did not waive right to have sufficiency of evidence reviewed in motion for new trial even though the defendant failed to renew motion for acquittal).

Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 573 (R.I. 2009), we were asked to determine what constitutes a serious permanent disfigurement under subsection (c)(3) of the definition of serious bodily injury in § 11-5-2. In that case, we held that the question of “[w]hether the injuries inflicted * * * were serious and disfiguring were factual matters for the jury’s consideration.” Clark, 974 A.2d at 573. It is similarly our opinion that what constitutes a “protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily part, member or organ” under subsection (c)(2) of 11-5-2 is a factual matter left for the jury’s determination.', 'The jury instructions appropriately required the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt “that the defendant assaulted [Janet] and that in doing so he seriously injured her shoulder area such that she lost the functional use of her shoulder or arm for a protracted period of time, that is to say a prolonged or extended period of time.” The defendant never objected to this jury instruction.', 'The jury heard evidence from Janet that she felt her shoulder break when defendant grabbed her arm and that it was necessary for her to wear a sling for six weeks and take pain medications. Further, Dr. Asiedu testified that Janet suffered a dislocation of her right arm. Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the state, there is no question that Janet’s injury cleared the statutory hurdle and properly was submitted to the jury.', '2', '- 13 -', 'Merger of Counts 5 and 6', 'Although we also are satisfied that whether count 6 (felony assault—assault or battery resulting in serious bodily injury) merged with count 5 (felony assault—assault with a dangerous weapon), therefore implicating the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions was not preserved, we nonetheless address this argument. We have held that a defense based upon double jeopardy must be raised in a pretrial motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(2) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. See State v. Day, 925 A.2d 962, 977 (R.I. 2007). Rule 12(b)(2) provides that “[t]he defense of double jeopardy * * * may be raised only by motion before trial.” See also Day, 925 A.2d at 977; State v. Grayhurst, 852 A.2d 491, 500 (R.I. 2004). Rule 12(b)(2) further states that “[f]ailure to present any such defense or objection as herein provided constitutes a waiver thereof, but the court for cause shown may grant relief from the waiver.” See also State v. McGuy, 841 A.2d 1109, 1115 (R.I. 2003) (stressing defendant needs to demonstrate “some compelling reason to grant relief from the waiver sanction of Rule 12(b)(2)”).13', 'In this case, defendant did not file a Rule 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss.', 'Therefore, defendant is barred from raising double jeopardy as a defense unless he can demonstrate some extraordinary justification for not doing so earlier. On the other hand, defendant’s trial occurred in 2005, almost two years before the Day decision made the law explicitly clear. Cf Day, 925 A.2d at 977 (holding that cause existed in part because of murkiness in the case law on this issue). Further, although no motion was filed under Rule 12, the trial justice nonetheless 13', 'In State v. Day, 925 A.2d 962, 977 (R.I. 2007), we determined that cause existed because this Court previously had not “focused with maximal explicitness on the necessity of bringing a merger argument to the attention of the trial court through a pretrial [Super.R.Crim.P.] 12(b)(2) motion” and because the trial justice dealt with the merger issue when considering the defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal.', '- 14 - entertained argument on this issue when he heard defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal and he ruled on the issue. Under all the circumstances present here, it is our opinion that defendant’s double-jeopardy claim, although not properly raised, should be considered by this Court.', 'To determine whether a criminal defendant is imperiled by double jeopardy, this Court applies the “same evidence” test first pronounced in Blockburger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299 (1932). See State v. Davis, 120 R.I. 82, 86, 384 A.2d 1061, 1064 (1978) (acknowledging adoption of Blockburger test). Under the same-evidence test, “where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.” Davis, 120 R.I. at 86, 384 A.2d at 1064 (quoting Blockburger, 284 U.S. at 304); see also State v. Bolarinho, 850 A.2d 907, 909 (R.I. 2004).', 'This is not the first time that we have addressed the issue of whether multiple assault convictions merged after a double-jeopardy analysis.', 'In Bolarinho, 850 A.2d at 911, the defendant, in a single incident, repeatedly kicked the complainant. From this single occurrence, the defendant was charged with two counts of felony assault in violation of § 11-5-2; one count for committing a felony assault by use of a dangerous weapon, to wit a shod foot, and one count for committing a felony assault that resulted in serious bodily injury. Bolarinho, 850 A.2d at 908-09. We considered whether “a conviction for both assault with a dangerous weapon and assault resulting in serious bodily injury resulting from the same transaction may stand.” Id. at 911. The Court held that when the evidence used to convict the defendant of assault with a dangerous weapon and assault resulting in serious bodily injury is identical, the counts merge under a double-jeopardy analysis. Id.', '- 15 -', 'Alternatively, in State v. Haney, 842 A.2d 1083, 1084-85 (R.I. 2004), we considered whether a defendant’s two domestic-assault convictions on the same complainant on the same night could withstand scrutiny under a double-jeopardy analysis. The incidents were separated by fifteen minutes, and one assault occurred in Burrillville while the other assault occurred in Glocester. Id. The defendant argued that, because he and the complainant were together in a car throughout the entire fifteen-minute interval between assaults, both were part of a continuing transaction. Id. at 1085. We rejected the defendant’s double-jeopardy argument because the acts underlying the two convictions were separate acts. Id. The victim was identical, but the assaults occurred at different times and in different towns, and the defendant had “sufficient opportunity to reflect on his assaultive conduct and to forbear from committing another crime” before he committed the second assault. Id.', 'Applying the Blockburger “same-evidence” test to the case before us, we first consider whether the facts underlying counts 5 and 6 constitute the “same act or transaction.” Davis, 120 R.I. at 86, 384 A.2d at 1064 (quoting Blockburger, 284 U.S. at 304). Count 5 alleged that defendant assaulted the complainant with a screwdriver, a dangerous weapon. Conversely, count 6 alleged that defendant committed a felony assault on the complainant by later grabbing her arm and dislocating it. On their face, the facts alleged in each count do not constitute the “same act or transaction,” because each assault arises from a different act. Nothing in the record indicates that the use of the screwdriver caused the complainant’s right arm to dislocate. Unlike in Bolarinho, in which the same evidence of kicking the victim was used to support both an assault with a dangerous weapon and an assault resulting in serious bodily injury, here the two counts are supported by different evidence. See Bolarinho, 850 A.2d at 911.

First, he says that the evidence introduced at his trial was not sufficient to support a conviction. Second, defendant claims that he is entitled to a new trial because the state twice violated its discovery obligations by failing to disclose, until the eve of trial, evidence that was critical to his defense.

We will not overturn the trial justice’s denial of a motion for new trial “unless the trial justice was clearly wrong or * * * overlooked or misconceived material and relevant evidence that related to a critical issue in the case.” Id.

Despite the conflicts between Janet’s earlier statements to the police and medical personnel and her trial testimony, he nonetheless found her to be a credible witness. Further, the trial justice said that he understood why the jury would discount the testimony of Roxanne Pare, defendant’s former girlfriend and the mother of his two children, with respect to the 1:20 a.m. phone call and subsequent visit by defendant. Finally, the trial justice stated “the credible evidence fairly and beyond a reasonable doubt pointed to this defendant, Tim Scanlon, as the man who abused [Janet].”', 'The trial justice’s decision on the motion for a new trial is not clearly wrong, nor did he overlook material evidence.

Likewise, defendant never objected to the state’s calling of Lt.

After hearing the parties’ arguments and considering memoranda submitted by counsel, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the appeal at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgments of conviction by the Superior Court. -1- Facts and Travel On July 24, 2004, at about 3:20 in the morning, the South Kingstown Police Department received two calls that reported a pickup truck first proceeding south in the northbound lane on Route 1 and then north in the southbound lane. A police officer responding to the call observed the pickup truck as it swerved and nearly collided with another vehicle and as it traveled briefly on the grassy median. Another vehicle, a Saturn, driven by a man later identified as Stanley Bates, was moving south in the southbound lane of Route 1 in the direct path of the errant pickup truck. In the severe collision that followed, Bates sustained serious injuries that required two surgeries, and his leg was permanently disfigured as a result of the collision. Another South Kingstown police officer responding to the call arrived soon. That officer testified that she approached the pickup truck and opened the driver’s side door to find a woman who identified herself as “Nicki” lying across the front seat of the vehicle. The officer further testified that she “was able to smell an odor of alcoholic beverage coming from her” and that it was her opinion that defendant “was under the influence of alcohol at that time.” Emergency vehicles transported the driver of the pickup truck to the hospital. There, her blood was evaluated for the presence of alcohol in accordance with hospital procedure for trauma patients. The analysis revealed a blood alcohol level in the range of 0.192 percent to 0.208 percent, well above the legal limit of 0.08 percent. The defendant, Nicki A. Nelson, was charged on May 25, 2005, with (1) operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, and causing serious bodily injury to Stanley Bates, in violation of § 31-27-2.6 (count 1); (2) operating a motor vehicle in reckless disregard of the safety of others that caused serious bodily injury to Stanley Bates as a proximate result of operating the vehicle, in violation of § 31-27-1.1 (count 2); (3) operating a motor -2- vehicle while knowingly having in said motor vehicle or in her possession a controlled substance, to wit, marijuana, as defined by G.L. 1956 § 21-28-1.02, in violation of § 31-27-2.4 (count 3); and (4) unlawfully, with knowledge and intent, possessing a controlled substance classified as marijuana by § 21-28-2.08, in violation of § 21-28-4.01(c)(2)(ii) (count 4).1 On February 14, 2007, a jury returned a verdict acquitting Nelson of operating a motor vehicle while in possession of a controlled substance, but convicting her on the charges of driving under the influence and causing serious bodily injury and driving to endanger and causing serious bodily injury. On April 27, 2007, the trial justice sentenced Nelson on count 1 to ten years to serve at the Adult Correctional Institutions, a $1,000 fine, two-year loss of license upon release, and alcohol treatment in prison, as well as restitution for Bates’s incurred and continuing expenses and lost wages. For count 2, the trial justice sentenced Nelson to a suspended five-year sentence, with five years probation on the condition that Nelson undergo substance-abuse counseling upon release. Nelson filed a timely notice of appeal. On appeal before this Court, defendant argues that her convictions should be vacated because (1) the trial justice erred when he denied a defense motion for a mistrial after a prospective juror made an inappropriate comment during the voir dire; (2) the trial justice erred in admitting the evidence of the blood-alcohol-level analysis done at South County Hospital because of an insufficient showing of chain of custody of the blood specimen; and (3) the trial justice erred when he questioned two of the state’s witnesses, John B. Kettelle, M.D. and Mr. Dennis Hilliard. 1 The trial justice found that count 4 merged with count 3 and dismissed count 4. -3- Standard of Review The trial justice is vested with considerable discretion when ruling on a motion to pass a case and declaring a mistrial. State v. LaPlante, 962 A.2d 63, 70 (R.I. 2009). Thus, this Court will reverse the trial justice’s ruling only if it was clearly wrong. State v. Mendoza, 889 A.2d 153, 158 (R.I. 2005). We afford the ruling such deference because the trial justice has a “front- row seat” at the trial, allowing the trial justice to “best determine the effect of the improvident remarks upon the jury.” State v. Figueroa, 673 A.2d 1084, 1091 (R.I. 1996) (quoting State v. Tempest, 651 A.2d 1198, 1207 (R.I. 1995)). Therefore, the trial justice’s determinations about the remarks’ prejudicial quality and whether to conduct an individual voir dire of each juror to determine his or her ability to render a fair and impartial verdict also are reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard. State v. Ramirez, 936 A.2d 1254, 1267-68 (R.I. 2007); State v. Gomes, 690 A.2d 310, 315 (R.I. 1997) (citing State v. Taylor, 423 A.2d 1174, 1175 (R.I. 1980)); State v. Carmody, 471 A.2d 1363, 1366 (R.I. 1984). Overall, “the conduct of a trial is within the sound discretion of the trial justice.” State v. Giordano, 440 A.2d 742, 745 (R.I. 1982) (citing Padula v. Machado, 416 A.2d 1184 (R.I. 1980); Pucci v. Algiere, 106 R.I. 411, 261 A.2d 1 (1970)). Analysis I Juror’s Comment On the first day of jury selection, the trial justice questioned prospective jurors on whether any circumstances existed that would affect their “ability to be fair and impartial in this case.” After questioning a number of prospective jurors, the trial justice asked Juror 29 whether she had “heard the questions already asked” and did she “have a response to any of them.” She -4- replied in the affirmative. The trial justice then asked whether she would like to be heard at sidebar or, alternatively, what was the question to which she would like to respond. Instead, she replied, “Well, I’m a college professor. I have had three students killed by drunk drivers.”2 The trial justice then promptly excused her without further questioning. Defense counsel immediately moved for a mistrial. The trial justice gave a cautionary instruction to the jurors, telling them “to disregard those comments” made by Juror 29, and then he dismissed them for the day.3 Defense counsel argued that the comment was “highly” prejudicial, apparently assuming that Juror 29 was a University of Rhode Island professor and that her deceased 2 “THE CLERK: Juror Number 29 from Kingston, * * *. “THE COURT: Good afternoon. Is it Miss, Ms., or Mrs. * * *? “JUROR NUMBER 29: Miss. “THE COURT: Have you heard the questions already asked? “JUROR NUMBER 29: I have. “THE COURT: Do you have a response to any of them? “JUROR NUMBER 29: I do. “THE COURT: Do you want to be heard at sidebar or what is the question that you would have a response to? “JUROR NUMBER 29: Well, I’m a college professor. I have had three students killed by drunk drivers. “THE COURT: That’s enough, ma’am. You are excused.” 3 “THE COURT: I instruct you to disregard that last comment made by Juror Number 21 [sic],* * *. Frankly, I don’t know what prompted it. I asked her what the question was that she had a response to, without stating what the question was she had, she made that comment. It has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with this case. As I said, this defendant is presumed to be innocent. That presumption of innocence, as I say, not only does she enjoy it now but she also enjoys it throughout the course of these proceedings and it never disappears. It only disappears if and when the State proves each and every allegation of these charges beyond a reasonable doubt. These are allegations only, subject to proof, as I say. She’s entitled to a fair trial without any type of prejudicial remarks having been made. And I instruct you to disregard those comments. Put them out of your mind. They can have no consideration whatsoever; and this goes for everybody sitting in this venire, this jury panel who may be called or whose number may be selected as we go through this jury process.” -5- students had been killed in the same geographic area as pertinent in this trial.4 Defense counsel further disputed that a curative instruction would be effective because the “inflammatory statement” had “contaminate[d]” the panel by suggesting “that we have to do something about these drunk drivers driving around, and * * * here is your opportunity.” Defense counsel also stressed that, as a practical matter, the motion to pass should be granted given the early stage of the trial. The trial justice observed, however, that there were not enough available jurors to simply begin anew the next day if the motion was granted. The state maintained that a mistrial was not warranted and that the trial justice’s curative instruction to the jury to disregard the comment was sufficient because the comment did not “point any finger at this defendant.” The next day, before the jurors were brought into the courtroom, the trial justice denied the motion to pass. Even in doing so, he characterized Juror 29’s unresponsive comment as “emotionally” and “almost vindictively” delivered. Nonetheless, he ruled that the comment would not “prevent[] [the jurors’] calm and dispassionate evaluation of the evidence.”5 However, the trial justice acknowledged on the record that he may “revisit the issue” after he asked the jurors whether they could follow his cautionary instruction to disregard the comment. The trial justice then addressed the jury panel as a group, rather than individually, precipitating another objection from defendant. The trial justice asked the prospective jurors whether they would be able to follow his cautionary instruction from the day before, and he received an affirmative response.6 The trial then proceeded until its conclusion on February 14, 2007. 4 The defense assumed that Juror 29 was a professor at the University of Rhode Island in Kingston, located in the area where the accident occurred. However, the parties have indicated to this Court that she actually is a professor at Salve Regina University in Newport. 5 Moreover, the trial justice noted, no evidence had yet been presented. 6 The trial justice questioned the prospective jurors as follows: “THE COURT: * * * Ladies and gentlemen, I’m going to ask you, before we continue with the jury selection, whether you are able – -6- On appeal, Nelson argues that the trial justice erred when he denied her motion to pass the case because Juror 29’s comment was “incendiary” and prejudicial because it encouraged the jury to convict the defendant. Nelson further contends that the trial justice should have conducted individual voir dires with the jurors to discuss privately with them whether they were able to follow his cautionary instruction, rather than question the panel as a group. Nelson also argues, however, that no instruction could cure the prejudicial effect of the statement on the jury because the statement was particularized to suggest that Nelson was guilty, and therefore it was not possible for the jurors to disregard it. The state argues that the trial justice did not err when he denied the motion to pass because Juror 29’s comment merely reiterated facts that were already known to the prospective and I am directing this not only – I’m going to direct it first to the prospective jurors in the box – whether you are able to follow my so-called cautionary instructions which I gave you after Juror Number 29 made the comment that prompted that cautionary instruction and it resulted in her excusal as a juror from the panel. Are you all able to follow that cautionary instruction which I gave you which is to strike that comment from your mind and give it no consideration whatsoever; and you have to decide this case, as I say, based upon a fair and impartial examination of the evidence in a so-called calm and dispassionate examination of the evidence. So are you all able to follow that instruction? “(AFFIRMATIVE RESPONSE FROM PROSPECTIVE PANEL SEATED IN THE JURY BOX) “* * * “THE COURT: * * * Are there any jurors in this panel who are seated in the so-called spectator’s section who, if called to serve as a juror, would be unable to follow that instruction which I gave the prospective jurors in the jury box? * * * “(NO AFFIRMATIVE RESPONSE FROM PROSPECTIVE JURORS SEATED IN THE SPECTATOR SECTION).” -7- jurors, namely, that the case was about driving under the influence of alcohol. Moreover, the state contends that it was unnecessary that the trial justice conduct a voir dire of each juror individually, and thus the trial justice’s “collective” questioning of the panel was not error. We hold that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion when he denied the motion to pass following the prospective juror’s inappropriate remark during the voir dire that she had had students who had been killed by drunk drivers. A new trial is not necessary “every time a juror has been placed in a potentially compromising situation.” Ramirez, 936 A.2d at 1267-68 (quoting Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 209, 217 (1982)). To warrant a new trial, “the prejudicial effect of extraneous information” that has reached the jury improperly turns on “the probable effect that such information would have on an average reasonable juror.” State v. Hartley, 656 A.2d 954, 962 (R.I. 1995). The prejudicial evidence must be of a nature to “inflame the jurors’ passions” to preclude “their calm and dispassionate evaluation of the evidence.” State v. Luciano, 739 A.2d 222, 228 (R.I. 1999) (citing State v. Mastracchio, 672 A.2d 438, 444 (R.I. 1996)). If the trial justice determines that the evidence is prejudicial, the trial justice has a duty “to attempt to dispel the taint with a proper warning or cautionary instruction.” Carmody, 471 A.2d at 1366. Here, it is our opinion that the prospective juror’s statement would not influence an average reasonable juror because the jurors already knew that defendant was charged with operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol. See State v. Coleman, 909 A.2d 929, 937 (R.I. 2006) (holding that judge did not abuse her discretion in refusing to grant the motion to pass when defendant himself admitted the prejudicial fact stated in the witness’s improper comment); see also State v. Lynch, 854 A.2d 1022, 1034 (R.I. 2004) (holding jurors “would not be unduly surprised or prejudiced” by defendant’s daughter angrily rushing from the stand -8- toward defendant because they already knew of the daughter’s allegations of defendant’s sexual abuse). Further, the statement is not of the type that would inflame the passions of the jury because it did not refer to the specific defendant nor did it imply her guilt. See Carmody, 471 A.2d at 1367 (“highly prejudicial” for jurors to overhear prospective juror give an opinion as to defendant’s guilt); State v. Massey, 119 R.I. 666, 667-68, 382 A.2d 801, 802-03 (1978). In Massey, a prospective juror who had been at the scene of the alleged crime recounted his belief that he “bet it was a Massey,” implying that defendant Massey’s family was likely to commit crimes and had committed crimes before. Massey, 119 R.I. at 667, 668, 382 A.2d at 802, 803. This Court held that the trial justice abused his discretion in refusing to pass the case because the statement was prejudicial in that it implied that the defendant was guilty and nontestimonial statements “linking a defendant to a particular crime and inferring the commission of others are most difficult to disregard.” Id. at 671, 382 A.2d at 804. Unlike the situation in Massey, the prospective juror’s statement in this case did not refer to defendant at all or even intimate that defendant might be guilty. After careful review of the transcript, it appears to us that the prospective juror, after observing the trial justice’s interactions with other jurors of whom the trial justice asked whether there was anything that would prevent them from considering the case in a fair and impartial manner, simply anticipated the question once it was her turn and “jumped the gun,” so to speak, in alerting the trial justice that she didn’t consider herself able to evaluate the case fairly and impartially. In an emotional moment, she blurted out why she believed that she was unable to fulfill the role of a juror. Her comment concerned herself and her qualifications to be a juror, not defendant in particular. -9- Indeed, even statements in evidence that are directed to defendant may be “palliated” by a prompt curative instruction, just as that which the trial justice employed in this case. Coleman, 909 A.2d at 936-37. For example, in Coleman, the witness testified that he knew the defendant “through being in jail, you know, since we was kids.” Id. at 935. The trial justice promptly gave a cautionary instruction and told the jury to disregard the statement. Id. She asked the juror whether they were able to disregard the statement, and every juror responded affirmatively. Id. This Court held that the cautionary instruction was sufficient to purge any “harmful effect” as a result of the testimony because the instruction highlighted the testimony’s “irrelevance and impropriety” and “took the extraordinary step of ensuring that the entire jury was capable of disregarding the witness’s response.” Id. at 936-37. The instruction in Coleman and by the trial justice in this case are very similar. Both instruct the jury to disregard the prejudicial statement and emphasize that the statement does not relate to the case or defendant’s guilt or innocence. See Coleman, 909 A.2d at 936 n.7 (comparing trial justice’s instruction favorably to that employed in State v. Werner, 831 A.2d 183, 207 (R.I. 2003), which, like the instruction here, used the phrase “put [the statements] out of your mind”). In contrast, the curative instruction given in Massey, held by this Court to be ineffective, “did not inform the potential jurors that they were not to consider the statement.” Massey, 119 R.I. at 671, 382 A.2d at 803; see also State v. Disla, 874 A.2d 190, 199, 199-200 (R.I. 2005) (holding “comprehensive instruction” including direction to “disregard” that statement was “sufficient * * * to fend off any prejudice”); Carmody, 471 A.2d at 1367 (holding curative instruction insufficient where jurors not told to disregard juror’s comments). Here, the trial justice’s curative instruction was prompt and comprehensive. It mirrored the instruction that was held to be sufficient in Coleman and likewise was sufficient to avoid any possible - 10 - prejudicial effect of the prospective juror’s statement about her deceased students. Therefore, it can be fairly said that the instruction “erased consideration of the statement from the jury’s mind.” State v. Manfredi, 118 R.I. 144, 149, 372 A.2d 975, 977 (1977) (citing State v. Costa, 111 R.I. 602, 609-10, 306 A.2d 36, 40 (1973)). As Coleman further illustrates, an individual voir dire of each juror is not necessary for the curative remedy to be effective. Coleman, 909 A.2d at 935 (defense feared that individual voir dire would cause additional prejudice to the defendant by emphasizing comment); see also Gomes, 690 A.2d at 316 (holding that trial justice properly questioned prospective jurors as a group concerning whether the sexual abuse charges or their personal experience would prevent them from being impartial). Individual voir dire is appropriate when it is unclear whether the jurors heard or read certain prejudicial statements or material and it is necessary to determine their exposure while at the same time insulating the rest of the jurors who may not have heard or read the prejudicial information. See, e.g., Figueroa, 673 A.2d at 1087-88 (voir dire conducted to determine whether jurors thought the witness said “heard” or “hurt”); State v. Pusyka, 592 A.2d 850, 852 (R.I. 1991) (voir dire conducted to determine if jurors had been exposed to newspaper article about the trial). We are of the opinion that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion when he declined to conduct an individual voir dire of each juror in this case. II Chain of Custody The defendant argues that the state did not adequately prove the chain of custody of Nelson’s blood sample for alcohol-level testing and that the results of the analysis should not have been admitted because the uncertainty with respect to who handled and analyzed the specimen in the lab renders the results “highly questionable.” The state counters that the trial - 11 - justice properly included the evidence on the ground that any “inadequacies” in chain of custody went to the weight of the evidence rather than to its admissibility. The state maintains that “there is no evidence of tampering in [this] case.” We agree with the state and hold that the trial justice did not err when he admitted the results of the blood analysis because the state established that it was reasonably probable that the blood specimen had not been tampered with. The nurse who drew Nelson’s blood at the hospital testified at trial as to the procedures that he followed. He testified that he sent the bagged vials of Nelson’s blood via the hospital’s pneumatic tube system directly to the laboratory for testing. The clinical laboratory scientist who was working on the morning of July 24, 2004, testified that the vials of Nelson’s blood arrived in the lab to be analyzed.7 She was unable to recall, however, whether it was she or her coworker who retrieved Nelson’s blood specimen and performed the analysis. The witness testified that this information was indicated on a medical record entitled “Internal Inquiry Report.” This document, however, was not located in Nelson’s medical record. Although a showing of a continuous chain of custody may operate as a “guarantee of the reliability,” such a showing is not necessary for the introduction of physical evidence. State v. Infantolino, 116 R.I. 303, 312, 355 A.2d 722, 727 (1976). Physical evidence is admissible upon a showing that in all reasonable probability the evidence has not been subjected to tampering. State v. Bracero, 434 A.2d 286, 290 (R.I. 1981). The state, however, need not “eliminate all possibility” of tampering. Id. A continuous chain of custody is relevant, therefore, “only to the weight of the evidence.” State v. Cohen, 538 A.2d 151, 154 (R.I. 1988). In Bracero, the defendant argued that the trial justice erred in admitting a bag of cocaine because the state did not establish a chain of custody. Bracero, 434 A.2d at 290. The evidence 7 The defendant acknowledges that up until this point the chain of custody was intact. - 12 - arrived at the lab for testing on June 9, but was not analyzed until July 19. Id.. Further, the toxicologists could not “state unequivocally that the evidence had not been tampered with” in the interim. Id. In Cohen, the defendant objected to the admission of evidence seized from a vehicle on the ground of an insufficient showing of chain of custody in which the evidence was not seized until the day after the arrest and the police did not testify about the location of the vehicle’s keys from the time of arrest until the time of the seizure. Cohen, 538 A.2d at 154. In both cases, this Court held that the state made a sufficient showing that in all reasonable probability the evidence had not been tampered with. Id.; Bracero, 434 A.2d at 290. By comparison, significantly less possibility of tampering is present in this case than was present in either Bracero or Cohen. Here, there is no evidence of any delay between the arrival of the blood evidence in the laboratory and the performance of the analysis. The specimen’s arrival in the lab and its subsequent analysis are undisputed. The path of the vials containing Nelson’s blood can be tracked from the drawing of the blood until the time the vials reached the lab by way of pneumatic tube. The only infirmity in the chain of custody is the unknown identity of the technician who retrieved the specimen and performed the analysis. Indeed, defendant presented no evidence of tampering, and in all reasonable probability, the blood specimen was not tampered with. Bracero, 434 A.2d at 290. Therefore, the failure of the state to identify the particular technician who performed the test properly goes to the weight of the evidence rather than its admissibility. Cohen, 538 A.2d at 154. We affirm the trial justice’s ruling. - 13 - III Trial Justice’s Interrogation of Witnesses The trial justice questioned four witnesses during the trial: Lt. William Buckley of the South Kingstown Police Department; Dr. Kettelle; a laboratory technician from South County Hospital; and Mr. Hilliard, the director of the Rhode Island State Crime Laboratory. Defense counsel objected to the trial justice’s questioning of Lt. Buckley, but the objection was not timely or sufficiently specific to preserve the issue for review, a fact conceded by defendant at oral argument. Defense counsel did not object to the questioning of the laboratory technician. Doctor Kettelle, the physician who treated Nelson at South County Hospital on the morning of July 24, 2004, was called to the witness stand by the state. After the doctor was subjected to direct and cross-examination by counsel, the trial justice questioned Dr. Kettelle about specific pages of Nelson’s fifty-five page medical record from South County Hospital, including Nelson’s blood alcohol level and the practice of not conducting spinal assessments on intoxicated patients who are unable to follow commands. After questioning the doctor about the medical record, the trial justice posed the following questions: “THE COURT: You also testified, Doctor, that you could not order a C spine at the time that you initially examined Miss Nelson, is that correct? “THE WITNESS: No, that’s not entirely correct. “THE COURT: What was it that you said? “THE WITNESS: Well, part of the cervical spine assessment is x- rays, and the other part is to actually examine the patient; but to examine the patient you need somebody who is cooperative and reliable because you can have normal x-rays and still have a severe injury that doesn’t show up. So you have to have the patient move their head very carefully so they don’t have a spinal cord injury if they had one of those types of injuries to the ligament of the neck. So you can’t assess them if they are intoxicated or if they had some other reason you couldn’t reliably have them move their head and check for pain. - 14 - “THE COURT: So what were you able to do as far as the so- called C spine or cervical spine when you first examined Miss Nelson in the emergency room at the South County Hospital on July 24, 2004? “THE WITNESS: We did the cervical spine x-rays on her. “THE COURT: You did the x-rays? “THE WITNESS: That’s correct. “THE COURT: Were you able to do the other, as you said, physical exam as far as your own examination of that area? “THE WITNESS: No, not able to do a complete examination, no. “THE COURT: Why was that? “THE WITNESS: Because part of that examination is to release the collar and feel the neck for any tenderness and have the patient carefully move their head to the right and to the left and lift the chin up; and if they have any pain, then you have them stop moving and you put the collar back on. “THE COURT: And were you able to do that with Miss Nelson? “THE WITNESS: No, I wouldn’t do that. It would be malpractice to do that. “THE COURT: Why couldn’t you? “THE WITNESS: Because she was intoxicated. “THE COURT: How would that effect [sic] your ability to do that examination or reliability of that exam? “THE WITNESS: Because you need a patient that’s going to be able to follow commands because you don’t want them to move suddenly and end up with a spinal cord injury.” There was a brief recross-examination immediately after the trial justice’s questioning of the witness, and defense counsel asked Dr. Kettelle about his opinion that defendant was intoxicated. Before the trial justice excused the witness, defense counsel conferred with the trial justice at sidebar. The next day, before the jury was brought into the courtroom, the trial justice acknowledged on the record that defense counsel had objected to his questioning of Dr. Kettelle previously, but that he had not yet been provided with an opportunity to be heard. Defense counsel then placed his objection to the trial justice’s questions on the record, arguing that the questions were “hammering in” the state’s points, and that therefore there was a risk that the jury would infer that defendant “must be guilty based upon the line of questions about the alcohol and the detail and nature of the questions.” The trial justice noted the objection and overruled it. - 15 - The state last presented Mr. Hilliard, the director of the Rhode Island State Crime Laboratory. After both defense counsel and the state indicated that they had no further questions, the trial justice rephrased a question the prosecution previously had asked Mr. Hilliard with respect to whether he had an opinion “as to whether her blood alcohol level at the time of the crash would have been the same as the blood alcohol level by analysis of 4:25[a.m.].”8 8 The prosecution posed its question as follows: “Q: Now, Doctor -- sorry, Mr. Hilliard, hypothetically, if the automobile crash occurred at approximately 3:35 a.m. and the blood was drawn at approximately 4:25 a.m., are you able to estimate what the blood alcohol level of the person would have been at the time of the crash? “[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection. Calls for speculation. “THE COURT: Based on that alone, are you able to answer that Doctor, yes or no? “THE WITNESS: No. There would have to be additional information provided. “Q: What other additional information? “A: Information about the subject’s drinking habits prior to the accident, of course, drinking. “THE COURT: That’s enough. Put another question.” The trial justice subsequently asked the witness the following: “THE COURT: Mr. Hilliard, assuming that the patient, Nicki Nelson, on July 24, 2004 did not consume or ingest alcohol between the time of the motor vehicle accident at approximately 3:30 a.m. and the time of the analysis of her serum blood at approximately 4:25 a.m., do you have an opinion, yes or no, as to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty as to whether her blood alcohol level at the time of the crash would have been the same as the blood alcohol level by analysis of 4:25 or would have been higher or would have been lower? Do you have an opinion? “[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Could I have an objection? “THE COURT: Your objection is noted. You have a continuing objection to this line of questioning. Do you have an opinion, yes or no. “THE WITNESS: No, your Honor, because additional information would be necessary. “THE COURT: And what would that additional information be? “THE WITNESS: The time of the last drink that Miss Nelson consumed.” - 16 - Over objection by defendant, the witness answered that he did not have an opinion because he lacked necessary information regarding when defendant had her last drink. Immediately thereafter, counsel for both parties declined to ask the witness any follow-up questions and the state rested. The defendant argues that the trial justice erred when he questioned two of the state’s witnesses by exceeding the scope of permitted judicial interrogation of witnesses and thereby prejudicing her. Rule 614(B) of the Rhode Island Rule of Evidence provides that, “[t]he court may interrogate witnesses, whether called by itself or a party.” This Court, many years before the adoption of the Rules of Evidence, noted that “[i]n the furtherance of justice it is sometimes proper and commendable for a judge presiding in a jury trial to interrogate a witness as to relevant matters proper to be presented to the jury.” State v. Amaral, 47 R.I. 245, 249-50, 132 A. 547, 549 (1926). It should be noted that in Amaral the Court was quick to add that the judge should do so with “caution” and that he or she should take pains not to reveal or appear to reveal an opinion, such as through tone of voice. Id. at 250, 32 A.2d at 549-50. Indeed, in another case decided before the Rules of Evidence were adopted we said that “we cannot overemphasize the need for caution when the trial justice deems it necessary to question a witness.” Giordano, 440 A.2d at 745. Since the adoption of Rule 614(B) in 1987, a trial justice’s prerogative to question witnesses still is limited to inquiry that “will clarify a matter which he justifiably feels is a cause for confusion in the minds of the jurors.” State v. Figueras, 644 A.2d 291, 293 (R.I. 1994) (noting “narrow parameters” of permitted judicial questioning of witnesses) (quoting Giordano, 440 A.2d at 745). Further, even as to clarification, the trial justice should “first allow counsel every opportunity to refine the witness’s testimony.” Giordano, 440 A.2d at 745. Therefore, - 17 - judicial interrogation of witnesses must be conducted reluctantly, cautiously, and in limited circumstances. Id. A Trial Justice’s Interrogation of Dr. Kettelle Before we address the merits of defendant’s argument, we first must determine if it was properly preserved for appeal.9 With respect to the questioning of Dr. Kettelle, the state argues that the objection was not timely because defense counsel, in attempting to be courteous by not interrupting the trial justice, did not put the trial justice on notice of the objection to the questioning while it was ongoing. Further, the state argues that the trial justice was within his right to question a witness about the lengthy medical record to which the witness had been referring to clarify its contents for the jury. Nelson maintains that it is permissible, even advisable, for counsel to defer objections to the court’s questioning until the court’s examination is complete and the jury is not present. 1 Preservation of Appeal We are of the opinion that defendant properly preserved this issue for review. Under the “raise-or-waive” rule, this Court will not consider appeals of issues that were not properly preserved in the lower court. State v. Bido, 941 A.2d 822, 828 (R.I. 2008). To satisfy the rule, evidentiary objections (1) must be raised before the trial court and (2) be “sufficiently focused so as to call the trial justice’s attention to the basis for said objection.” State v. Gautier, 950 A.2d 400, 407 (R.I. 2008) (quoting State v. Pacheco, 763 A.2d 971, 976 (R.I. 2001)). Under the 9 As the appellant conceded at oral argument, defense counsel’s objection to the trial justice’s questioning of Lt. Buckley was not timely or sufficiently specific to preserve the issue for review. Defense counsel did not object to the questioning of the laboratory technician. - 18 - specific language of Rule 614(C) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, objections to interrogation by the court “may be made at the time or at the next available opportunity when the jury is not present.” (Emphasis added). Defense counsel asked to be heard at sidebar promptly after the trial justice’s questioning of Dr. Kettelle and before the witness was excused. At the suggestion of the trial justice, defense counsel placed his specific reasons for objection on the record the next day before the jury returned. Rule 614(C) permits the defense counsel’s method of objection used here to avoid counsel being put in the position of interrupting the trial justice in front of the jury. In Amaral, decided before the adoption of Rule 614(C), this Court described such a predicament as “embarrassing.” Amaral, 47 R.I. at 250, 132 A. at 550. This Court noted that counsel was forced to choose between risking the loss of the jury’s favor or losing the right to object to the introduction of the evidence. Id. The adoption of Rule 614(C) remedied this dilemma by permitting advocates to defer their objection until the trial justice concludes the interrogation. Here, defense counsel chose to do so and thus under Rule 614(C), the objection interposed at sidebar after the questioning was timely. We caution that a general objection, made at the end of the trial justice’s line of questioning of a witness, does not preserve the issue for review. State v. Phommachak, 674 A.2d 382, 389 (R.I. 1996). However, the objection here was sufficiently specific. Counsel promptly notified the trial justice of his objection and put the trial justice on notice that he objected to the line of questioning. Further, defense counsel was given the opportunity to place the reasons for objection on the record the next day before the jury was seated. He informed the trial justice that the questioning of Dr. Kettelle served to “reiterat[e] points that were already made by the State” and he was concerned that the trial justice’s “adding in and going on at length at different points - 19 - * * * put[] the defendant in harm’s way where the jury might interpret your questions as suggesting that she must be guilty based upon the line of questions about the alcohol.” Although the defense did not request a cautionary instruction at this time, this failure does not bar review if the request “would have been futile or any attempt to palliate the prejudice would have been ineffective.” State v. Briggs, 787 A.2d 479, 484 (R.I. 2001) (quoting State v. Lemon, 478 A.2d 175, 181 (R.I. 1984)) (Emphasis in original.). In our view, the trial justice’s questioning of Dr. Kettelle transgressed the limits of judicial interrogation of witnesses to the extent that a curative instruction would have had an insufficient palliative effect. See State v. Evans, 618 A.2d 1283, 1284 (R.I. 1993) (holding trial justice’s curative instruction insufficient as “tenor of the trial justice’s questioning contained prejudicial influences”). Therefore, defense counsel’s failure to request a curative instruction does not render the objection too general, and the issue is properly before this Court. Briggs, 787 A.2d at 484. 2 Trial Justice’s Interrogation We have great respect for the trial justice and recognize that he has considerable discretion in the administration of the jury trial. However, we are further of the opinion that the trial justice erred when he questioned Dr. Kettelle, that the error was prejudicial and not harmless, and that defendant’s judgments of conviction must be vacated. The trial justice explained that his sole motivation in questioning Dr. Kettelle was to clarify the location of specific pages of a lengthy medical record. When the trial justice questioned Dr. Kettelle, both the manner of his interrogation and the testimony elicited from the witness went beyond the limits of clarification. Giordano, 440 A.2d at 745. - 20 - As we repeatedly have emphasized, the parameters of judicial interrogation are narrowly confined to clarification of justifiably confusing matters for the jury. Figueras, 644 A.2d at 293; Evans, 618 A.2d at 1284; Giordano, 440 A.2d at 745. A trial justice may, for example, conduct a limited interrogation of a witness to inquire about the witness’s height and weight at various relevant intervals. State v. McVeigh, 660 A.2d 269, 273-74 (R.I. 1995). In McVeigh, this Court held that “[b]ecause neither the prosecutor nor defense counsel inquired about these subjects, this was an area that conceivably may have been a basis for confusion in the minds of the jurors.” Id. at 274. Here, the voluminous medical record did not in and of itself lead to a conclusion that the jury was confused or that it needed clarification. Indeed, the trial justice noted after defense counsel’s objection that “I didn’t want the jury to be confused and that was my point in questioning Dr. Kettelle, not to * * * as you put it, place the defendant in harm’s way.” He apparently did not believe that the jurors were confused, but rather did not want them to become confused with respect to the fifty-five page medical record. Therefore, the trial justice’s questioning of Dr. Kettelle about the medical record did not constitute clarification of a point of confusion for the jury. There seems little question to us that the trial justice’s questioning prejudiced defendant. This is so because the trial justice’s questioning took on an air of cross- examination and the questions twice elicited answers from the witness that he was unable to perform standard tests on defendant because of her level of intoxication. Doctor Kettelle testified that it would have been “malpractice” for him to conduct a certain examination on Nelson because she was too drunk to cooperate. This was devastating testimony in a drunk- driving trial. Judicial interrogation that elicits inflammatory information from a witness is beyond the narrow parameters allowing only for clarification of confusing issues for the jury. Here, the - 21 - prosecution and defense already had questioned the witness regarding how defendant’s intoxicated state affected his examination and treatment of her. Therefore, the trial justice’s interrogation of Dr. Kettelle was not limited to a discrete issue left unresolved through counsels’ examination. Rather, the trial justice’s interrogation of Dr. Kettelle improperly served as an extension of the direct and cross-examination and went beyond acceptable limits. The questioning severely prejudiced defendant because it reinforced defendant’s intoxication to the jury. B Interrogation of Dennis Hilliard Nelson objected contemporaneously to the trial justice’s questioning of Mr. Hilliard with respect to his opinion as to Nelson’s relative blood alcohol level at 3:30 a.m. and 4:25 a.m. Nelson argues that the trial justice improperly asked the witness a “prosecution-oriented question” because the question tended to reveal to the jury the trial justice’s partiality and belief that Nelson had a higher blood alcohol content at 3:30 a.m. than she did an hour later. The state counters that the questioning does not entitle Nelson to a new trial because the witness could not, and did not, actually provide an opinion in response, and therefore the verdict was unaffected. In our opinion, the trial justice’s interrogation of Mr. Hilliard was error and also requires us to vacate the judgments of conviction. The trial justice’s questioning of Mr. Hilliard was in the same vein as his questioning of Dr. Kettelle in that it strayed from this Court’s long-standing holdings that judicial questioning of witnesses must be confined to clarification of justifiably confusing matters for the jury. See Figueras, 644 A.2d at 293 (citing Giordano, 440 A.2d at 745). We emphasize that trial justices should not engage in the examination of witnesses of the kind that the trial justice conducted here. - 22 - This questioning roamed beyond the boundaries of appropriate clarifying judicial interrogation because the question subtly rephrased a question that the prosecution had already asked and the witness had already answered. Therefore, the jury heard for a second time that Mr. Hilliard could not form an opinion about the defendant’s blood alcohol level at 3:30 a.m. compared with the established level at 4:25 a.m. without knowing when the defendant last consumed alcohol. We fail to see how this question could be characterized as a clarification of a justifiably confusing matter when the trial justice already knew exactly how the witness would respond. Clarification does not include simply editing counsel’s previous questions to how the judge felt they should have been asked. See Giordano, 440 A.2d at 745-46 (holding that trial justice’s request of a witness to explain an answer to a question asked on cross-examination constituted a clarification of the evidence). In our opinion the trial justice erred in his questioning of Mr. Hilliard, and the defendant was prejudiced as a result of the jury hearing the trial justice essentially cross-examine a witness, regardless of Mr. Hilliard’s inability to give an opinion in response to the questioning. Conclusion Accordingly, the defendant’s appeal is sustained in part and denied in part and the judgments of conviction appealed from are vacated. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for a new trial. - 23 - Supreme Court No. 2007-323-C.A. (W1/05-170A) State : v. : Nicki A.

This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on October 6, 2009, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided.

Another vehicle, a Saturn, driven by a man later identified as Stanley Bates, was moving south in the southbound lane of Route 1 in the direct path of the errant pickup truck. In the severe collision that followed, Bates sustained serious injuries that required two surgeries, and his leg was permanently disfigured as a result of the collision.', 'Another South Kingstown police officer responding to the call arrived soon. That officer testified that she approached the pickup truck and opened the driver’s side door to find a woman who identified herself as “Nicki” lying across the front seat of the vehicle.

On April 27, 2007, the trial justice sentenced Nelson on count 1 to ten years to serve at the Adult Correctional Institutions, a $1,000 fine, two-year loss of license upon release, and alcohol treatment in prison, as well as restitution for Bates’s incurred and continuing expenses and lost wages.

The trial justice observed, however, that there were not enough available jurors to simply begin anew the next day if the motion was granted.

Massey, 119 R.I. 666, 667-68, 382 A.2d 801, 802-03 (1978). In Massey, a prospective juror who had been at the scene of the alleged crime recounted his belief that he “bet it was a Massey,” implying that defendant Massey’s family was likely to commit crimes and had committed crimes before. Massey, 119 R.I. at 667, 668, 382 A.2d at 802, 803. This Court held that the trial justice abused his discretion in refusing to pass the case because the statement was prejudicial in that it implied that the defendant was guilty and nontestimonial statements “linking a defendant to a particular crime and inferring the commission of others are most difficult to disregard.” Id. at 671, 382 A.2d at 804. Unlike the situation in Massey, the prospective juror’s statement in this case did not refer to defendant at all or even intimate that defendant might be guilty.', 'After careful review of the transcript, it appears to us that the prospective juror, after observing the trial justice’s interactions with other jurors of whom the trial justice asked whether there was anything that would prevent them from considering the case in a fair and impartial manner, simply anticipated the question once it was her turn and “jumped the gun,” so to speak, in alerting the trial justice that she didn’t consider herself able to evaluate the case fairly and impartially. In an emotional moment, she blurted out why she believed that she was unable to fulfill the role of a juror. Her comment concerned herself and her qualifications to be a juror, not defendant in particular.', '-9-', 'Indeed, even statements in evidence that are directed to defendant may be “palliated” by a prompt curative instruction, just as that which the trial justice employed in this case. Coleman, 909 A.2d at 936-37. For example, in Coleman, the witness testified that he knew the defendant “through being in jail, you know, since we was kids.” Id. at 935. The trial justice promptly gave a cautionary instruction and told the jury to disregard the statement. Id. She asked the juror whether they were able to disregard the statement, and every juror responded affirmatively. Id. This Court held that the cautionary instruction was sufficient to purge any “harmful effect” as a result of the testimony because the instruction highlighted the testimony’s “irrelevance and impropriety” and “took the extraordinary step of ensuring that the entire jury was capable of disregarding the witness’s response.” Id. at 936-37.', 'The instruction in Coleman and by the trial justice in this case are very similar. Both instruct the jury to disregard the prejudicial statement and emphasize that the statement does not relate to the case or defendant’s guilt or innocence.', 'See Coleman, 909 A.2d at 936 n.7 (comparing trial justice’s instruction favorably to that employed in State v. Werner, 831 A.2d 183, 207 (R.I. 2003), which, like the instruction here, used the phrase “put [the statements] out of your mind”). In contrast, the curative instruction given in Massey, held by this Court to be ineffective, “did not inform the potential jurors that they were not to consider the statement.” Massey, 119 R.I. at 671, 382 A.2d at 803; see also State v.

Here, the trial justice’s curative instruction was prompt and comprehensive. It mirrored the instruction that was held to be sufficient in Coleman and likewise was sufficient to avoid any possible', '- 10 - prejudicial effect of the prospective juror’s statement about her deceased students. Therefore, it can be fairly said that the instruction “erased consideration of the statement from the jury’s mind.” State v. Manfredi, 118 R.I. 144, 149, 372 A.2d 975, 977 (1977) (citing State v.

Coleman, 909 A.2d at 935 (defense feared that individual voir dire would cause additional prejudice to the defendant by emphasizing comment); see also Gomes, 690 A.2d at 316 (holding that trial justice properly questioned prospective jurors as a group concerning whether the sexual abuse charges or their personal experience would prevent them from being impartial). Individual voir dire is appropriate when it is unclear whether the jurors heard or read certain prejudicial statements or material and it is necessary to determine their exposure while at the same time insulating the rest of the jurors who may not have heard or read the prejudicial information. See, e.g., Figueroa, 673 A.2d at 1087-88 (voir dire conducted to determine whether jurors thought the witness said “heard” or “hurt”); State v. Pusyka, 592 A.2d 850, 852 (R.I. 1991) (voir dire conducted to determine if jurors had been exposed to newspaper article about the trial). We are of the opinion that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion when he declined to conduct an individual voir dire of each juror in this case.', 'II', 'Chain of Custody', 'The defendant argues that the state did not adequately prove the chain of custody of Nelson’s blood sample for alcohol-level testing and that the results of the analysis should not have been admitted because the uncertainty with respect to who handled and analyzed the specimen in the lab renders the results “highly questionable.” The state counters that the trial', '- 11 - justice properly included the evidence on the ground that any “inadequacies” in chain of custody went to the weight of the evidence rather than to its admissibility. The state maintains that “there is no evidence of tampering in [this] case.” We agree with the state and hold that the trial justice did not err when he admitted the results of the blood analysis because the state established that it was reasonably probable that the blood specimen had not been tampered with.', 'The nurse who drew Nelson’s blood at the hospital testified at trial as to the procedures that he followed. He testified that he sent the bagged vials of Nelson’s blood via the hospital’s pneumatic tube system directly to the laboratory for testing. The clinical laboratory scientist who was working on the morning of July 24, 2004, testified that the vials of Nelson’s blood arrived in the lab to be analyzed.7 She was unable to recall, however, whether it was she or her coworker who retrieved Nelson’s blood specimen and performed the analysis. The witness testified that this information was indicated on a medical record entitled “Internal Inquiry Report.” This document, however, was not located in Nelson’s medical record.', 'Although a showing of a continuous chain of custody may operate as a “guarantee of the reliability,” such a showing is not necessary for the introduction of physical evidence. State v. Infantolino, 116 R.I. 303, 312, 355 A.2d 722, 727 (1976). Physical evidence is admissible upon a showing that in all reasonable probability the evidence has not been subjected to tampering. State v. Bracero, 434 A.2d 286, 290 (R.I. 1981). The state, however, need not “eliminate all possibility” of tampering. Id. A continuous chain of custody is relevant, therefore, “only to the weight of the evidence.” State v. Cohen, 538 A.2d 151, 154 (R.I. 1988).', 'In Bracero, the defendant argued that the trial justice erred in admitting a bag of cocaine because the state did not establish a chain of custody. Bracero, 434 A.2d at 290. The evidence 7', 'The defendant acknowledges that up until this point the chain of custody was intact.', '- 12 - arrived at the lab for testing on June 9, but was not analyzed until July 19. Id.. Further, the toxicologists could not “state unequivocally that the evidence had not been tampered with” in the interim. Id. In Cohen, the defendant objected to the admission of evidence seized from a vehicle on the ground of an insufficient showing of chain of custody in which the evidence was not seized until the day after the arrest and the police did not testify about the location of the vehicle’s keys from the time of arrest until the time of the seizure. Cohen, 538 A.2d at 154. In both cases, this Court held that the state made a sufficient showing that in all reasonable probability the evidence had not been tampered with. Id.; Bracero, 434 A.2d at 290.', 'By comparison, significantly less possibility of tampering is present in this case than was present in either Bracero or Cohen. Here, there is no evidence of any delay between the arrival of the blood evidence in the laboratory and the performance of the analysis. The specimen’s arrival in the lab and its subsequent analysis are undisputed. The path of the vials containing Nelson’s blood can be tracked from the drawing of the blood until the time the vials reached the lab by way of pneumatic tube. The only infirmity in the chain of custody is the unknown identity of the technician who retrieved the specimen and performed the analysis. Indeed, defendant presented no evidence of tampering, and in all reasonable probability, the blood specimen was not tampered with. Bracero, 434 A.2d at 290. Therefore, the failure of the state to identify the particular technician who performed the test properly goes to the weight of the evidence rather than its admissibility. Cohen, 538 A.2d at 154. We affirm the trial justice’s ruling.', '- 13 -', 'III', 'Trial Justice’s Interrogation of Witnesses', 'The trial justice questioned four witnesses during the trial: Lt. William Buckley of the South Kingstown Police Department; Dr. Kettelle; a laboratory technician from South County Hospital; and Mr. Hilliard, the director of the Rhode Island State Crime Laboratory. Defense counsel objected to the trial justice’s questioning of Lt. Buckley, but the objection was not timely or sufficiently specific to preserve the issue for review, a fact conceded by defendant at oral argument. Defense counsel did not object to the questioning of the laboratory technician.', 'Doctor Kettelle, the physician who treated Nelson at South County Hospital on the morning of July 24, 2004, was called to the witness stand by the state. After the doctor was subjected to direct and cross-examination by counsel, the trial justice questioned Dr. Kettelle about specific pages of Nelson’s fifty-five page medical record from South County Hospital, including Nelson’s blood alcohol level and the practice of not conducting spinal assessments on intoxicated patients who are unable to follow commands. After questioning the doctor about the medical record, the trial justice posed the following questions:', '“THE COURT: You also testified, Doctor, that you could not', 'order a C spine at the time that you initially examined Miss', 'Nelson, is that correct?', '“THE WITNESS: No, that’s not entirely correct.', '“THE COURT: What was it that you said?', '“THE WITNESS: Well, part of the cervical spine assessment is x-', 'rays, and the other part is to actually examine the patient; but to', 'examine the patient you need somebody who is cooperative and', 'reliable because you can have normal x-rays and still have a severe', 'injury that doesn’t show up.

Before the trial justice excused the witness, defense counsel conferred with the trial justice at sidebar. The next day, before the jury was brought into the courtroom, the trial justice acknowledged on the record that defense counsel had objected to his questioning of Dr. Kettelle previously, but that he had not yet been provided with an opportunity to be heard. Defense counsel then placed his objection to the trial justice’s questions on the record, arguing that the questions were “hammering in” the state’s points, and that therefore there was a risk that the jury would infer that defendant “must be guilty based upon the line of questions about the alcohol and the detail and nature of the questions.” The trial justice noted the objection and overruled it.', '- 15 -', 'The state last presented Mr. Hilliard, the director of the Rhode Island State Crime Laboratory.', 'After both defense counsel and the state indicated that they had no further questions, the trial justice rephrased a question the prosecution previously had asked Mr. Hilliard with respect to whether he had an opinion “as to whether her blood alcohol level at the time of the crash would have been the same as the blood alcohol level by analysis of 4:25[a.m.].”8 8', 'The prosecution posed its question as follows:', '“Q: Now, Doctor -- sorry, Mr. Hilliard, hypothetically, if the', 'automobile crash occurred at approximately 3:35 a.m. and the', 'blood was drawn at approximately 4:25 a.m., are you able to', 'estimate what the blood alcohol level of the person would have', 'been at the time of the crash?', '“[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection.

Rule 614(B) of the Rhode Island Rule of Evidence provides that, “[t]he court may interrogate witnesses, whether called by itself or a party.” This Court, many years before the adoption of the Rules of Evidence, noted that “[i]n the furtherance of justice it is sometimes proper and commendable for a judge presiding in a jury trial to interrogate a witness as to relevant matters proper to be presented to the jury.” State v. Amaral, 47 R.I. 245, 249-50, 132 A. 547, 549 (1926). It should be noted that in Amaral the Court was quick to add that the judge should do so with “caution” and that he or she should take pains not to reveal or appear to reveal an opinion, such as through tone of voice. Id. at 250, 32 A.2d at 549-50. Indeed, in another case decided before the Rules of Evidence were adopted we said that “we cannot overemphasize the need for caution when the trial justice deems it necessary to question a witness.” Giordano, 440 A.2d at 745. Since the adoption of Rule 614(B) in 1987, a trial justice’s prerogative to question witnesses still is limited to inquiry that “will clarify a matter which he justifiably feels is a cause for confusion in the minds of the jurors.” State v. Figueras, 644 A.2d 291, 293 (R.I. 1994) (noting “narrow parameters” of permitted judicial questioning of witnesses) (quoting Giordano, 440 A.2d at 745). Further, even as to clarification, the trial justice should “first allow counsel every opportunity to refine the witness’s testimony.” Giordano, 440 A.2d at 745. Therefore,', '- 17 - judicial interrogation of witnesses must be conducted reluctantly, cautiously, and in limited circumstances. Id.', 'A', 'Trial Justice’s Interrogation of Dr. Kettelle', 'Before we address the merits of defendant’s argument, we first must determine if it was properly preserved for appeal.9 With respect to the questioning of Dr. Kettelle, the state argues that the objection was not timely because defense counsel, in attempting to be courteous by not interrupting the trial justice, did not put the trial justice on notice of the objection to the questioning while it was ongoing. Further, the state argues that the trial justice was within his right to question a witness about the lengthy medical record to which the witness had been referring to clarify its contents for the jury. Nelson maintains that it is permissible, even advisable, for counsel to defer objections to the court’s questioning until the court’s examination is complete and the jury is not present.', '1', 'Preservation of Appeal', 'We are of the opinion that defendant properly preserved this issue for review. Under the “raise-or-waive” rule, this Court will not consider appeals of issues that were not properly preserved in the lower court. State v. Bido, 941 A.2d 822, 828 (R.I. 2008). To satisfy the rule, evidentiary objections (1) must be raised before the trial court and (2) be “sufficiently focused so as to call the trial justice’s attention to the basis for said objection.” State v. Gautier, 950 A.2d 400, 407 (R.I. 2008) (quoting State v. Pacheco, 763 A.2d 971, 976 (R.I. 2001)). Under the 9', 'As the appellant conceded at oral argument, defense counsel’s objection to the trial justice’s questioning of Lt. Buckley was not timely or sufficiently specific to preserve the issue for review. Defense counsel did not object to the questioning of the laboratory technician.', '- 18 - specific language of Rule 614(C) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, objections to interrogation by the court “may be made at the time or at the next available opportunity when the jury is not present.” (Emphasis added).', 'Defense counsel asked to be heard at sidebar promptly after the trial justice’s questioning of Dr. Kettelle and before the witness was excused. At the suggestion of the trial justice, defense counsel placed his specific reasons for objection on the record the next day before the jury returned. Rule 614(C) permits the defense counsel’s method of objection used here to avoid counsel being put in the position of interrupting the trial justice in front of the jury. In Amaral, decided before the adoption of Rule 614(C), this Court described such a predicament as “embarrassing.” Amaral, 47 R.I. at 250, 132 A. at 550. This Court noted that counsel was forced to choose between risking the loss of the jury’s favor or losing the right to object to the introduction of the evidence. Id. The adoption of Rule 614(C) remedied this dilemma by permitting advocates to defer their objection until the trial justice concludes the interrogation. Here, defense counsel chose to do so and thus under Rule 614(C), the objection interposed at sidebar after the questioning was timely.', 'We caution that a general objection, made at the end of the trial justice’s line of questioning of a witness, does not preserve the issue for review. State v. Phommachak, 674 A.2d 382, 389 (R.I. 1996). However, the objection here was sufficiently specific. Counsel promptly notified the trial justice of his objection and put the trial justice on notice that he objected to the line of questioning. Further, defense counsel was given the opportunity to place the reasons for objection on the record the next day before the jury was seated. He informed the trial justice that the questioning of Dr. Kettelle served to “reiterat[e] points that were already made by the State” and he was concerned that the trial justice’s “adding in and going on at length at different points', '- 19 - * * * put[] the defendant in harm’s way where the jury might interpret your questions as suggesting that she must be guilty based upon the line of questions about the alcohol.” Although the defense did not request a cautionary instruction at this time, this failure does not bar review if the request “would have been futile or any attempt to palliate the prejudice would have been ineffective.” State v. Briggs, 787 A.2d 479, 484 (R.I. 2001) (quoting State v. Lemon, 478 A.2d 175, 181 (R.I. 1984)) (Emphasis in original.). In our view, the trial justice’s questioning of Dr. Kettelle transgressed the limits of judicial interrogation of witnesses to the extent that a curative instruction would have had an insufficient palliative effect. See State v. Evans, 618 A.2d 1283, 1284 (R.I. 1993) (holding trial justice’s curative instruction insufficient as “tenor of the trial justice’s questioning contained prejudicial influences”). Therefore, defense counsel’s failure to request a curative instruction does not render the objection too general, and the issue is properly before this Court. Briggs, 787 A.2d at 484.', '2', 'Trial Justice’s Interrogation', 'We have great respect for the trial justice and recognize that he has considerable discretion in the administration of the jury trial. However, we are further of the opinion that the trial justice erred when he questioned Dr. Kettelle, that the error was prejudicial and not harmless, and that defendant’s judgments of conviction must be vacated. The trial justice explained that his sole motivation in questioning Dr. Kettelle was to clarify the location of specific pages of a lengthy medical record. When the trial justice questioned Dr. Kettelle, both the manner of his interrogation and the testimony elicited from the witness went beyond the limits of clarification. Giordano, 440 A.2d at 745.', '- 20 -', 'As we repeatedly have emphasized, the parameters of judicial interrogation are narrowly confined to clarification of justifiably confusing matters for the jury. Figueras, 644 A.2d at 293; Evans, 618 A.2d at 1284; Giordano, 440 A.2d at 745. A trial justice may, for example, conduct a limited interrogation of a witness to inquire about the witness’s height and weight at various relevant intervals. State v. McVeigh, 660 A.2d 269, 273-74 (R.I. 1995). In McVeigh, this Court held that “[b]ecause neither the prosecutor nor defense counsel inquired about these subjects, this was an area that conceivably may have been a basis for confusion in the minds of the jurors.” Id. at 274. Here, the voluminous medical record did not in and of itself lead to a conclusion that the jury was confused or that it needed clarification. Indeed, the trial justice noted after defense counsel’s objection that “I didn’t want the jury to be confused and that was my point in questioning Dr. Kettelle, not to * * * as you put it, place the defendant in harm’s way.” He apparently did not believe that the jurors were confused, but rather did not want them to become confused with respect to the fifty-five page medical record.', 'Therefore, the trial justice’s questioning of Dr. Kettelle about the medical record did not constitute clarification of a point of confusion for the jury. There seems little question to us that the trial justice’s questioning prejudiced defendant. This is so because the trial justice’s questioning took on an air of cross- examination and the questions twice elicited answers from the witness that he was unable to perform standard tests on defendant because of her level of intoxication.', 'Doctor Kettelle testified that it would have been “malpractice” for him to conduct a certain examination on Nelson because she was too drunk to cooperate. This was devastating testimony in a drunk- driving trial.', 'Judicial interrogation that elicits inflammatory information from a witness is beyond the narrow parameters allowing only for clarification of confusing issues for the jury. Here, the', '- 21 - prosecution and defense already had questioned the witness regarding how defendant’s intoxicated state affected his examination and treatment of her. Therefore, the trial justice’s interrogation of Dr. Kettelle was not limited to a discrete issue left unresolved through counsels’ examination. Rather, the trial justice’s interrogation of Dr. Kettelle improperly served as an extension of the direct and cross-examination and went beyond acceptable limits.', 'The questioning severely prejudiced defendant because it reinforced defendant’s intoxication to the jury.', 'B', 'Interrogation of Dennis Hilliard', 'Nelson objected contemporaneously to the trial justice’s questioning of Mr. Hilliard with respect to his opinion as to Nelson’s relative blood alcohol level at 3:30 a.m. and 4:25 a.m. Nelson argues that the trial justice improperly asked the witness a “prosecution-oriented question” because the question tended to reveal to the jury the trial justice’s partiality and belief that Nelson had a higher blood alcohol content at 3:30 a.m. than she did an hour later. The state counters that the questioning does not entitle Nelson to a new trial because the witness could not, and did not, actually provide an opinion in response, and therefore the verdict was unaffected.', 'In our opinion, the trial justice’s interrogation of Mr. Hilliard was error and also requires us to vacate the judgments of conviction. The trial justice’s questioning of Mr. Hilliard was in the same vein as his questioning of Dr. Kettelle in that it strayed from this Court’s long-standing holdings that judicial questioning of witnesses must be confined to clarification of justifiably confusing matters for the jury. See Figueras, 644 A.2d at 293 (citing Giordano, 440 A.2d at 745). We emphasize that trial justices should not engage in the examination of witnesses of the kind that the trial justice conducted here.', '- 22 -', 'This questioning roamed beyond the boundaries of appropriate clarifying judicial interrogation because the question subtly rephrased a question that the prosecution had already asked and the witness had already answered. Therefore, the jury heard for a second time that Mr. Hilliard could not form an opinion about the defendant’s blood alcohol level at 3:30 a.m. compared with the established level at 4:25 a.m. without knowing when the defendant last consumed alcohol. We fail to see how this question could be characterized as a clarification of a justifiably confusing matter when the trial justice already knew exactly how the witness would respond. Clarification does not include simply editing counsel’s previous questions to how the judge felt they should have been asked. See Giordano, 440 A.2d at 745-46 (holding that trial justice’s request of a witness to explain an answer to a question asked on cross-examination constituted a clarification of the evidence).', 'In our opinion the trial justice erred in his questioning of Mr. Hilliard, and the defendant was prejudiced as a result of the jury hearing the trial justice essentially cross-examine a witness, regardless of Mr. Hilliard’s inability to give an opinion in response to the questioning.', 'Conclusion', 'Accordingly, the defendant’s appeal is sustained in part and denied in part and the judgments of conviction appealed from are vacated.

91,"Martel Investment Group, LLC : v. : Town of Richmond et al. : Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty, and Robinson, JJ. OPINION Justice Goldberg, for the Court. Martel Investment Group, LLC (Martel) appeals from a Superior Court decision granting summary judgment in favor of the defendant, Town of Richmond (Richmond or town).1 This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on September 29, 2009, pursuant to an order directing both parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised by this appeal should not summarily be decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that the issues raised by this appeal should be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1 Martel also filed suit against W. Michael Sullivan, Jennifer P. Anderson, Kevin Gosper, Henry R. Oppenheimer and Jason J. Proulx in their capacities as council members of the Town of Richmond, Melanie Jewett, in her capacity as the town planner of the Town of Richmond, Walter Prescott, Nancy Hess, Philip Damicis, John Fox, Charles W. More, William Bokon and Mark Robar in their capacities as members of the planning board of the Town of Richmond, and Gary Tedeschi, in his capacity as treasurer of the Town of Richmond. For the sake of simplicity, we refer to the entire group of defendants as the town. -1- I Facts and Travel On September 15, 2005, Martel purchased a parcel of real estate at 1210 Main Street in Richmond, the former site of a Bickford’s restaurant. The town previously had designated the property as part of the “general business district,” established “to provide areas of commercial uses that depend on greater volumes of vehicular traffic and highway related uses.” Town of Richmond Zoning Ordinance § 18.12.020E. (Zoning Ordinance). Operation of a restaurant was among the uses specifically permitted in the business district. Zoning Ordinance § 18.16.010, Use Codes 581 and 583. Martel purchased the property with the intention of operating an adult- entertainment business; however, it did not disclose this to the town. On October 5, 2005, Martel applied for a building permit to renovate the building for its intended use. The town issued the permit on October 7, 2005.2 In response to the permit application question concerning the proposed use, Martel indicated simply “retail” without further elaboration. Although the precise moment that the town became aware that Martel intended to open an adult-entertainment business is unclear, there is no dispute that on November 17, 2005, approximately one month after issuing the building permit, the town’s planning board proposed an amendment to the zoning ordinance that would prohibit the operation of an “adult entertainment business” throughout the town, except for the industrial zoning district. The planning board’s proposal was adopted on January 3, 2006. See Zoning Ordinance § 18.08.043. On December 12, 2005, the town, through its zoning enforcement officer, informed Martel that because it was proposing to change the property’s use from “restaurant to retail,” a development-plan review was required under § 18.54.010.D.2. Section B. of § 18.54.010 also 2 The town subsequently issued Martel permits related to electrical, plumbing, and mechanical work on the site. -2- provides that “[n]o building permit may be issued for any building within the purview of this chapter except in conformance with an approved development plan review.”3 It was not until January 20, 2006, that Martel applied for development-plan review and wrote in its submission that, “[b]ased upon the issuance of the various permits, and the representations of town officials, it was Martel’s understanding that no formal development review was required as it was changing from one allowable use to another, thus the town was waiving the requirement under Section 18.54.010.D.2 * * *.” By the time Martel applied, however, its proposed use was prohibited by newly amended § 18.08.043. By letter, dated February 1, 2006, the town solicitor notified Martel that its application for development plan review was rejected. Martel filed this suit against the town on May 3, 2006, contending that the town should be equitably estopped from enforcing the amended zoning ordinance because Martel reasonably had relied on the various construction permits that the town had issued. Martel also sought a declaratory judgment that it had a vested right in its proposed use and the newly amended ordinance could not be enforced against it. Additionally, Martel sought a writ of mandamus ordering the town to initiate development-plan review. Finally, Martel alleged that the town’s actions constituted intentional interference with its prospective contractual relations. On March 23, 2007, after discovery, Martel moved for summary judgment on all its claims. In response, the town filed a motion requesting additional discovery time pursuant to Rule 56(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. The hearing justice granted the town’s motion and postponed the summary judgment hearing until August 20, 2007. On July 23, 2007, however, the town filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. This became a point of contention 3 Section 18.54.010A. of the Town of Richmond Zoning Ordinance provides in relevant part: “Development plan review is required for all permitted uses and special permit uses other than one- or two-family dwellings or accessory buildings.” -3- between the parties, and Martel moved to strike the town’s cross-motion for summary judgment. Martel argued that, by asking for additional discovery solely so that it could respond to Martel’s summary-judgment motion, the town had violated Rule 56(f) and had misled the court by using the time to prepare its own summary-judgment motion. On August 20, 2007, after hearing arguments of counsel, a second hearing justice entered summary judgment in favor of the town.4 He primarily relied on this Court’s opinion in Town of Johnston v. Pezza, 723 A.2d 278, 283 (R.I. 1999), in which we held that the doctrine of equitable estoppel does not apply to instances in which a building official acts outside the authority vested in the official by the zoning ordinance. In addition, the hearing justice found that Martel had failed to notify the town of its intentional-interference with contractual-relations claim at least forty days prior to initiation of suit in accordance with G.L. 1956 § 45-15-5; and, therefore, he dismissed the tort claim, albeit without prejudice. Judgment was entered on January 14, 2008, from which Martel timely appealed. Before this Court, Martel advances five arguments. First, it contends that in ruling on the town’s summary-judgment motion, the hearing justice made impermissible findings of fact. Second, Martel argues that the hearing justice misconstrued this Court’s decision in Pezza. Third, Martel avers that it had a vested right to the building permit. Next, Martel contends that the hearing justice erred in denying Martel’s motion to strike the town’s summary-judgment motion as violating Rule 56(f). Finally, it argues that it was error to dismiss the intentional- interference claim without prejudice. 4 The second hearing justice’s decision did not mention Martel’s concurrent motion to strike the town’s summary-judgment motion. Although neither party included an official transcript of the hearing on August 20, 2007, a review of the transcript attached as an exhibit to the town’s Sup. Ct. R. 12A Statement reveals that the second hearing justice heard and denied Martel’s motion to strike. -4- II Standard of Review “This Court reviews a trial justice’s decision to grant summary judgment on a de novo basis.” Credit Union Central Falls v. Groff, 966 A.2d 1262, 1267 (R.I. 2009) (citing United Lending Corp. v. City of Providence, 827 A.2d 626, 631 (R.I. 2003)). “We will affirm such a decision only if ‘after reviewing the admissible evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, we conclude that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.’” Id. (quoting Lucier v. Impact Recreation, Ltd., 864 A.2d 635, 638 (R.I. 2005)). “Moreover, the party opposing a summary-judgment motion ‘has the burden of proving by competent evidence the existence of a disputed issue of material fact and cannot rest upon mere allegations or denials in the pleadings, mere conclusions or mere legal opinions.’” Id. (quoting Lucier, 864 A.2d at 638). III Discussion Our careful review of the hearing justice’s decision reveals no cause for reversal. Martel’s primary argument on appeal is that the hearing justice erred in declining to find that the town was estopped from enforcing its zoning ordinances. It long has been the law of this jurisdiction that, “building permits lawfully issued for a permitted use should be immune to impairment or revocation by reason of subsequent amendment to the zoning ordinance when the holders thereof, acting in reliance thereon in good faith, initiate construction in some reasonably substantial measure or incur some reasonably substantial obligation promoting such construction.” Shalvey v. Zoning Board of Review of Warwick, 99 R.I. 692, 699, 210 A.2d 589, 593-94 (1965) (emphasis added); see also A. Ferland & Sons, Inc. v. Zoning Board of Review of East Providence, 105 R.I. 275, 278-79, 251 A.2d 536, 538 (1969) (recognizing that the “acquisition of equities” immunize a narrow class of permit holders). -5- The crucial question before us, then, is whether the series of construction permits the town granted Martel were lawfully issued. The facts in this case closely resemble the circumstances giving rise to our decision in Pezza. In that case, a company bought a parcel of property with the intention of operating an asphalt-mixing plant. Pezza, 723 A.2d at 280. To that end, it pursued a building permit from the town building official who, after first requiring preliminary approval from the Department of Environmental Management and the local fire department, issued the permit. Id. Relying on this permit, the company began construction of the plant. Id. at 280-81. Litigation commenced after a subsequent building official rescinded the company’s building permit, citing, inter alia, the company’s failure to provide a site plan in accordance with the town’s zoning ordinance. Id. After finding that the building official had ignored the site plan requirement sixty-one out of a possible sixty-two times, the Superior Court refused to enjoin the company from going forward with construction, despite the clear language of the ordinance, declaring that such a remedy would be “too drastic.” Id. at 283. We reversed the trial justice’s decision, reasoning that “[a] building-permit applicant’s compliance with [the] zoning ordinance * * * does not constitute a mere empty formality.” Id. We went on to say, “In fact, such [compliance] is a condition precedent to the later submittal and potential building-permit approval by the town’s building official. Because neither [the applicant] nor [the building official] even attempted to satisfy—much less fulfill—this condition precedent to the issuance of a building permit, [the building official’s] act of issuing the building permit without first obtaining an approved site plan from the board was ultra vires, and the [applicants] were not entitled to rely upon the inspector’s unlawful issuance of the permit in proceeding to construct the asphalt plant.” Id. -6- Turning to the facts in this case, there is no dispute that the town’s zoning ordinance expressly required development-plan-review approval before the building official lawfully could issue a building permit. It is also clear that, at the time the town building official issued the building permit in this case, Martel had not complied with that express mandate. Martel nevertheless urges this Court to apply the doctrine of equitable estoppel, despite our holding in Pezza, arguing that “it is patently unfair to require a developer to adhere to zoning regulations during the building permit stage that the municipality itself does not enforce.” We disagree. We long have refused to estop a governmental entity when to do so would contravene state law. See, e.g., Romano v. Retirement Board of the Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island, 767 A.2d 35, 39-43, 43 (R.I. 2001) (allowing a state employee to rely on ultra vires assurances of a state retirement counselor “would undermine the integrity and structure of our state government because it would allow every government official to act as his own mini- legislature, cashiering those laws he or she dislikes, is ignorant of, or misinterprets, and instead molding the law to be whatever the government official claims it to be”). As we explained in Pezza, a building-permit applicant is responsible for ensuring that his or her application conforms to the relevant zoning ordinances. Martel’s failure to comply with the zoning ordinance is neither mitigated nor excused by the mere fact that the town building official also erred. Indeed, the town’s error seems far less egregious than the situation in Pezza, where the building official almost uniformly ignored the requirements of the zoning ordinance. Pezza, 723 A.2d at 283. We often have stated that “[i]n Rhode Island the local building official is a municipal administrative officer who is bound to follow the zoning ordinance and applicable statutory provisions pursuant to which he or she is authorized to act.” City of Providence v. Estate of Tarro, 973 A.2d 597, 605 (R.I. 2009) (quoting Pitocco v. Harrington, 707 A.2d 692, -7- 696 (R.I. 1998)); see also G.L. 1956 § 23-27.3-107.1. A building official may not act beyond the authority granted to him or her by law. Thus, issuance of a building permit by the building official in the absence of development-plan review was ultra vires and unlawful such that the doctrine of equitable estoppel does not apply. Martel argues alternatively that it had a vested right in the building permit. According to § 18.56.010 of the town zoning ordinance entitled “Creation of vested rights,” “Applications for development that are substantially complete and have been submitted for approval to the appropriate review agency in the town prior to enactment of this zoning ordinance or any amendment thereto shall be considered vested. For the purposes of this section, any application considered by the town shall be reviewed according to the regulations applicable in the zoning ordinance in force at the time the application was submitted.” Martel did not submit its request for development-plan review until January 20, 2006, after the town had amended its zoning ordinance to prohibit “adult entertainment businesses” outside the industrial zone. As such, Martel’s application was not substantially complete before the prohibition was enacted; therefore, there is no “safe harbor” of substantial completeness that can be invoked. We pause briefly to address the remainder of Martel’s arguments. Martel also contends that the second hearing justice erroneously found that it failed to disclose its intention to open an adult-entertainment business when it applied for its building permits. We decline to address this issue. Whatever Martel’s level of forthrightness, the hearing justice did not arrive at his decision by impugning Martel. Indeed, the hearing justice “expresse[d] no opinion on whether [Martel’s] reliance was done in good faith or was sufficiently substantial so as to trigger [equitable estoppel].” Rather, the hearing justice found that, without development-plan review, the town could not issue Martel a valid building permit. Accordingly, we are satisfied that the second -8- hearing justice’s purported finding on Martel’s failure to disclose its intended use for the property had no bearing on his ultimate decision. Martel avers that the second hearing justice committed reversible error when he failed to rule on its motion to strike the town’s counter-motion for summary judgment. Martel argues that by moving pursuant to Rule 56(f), the town was required to conduct additional discovery before filing its counter-motion for summary judgment. Rule 56(f) allows a party opposing a motion for summary judgment to seek additional time to conduct further discovery to respond to a motion for summary judgment. “This Court has held that a trial justice’s decision to grant a continuance pursuant to Rule 56(f) is discretionary.” Chevy Chase, F.S.B. v. Faria, 733 A.2d 725, 727 (R.I. 1999) (mem.) (citing Greenwald v. Selya & Iannuccillo, Inc., 491 A.2d 988, 989 (R.I. 1985)). Further, “courts have been lenient with the party opposing summary judgment, even where [the party] has not formally complied with [R]ule 56(f).” Mill Factors Corp. v. L.S. Building Supplies, Inc., 103 R.I. 675, 678, 240 A.2d 720, 722 (1968) (citing 6 Moore, Federal Practice, § 56.24 at 2872 (2d ed. 1966)). In light of the second hearing justice’s broad discretion in granting a continuance pursuant to Rule 56(f) and Martel’s failure to provide a record of the hearing in which its motion to strike was denied, we are satisfied that the second hearing justice did not abuse his discretion. Finally, Martel argues that the second hearing justice erred when he dismissed Martel’s tort claim alleging intentional interference with contractual relations, based on its failure to comply with the notice provision in § 45-15-5, which requires a plaintiff to provide a municipality with forty days notice before commencing suit. Such notice is a condition precedent to a valid suit and is intended to afford a municipality time to settle a claim rather than undergoing the expense of litigation. United Lending Corp., 827 A.2d at 632 (citing Bernard v. -9- Alexander, 605 A.2d 484, 485 (R.I. 1992)). There is no dispute that Martel failed to comply with § 45-15-5. However, because Martel refiled its intentional-interference with contractual- relations claim in compliance with § 45-15-5, it has waived this issue on appeal. IV Conclusion For the reasons set out above, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed and the papers of the case are returned to the Superior Court. Chief Justice Williams (ret.) did not participate. - 10 - Supreme Court No. 2008-152-Appeal. (WC 06-276) Martel Investment Group, LLC : v. : Town of Richmond et al. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. Martel Investment Group, LLC (Martel) appeals from a Superior Court decision granting summary judgment in favor of the defendant, Town of Richmond (Richmond or town).1 This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on September 29, 2009, pursuant to an order directing both parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised by this appeal should not summarily be decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that the issues raised by this appeal should be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'Martel also filed suit against W. Michael Sullivan, Jennifer P. Anderson, Kevin Gosper, Henry R. Oppenheimer and Jason J. Proulx in their capacities as council members of the Town of Richmond, Melanie Jewett, in her capacity as the town planner of the Town of Richmond, Walter Prescott, Nancy Hess, Philip Damicis, John Fox, Charles W. More, William Bokon and Mark Robar in their capacities as members of the planning board of the Town of Richmond, and Gary Tedeschi, in his capacity as treasurer of the Town of Richmond. For the sake of simplicity, we refer to the entire group of defendants as the town.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On September 15, 2005, Martel purchased a parcel of real estate at 1210 Main Street in Richmond, the former site of a Bickford’s restaurant. The town previously had designated the property as part of the “general business district,” established “to provide areas of commercial uses that depend on greater volumes of vehicular traffic and highway related uses.” Town of Richmond Zoning Ordinance § 18.12.020E. (Zoning Ordinance). Operation of a restaurant was among the uses specifically permitted in the business district. Zoning Ordinance § 18.16.010, Use Codes 581 and 583. Martel purchased the property with the intention of operating an adult- entertainment business; however, it did not disclose this to the town. On October 5, 2005, Martel applied for a building permit to renovate the building for its intended use. The town issued the permit on October 7, 2005.2 In response to the permit application question concerning the proposed use, Martel indicated simply “retail” without further elaboration.', 'Although the precise moment that the town became aware that Martel intended to open an adult-entertainment business is unclear, there is no dispute that on November 17, 2005, approximately one month after issuing the building permit, the town’s planning board proposed an amendment to the zoning ordinance that would prohibit the operation of an “adult entertainment business” throughout the town, except for the industrial zoning district. The planning board’s proposal was adopted on January 3, 2006. See Zoning Ordinance § 18.08.043.', 'On December 12, 2005, the town, through its zoning enforcement officer, informed Martel that because it was proposing to change the property’s use from “restaurant to retail,” a development-plan review was required under § 18.54.010.D.2. Section B. of § 18.54.010 also 2', 'The town subsequently issued Martel permits related to electrical, plumbing, and mechanical work on the site.', '-2- provides that “[n]o building permit may be issued for any building within the purview of this chapter except in conformance with an approved development plan review.”3 It was not until January 20, 2006, that Martel applied for development-plan review and wrote in its submission that, “[b]ased upon the issuance of the various permits, and the representations of town officials, it was Martel’s understanding that no formal development review was required as it was changing from one allowable use to another, thus the town was waiving the requirement under Section 18.54.010.D.2 * * *.” By the time Martel applied, however, its proposed use was prohibited by newly amended § 18.08.043. By letter, dated February 1, 2006, the town solicitor notified Martel that its application for development plan review was rejected.', 'Martel filed this suit against the town on May 3, 2006, contending that the town should be equitably estopped from enforcing the amended zoning ordinance because Martel reasonably had relied on the various construction permits that the town had issued. Martel also sought a declaratory judgment that it had a vested right in its proposed use and the newly amended ordinance could not be enforced against it. Additionally, Martel sought a writ of mandamus ordering the town to initiate development-plan review. Finally, Martel alleged that the town’s actions constituted intentional interference with its prospective contractual relations.', 'On March 23, 2007, after discovery, Martel moved for summary judgment on all its claims. In response, the town filed a motion requesting additional discovery time pursuant to Rule 56(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. The hearing justice granted the town’s motion and postponed the summary judgment hearing until August 20, 2007. On July 23, 2007, however, the town filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. This became a point of contention 3', 'Section 18.54.010A. of the Town of Richmond Zoning Ordinance provides in relevant part: “Development plan review is required for all permitted uses and special permit uses other than one- or two-family dwellings or accessory buildings.”', '-3- between the parties, and Martel moved to strike the town’s cross-motion for summary judgment. Martel argued that, by asking for additional discovery solely so that it could respond to Martel’s summary-judgment motion, the town had violated Rule 56(f) and had misled the court by using the time to prepare its own summary-judgment motion.', 'On August 20, 2007, after hearing arguments of counsel, a second hearing justice entered summary judgment in favor of the town.4 He primarily relied on this Court’s opinion in Town of Johnston v. Pezza, 723 A.2d 278, 283 (R.I. 1999), in which we held that the doctrine of equitable estoppel does not apply to instances in which a building official acts outside the authority vested in the official by the zoning ordinance. In addition, the hearing justice found that Martel had failed to notify the town of its intentional-interference with contractual-relations claim at least forty days prior to initiation of suit in accordance with G.L. 1956 § 45-15-5; and, therefore, he dismissed the tort claim, albeit without prejudice.

92,"In re Toryn C. : Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty, Robinson, JJ., and Williams, C.J. (ret.). OPINION Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. Diamantina Sousa Andrade and Christopher Andrade, the petitioners, appeal from a Family Court order dismissing their petition for adoption. The petition concerned Toryn C., the biological daughter of Mrs. Andrade and the stepdaughter of Mr. Andrade. The petitioners seek to terminate the parental rights of Toryn’s biological father, Daniel Cabral, thus enabling Mr. Andrade to legally adopt her. The chief judge of the Family Court dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction because both the petitioners are residents of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised on appeal should not summarily be decided. After considering the submissions of petitioners, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that the case may be decided without the necessity of further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Family Court. I Facts and Procedural History According to Mrs. Andrade, she and Toryn lived continuously in Rhode Island from the date of Toryn’s birth in 1993 through March 2005. On March 7, 2005, Mrs. Andrade filed a miscellaneous complaint for custody and allowances against Mr. Cabral, and on June 9, 2005, -1- the Family Court entered an order granting her sole custody of Toryn. Sometime after her marriage to Mr. Andrade, she and Toryn moved to Rehoboth, Massachusetts, where the family continues to reside. The Andrades first attempted to file a petition for adoption on April 4, 2007. The petition and related documents were returned to them, however, together with a letter from the supervisory clerk of the Family Court stating that the “Chief Judge * * * deems that we do not have jurisdiction.” On May 14, 2007, they refiled their petition, which was accepted by the clerk’s office. The record also indicates that Mr. Cabral was served personally at his residence in Providence on May 23, 2007. 1 The petitioners also filed a motion to recuse, seeking to prevent the chief judge from presiding at the hearing on the petition. The Andrades contended that the chief judge had “prejudged” the jurisdictional question because he already had expressed his opinion on the issue when they originally attempted to file the petition. The chief judge held a hearing on the petition on June 13, 2007. He first noted that petitioners were correct in arguing that the Family Court clerk had no authority to reject the petition, stating that “[i]t’s up to a judge to make the determination whether the petition is appropriate or not.” After a brief colloquy, the chief judge stated that G.L. 1956 § 15-7-4 permits the Family Court to consider petitions for adoption filed by a “person residing in Rhode Island.” He concluded that, because petitioners were both residents of Massachusetts, the Family Court had no jurisdiction to consider their petition. An order was entered the same day dismissing the petition for lack of jurisdiction. The petitioners timely filed a notice of appeal. 1 Mr. Cabral never responded to any of the pleadings filed in the Family Court, nor has he filed a counter-statement under Article I, Rule 12A of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure. He was defaulted by this Court on January 20, 2009. -2- On appeal, the Andrades argue that the Family Court has jurisdiction over the petition because (1) Toryn’s biological father, whose parental rights would be determined in the course of the adoption proceeding, is a resident of Rhode Island; (2) the Family Court has some form of continuing jurisdiction over the adoption petition because it previously adjudicated Mrs. Andrade’s complaint for custody and allowances; and (3) under certain circumstances, § 15-7-4 allows nonresidents to petition for adoption. II Standard of Review The relevant portions of § 15-7-4 provide as follows: “(a) Any person residing in Rhode Island may petition the [F]amily [C]ourt for leave to adopt * * *. “* * * “(c) Any person not a resident of Rhode Island may petition the [F]amily [C]ourt for leave to adopt * * * if the child is at the time of the filing of the petition in the care and custody of a governmental child placing agency, or licensed Rhode Island child placing agency * * *.” This Court reviews questions of statutory construction de novo. In re Tamika R., 973 A.2d 547, 550 (R.I. 2009). “[W]hen the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, [this Court] must interpret the statute literally and must give the words of the statute their plain and ordinary meanings.” State v. LaRoche, 925 A.2d 885, 887 (R.I. 2007) (quoting State v. Oliveira, 882 A.2d 1097, 1110 (R.I. 2005)). When interpreting a statute, however, this Court’s “ultimate goal is to give effect to the purpose of the act as intended by the Legislature.” Hanley v. State, 837 A.2d 707, 711 (R.I. 2003) (quoting Oliveira v. Lombardi, 794 A.2d 453, 457 (R.I. 2002)). III Discussion We discern no ambiguity in the language of § 15-7-4(a). The General Assembly has not vested jurisdiction in the Family Court over adoption petitions filed by nonresidents unless the -3- child sought to be adopted is in the care and custody of a government child-placing agency as provided in § 15-7-4(c). The petitioners concede that they have been residents of Massachusetts at all times relevant to the petition under review, thus precluding Family Court jurisdiction under § 15-7-4(a). Nor do they dispute that Toryn has been in the continuous custody of her mother and has never been in the care and custody of a Rhode Island agency, thus precluding Family Court jurisdiction under § 15-7-4(c). The fact that Toryn’s biological father is a resident of Rhode Island has no bearing on the question of the Family Court’s jurisdiction under the statutory scheme. Moreover, the petition for adoption is an entirely separate proceeding from Mrs. Andrade’s previous complaint for custody and allowances. The fact that the Family Court may continue to exercise jurisdiction with respect to issues of custody and support does not confer upon the Family Court jurisdiction to entertain an adoption petition. Whereas, Mrs. Andrade’s previous action fell within the jurisdiction of the Family Court, the instant petition does not. As we have previously noted, the Family Court is a legislatively created court of limited jurisdiction. See Pierce v. Pierce, 770 A.2d 867, 870 (R.I. 2001) (citing Furia v. Furia, 638 A.2d 548, 552 (R.I. 1994)). In the absence of statutory language expressly conferring original or concurrent jurisdiction on the Family Court, such jurisdiction cannot be inferred. Concannon v. Concannon, 116 R.I. 323, 328-30, 356 A.2d 487, 491 (1976). The facts of this case clearly place the Andrades’ petition outside the jurisdiction of the Family Court as delimited in § 15-7-4. The petitioners’ reliance on this Court’s decision in In re Jeramie N., 688 A.2d 825 (R.I. 1997), is unavailing. In that case, this Court allowed the Family Court to consider a petition for adoption filed by two nonresidents. Id. at 830. We specifically noted, however, that “[w]e decline * * * to apply our holding [in Jeramie N.] to other cases at this time. Our holding is -4- limited to the statute as applied in this case.” Id. That case presented a unique situation that has little bearing on the instant matter. We are satisfied that in the case under review the chief judge correctly ruled that the Family Court was without jurisdiction to hear the Andrades’ adoption petition. 2 IV Conclusion For the reasons set forth in this opinion, the order of the Family Court is affirmed. The papers in this case may be returned to the Family Court. 2 To the extent petitioners suggest a constitutional infirmity in the Family Court proceedings, the issue clearly has been waived. They did not present a due-process or equal-protection argument to the Family Court and, at best, the issue has been only obliquely raised in their Rule 12A statement. Moreover, notice was not given to the Attorney General as required by Rule 24(d) of the Family Court Rules of Procedure for Domestic Relations. -5- Supreme Court No. 2007-294-Appeal.

93,: v. : Kenneth Lima. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson for the Court. The plaintiff, Frank Fiorenzano, appeals pro se from the Superior Court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant, Kenneth Lima, with respect to each of the counts set forth in the plaintiff’s complaint. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the written and oral submissions of the parties, we are of the opinion that the appeal may be resolved without further briefing or argument.', 'For the reasons hereinafter set forth, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'This case arose in the wake of an acrimonious probate-related dispute involving Kenneth Lima and Charlene Lima, the latter being plaintiff’s wife and Kenneth’s sister.1 In his complaint, Mr. Fiorenzano alleged that Kenneth had engaged in a pattern of harassing and abusive legal proceedings in a purported effort to inflict emotional and physical distress upon both Charlene 1', 'For the sake of simplicity and clarity, we shall frequently refer to the members of the Lima family mentioned herein by their first names; we of course intend no disrespect.', '-1- and himself.2 Mr. Fiorenzano further alleged that Kenneth’s actions were motivated by his belief that he did not receive a proper share of his mother’s estate under her will.3 Mr. Fiorenzano asserted, inter alia, that Kenneth had filed frivolous motions in the probate court and had filed a complaint with the Rhode Island State Police, alleging that Charlene had embezzled assets of the estate.', 'The probate court litigation was ultimately settled; and, on September 29, 2006, Kenneth and Charlene signed mutual releases.4 After the settlement of the probate court litigation, Kenneth commenced a civil action against an entity called Domestic Bank, alleging that it had mishandled the assets of his mother’s estate. In the case at bar, Mr. Fiorenzano has alleged that Kenneth’s harassment of him and his wife continued when defendant sought to depose each of them in connection with the Domestic Bank case.', 'Kenneth (the plaintiff in the Domestic Bank case and the defendant in the instant case) first attempted to depose Charlene in connection with the Domestic Bank litigation on February 14, 2008.5 When she appeared for the deposition, Charlene was accompanied by her attorney and by Mr. Fiorenzano. Counsel for Kenneth objected to the presence of Mr. Fiorenzano at the 2', 'In his submissions to the Superior Court and to this Court, plaintiff has made frequent reference to Kenneth’s alleged harassment of Charlene. It should be emphasized, however, that Charlene is not now and never has been a party to this case. In view of Charlene’s non-party status, Kenneth’s actions vis-à-vis Charlene (and we express no view concerning the accuracy of plaintiff’s allegations in that regard) are of no moment in this case.', 'We consider plaintiff’s frequent attempts to muddy the waters with irrelevant assertions concerning a non-party to be regrettable. 3', 'Angela Lima, the mother of Charlene and Kenneth Lima, died on June 3, 2004. 4', 'Although it is true that mutual releases were signed by Charlene and Kenneth at the time of the settlement of the probate litigation, we need not reach the issue of the preclusive effect (vel non) of those releases as to post-settlement civil actions since there is no evidence of any civil action ever having been brought by Charlene against Kenneth. 5', 'Charlene had earlier filed a motion to quash the notice of the deposition, but that motion was denied.', '-2- deposition, citing Rule 30(c) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure; that rule provides that all counsel of record must be given forty-eight hours notice if a non-party seeks to attend the deposition. In response to that objection, Charlene’s counsel stated on the record that he had relied on Mr. Fiorenzano’s assistance and that Mr. Fiorenzano’s presence was necessary to assist counsel in his representation of Charlene. Charlene’s counsel later stated that Mr. Fiorenzano was also needed “to provide comfort” to Charlene during the deposition. Kenneth’s counsel refused to go forward with the deposition at that time due to the presence of Mr. Fiorenzano. The dispute about who could attend the deposition was subsequently brought before a hearing justice of the Superior Court, who issued a protective order precluding Mr. Fiorenzano from attending his wife’s deposition; and Charlene was eventually deposed.', 'Subsequent to the above-referenced first attempt to depose Charlene (but before her deposition was actually taken), defendant, through counsel, sought to take the deposition of Mr. Fiorenzano. A subpoena requiring Mr. Fiorenzano to appear at the office of Kenneth’s counsel for the taking of his deposition on March 13, 2008 was issued. Because of Mr. Fiorenzano’s unavailability on March 13, 2008, his deposition was not taken on that date. Mr. Fiorenzano alleges that he has tried on numerous occasions to reschedule his deposition, but that defendant has “failed and refused” to do so. The plaintiff now contends that defendant’s refusal to reschedule the deposition “demonstrat[es] that the real reason for serving process on Plaintiff is to harass and annoy him,” rather than to actually obtain plaintiff’s testimony.', 'Mr. Fiorenzano commenced the instant action in the Superior Court for Newport County on April 11, 2008. The plaintiff’s complaint contained two substantive counts. The first count of the complaint alleged that Kenneth engaged in abuse of process by seeking to depose him and Charlene in the above-referenced action against Domestic Bank. Mr. Fiorenzano alleged that defendant noticed those depositions only for the purpose of further harassing him and his wife', '-3- just as (according to Mr. Fiorenzano) defendant also did during the probate proceedings. The second substantive count was a loss of consortium claim that (according to Mr. Fiorenzano) stemmed from defendant’s wrongful conduct toward both him and Charlene. The complaint also sets forth extensive allegations, many of which are unrelated to the present case, which describe numerous acrimonious interactions over the course of several years.', 'The defendant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure; he simultaneously moved in the alternative for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. The defendant’s two-pronged motion was heard before a hearing justice of the Superior Court on June 2, 2008. After considering the submissions and arguments of the parties, defendant’s dispositive motion was granted;6 the hearing justice ordered that judgment be entered in favor of defendant on all counts of plaintiff’s complaint. In the course of rendering her decision, the hearing justice stated:', '“The Court finds the instant Complaint to be scurrilous,', 'bizarre[;] it is baseless, and it has components that are absolutely', 'libelous and defamatory, per se, in that they purport to impute', 'crimes baselessly to a person. This Complaint has no place in any', 'court of integrity in the American judicial system, and the Court is', 'dismissing it.”7 6', 'Since the hearing justice considered documents outside the pleadings, it is clear that she ruled in defendant’s favor in reliance on Rule 56 rather than Rule 12(b)(6) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. 7', 'The plaintiff takes issue with the strong language used by the hearing justice in dismissing his complaint.

The hearing justice quite correctly pointed out that a loss of consortium action is derivative in nature and that Charlene is not a party to the instant litigation.', 'The hearing justice properly dismissed plaintiff’s loss of consortium action against defendant. In Sama v. Cardi Corp., 569 A.2d 432 (R.I. 1990), we stated that “an action for loss of consortium under § 9-1-41, although a separate cause of action * * *, is not an independent action but a derivative one that is attached to the claim of the injured spouse. It arises from the injured spouse’s physical injury and is dependent upon the success of the underlying tort claim.” Id. (emphasis added); see also Olshansky v. Rehrig International, 872 A.2d 282, 291 (R.I. 2005); Desjarlais v. USAA Insurance Co., 824 A.2d 1272, 1277 (R.I. 2003); Soares v. Ann & Hope of Rhode Island, Inc., 637 A.2d 339, 353 (R.I. 1994). A claim for loss of consortium by a spouse or parent or child depends on the injured party’s ability to recover in a claim against the same defendant; the claim remains essentially inchoate until the injured party in fact recovers. See Desjarlais, 824 A.2d at 1277; see also Santana v. Rainbow Cleaners, Inc., 969 A.2d 653, 667 (R.I. 2009) (holding that, because the plaintiff mother did not prevail on her tort claim, her children’s loss of consortium claim must fail); Holley v. Argonaut Holdings, Inc., 968 A.2d 271, depose Mr. Fiorenzano. Indeed, it appears from that correspondence that defendant’s attorney attempted to reschedule the deposition, but was unable to do so.

There being no evidence whatsoever of the existence of a successful tort action by Charlene against Kenneth, Mr. Fiorenzano’s claim for loss of consortium is bootless: there is nothing upon which such a derivative claim can be based. See Olshansky, 872 A.2d at 291; Soares, 637 A.2d at 353.', 'There conceivably may be extraordinary circumstances in which a spouse can obtain damages for loss of consortium where his or her spouse cannot or will not bring an action. See generally Restatement (Second) of Torts § 693 cmt.g. (1977). However, even if this jurisdiction were to look favorably upon the above-cited comment in the Restatement as to the possibility of a freestanding claim for loss of consortium, the circumstances of the instant case are entirely inappropriate for such an innovation; what is before us is the complete absence of any tort claim by the allegedly injured spouse as well as the complete absence of any “equitable” factor that might conceivably incline this Court to depart from the traditional principles relative to the derivative nature of loss of consortium claims. The hearing justice did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of the defendant on the plaintiff’s loss of consortium claim.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

94,: v. : Douglas Farrar. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson for the Court. This case arises from a dispute between a residential landlord and his tenant. The defendant landlord, Douglas Farrar, appeals from a judgment entered in favor of the pro se plaintiff, Loretta Furlan, after a bench trial in the Superior Court. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After examining the written and oral submissions of the parties, we are of the opinion that the appeal may be resolved without further briefing or argument. For the reasons hereinafter set forth, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'There is no material dispute as to the facts summarized in this paragraph. In August of 2006, Ms. Furlan called Mr. Farrar to inquire about an apartment in Smithfield that he had advertised as being for rent. Ms. Furlan had been living in Florida, and she intended to move back to Rhode Island. Shortly after placing the phone call to Mr. Farrar, Ms. Furlan asked one or', '-1- two of her friends to inspect the apartment in her absence. One of those friends reported back to Ms. Furlan that the apartment was “nice and clean.”', 'Thereafter, Ms. Furlan and defendant orally agreed that Ms. Furlan would pay $800 as a security deposit and $800 for the first month’s rent. On August 25, 2006, Ms. Furlan then sent defendant a cashier’s check in the amount of $1600.', 'The starting date of the rental period was in dispute at trial. Ms. Furlan contended that the rental period was to begin on October 1, 2006. The defendant disagreed and asserted that he and Ms. Furlan had agreed that the rental period would begin on September 1.', 'At some point in time after having sent the $1600 check to Mr. Farrar, Ms. Furlan called him to inform him that she would be delayed in taking possession of the apartment. The date on which this call was made was also in dispute. According to plaintiff, she placed this call on October 1. The defendant asserts, however, that it was on September 10 and then again in the third week of September that plaintiff called him to inform him of the delay.', 'On October 6, Ms. Furlan called defendant to tell him that she would not be taking the apartment after all, and she asked that defendant return $800 to her. The defendant told her that he was unwilling to return any money to her. The plaintiff testified that, later on October 6, approximately one half-hour after her initial phone call to Mr. Farrar, she called him again to tell him that, since defendant had refused to return the requested amount to her, plaintiff would in fact use the apartment; she further testified that she told defendant that her brother would be bringing furniture to the apartment. However, defendant refused to allow Ms. Furlan to take possession of the apartment or allow her brother to bring furniture to the apartment.', 'Consequently, on December 22, 2006, plaintiff filed the instant action in the District Court’s Small Claims Court. In her complaint, Ms. Furlan sought damages in the amount of', '-2- $800 plus costs. On September 6, 2007, after a bench trial in the Small Claims Court, the trial justice found in favor of plaintiff.1 The defendant then proceeded to file a timely appeal and sought a de novo trial in the Superior Court.', 'In due course, a bench trial was held in the Superior Court on November 9, 2007. At that trial, plaintiff testified that, on October 6, 2006,2 she had been driving to Rhode Island when she learned that her husband had been injured at work in Florida. The plaintiff further testified that she then drove back to Florida and called defendant to advise him that she would not be taking the apartment. The plaintiff further testified that defendant refused her request to refund her money and subsequently refused to allow her to occupy the apartment in October. The plaintiff testified that her brother had arrived at the apartment in order to move furniture into it, but (in her words) “the men that were working at the house wouldn’t let him in.”', 'The defendant admitted that, after plaintiff called him on October 6, 2006 to notify him that she would not be taking the apartment, plaintiff called him back and requested that her brother be given access to the apartment to move furniture into it. The defendant further testified that, before plaintiff called him back, he had instructed his staff to “remove the key” because he “didn’t want anybody moving in.” The defendant also testified that no written agreement with plaintiff existed, and he added that he had intended to provide a lease once plaintiff took possession of the apartment. According to defendant, his general course of conduct was to enter 1', 'The plaintiff was initially defaulted for her failure to appear for trial in the Small Claims Court on February 13, 2007. In defaulting plaintiff, the trial justice dismissed plaintiff’s complaint and awarded defendant damages on his counterclaim. The plaintiff subsequently filed a motion to vacate the default judgment on the grounds that she had not been notified of the February 13 trial date. The District Court vacated the default judgment on August 30, 2007. 2', 'Ms. Furlan initially testified that she had called Mr. Farrar on October 5, but she later testified that she had placed the phone call on October 6. We shall rely on the latter date in applying the law to the facts of this case.', '-3- into lease agreements with all his tenants. The defendant also testified that, on October 16 and October 30, 2006, he had placed advertisements in a newspaper indicating that the apartment at issue was available for rent; he testified that said advertising cost $169.84 per advertisement— for a total amount of $339.68. It was further his testimony that a few people expressed interest in renting the apartment, but that he decided not to rent to them.', 'The trial justice in the Superior Court found that the starting date of the rental period was “the beginning of September as advocated by the defendant,” and he also found that the landlord- tenant relationship began when defendant received plaintiff’s check for $1600. The trial justice further stated:', '“Mr. Farrar had $800 for the month of September rent, and that certainly', 'was used up even though the plaintiff, Miss Furlan, you didn’t arrive at the', 'apartment, there was another $800 in security deposit that began to spill', 'over into the month of October, and at some point, specifically October', '6th, Miss Furlan, you made a telephone call and you advised Mr. Farrar', 'that you wouldn’t be taking the apartment. Sometime thereafter on the', 'same day, by both [parties’] testimony, you decided to at least try and take', 'the benefit of your bargain and take the remaining weeks and whatever', 'money that you had left on this particular transaction, and by Mr. Farrar’s', 'testimony as well as yours, both sides agree that Mr. Farrar decided not to', 'allow that.”', 'The trial justice further found that defendant did not send a termination letter to plaintiff and that plaintiff had not abandoned the premises as of the second phone call on October 6, 2006. The trial justice then determined that plaintiff was entitled to be awarded the sum of $625—such sum being reflective of the rental value of the apartment from the period from October 6 through October 31, during which period the defendant landlord would not permit the plaintiff tenant to have access to the apartment. However, the trial justice then proceeded to offset that $625 amount by defendant’s advertising costs (viz., $339.68), and he accordingly awarded plaintiff the sum of $285.32 in net damages, plus costs.', '-4-', 'Final judgment was entered on November 9, 2007 in favor of plaintiff in the amount of $320.35, including $35.03 in costs. The defendant filed a notice of appeal on November 27, 2007.', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court has stated that “[i]t is well settled that the findings of fact of a trial justice, sitting without a jury, will be given great weight and will not be disturbed absent a showing that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.” Greensleeves, Inc. v. Smiley, 942 A.2d 284, 289 (R.I. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Riley v. Stafford, 896 A.2d 701, 703 (R.I. 2006); Technology Investors v. Town of Westerly, 689 A.2d 1060, 1062 (R.I. 1997). In reviewing a trial justice’s findings, we will not disturb them “unless such findings are clearly erroneous or unless the trial justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence or unless the decision fails to do substantial justice between the parties.” Vigneaux v. Carriere, 845 A.2d 304, 306 (R.I. 2004). We have carefully reviewed each of the trial justice’s factual findings as they relate to the issues properly before us on appeal, and we can perceive no clear error with respect to any material fact.', 'The standard of review is different with respect to questions of law: “In contrast to our deferential stance vis-à-vis factual findings made by a trial justice, we review in a de novo manner a trial justice’s rulings concerning questions of law.” Grady v. Narragansett Electric Co., 962 A.2d 34, 41 (R.I. 2009); see also Manchester v. Pereira, 926 A.2d 1005, 1011 (R.I. 2007); Dellagrotta v. Dellagrotta, 873 A.2d 101, 109 (R.I. 2005).', 'Analysis', 'The defendant contends that plaintiff had a month-to-month tenancy and that, accordingly, plaintiff is not entitled to damages because she did not provide the requisite thirty', '-5- days notice to terminate her tenancy as he contends is required under G.L. 1956 § 34-18-37(b). The defendant asserts that plaintiff was not entitled to the return of her security deposit— because, in his view, plaintiff owed rent for an additional thirty days after she called defendant on October 6, 2006 to notify him that she would not be able to take the apartment.', 'The defendant is correct in asserting that, with respect to the case at bar, a month-to- month tenancy was created because the oral rental agreement between the parties did not fix a specific term. The language of § 34-18-15(d) is completely clear: “Unless the rental agreement fixes a definite term, the tenancy is week-to-week in case of a roomer who pays weekly rent, and in all other cases month to month.” Moreover, when there is a month-to-month tenancy, rent is payable in equal monthly installments at the beginning of each month. Section 34-18-15(c).', 'The trial justice supportably found that the lease term began on September 1, 2006. Thus, $800 of the sum of $1600 that was sent by plaintiff to defendant on August 25 was properly used as September’s rent. Moreover, in view of the provisions of the statutes cited in the preceding paragraph, defendant correctly maintains that plaintiff owed him an additional $800 on October 1, 2006 for October’s rent. In view of the fact that plaintiff failed to send him an additional check, defendant was entitled to deduct an appropriate amount from plaintiff’s security deposit for unpaid, accrued rent. Section 34-18-19(b).', 'What distinguishes this case from so many others, however, is the fact that in the instant case rent only accrued until October 6, 2006—on which date the defendant landlord prevented his tenant from having access to the apartment, in violation of § 34-18-21 and § 34-18-44. The trial justice correctly ruled that, because defendant prevented plaintiff and her brother from accessing the apartment after October 6, plaintiff was entitled to the return of her security deposit minus the unpaid, accrued rent for the period from October 1 through October 6.', '-6-', 'As for the trial justice’s decision to offset plaintiff’s damages by the amount that defendant spent on advertising (viz., $339.68), we note that defendant would have had to incur such an expense in any event after the termination of the tenancy. However, there being no cross-appeal as to this issue, we decline to make any definitive ruling about same.', 'In view of the fact that the plaintiff was under no obligation to pay rent after the defendant denied her access to the apartment on October 6, 2006, we have no occasion to decide whether the plaintiff was required to provide thirty days advance notice in order to terminate the tenancy pursuant to § 34-18-37(b).

95,"State : v. : Shane M. Gaspar. : Present: Goldberg, Acting C.J., Flaherty, Suttell, Robinson, JJ., and Williams, C.J. (ret.). OPINION Justice Suttell, for the Court. The evidence adduced at the trial of this criminal case included testimony concerning a multitude of unconventional sexual practices but ultimately presented only one question for the jury’s determination: did the events of the night in question constitute a mutually consensual sexual encounter between two adults or a brutal sexual assault? The defendant, Shane M. Gaspar, appeals from a Superior Court judgment of conviction on five counts of first-degree sexual assault resulting from events that unfolded on November 8, 2003. On appeal, defendant argues for reversal of his conviction on three grounds. He contends that the trial justice committed prejudicial error by (1) permitting the state to introduce under Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence the testimony of another woman who previously had a consensual sexual relationship with defendant, (2) allowing the state to introduce the complaining witness’s hearsay statements contained in a report prepared by an emergency room physician, and (3) permitting the state’s medical expert to offer an opinion about the approximate age of the complaining witness’s bruising without providing any foundation for her opinion. For the reasons stated in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court. -1- I Facts and Procedural History Generally, the facts leading up to the night in question are not in dispute. In early 2003, both defendant and the complaining witness, Sally Smith, 1 frequented a local Providence chat room on the internet. At some point, using an internet “screen name” of “IrishFriend,” Ms. Smith struck up an instant message (IM) 2 conversation with defendant, who was using the screen name “OCEANBENZ1,” asking if he drove a Mercedes Benz. They began conversing on a regular basis over the internet, finally agreeing to meet in person. Before the night of the alleged sexual assault, defendant and Ms. Smith had maintained regular contact over the internet for a period of many months, and they previously had met each other on three separate occasions. Before they ever met in person, Ms. Smith learned from chatting with OCEANBENZ1 that his real name was Shane Gaspar, that he was originally from Warwick, and that he owned a restaurant in Fall River. They initially met in the spring of 2003 at the Mudville Pub in Newport around 9 p.m. on a Sunday night. On that occasion, they each had one beer and talked for about an hour before taking a walk in a park under the Newport bridge. They met a second time in July 2003, when defendant brought coffee to Ms. Smith at her apartment before she left for work. That morning they had a casual conversation, and defendant stayed less than an hour. Both individuals testified that no physical contact or discussions of a sexual nature occurred during these first encounters. Ms. Smith testified that defendant came across as “very nice,” “quiet,” and “kind of reserved.” 1 We identify the complaining witness by use of a pseudonym. 2 Instant messaging is a form of real-time communication between two or more people by means of the internet using typed text. See Wisniewski v. Board of Education of Weedsport Central School District, 494 F.3d 34, 35 (2d Cir. 2007). In a chat room, where the messaging is “public” or visible to anyone who enters, an instant message allows private dialogue unseen by others. See United States v. Dwinells, 508 F.3d 63, 66 (1st Cir. 2007); State v. Lacasse, 917 A.2d 184, 185 (N.H. 2006). -2- They met again in September 2003, at Ms. Smith’s apartment, when defendant again brought over coffee in the morning. This time, however, a “pleasant” conversation led to consensual coitus. Ms. Smith described their sexual encounter as “normal,” a “quickie,” and she testified that they used a condom. It is at this juncture that the parties’ accounts of what happened between them begin to diverge. The defendant testified that he saw bruising on Ms. Smith’s body, particularly her buttocks, and asked her about it. According to defendant, she told him that she “had been a bad bad girl” and had started experimenting with sadomasochism and bondage during a recent trip to California. The defendant said that, although they had never discussed the topic of “rough sex” before, there had been some indication of this interest on her part in previous instant messages that she sent him. Ms. Smith testified that they may have discussed her recent trip to California but denied ever seeking or being involved in a “rough sex” relationship. Five or six weeks passed after their September encounter without Ms. Smith hearing from defendant. They met again, however, on November 8, 2003, an encounter both parties agreed was precipitated by instant messaging. Ms. Smith testified that defendant instant messaged her around 3 p.m., telling her he missed her and missed having sex with her. When defendant asked if he could come over to her apartment that night, she agreed. She testified that she may have told him she “like[d] to be spanked.” She described their exchange as being “just kind of like the other conversations,” though they had never before “said anything about spanking.” She told the grand jury, however, that their conversation was very flirtatious and that they talked about “rough sex.” In a written statement Ms. Smith gave to police, she wrote, “[w]e talked about sexual fantasy and rough sex online.” She maintained at trial, however, that their internet -3- conversation on November 8, 2003, did not include an agreement to engage in “rough sex” later that evening. In any event, they agreed to meet that night, and defendant arrived at Ms. Smith’s apartment around 9 p.m. Ms. Smith testified that, during what amounted to at least an hour-long conversation on the living room couch, defendant told her that, in the five or six weeks that they had not communicated, he had moved in with a woman but subsequently left because she proved to be a sex addict. The defendant testified that Ms. Smith again told him about her travels to California and her experimentation with a sadomasochistic lifestyle. He told the jury that he saw marks and bruises on her arms and legs, although Ms. Smith testified that she was wearing full- length pants and a sweater that evening. The defendant stated that he was not interested in that lifestyle, although he “wasn’t judgmental about her at all.” Eventually, they repaired to the bedroom. From there, the parties have wildly divergent—though equally graphic—accounts of what transpired. Ms. Smith described a brutally violent sexual assault that came as a complete surprise to her, whereas defendant recounted an evening of unorthodox, but consensual, sexual activity. We relate only the essential aspects of their contradictory testimony so as to omit its more lurid details. Ms. Smith testified to a horrific series of events that began when defendant slapped her across the face, grabbed her hair, and put his fingers down her throat, causing her to gag. She said that she asked him to stop; and, when she told him she was going to vomit, he said, “I like puke, bitch.” She then testified that defendant started to choke her, spit into her mouth and face, forced her to perform fellatio three times, once while she was sitting on the bathroom toilet, had vaginal intercourse with her twice and anal intercourse once, performed cunnilingus on her, and penetrated her with his fist on two occasions, causing her intense and excruciating pain. She -4- further testified that throughout this ordeal defendant was controlling her by pulling her roughly by the hair, all the while slapping and biting her breasts, and uttering crude and degrading epithets. Ms. Smith testified that, in the time since they had originally entered the bedroom, at least an hour and a half passed. She stated that she fought him as much as she could for at least an hour. She said they then lay on the bed while she devised a strategy to get him to leave her apartment. She suggested that she go with him to his restaurant and give him oral sex in the car. The defendant agreed to leave, but he told her he did not want her to accompany him. She testified that he then got up, dressed, and left the apartment; she locked the door behind him. The defendant recounted a very different version of what transpired in Ms. Smith’s apartment that night. He testified that when they were talking on the couch, she told him she wanted to teach him about her new lifestyle and made “all sorts of S&M sort of related comments.” According to Mr. Gaspar, when they undressed, he saw fresh injuries already on her buttocks, breasts, shoulders, and legs. Although he testified that “S&M has never been anything I was interested in,” he nonetheless complied with her requests. He said that, at her insistence, he called her names, bit her, and slapped her. He said that he was not able to bite her as hard as she desired because of four false front teeth, causing her to call him a wimp. He testified that they engaged in consensual foreplay, fellatio, and coitus. The foreplay included digital stimulation and non-aggressive spitting as a form of lubrication, but he denied penetrating her vaginally with his fist. 3 The act of fellatio in the bathroom, he said, was a sexual fantasy of Ms. Smith’s, and she was insistent that they do it. He said that the only time he held her hair was 3 Mr. Gaspar later testified that “fisting,” as a sexual act, requires lubrication and is a “process” that requires “preparation.” He said that “fisting” cannot be done forcibly without seriously hurting an individual. -5- when she asked him to do so and that he never pulled or dragged her forcefully by her hair. Ms. Smith neither screamed nor cried, he said, nor told him “no.” He told the jury that he did not force her into any sexual act and that their activities that night were entirely consensual. The defendant agreed with Ms. Smith that their activities lasted approximately an hour and a half and that he left her apartment to return to his restaurant that night. He said, however, that they spent some time lying on the bed and opened a window to “look[] up at the stars.” When he told her that he needed to leave, she offered to go with him so he could come back and stay the night, even offering him oral sex as an incentive. He said that he turned down her offer because he wanted to avoid driving from West Warwick to Fall River and back again, but he would call her in the morning. Ms. Smith testified that after defendant left that night, she immediately brushed her teeth, took some aspirin, and examined herself in the mirror. She then called 911. Before the police arrived, she straightened up her apartment—throwing away beer cans and an unopened condom defendant had brought over. She changed clothes so that she could turn over the clothing she was wearing that night to the police, but she nevertheless put on the same set of undergarments. Patrolman Don Archibald was first to arrive at her apartment. When Ms. Smith declined an ambulance, the officer drove her to Women & Infants Hospital. At the hospital, Valerie Swiatkowski, M.D., a second-year resident, performed a standardized examination for an alleged sexual assault. Doctor Swiatkowski discovered abrasions on Ms. Smith’s labia majora and minora and a laceration on her perineum (the area between the vaginal opening and anus) that was still bleeding. The doctor testified that the other times she had seen women with similar lacerations to the perineum, they had occurred during childbirth. While at the hospital, Captain Catherine Ochs of the West Warwick Police Department took photographs of the bruises and -6- marks on Ms. Smith’s body, and Ms. Smith gave an oral statement to Officer Archibald. Ms. Smith testified at trial that, at that time, she did not disclose everything she knew about Mr. Gaspar—telling the police only his first name, his physical description, that they met on the internet, and what happened to her that night. 4 Meanwhile, police inspected her apartment as part of their investigation. When they requested permission to seize her computer, she did not grant it, instead giving them her password so they could have access to her computer that night. An officer from the West Warwick Bureau of Criminal Identification testified that a search of Ms. Smith’s computer revealed eight or nine websites saved to a list of favorites, including one called “Boston Dungeon” and another titled “New England Dungeon.” 5 The police seized a steno notebook that she kept near her computer, in which Ms. Smith kept quotes, such as “I love submissive people,” 6 and listed a number of screen names, either hers or her friends’, including the screen name “NE Submissive.” Police investigators found several indications of the presence of bodily and seminal fluid using an alternative light source, seizing various items for forensic testing. Sergeant Keith Azverde explained that they did not request that the seminal fluid be matched to any particular person because “the identity of the male party was no longer an issue; the issue was more consent.” A forensic scientist at the Rhode Island Department of Health received a sexual assault kit from Women & Infants Hospital and a number of items seized from Ms. 4 Ms. Smith did not inform them that she knew his last name, cell phone number, place of business, and make of car; she also did not disclose their previous consensual intercourse. She gave the jury a number of reasons for limiting her disclosure, including a chaotic hospital environment, emotional trauma and shock, and embarrassment. 5 Ms. Smith testified that a friend who was visiting showed her these websites, and she never visited them again. Despite her admittedly avid use of the internet, she said that she “didn’t even know there was a favorite thing that you could have.” 6 Ms. Smith testified that she wrote down some of the things people said in chat rooms that she visited for a potential book. -7- Smith’s apartment. An analysis found seminal fluid in the oral samples collected from Ms. Smith, but not from the vaginal or rectal samples; it also revealed seminal fluid on the bedding from Ms. Smith’s apartment, but not on any other items seized. A police officer drove Ms. Smith home from the hospital around 9:30 a.m. on November 9, 2003. A day or two later, the complaining witness went to the police station, where she disclosed the information she previously withheld. Captain Ochs also took additional photographs of Ms. Smith to show the progression of the bruising. She opined at trial that the bruising proceeded as expected, although she could not say from her observations when the bruising actually occurred. Subsequently, Mr. Gaspar was charged by indictment with six counts of first-degree sexual assault, all arising out of the same sexual encounter. The case was tried twice before the same trial justice. A deadlocked jury in the first trial resulted in a mistrial. The case was tried a second time on February 28, 2006. On March 7, 2006, the jury returned a guilty verdict on five of the six counts. The trial justice heard and denied defendant’s motion for new trial on May 9, 2006. On May 12, 2006, defendant was sentenced to fifty years imprisonment on each count, terms to run concurrently, with twenty-five years to serve, and the balance suspended with the statutory conditions of sex offender registration and counseling. The defendant bases his appeal on the trial testimony of two state witnesses, Jane Doe, 7 a former girlfriend of defendant, and Dr. Swiatkowski, who examined Ms. Smith at Women & Infants Hospital. We discuss the substance of this testimony below, in the context of the three evidentiary issues raised on appeal. 7 We refer to defendant’s former girlfriend pseudonymously in deference to her minor child. -8- II Analysis A Testimony of Defendant’s Former Girlfriend At Mr. Gaspar’s first trial, his former girlfriend, Jane Doe, testified as a rebuttal witness for the state. 8 At his second trial, the prosecution called Ms. Doe to testify as part of its case-in- chief. She testified that she began a relationship with Mr. Gaspar around February 2003, which relationship lasted eight or nine months. They met online when defendant sent her an instant message with sexual overtones. For a period, Mr. Gaspar moved in with Ms. Doe and her four- year-old daughter. They separated, however, in the fall of 2003, some time before Thanksgiving. Ms. Doe stated that, from the outset of their relationship, she and defendant had engaged in “rough or aggressive sex” on an almost daily basis. She freely admitted that she enjoyed aggressive sex and that this was their exclusive form of sexual encounter. Before the jury, she described in explicit detail the various sexual activities in which she willingly participated with defendant. She said that defendant would put his fingers deep into her mouth, because he liked to make her gag and whimper. He also spit on her and in her mouth, put his whole fist into her vagina, and engaged in anal sex. 9 According to Ms. Doe, defendant was never affectionate or non-aggressive during their sexual encounters, and he progressively became more aggressive over time. At some point, they developed a “safety word,” 10 which would signal when it was 8 Although the transcript from the first trial is not in the record, it appears that Mr. Gaspar testified during both trials that he had no interest in sadomasochistic or aggressive sex. At the first trial, Ms. Doe impeached this assertion when she testified that she and Mr. Gaspar had a consensual sexual relationship that was rough and aggressive. 9 Nothing in Ms. Doe’s testimony indicated that she and defendant engaged in choking, biting, or slapping during intercourse. 10 Ms. Doe explained that a safety word is “a word that [does not] make sense in any sexual situation” and “should act as a kind of turn off.” Theirs was “cheeseburger.” She said it indicates to a person that they are doing something wrong, and it is time to stop. -9- time to stop. Ms. Doe said she only had occasion to use their safety word once or twice, but that defendant did not honor it, and it “seemed to egg him on” instead. The state also elicited from Ms. Doe that on five occasions she and Mr. Gaspar had consensual sex together with other women: so-called “threesomes.” All of these women were in their forties and all but one was overweight. Ms. Doe, herself aged twenty-nine, asserted that defendant engaged in the same sort of rough or aggressive actions during their forays into ménage à trois. Additionally, Ms. Doe was asked on redirect examination to read from an anonymous e-mail she had sent to the Office of the Attorney General before she agreed to testify as a witness. In her e-mail, she stated that she did not want to become involved in this case unless it was likely that Mr. Gaspar would be acquitted. Although she acknowledged on the stand and in her e-mail that her sexual relationship with defendant was consensual, she read to the jury a portion of her e-mail bemoaning the circumstances of the complaining witness and professing remorse that neither she nor defendant’s other sexual partners had come forward previously. On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice committed prejudicial error when she allowed the state to introduce the testimony of Jane Doe under Rule 404(b). The defendant gives three reasons why the admission of this evidence was prejudicial error. First, defendant contends that Ms. Doe’s testimony about defendant’s prior sexual acts did not have the “special relevance” necessary for admission of “prior bad acts” under Rule 404(b). Instead, because Ms. Doe testified about consensual sexual activities in a case in which the state was required to prove force or coercion, defendant argues the testimony showed only that he had a particular character trait (viz., interest in rough and aggressive sex). Thus, defendant asserts that the state asked the jury to draw the very inference specifically prohibited by Rule 404(a)—that defendant acted in - 10 - conformance with that trait on November 8, 2003. Second, defendant argues that “the state unfairly exploited this evidence by maximizing its sensationalist potential by grafting onto it inflammatory descriptions of three-way sex.” Finally, defendant avers that the trial justice’s limiting instruction was “woefully insufficient.” The state argues that the trial justice did not err in admitting evidence concerning defendant’s previous sexual conduct because the evidence was relevant and reasonably necessary to negate defendant’s consent defense. Specifically, the state argues that defendant’s position at his first trial—in which he allegedly portrayed Ms. Smith as the person with sadomasochistic proclivities and himself as a reluctant participant—made Ms. Doe’s testimony relevant “to contradict defendant’s position, and thereby undercut his defense.” The state further contends that Ms. Doe’s testimony about aggressive group sex with middle-aged, overweight women whom defendant met on the internet “was admissible under the common plan/scheme and motive exceptions to [Rule] 404(b) in order to demonstrate that * * * [defendant] not only had an ongoing interest in having aggressive sex with women like [Ms. Smith], but used the Internet as the means by which to meet such women.” Additionally, the state points out that Ms. Doe’s testimony about defendant’s failure to honor their safety word on one or two occasions was admissible under Rule 404(b) to demonstrate absence of mistake concerning non-consent. The state professes that the “deadlocking of the jury in the first trial” meant that the state “may have been unable to sustain its burden of proof without the introduction of the [Rule] 404(b) evidence.” Finally, the state argues that the trial justice’s limiting instruction to the jury was adequate but that, even if it was not, defendant waived this issue by failing to object. 11 11 Because we vacate the judgment of conviction on grounds that Ms. Doe’s testimony about a consensual relationship was inadmissible under Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, we decline to address the sufficiency of the trial justice’s limiting instruction. - 11 - 1. Standard of Review It is well established that decisions concerning the admissibility of evidence are “within the sound discretion of the trial justice, and this Court will not interfere with the trial justice’s decision unless a clear abuse of that discretion is apparent.” State v. Mohapatra, 880 A.2d 802, 805 (R.I. 2005) (quoting State v. Grayhurst, 852 A.2d 491, 504 (R.I. 2004)). 2. Discussion It is not necessary for us to decide whether Ms. Doe’s testimony was properly admitted at the second trial based on the criteria set forth in Rule 404(b) because we are persuaded that her testimony should have been barred under Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. Rule 403 provides: “Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.” Rule 403 cuts across the rules of evidence and is always a consideration in a trial justice’s ruling on the admissibility of Rule 404(b) evidence. See, e.g., State v. John, 881 A.2d 920, 927 n.14 (R.I. 2005) (“In addition to the protections afforded by Rule 403, we have required that, in applying Rule 404(b), ‘the trial justice must carefully weigh the probative value of the evidence against the danger of unfair prejudice * * *.’”) (quoting State v. Pratt, 641 A.2d 732, 742 (R.I. 1994)); State v. Hopkins, 698 A.2d 183, 186 (R.I. 1997) (“In deciding whether to allow the jury to hear this type of [Rule] 404(b) evidence, the trial justice has to balance relevance against remoteness and the potential for improper prejudicial impact.”). Similar approaches have been endorsed by the federal courts applying the substantially analogous Federal Rules of Evidence 403 and 404(b). See, e.g., Huddleston v. United States, 485 U.S. 681, 688 (1988) (noting that - 12 - evidence properly offered under Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence “is subject only to general strictures limiting admissibility such as Rules 402 and 403.”); United States v. Varoudakis, 233 F.3d 113, 121 (1st Cir. 2000) (“Prior bad act evidence that surmounts the bar of Rule 404(b) may still be inadmissible under Rule 403.”). Indeed, some jurisdictions have highlighted the interplay of these two rules by explicitly adopting two-step analyses of Rule 404(b) evidence. See, e.g., Varoudakis, 233 F.3d at 118 (“To admit evidence of prior bad acts, a trial court must find that the evidence passes two tests. First, the evidence must have ‘special relevance’ to an issue in the case such as intent or knowledge, and must not include ‘bad character or propensity as a necessary link in the inferential chain.’ * * * Second, under Rule 403, evidence that is specially relevant may still be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.”) (quoting United States v. Frankhauser, 80 F.3d 641, 648 (1st Cir. 1996)); see also United States v. Beechum, 582 F.2d 898, 911 (5th Cir. 1978) (“What [Rule 404(b)] calls for is essentially a two-step test. First, it must be determined that the extrinsic offense evidence is relevant to an issue other than the defendant’s character. Second, the evidence must possess probative value that is not substantially outweighed by its undue prejudice and must meet the other requirements of [R]ule 403.”); see generally Rule 404(b) Other Crimes Evidence: The Need For a Two-Step Analysis, 71 Nw. U. L. Rev. 635, 640 (1976) (“[D]eciding the admissibility of evidence of other crimes under [R]ule 404(b) is merely one step in determining whether the jury will be allowed to hear the evidence. Like any other relevant evidence, the probative value of other crimes information still must be weighed by the criteria of [R]ule 403, which excludes unfair or confusing evidence.”). - 13 - The decision to exclude evidence pursuant to Rule 403 is confided to the sound discretion of the trial justice. State v. Martinez, 824 A.2d 443, 449 (R.I. 2003). We review the trial justice’s decision for clear abuse of discretion. State v. DeJesus, 947 A.2d 873, 883 (R.I. 2008). Assuming, without deciding, that Ms. Doe’s testimony was admissible under one of the exceptions to the general exclusionary provisions of Rule 404(b), we hold that the trial justice erred in admitting this unfairly prejudicial evidence. 12 Whatever the probative value of Ms. Doe’s testimony, its utility was clearly outweighed by the danger that it would confuse, mislead, and unfairly prejudice the jury. In the case at bar, the sole issue for the jury was whether defendant acted with force or coercion, or, as defendant contended, whether the sexual encounter was consensual. As part of its case-in-chief, 13 the state presented the testimony of Ms. Doe, who recounted an eight- or 12 We stress that this evidence was unfairly prejudicial because most evidence offered at trial is inherently prejudicial. Only unfairly prejudicial evidence is barred under Rule 403—meaning evidence that has “an undue tendency to suggest a decision on an improper basis[,]” and “appeals to the jurors’ sympathies, arouses their sense of horror, provokes their instinct to punish, or otherwise causes a jury to base its decision on something other than the established propositions in the case.” 29 Am. Jur. 2d Evidence § 338 at 360 (2008). 13 According to the state, at his first trial, defendant “depicted himself as a reluctant participant who found what [Ms. Smith] was telling him to do personally distasteful and who himself had never engaged in these practices before.” At the first trial, the state presented Ms. Doe as a rebuttal witness to impeach that testimony by defendant. At the second trial, the state presented Ms. Doe as part of its case-in-chief. On appeal, the state asserts that Ms. Doe’s testimony at the second trial “was presented to contradict defendant’s position, and thereby undercut his defense” of consent. Despite its purported Rule 404(b) rationale, in essence the state is suggesting that Ms. Doe’s testimony was presented as part of its case-in-chief to impeach defendant’s anticipated testimony. Rule 404(b) does not govern the introduction of impeachment evidence. There are various other evidentiary rules that govern impeachment. See, e.g., R.I. R. Evid. 607-609. Specifically, Rule 607 provides that “[t]he credibility of a witness may be attacked.” (Emphasis added.) When the state presented Ms. Doe on direct, defendant was not yet a witness at trial, and thus his anticipated consent defense could not yet be impeached. In a criminal matter, a defendant has no burden of proof and may choose not to testify at any time. See State v. Alston, 900 A.2d 1212, 1221 (R.I. 2006); State v. Hallenbeck, 878 A.2d 992, 1007-08 (R.I. 2005). Thus, impeachment in this form was improper during the state’s case-in-chief and significantly increased the risk of unfair prejudice to defendant. Because Ms. Doe’s testimony was elicited as - 14 - nine-month relationship with defendant involving rough or aggressive sexual activity on an almost daily basis. With the exception of only one or two occasions when, according to Ms. Doe, defendant failed to heed their safety word, the sexual encounters were entirely consensual. We are satisfied that the implied equivalence of defendant’s consensual and alleged nonconsensual sexual encounters (with Ms. Doe and Ms. Smith respectively) was very likely to confuse the jury and invite an emotional response. We conclude, therefore, that the trial justice committed reversible error in admitting this evidence. B Admission of Medical Report Narrative The defendant next assigns as prejudicial error the admission into evidence of the portion of the medical records that contain an historical narrative of the evening’s events as related by the complaining witness. He particularly challenges the trial justice’s ruling that allowed the doctor to read the narrative to the jury during her testimony, thereby imbuing it with her professional imprimatur. Doctor Swiatkowski, who examined Ms. Smith in the early morning of November 9, 2003, testified that she followed a standard protocol for evaluating a patient for an alleged sexual assault. The state requested that she read the contents of a portion of her documentation titled “medical summary of alleged assault.” 14 Doctor Swiatkowski stated that she gathered information about the assault for purposes of medical diagnosis and treatment, and proceeded to read into the record the narrative that she had taken from the complaining witness that night. This report repeated, at times verbatim, the criminal accusations of the complaining witness: part of the state’s case-in-chief, we need not consider whether some or all of her testimony would have been properly admissible in rebuttal; that would depend on what defendant testified to—if indeed he chose to testify. 14 The entire medical report of Women & Infants Hospital had been admitted into evidence by agreement, although defendant objected to the introduction of the narrative portion. - 15 - “[Doctor Swiatkowski]: Okay. ‘The patient invited the acquaintance into her home and into her bedroom. Patient originally was consensual, but after approximately three minutes, she told the man, “No.” He became abusive, yelling at her, pulling her hair. He did not stop. He bit her over multiple spots on her body, the shoulders, back, arms, and legs, forced fellatio on her, pulling her hair and told her, “You like it, bitch.” He then raped her both vaginally and anally several times. He told her she “had not made me cum.” During this time period, he held her down at times by her arms and her hair, hit her on the breasts, arms, legs. At several points, she tried to get away, but he pulled her hair harder. She told him she had to go to the bathroom, so he dragged her from the bedroom to the bathroom. She urinated after he forced her to sit on the toilet and provide oral sex to him again. He then pulled her into the living room by her hair and eventually pushed her onto the floor. He again raped her both vaginally and anally. He also forced his fist into her vagina. She screamed that it hurt and to stop. He again told her—he told her she, “liked it, bitch.” She noted vaginal pain and bleeding afterwards. He again forced fellatio on her; and during one of the episodes, he ejaculated into her mouth. She spit out the semen. She is unsure if he came during vaginal or anal intercourse. He brought her back into the bedroom, all the while continued biting her, hitting her, and pulling her hair. Eventually, he got dressed and left. She got up and brushed her teeth. She then called 9-1-1, and the police came and brought her here with the clothing she had on the night or on before the encounter [sic]. Her underwear were the same ones she wore when she got here. They have been collected as evidence. The patient relates a time period to be 10 to 12 p.m. on 11-8. She arrived at Women & Infants Hospital with the police at 2:50 a.m. on 11-9.” On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice committed prejudicial error when she permitted the introduction of those portions of the medical records that contained the hearsay narrative from the complaining witness. The defendant argues that this testimony falls squarely within a line of cases applying this Court’s pronouncement in State v. Pina, 455 A.2d 313, 315 (R.I. 1983), that under the hearsay exception for medical diagnosis and treatment, statements that ascribe fault or are otherwise not a basis for diagnosis or treatment should be excluded. See R.I. R. Evid. 803(4). The defendant contends that Dr. Swiatkowski’s testimony was “replete with - 16 - accusations of criminal behavior, [and] with assertions that the complaining witness had not acted consensually[;]” he further contends that the report was gathered for law enforcement purposes, not medical purposes. Additionally, defendant argues that the testimony in this case was much more graphic and pointed in its accusations of criminal behavior than those previously considered and excluded by this Court and that to allow its admission would require overruling an entire assemblage of case law. Finally, defendant maintains that this testimony was especially prejudicial because of its suggested “seal of professional approval.” The state counters that “the majority of the statements in the narrative portion of [the medical report], as read at trial by Dr. Swiatkowski,” were pertinent to Ms. Smith’s diagnosis and treatment for sexual assault, and that the doctor so testified at trial. The state contends that, to the extent any statements fell outside the scope of Rule 803(4), the admission was harmless because the jury heard the same testimony from Ms. Smith herself and the doctor did not comment on the report’s veracity. 1. Standard of Review “It is well established that ‘the admission of a statement under an exception to the hearsay rule is within the sound discretion of the trial justice and shall not be overturned unless clearly erroneous.” State v. Bergevine, 942 A.2d 974, 978 (R.I. 2008) (quoting State v. Ruffner, 911 A.2d 680, 689 (R.I. 2006)). 2. Rule of Evidence 803(4) Doctor Swiatkowski’s testimony relaying Ms. Smith’s medical summary report is clearly hearsay. See R.I. R. Evid. 801(c). Rhode Island, however, recognizes the medical-diagnosis exception to the hearsay rule. Rule 803(4); 15 see In re Andrey G., 796 A.2d 452, 456 (R.I. 2002); 15 Rule 803(4) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence excludes from the hearsay rule: - 17 - State v. Contreras, 105 R.I. 523, 534-35, 253 A.2d 612, 619 (1969). The rationale behind this rule is that “a person will presumably be truthful to a physician from whom he expects to receive medical attention.” Pina, 455 A.2d at 315; see Rule 803(4), Advisory Committee’s Note; State v. Lima, 546 A.2d 770, 774 (R.I. 1988). Thus, statements made by an injured individual to his treating physician relating to his physical condition and to the cause of such injury are generally admissible. Pina, 455 A.2d at 315. The test for determining admissibility “hinge[s] on whether what has been related by the patient will assist or is helpful in the diagnosis or treatment of [the patient’s] ailment.” In re Andrey G., 796 A.2d at 456 (quoting In re Jessica C., 690 A.2d 1357, 1363 (R.I. 1997)); see Contreras, 105 R.I. at 534-35, 253 A.2d at 619. Statements that narrate details unconnected with either diagnosis or treatment, however, are inadmissible unless they fall under another hearsay exception. Pina, 455 A.2d at 315; State v. Veluzat, 578 A.2d 93, 96 (R.I. 1990). When statements about causation enter the realm of assigning fault, it is unlikely that the patient or the physician consider them related to diagnosis or treatment. Pina, 455 A.2d at 315. “In the circumstances where fault is an issue, statements of causation do not hold the same reliability of truthfulness and are properly excluded.” Id. An uninterrupted line of cases from this Court has followed the rule elucidated in Pina in applying Rule 803(4). See In re Andrey G., 796 A.2d at 456; Veluzat, 578 A.2d at 96; Lima, 546 A.2d at 774; State v. Barber, 468 A.2d 277, 278 (R.I. 1983); State v. Burgess, 465 A.2d 204, 206-07 (R.I. 1983). “Statements made for the purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment and describing medical history, or past or present symptoms, pain, or sensations, or the inception or general character of the cause of external source thereof insofar as reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment, but not including statements made to a physician consulted solely for the purposes of preparing for litigation or obtaining testimony for trial.” - 18 - In Pina, in which the only issue at trial was whether the intercourse was consensual, this Court held that a doctor’s statements about defendant’s alleged threats merely acted to assign fault by clarifying the issue of consent; therefore, the statements were not pertinent to medical diagnosis or treatment and were inadmissible. In the same year that Pina was issued, this Court held that a medical history report constituted inadmissible hearsay in two more cases, both of which relied on Pina. See Barber, 468 A.2d at 278; Burgess, 465 A.2d at 206-07. Similarly, in In re Andrey G., 796 A.2d at 456, the Court held inadmissible a child’s statements in a medical document that respondent had sexually abused her because it merely assigned fault rather than assisted the doctor in medical diagnosis. In some cases, this Court has held that medical history reports that contain information about a sexual assault are admissible. In those cases, however, the material issue was not consent, but rather whether a sexual assault actually had occurred. See State v. Pierce, 689 A.2d 1030, 1033 (R.I. 1997) (holding that purpose of hospital visit was to determine whether sexual assault had occurred); In re Jean Marie W., 559 A.2d 625, 630 (R.I. 1989) (holding that child’s statements were used to establish that sexual abuse had actually occurred, but did not ascribe fault); State v. Ucero, 450 A.2d 809, 815 (R.I. 1982) (holding that purpose of hospital visit was to determine whether sexual assault had occurred). Here, there is no question that Ms. Smith and defendant had a sexual encounter on the night in question, making these cases inapplicable. 3. Discussion Applying the rule set forth in Pina, we hold that Dr. Swiatkowski’s verbatim rendition of the un-redacted medical summary report should have been excluded because it contained information that was not reasonably related to either diagnosis or treatment. Like the question presented in Pina, 455 A.2d at 315, “the instant case presents no question as to whether or not - 19 - sexual intercourse took place. The only issue is whether intercourse was voluntary or involuntary.” Doctor Swiatkowski’s verbatim recitation of her medical summary report included many narrative details that were unconnected with diagnosis or treatment and that strongly, and graphically, imputed criminal fault to defendant. It contains facts clearly inapposite to medical diagnosis or treatment, such as statements defendant allegedly made to Ms. Smith, and the assertion that “[p]atient originally was consensual, but after approximately three minutes, she told the man, ‘No.’ He became abusive * * *.” The doctor’s testimony, a near-perfect repetition of the complaining witness’s version of events, is replete with assignments of fault, asserting in conclusive terms that “he then raped her both vaginally and anally several times” and “forced fellatio on her.” We are hard pressed to discern how some of the statements related in the narrative would assist in the diagnosis or treatment of the complaining witness. The doctor did not provide any medical reason as to why she obtained this narrative. Although Dr. Swiatkowski answered “yes” when the state pointedly asked her if she gathered information about the sexual assault for purposes of medical diagnosis and treatment, when the doctor was invited to elaborate, she stated, “[f]rom a medical perspective, the document is from the rape kit, it’s just to gather information about the assault.” This suggests forensics, not medicine. We further conclude that allowing Dr. Swiatkowski to read the entire “medical summary of alleged assault” was highly prejudicial to the defendant. “We have often recognized that a physician’s testimony can carry with it an impression of great credibility.” Veluzat, 578 A.2d at 96; see Pina, 455 A.2d at 315 (“A doctor clothed in the garb of a medical expert possesses substantial stature in the eyes of a jury.”). We have further recognized that, where the only witness to the alleged sexual assault is the complainant, “[t]he doctor’s repetition of the victim’s - 20 - version of events [is] sure to lend it credibility. A medical expert cannot serve the function of a thirteenth juror by evaluating the credibility of witnesses.” Veluzat, 578 A.2d at 96-97 (quoting Pina, 455 A.2d at 315). The introduction of this medical history narrative is especially prejudicial in that it corroborated the details set forth in the testimony of the complainant concerning the alleged sexual assault, surely lending to its credibility. See Barber, 468 A.2d at 278; Burgess, 465 A.2d at 206-07; Pina, 455 A.2d at 315. We recognize that in the likely event that the state seeks to introduce the narrative portion of the medical records at defendant’s retrial, it will do so upon a new record and under differing circumstances. Its admissibility undoubtedly will depend in large measure on the foundational testimony of the doctor. With respect to the case on appeal, however, we are satisfied that the admission of the entire unexpurgated medical report narrative, both as a document and then as read to the jury, was in error. Because we are vacating the judgment on other grounds, we need not consider whether such error was harmless. C Expert Opinion Concerning Age of Bruises One of the key issues at trial was whether the complaining witness’s multiple bruises and bite markings were inflicted by defendant or whether—as defendant insinuated—she already had suffered injuries from some previous sexual encounter before she met with defendant on November 8, 2003. The state asked Dr. Swiatkowski to give an expert opinion on the age of the bruises that she observed on the complaining witness’s body. She opined, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that the bruising occurred within twenty-four hours of her examination. Doctor Swiatkowski explained that as a bruise ages, it goes through different color phases, although she acknowledged that the coloration and healing process is different on every patient - 21 - and can be affected by various factors, such as medication. She said that she based her judgment on coloration, as well as on redness, bite marks, and raised parts of the skin. The defendant argues that the trial justice committed reversible error when she permitted the state’s doctor to offer an opinion concerning when the complaining witness suffered bruising. The defendant’s position is that the state did not lay a medical or forensic foundation for this expert testimony. He asserts that the question of the aging of bruises is more a forensic than a medical issue, and is not within the ordinary and usual expertise of a medical practitioner. The state counters that the trial justice did not err in permitting Dr. Swiatkowski to testify about the approximate age of the complaining witness’s bruises. The state argues that a foundation does “not have to be elaborately presented before the expert testifies to her conclusion if the information is common and well understood.” 16 1. Standard of Review In reviewing a trial justice’s ruling on the admissibility of an expert witness’s proffered testimony, “this Court will not reverse the decision unless the trial justice abused his or her discretion.” State v. Rieger, 763 A.2d 997, 1004 (R.I. 2001) (citing State v. Morales, 621 A.2d 1247, 1249 (R.I. 1993)). We will sustain the ruling below provided that the trial justice’s discretion “has been soundly and judicially exercised, that is, if it has been exercised in the light of reason applied to all the facts and with a view to the rights of all the parties to the action * * *.” In re Mackenzie C., 877 A.2d 674, 684 (R.I. 2005) (quoting Owens v. Silvia, 838 A.2d 881, 890 (R.I. 2003)). 16 The state argues, alternatively, that defendant did not preserve his foundational argument because it was not “specifically focused enough.” When the trial justice asked defense to articulate his grounds for objection, he stated, “I don’t think there was a satisfactory basis for that opinion.” We are satisfied, however, that the foundational grounds for the defense’s objection were entirely clear. - 22 - 2. Discussion Under Rule 705 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, “an expert’s opinion must be predicated upon facts legally sufficient to form a basis for his [or her] conclusion.” Gallucci v. Humbyrd, 709 A.2d 1059, 1063 (R.I. 1998) (quoting Alterio v. Biltmore Construction Corp., 119 R.I. 307, 312, 377 A.2d 237, 240 (1977)). 17 Such facts must be disclosed so that it is possible “to assess whether the conclusions drawn from the facts possess sufficient probative force or, rather, are grounded in mere speculation or conjecture.” State v. Hanes, 783 A.2d 920, 927 (R.I. 2001) (quoting DeChristofaro v. Machala, 685 A.2d 258, 267 (R.I. 1996)). Another major purpose of this requirement is to facilitate intelligent cross-examination. Gorham v. Public Building Authority of Providence, 612 A.2d 708, 717 (R.I. 1992). At times, the scientific foundation for a particular expert opinion is so common and well understood that the expert’s qualifications are sufficient to assure that the opinion has an adequate foundation. See, e.g., Gallucci, 709 A.2d at 1063-66 (holding expert’s qualifications as a board-certified orthopedic surgeon, the substantial nature of his examination, and his review of patient records to be a sufficient foundation for him to proffer opinion as to causation); cf. Owens, 838 A.2d at 892 (noting that under Rule 702 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, the scientific foundation for an expert’s theory may be so common and well understood that the proponent of the testimony can lay the foundation while qualifying the witness). We caution, however, that this narrow situation is not intended to subsume the rule. It is our opinion that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion in permitting Dr. Swiatkowski to testify about the aging of the complaining witness’s bruising. The doctor’s 17 Rule 705 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence provides: “Unless the court directs otherwise, before testifying in terms of opinion, an expert witness shall be first examined concerning the facts or data upon which the opinion is based.” - 23 - opinion was not without a medical foundation; she explained that as a bruise ages progresses, it changes in coloration and that the coloration process helps determine when the injuries were sustained. She explained that older bruises present themselves in shades of green and yellow, whereas newer bruises are more red and purple. She stated that she based her judgment on other, additional facts—such as the redness of the skin around the bruises, indentations in the skin that appeared to be bite marks, and raised or swollen skin. She also explained that all the bruises were similar in appearance. Because Dr. Swiatkowski is an emergency room physician with experience and training at Women & Infants Hospital and Detroit Receiving Hospital, we believe that her qualifications, coupled with the factual basis for her opinion, are sufficient to assure this Court that the trial justice based her ruling on more than “mere speculation or conjecture.” Hanes, 783 A.2d at 927 (quoting DeChristoforo, 685 A.2d at 267). Furthermore, the doctor’s testimony was buttressed by photographs of Ms. Smith’s injuries, which showed her bruises changing color over time. The doctor’s testimony also provided the information necessary for intelligent cross- examination. The defendant was able to extract from Dr. Swiatkowski the acknowledgement that the bruises on every patient age and heal differently and that bruising can be affected by medication, among other factors. The defendant also asked her whether the bruising could have occurred more than twenty-four hours before the patient was examined, to which the doctor replied in the negative. The defendant chose not to follow this line of questioning any further. With these considerations in mind, we cannot say that the trial justice abused her discretion by allowing Dr. Swiatkowski’s to opine on the age of the complainant’s bruises. - 24 - III Conclusion For the reasons stated in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of conviction entered in the Superior Court. The case shall be remanded to the Superior Court for a new trial consistent with this opinion. - 25 - Supreme Court No. 2007-44-C.A. (K1/04-237A) State : v. : Shane M. Gaspar.",criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Suttell, for the Court. The evidence adduced at the trial of this criminal case included testimony concerning a multitude of unconventional sexual practices but ultimately presented only one question for the jury’s determination: did the events of the night in question constitute a mutually consensual sexual encounter between two adults or a brutal sexual assault?', 'The defendant, Shane M. Gaspar, appeals from a Superior Court judgment of conviction on five counts of first-degree sexual assault resulting from events that unfolded on November 8, 2003. On appeal, defendant argues for reversal of his conviction on three grounds. He contends that the trial justice committed prejudicial error by (1) permitting the state to introduce under Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence the testimony of another woman who previously had a consensual sexual relationship with defendant, (2) allowing the state to introduce the complaining witness’s hearsay statements contained in a report prepared by an emergency room physician, and (3) permitting the state’s medical expert to offer an opinion about the approximate age of the complaining witness’s bruising without providing any foundation for her opinion. For the reasons stated in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'Generally, the facts leading up to the night in question are not in dispute. In early 2003, both defendant and the complaining witness, Sally Smith, 1 frequented a local Providence chat room on the internet. At some point, using an internet “screen name” of “IrishFriend,” Ms. Smith struck up an instant message (IM) 2 conversation with defendant, who was using the screen name “OCEANBENZ1,” asking if he drove a Mercedes Benz. They began conversing on a regular basis over the internet, finally agreeing to meet in person.', 'Before the night of the alleged sexual assault, defendant and Ms. Smith had maintained regular contact over the internet for a period of many months, and they previously had met each other on three separate occasions. Before they ever met in person, Ms. Smith learned from chatting with OCEANBENZ1 that his real name was Shane Gaspar, that he was originally from Warwick, and that he owned a restaurant in Fall River. They initially met in the spring of 2003 at the Mudville Pub in Newport around 9 p.m. on a Sunday night. On that occasion, they each had one beer and talked for about an hour before taking a walk in a park under the Newport bridge. They met a second time in July 2003, when defendant brought coffee to Ms. Smith at her apartment before she left for work. That morning they had a casual conversation, and defendant stayed less than an hour. Both individuals testified that no physical contact or discussions of a sexual nature occurred during these first encounters. Ms. Smith testified that defendant came across as “very nice,” “quiet,” and “kind of reserved.” 1', 'We identify the complaining witness by use of a pseudonym. 2', 'Instant messaging is a form of real-time communication between two or more people by means of the internet using typed text. See Wisniewski v. Board of Education of Weedsport Central School District, 494 F.3d 34, 35 (2d Cir. 2007). In a chat room, where the messaging is “public” or visible to anyone who enters, an instant message allows private dialogue unseen by others. See United States v. Dwinells, 508 F.3d 63, 66 (1st Cir. 2007); State v. Lacasse, 917 A.2d 184, 185 (N.H. 2006).', '-2-', 'They met again in September 2003, at Ms. Smith’s apartment, when defendant again brought over coffee in the morning. This time, however, a “pleasant” conversation led to consensual coitus. Ms. Smith described their sexual encounter as “normal,” a “quickie,” and she testified that they used a condom. It is at this juncture that the parties’ accounts of what happened between them begin to diverge. The defendant testified that he saw bruising on Ms. Smith’s body, particularly her buttocks, and asked her about it. According to defendant, she told him that she “had been a bad bad girl” and had started experimenting with sadomasochism and bondage during a recent trip to California. The defendant said that, although they had never discussed the topic of “rough sex” before, there had been some indication of this interest on her part in previous instant messages that she sent him. Ms. Smith testified that they may have discussed her recent trip to California but denied ever seeking or being involved in a “rough sex” relationship.', 'Five or six weeks passed after their September encounter without Ms. Smith hearing from defendant. They met again, however, on November 8, 2003, an encounter both parties agreed was precipitated by instant messaging. Ms. Smith testified that defendant instant messaged her around 3 p.m., telling her he missed her and missed having sex with her. When defendant asked if he could come over to her apartment that night, she agreed. She testified that she may have told him she “like[d] to be spanked.” She described their exchange as being “just kind of like the other conversations,” though they had never before “said anything about spanking.” She told the grand jury, however, that their conversation was very flirtatious and that they talked about “rough sex.” In a written statement Ms. Smith gave to police, she wrote, “[w]e talked about sexual fantasy and rough sex online.” She maintained at trial, however, that their internet', '-3- conversation on November 8, 2003, did not include an agreement to engage in “rough sex” later that evening.', 'In any event, they agreed to meet that night, and defendant arrived at Ms. Smith’s apartment around 9 p.m. Ms. Smith testified that, during what amounted to at least an hour-long conversation on the living room couch, defendant told her that, in the five or six weeks that they had not communicated, he had moved in with a woman but subsequently left because she proved to be a sex addict. The defendant testified that Ms. Smith again told him about her travels to California and her experimentation with a sadomasochistic lifestyle. He told the jury that he saw marks and bruises on her arms and legs, although Ms. Smith testified that she was wearing full- length pants and a sweater that evening. The defendant stated that he was not interested in that lifestyle, although he “wasn’t judgmental about her at all.” Eventually, they repaired to the bedroom. From there, the parties have wildly divergent—though equally graphic—accounts of what transpired. Ms. Smith described a brutally violent sexual assault that came as a complete surprise to her, whereas defendant recounted an evening of unorthodox, but consensual, sexual activity. We relate only the essential aspects of their contradictory testimony so as to omit its more lurid details.', 'Ms. Smith testified to a horrific series of events that began when defendant slapped her across the face, grabbed her hair, and put his fingers down her throat, causing her to gag. She said that she asked him to stop; and, when she told him she was going to vomit, he said, “I like puke, bitch.” She then testified that defendant started to choke her, spit into her mouth and face, forced her to perform fellatio three times, once while she was sitting on the bathroom toilet, had vaginal intercourse with her twice and anal intercourse once, performed cunnilingus on her, and penetrated her with his fist on two occasions, causing her intense and excruciating pain. She', '-4- further testified that throughout this ordeal defendant was controlling her by pulling her roughly by the hair, all the while slapping and biting her breasts, and uttering crude and degrading epithets.', 'Ms. Smith testified that, in the time since they had originally entered the bedroom, at least an hour and a half passed. She stated that she fought him as much as she could for at least an hour. She said they then lay on the bed while she devised a strategy to get him to leave her apartment. She suggested that she go with him to his restaurant and give him oral sex in the car. The defendant agreed to leave, but he told her he did not want her to accompany him. She testified that he then got up, dressed, and left the apartment; she locked the door behind him.', 'The defendant recounted a very different version of what transpired in Ms. Smith’s apartment that night. He testified that when they were talking on the couch, she told him she wanted to teach him about her new lifestyle and made “all sorts of S&M sort of related comments.” According to Mr. Gaspar, when they undressed, he saw fresh injuries already on her buttocks, breasts, shoulders, and legs. Although he testified that “S&M has never been anything I was interested in,” he nonetheless complied with her requests. He said that, at her insistence, he called her names, bit her, and slapped her. He said that he was not able to bite her as hard as she desired because of four false front teeth, causing her to call him a wimp. He testified that they engaged in consensual foreplay, fellatio, and coitus.', 'The foreplay included digital stimulation and non-aggressive spitting as a form of lubrication, but he denied penetrating her vaginally with his fist. 3 The act of fellatio in the bathroom, he said, was a sexual fantasy of Ms. Smith’s, and she was insistent that they do it. He said that the only time he held her hair was 3', 'Mr. Gaspar later testified that “fisting,” as a sexual act, requires lubrication and is a “process” that requires “preparation.” He said that “fisting” cannot be done forcibly without seriously hurting an individual.', '-5- when she asked him to do so and that he never pulled or dragged her forcefully by her hair. Ms. Smith neither screamed nor cried, he said, nor told him “no.” He told the jury that he did not force her into any sexual act and that their activities that night were entirely consensual.', 'The defendant agreed with Ms. Smith that their activities lasted approximately an hour and a half and that he left her apartment to return to his restaurant that night. He said, however, that they spent some time lying on the bed and opened a window to “look[] up at the stars.” When he told her that he needed to leave, she offered to go with him so he could come back and stay the night, even offering him oral sex as an incentive. He said that he turned down her offer because he wanted to avoid driving from West Warwick to Fall River and back again, but he would call her in the morning.', 'Ms. Smith testified that after defendant left that night, she immediately brushed her teeth, took some aspirin, and examined herself in the mirror. She then called 911. Before the police arrived, she straightened up her apartment—throwing away beer cans and an unopened condom defendant had brought over. She changed clothes so that she could turn over the clothing she was wearing that night to the police, but she nevertheless put on the same set of undergarments.', 'Patrolman Don Archibald was first to arrive at her apartment. When Ms. Smith declined an ambulance, the officer drove her to Women & Infants Hospital. At the hospital, Valerie Swiatkowski, M.D., a second-year resident, performed a standardized examination for an alleged sexual assault. Doctor Swiatkowski discovered abrasions on Ms. Smith’s labia majora and minora and a laceration on her perineum (the area between the vaginal opening and anus) that was still bleeding. The doctor testified that the other times she had seen women with similar lacerations to the perineum, they had occurred during childbirth. While at the hospital, Captain Catherine Ochs of the West Warwick Police Department took photographs of the bruises and', '-6- marks on Ms. Smith’s body, and Ms. Smith gave an oral statement to Officer Archibald. Ms. Smith testified at trial that, at that time, she did not disclose everything she knew about Mr. Gaspar—telling the police only his first name, his physical description, that they met on the internet, and what happened to her that night. 4', 'Meanwhile, police inspected her apartment as part of their investigation. When they requested permission to seize her computer, she did not grant it, instead giving them her password so they could have access to her computer that night. An officer from the West Warwick Bureau of Criminal Identification testified that a search of Ms. Smith’s computer revealed eight or nine websites saved to a list of favorites, including one called “Boston Dungeon” and another titled “New England Dungeon.” 5 The police seized a steno notebook that she kept near her computer, in which Ms. Smith kept quotes, such as “I love submissive people,” 6 and listed a number of screen names, either hers or her friends’, including the screen name “NE Submissive.” Police investigators found several indications of the presence of bodily and seminal fluid using an alternative light source, seizing various items for forensic testing. Sergeant Keith Azverde explained that they did not request that the seminal fluid be matched to any particular person because “the identity of the male party was no longer an issue; the issue was more consent.” A forensic scientist at the Rhode Island Department of Health received a sexual assault kit from Women & Infants Hospital and a number of items seized from Ms. 4', 'Ms. Smith did not inform them that she knew his last name, cell phone number, place of business, and make of car; she also did not disclose their previous consensual intercourse. She gave the jury a number of reasons for limiting her disclosure, including a chaotic hospital environment, emotional trauma and shock, and embarrassment. 5', 'Ms. Smith testified that a friend who was visiting showed her these websites, and she never visited them again. Despite her admittedly avid use of the internet, she said that she “didn’t even know there was a favorite thing that you could have.” 6', 'Ms. Smith testified that she wrote down some of the things people said in chat rooms that she visited for a potential book.', '-7- Smith’s apartment. An analysis found seminal fluid in the oral samples collected from Ms. Smith, but not from the vaginal or rectal samples; it also revealed seminal fluid on the bedding from Ms. Smith’s apartment, but not on any other items seized.', 'A police officer drove Ms. Smith home from the hospital around 9:30 a.m. on November 9, 2003. A day or two later, the complaining witness went to the police station, where she disclosed the information she previously withheld.', 'Captain Ochs also took additional photographs of Ms. Smith to show the progression of the bruising. She opined at trial that the bruising proceeded as expected, although she could not say from her observations when the bruising actually occurred.', 'Subsequently, Mr. Gaspar was charged by indictment with six counts of first-degree sexual assault, all arising out of the same sexual encounter. The case was tried twice before the same trial justice. A deadlocked jury in the first trial resulted in a mistrial. The case was tried a second time on February 28, 2006. On March 7, 2006, the jury returned a guilty verdict on five of the six counts. The trial justice heard and denied defendant’s motion for new trial on May 9, 2006. On May 12, 2006, defendant was sentenced to fifty years imprisonment on each count, terms to run concurrently, with twenty-five years to serve, and the balance suspended with the statutory conditions of sex offender registration and counseling.', 'The defendant bases his appeal on the trial testimony of two state witnesses, Jane Doe, 7 a former girlfriend of defendant, and Dr. Swiatkowski, who examined Ms. Smith at Women & Infants Hospital. We discuss the substance of this testimony below, in the context of the three evidentiary issues raised on appeal. 7', 'We refer to defendant’s former girlfriend pseudonymously in deference to her minor child.', '-8-', 'II', 'Analysis', 'A', 'Testimony of Defendant’s Former Girlfriend', 'At Mr. Gaspar’s first trial, his former girlfriend, Jane Doe, testified as a rebuttal witness for the state. 8 At his second trial, the prosecution called Ms. Doe to testify as part of its case-in- chief. She testified that she began a relationship with Mr. Gaspar around February 2003, which relationship lasted eight or nine months. They met online when defendant sent her an instant message with sexual overtones. For a period, Mr. Gaspar moved in with Ms. Doe and her four- year-old daughter. They separated, however, in the fall of 2003, some time before Thanksgiving.', 'Ms. Doe stated that, from the outset of their relationship, she and defendant had engaged in “rough or aggressive sex” on an almost daily basis. She freely admitted that she enjoyed aggressive sex and that this was their exclusive form of sexual encounter. Before the jury, she described in explicit detail the various sexual activities in which she willingly participated with defendant. She said that defendant would put his fingers deep into her mouth, because he liked to make her gag and whimper. He also spit on her and in her mouth, put his whole fist into her vagina, and engaged in anal sex. 9 According to Ms. Doe, defendant was never affectionate or non-aggressive during their sexual encounters, and he progressively became more aggressive over time. At some point, they developed a “safety word,” 10 which would signal when it was 8', 'Although the transcript from the first trial is not in the record, it appears that Mr. Gaspar testified during both trials that he had no interest in sadomasochistic or aggressive sex. At the first trial, Ms. Doe impeached this assertion when she testified that she and Mr. Gaspar had a consensual sexual relationship that was rough and aggressive. 9', 'Nothing in Ms. Doe’s testimony indicated that she and defendant engaged in choking, biting, or slapping during intercourse. 10', 'Ms. Doe explained that a safety word is “a word that [does not] make sense in any sexual situation” and “should act as a kind of turn off.” Theirs was “cheeseburger.” She said it indicates to a person that they are doing something wrong, and it is time to stop.', '-9- time to stop. Ms. Doe said she only had occasion to use their safety word once or twice, but that defendant did not honor it, and it “seemed to egg him on” instead.', 'The state also elicited from Ms. Doe that on five occasions she and Mr. Gaspar had consensual sex together with other women: so-called “threesomes.” All of these women were in their forties and all but one was overweight. Ms. Doe, herself aged twenty-nine, asserted that defendant engaged in the same sort of rough or aggressive actions during their forays into ménage à trois.', 'Additionally, Ms. Doe was asked on redirect examination to read from an anonymous e-mail she had sent to the Office of the Attorney General before she agreed to testify as a witness. In her e-mail, she stated that she did not want to become involved in this case unless it was likely that Mr. Gaspar would be acquitted. Although she acknowledged on the stand and in her e-mail that her sexual relationship with defendant was consensual, she read to the jury a portion of her e-mail bemoaning the circumstances of the complaining witness and professing remorse that neither she nor defendant’s other sexual partners had come forward previously.', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice committed prejudicial error when she allowed the state to introduce the testimony of Jane Doe under Rule 404(b). The defendant gives three reasons why the admission of this evidence was prejudicial error. First, defendant contends that Ms. Doe’s testimony about defendant’s prior sexual acts did not have the “special relevance” necessary for admission of “prior bad acts” under Rule 404(b). Instead, because Ms. Doe testified about consensual sexual activities in a case in which the state was required to prove force or coercion, defendant argues the testimony showed only that he had a particular character trait (viz., interest in rough and aggressive sex). Thus, defendant asserts that the state asked the jury to draw the very inference specifically prohibited by Rule 404(a)—that defendant acted in', '- 10 - conformance with that trait on November 8, 2003. Second, defendant argues that “the state unfairly exploited this evidence by maximizing its sensationalist potential by grafting onto it inflammatory descriptions of three-way sex.” Finally, defendant avers that the trial justice’s limiting instruction was “woefully insufficient.”', 'The state argues that the trial justice did not err in admitting evidence concerning defendant’s previous sexual conduct because the evidence was relevant and reasonably necessary to negate defendant’s consent defense. Specifically, the state argues that defendant’s position at his first trial—in which he allegedly portrayed Ms. Smith as the person with sadomasochistic proclivities and himself as a reluctant participant—made Ms. Doe’s testimony relevant “to contradict defendant’s position, and thereby undercut his defense.” The state further contends that Ms. Doe’s testimony about aggressive group sex with middle-aged, overweight women whom defendant met on the internet “was admissible under the common plan/scheme and motive exceptions to [Rule] 404(b) in order to demonstrate that * * * [defendant] not only had an ongoing interest in having aggressive sex with women like [Ms. Smith], but used the Internet as the means by which to meet such women.” Additionally, the state points out that Ms. Doe’s testimony about defendant’s failure to honor their safety word on one or two occasions was admissible under Rule 404(b) to demonstrate absence of mistake concerning non-consent. The state professes that the “deadlocking of the jury in the first trial” meant that the state “may have been unable to sustain its burden of proof without the introduction of the [Rule] 404(b) evidence.” Finally, the state argues that the trial justice’s limiting instruction to the jury was adequate but that, even if it was not, defendant waived this issue by failing to object. 11 11', 'Because we vacate the judgment of conviction on grounds that Ms. Doe’s testimony about a consensual relationship was inadmissible under Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, we decline to address the sufficiency of the trial justice’s limiting instruction.', '- 11 -', '1.

Similar approaches have been endorsed by the federal courts applying the substantially analogous Federal Rules of Evidence 403 and 404(b). See, e.g., Huddleston v. United States, 485 U.S. 681, 688 (1988) (noting that', '- 12 - evidence properly offered under Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence “is subject only to general strictures limiting admissibility such as Rules 402 and 403.”); United States v.

See, e.g., Varoudakis, 233 F.3d at 118 (“To admit evidence of prior bad acts, a trial court must find that the evidence passes two tests. First, the evidence must have ‘special relevance’ to an issue in the case such as intent or knowledge, and must not include ‘bad character or propensity as a necessary link in the inferential chain.’ * * * Second, under Rule 403, evidence that is specially relevant may still be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.”) (quoting United States v.

Only unfairly prejudicial evidence is barred under Rule 403—meaning evidence that has “an undue tendency to suggest a decision on an improper basis[,]” and “appeals to the jurors’ sympathies, arouses their sense of horror, provokes their instinct to punish, or otherwise causes a jury to base its decision on something other than the established propositions in the case.” 29 Am.

At the second trial, the state presented Ms. Doe as part of its case-in-chief. On appeal, the state asserts that Ms. Doe’s testimony at the second trial “was presented to contradict defendant’s position, and thereby undercut his defense” of consent.', 'Despite its purported Rule 404(b) rationale, in essence the state is suggesting that Ms. Doe’s testimony was presented as part of its case-in-chief to impeach defendant’s anticipated testimony. Rule 404(b) does not govern the introduction of impeachment evidence. There are various other evidentiary rules that govern impeachment. See, e.g., R.I. R. Evid. 607-609. Specifically, Rule 607 provides that “[t]he credibility of a witness may be attacked.” (Emphasis added.) When the state presented Ms. Doe on direct, defendant was not yet a witness at trial, and thus his anticipated consent defense could not yet be impeached. In a criminal matter, a defendant has no burden of proof and may choose not to testify at any time. See State v. Alston, 900 A.2d 1212, 1221 (R.I. 2006); State v. Hallenbeck, 878 A.2d 992, 1007-08 (R.I. 2005). Thus, impeachment in this form was improper during the state’s case-in-chief and significantly increased the risk of unfair prejudice to defendant. Because Ms. Doe’s testimony was elicited as', '- 14 -', 'nine-month relationship with defendant involving rough or aggressive sexual activity on an', 'almost daily basis. With the exception of only one or two occasions when, according to Ms.', 'Doe, defendant failed to heed their safety word, the sexual encounters were entirely consensual.', 'We are satisfied that the implied equivalence of defendant’s consensual and alleged', 'nonconsensual sexual encounters (with Ms. Doe and Ms. Smith respectively) was very likely to', 'confuse the jury and invite an emotional response. We conclude, therefore, that the trial justice', 'committed reversible error in admitting this evidence.', 'B', 'Admission of Medical Report Narrative', 'The defendant next assigns as prejudicial error the admission into evidence of the portion of the medical records that contain an historical narrative of the evening’s events as related by the complaining witness. He particularly challenges the trial justice’s ruling that allowed the doctor to read the narrative to the jury during her testimony, thereby imbuing it with her professional imprimatur. Doctor Swiatkowski, who examined Ms. Smith in the early morning of November 9, 2003, testified that she followed a standard protocol for evaluating a patient for an alleged sexual assault. The state requested that she read the contents of a portion of her documentation titled “medical summary of alleged assault.” 14 Doctor Swiatkowski stated that she gathered information about the assault for purposes of medical diagnosis and treatment, and proceeded to read into the record the narrative that she had taken from the complaining witness that night. This report repeated, at times verbatim, the criminal accusations of the complaining witness: part of the state’s case-in-chief, we need not consider whether some or all of her testimony would have been properly admissible in rebuttal; that would depend on what defendant testified to—if indeed he chose to testify. 14', 'The entire medical report of Women & Infants Hospital had been admitted into evidence by agreement, although defendant objected to the introduction of the narrative portion.', '- 15 -', '“[Doctor Swiatkowski]:', 'Okay.', '‘The patient invited the', 'acquaintance into her home and into her bedroom. Patient', 'originally was consensual, but after approximately three minutes,', 'she told the man, “No.” He became abusive, yelling at her, pulling', 'her hair. He did not stop. He bit her over multiple spots on her', 'body, the shoulders, back, arms, and legs, forced fellatio on her,', 'pulling her hair and told her, “You like it, bitch.” He then raped', 'her both vaginally and anally several times. He told her she “had', 'not made me cum.” During this time period, he held her down at', 'times by her arms and her hair, hit her on the breasts, arms, legs.', 'At several points, she tried to get away, but he pulled her hair', 'harder. She told him she had to go to the bathroom, so he dragged', 'her from the bedroom to the bathroom. She urinated after he', 'forced her to sit on the toilet and provide oral sex to him again. He', 'then pulled her into the living room by her hair and eventually', 'pushed her onto the floor. He again raped her both vaginally and', 'anally. He also forced his fist into her vagina. She screamed that', 'it hurt and to stop. He again told her—he told her she, “liked it,', 'bitch.” She noted vaginal pain and bleeding afterwards. He again', 'forced fellatio on her; and during one of the episodes, he ejaculated', 'into her mouth. She spit out the semen. She is unsure if he came', 'during vaginal or anal intercourse. He brought her back into the', 'bedroom, all the while continued biting her, hitting her, and pulling', 'her hair. Eventually, he got dressed and left. She got up and', 'brushed her teeth. She then called 9-1-1, and the police came and', 'brought her here with the clothing she had on the night or on', 'before the encounter [sic]. Her underwear were the same ones she', 'wore when she got here. They have been collected as evidence.', 'The patient relates a time period to be 10 to 12 p.m. on 11-8. She', 'arrived at Women & Infants Hospital with the police at 2:50 a.m.', 'on 11-9.”', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice committed prejudicial error when she permitted the introduction of those portions of the medical records that contained the hearsay narrative from the complaining witness. The defendant argues that this testimony falls squarely within a line of cases applying this Court’s pronouncement in State v. Pina, 455 A.2d 313, 315 (R.I. 1983), that under the hearsay exception for medical diagnosis and treatment, statements that ascribe fault or are otherwise not a basis for diagnosis or treatment should be excluded. See R.I. R. Evid. 803(4). The defendant contends that Dr. Swiatkowski’s testimony was “replete with', '- 16 - accusations of criminal behavior, [and] with assertions that the complaining witness had not acted consensually[;]” he further contends that the report was gathered for law enforcement purposes, not medical purposes. Additionally, defendant argues that the testimony in this case was much more graphic and pointed in its accusations of criminal behavior than those previously considered and excluded by this Court and that to allow its admission would require overruling an entire assemblage of case law. Finally, defendant maintains that this testimony was especially prejudicial because of its suggested “seal of professional approval.”', 'The state counters that “the majority of the statements in the narrative portion of [the medical report], as read at trial by Dr. Swiatkowski,” were pertinent to Ms. Smith’s diagnosis and treatment for sexual assault, and that the doctor so testified at trial. The state contends that, to the extent any statements fell outside the scope of Rule 803(4), the admission was harmless because the jury heard the same testimony from Ms. Smith herself and the doctor did not comment on the report’s veracity.', '1. Standard of Review', '“It is well established that ‘the admission of a statement under an exception to the hearsay rule is within the sound discretion of the trial justice and shall not be overturned unless clearly erroneous.” State v. Bergevine, 942 A.2d 974, 978 (R.I. 2008) (quoting State v. Ruffner, 911 A.2d 680, 689 (R.I. 2006)).', '2. Rule of Evidence 803(4)', 'Doctor Swiatkowski’s testimony relaying Ms. Smith’s medical summary report is clearly hearsay. See R.I. R. Evid. 801(c). Rhode Island, however, recognizes the medical-diagnosis exception to the hearsay rule. Rule 803(4); 15 see In re Andrey G., 796 A.2d 452, 456 (R.I. 2002); 15', 'Rule 803(4) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence excludes from the hearsay rule:', '- 17 - State v. Contreras, 105 R.I. 523, 534-35, 253 A.2d 612, 619 (1969). The rationale behind this rule is that “a person will presumably be truthful to a physician from whom he expects to receive medical attention.” Pina, 455 A.2d at 315; see Rule 803(4), Advisory Committee’s Note; State v. Lima, 546 A.2d 770, 774 (R.I. 1988). Thus, statements made by an injured individual to his treating physician relating to his physical condition and to the cause of such injury are generally admissible. Pina, 455 A.2d at 315.', 'The test for determining admissibility “hinge[s] on whether what has been related by the patient will assist or is helpful in the diagnosis or treatment of [the patient’s] ailment.” In re Andrey G., 796 A.2d at 456 (quoting In re Jessica C., 690 A.2d 1357, 1363 (R.I. 1997)); see Contreras, 105 R.I. at 534-35, 253 A.2d at 619. Statements that narrate details unconnected with either diagnosis or treatment, however, are inadmissible unless they fall under another hearsay exception. Pina, 455 A.2d at 315; State v. Veluzat, 578 A.2d 93, 96 (R.I. 1990).', 'When statements about causation enter the realm of assigning fault, it is unlikely that the patient or the physician consider them related to diagnosis or treatment. Pina, 455 A.2d at 315. “In the circumstances where fault is an issue, statements of causation do not hold the same reliability of truthfulness and are properly excluded.” Id. An uninterrupted line of cases from this Court has followed the rule elucidated in Pina in applying Rule 803(4). See In re Andrey G., 796 A.2d at 456; Veluzat, 578 A.2d at 96; Lima, 546 A.2d at 774; State v. Barber, 468 A.2d 277, 278 (R.I. 1983); State v. Burgess, 465 A.2d 204, 206-07 (R.I. 1983).', '“Statements made for the purposes of medical diagnosis or', 'treatment and describing medical history, or past or present', 'symptoms, pain, or sensations, or the inception or general character', 'of the cause of external source thereof insofar as reasonably', 'pertinent to diagnosis or treatment, but not including statements', 'made to a physician consulted solely for the purposes of preparing', 'for litigation or obtaining testimony for trial.”', '- 18 -', 'In Pina, in which the only issue at trial was whether the intercourse was consensual, this Court held that a doctor’s statements about defendant’s alleged threats merely acted to assign fault by clarifying the issue of consent; therefore, the statements were not pertinent to medical diagnosis or treatment and were inadmissible. In the same year that Pina was issued, this Court held that a medical history report constituted inadmissible hearsay in two more cases, both of which relied on Pina. See Barber, 468 A.2d at 278; Burgess, 465 A.2d at 206-07. Similarly, in In re Andrey G., 796 A.2d at 456, the Court held inadmissible a child’s statements in a medical document that respondent had sexually abused her because it merely assigned fault rather than assisted the doctor in medical diagnosis.', 'In some cases, this Court has held that medical history reports that contain information about a sexual assault are admissible. In those cases, however, the material issue was not consent, but rather whether a sexual assault actually had occurred. See State v. Pierce, 689 A.2d 1030, 1033 (R.I. 1997) (holding that purpose of hospital visit was to determine whether sexual assault had occurred); In re Jean Marie W., 559 A.2d 625, 630 (R.I. 1989) (holding that child’s statements were used to establish that sexual abuse had actually occurred, but did not ascribe fault); State v. Ucero, 450 A.2d 809, 815 (R.I. 1982) (holding that purpose of hospital visit was to determine whether sexual assault had occurred). Here, there is no question that Ms. Smith and defendant had a sexual encounter on the night in question, making these cases inapplicable.', '3. Discussion', 'Applying the rule set forth in Pina, we hold that Dr. Swiatkowski’s verbatim rendition of the un-redacted medical summary report should have been excluded because it contained information that was not reasonably related to either diagnosis or treatment. Like the question presented in Pina, 455 A.2d at 315, “the instant case presents no question as to whether or not', '- 19 - sexual intercourse took place.', 'The only issue is whether intercourse was voluntary or involuntary.” Doctor Swiatkowski’s verbatim recitation of her medical summary report included many narrative details that were unconnected with diagnosis or treatment and that strongly, and graphically, imputed criminal fault to defendant. It contains facts clearly inapposite to medical diagnosis or treatment, such as statements defendant allegedly made to Ms. Smith, and the assertion that “[p]atient originally was consensual, but after approximately three minutes, she told the man, ‘No.’ He became abusive * * *.” The doctor’s testimony, a near-perfect repetition of the complaining witness’s version of events, is replete with assignments of fault, asserting in conclusive terms that “he then raped her both vaginally and anally several times” and “forced fellatio on her.”', 'We are hard pressed to discern how some of the statements related in the narrative would assist in the diagnosis or treatment of the complaining witness. The doctor did not provide any medical reason as to why she obtained this narrative. Although Dr. Swiatkowski answered “yes” when the state pointedly asked her if she gathered information about the sexual assault for purposes of medical diagnosis and treatment, when the doctor was invited to elaborate, she stated, “[f]rom a medical perspective, the document is from the rape kit, it’s just to gather information about the assault.” This suggests forensics, not medicine.', 'We further conclude that allowing Dr. Swiatkowski to read the entire “medical summary of alleged assault” was highly prejudicial to the defendant. “We have often recognized that a physician’s testimony can carry with it an impression of great credibility.” Veluzat, 578 A.2d at 96; see Pina, 455 A.2d at 315 (“A doctor clothed in the garb of a medical expert possesses substantial stature in the eyes of a jury.”). We have further recognized that, where the only witness to the alleged sexual assault is the complainant, “[t]he doctor’s repetition of the victim’s', '- 20 - version of events [is] sure to lend it credibility. A medical expert cannot serve the function of a thirteenth juror by evaluating the credibility of witnesses.” Veluzat, 578 A.2d at 96-97 (quoting Pina, 455 A.2d at 315).', 'The introduction of this medical history narrative is especially prejudicial in that it corroborated the details set forth in the testimony of the complainant concerning the alleged sexual assault, surely lending to its credibility. See Barber, 468 A.2d at 278; Burgess, 465 A.2d at 206-07; Pina, 455 A.2d at 315.', 'We recognize that in the likely event that the state seeks to introduce the narrative portion of the medical records at defendant’s retrial, it will do so upon a new record and under differing circumstances. Its admissibility undoubtedly will depend in large measure on the foundational testimony of the doctor. With respect to the case on appeal, however, we are satisfied that the admission of the entire unexpurgated medical report narrative, both as a document and then as read to the jury, was in error. Because we are vacating the judgment on other grounds, we need not consider whether such error was harmless.', 'C', 'Expert Opinion Concerning Age of Bruises', 'One of the key issues at trial was whether the complaining witness’s multiple bruises and bite markings were inflicted by defendant or whether—as defendant insinuated—she already had suffered injuries from some previous sexual encounter before she met with defendant on November 8, 2003. The state asked Dr. Swiatkowski to give an expert opinion on the age of the bruises that she observed on the complaining witness’s body. She opined, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that the bruising occurred within twenty-four hours of her examination. Doctor Swiatkowski explained that as a bruise ages, it goes through different color phases, although she acknowledged that the coloration and healing process is different on every patient', '- 21 - and can be affected by various factors, such as medication. She said that she based her judgment on coloration, as well as on redness, bite marks, and raised parts of the skin.', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice committed reversible error when she permitted the state’s doctor to offer an opinion concerning when the complaining witness suffered bruising. The defendant’s position is that the state did not lay a medical or forensic foundation for this expert testimony. He asserts that the question of the aging of bruises is more a forensic than a medical issue, and is not within the ordinary and usual expertise of a medical practitioner. The state counters that the trial justice did not err in permitting Dr. Swiatkowski to testify about the approximate age of the complaining witness’s bruises. The state argues that a foundation does “not have to be elaborately presented before the expert testifies to her conclusion if the information is common and well understood.” 16', '1. Standard of Review', 'In reviewing a trial justice’s ruling on the admissibility of an expert witness’s proffered testimony, “this Court will not reverse the decision unless the trial justice abused his or her discretion.” State v. Rieger, 763 A.2d 997, 1004 (R.I. 2001) (citing State v. Morales, 621 A.2d 1247, 1249 (R.I. 1993)). We will sustain the ruling below provided that the trial justice’s discretion “has been soundly and judicially exercised, that is, if it has been exercised in the light of reason applied to all the facts and with a view to the rights of all the parties to the action * * *.” In re Mackenzie C., 877 A.2d 674, 684 (R.I. 2005) (quoting Owens v. Silvia, 838 A.2d 881, 890 (R.I. 2003)). 16', 'The state argues, alternatively, that defendant did not preserve his foundational argument because it was not “specifically focused enough.” When the trial justice asked defense to articulate his grounds for objection, he stated, “I don’t think there was a satisfactory basis for that opinion.” We are satisfied, however, that the foundational grounds for the defense’s objection were entirely clear.', '- 22 -', '2. Discussion', 'Under Rule 705 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, “an expert’s opinion must be predicated upon facts legally sufficient to form a basis for his [or her] conclusion.” Gallucci v. Humbyrd, 709 A.2d 1059, 1063 (R.I. 1998) (quoting Alterio v. Biltmore Construction Corp., 119 R.I. 307, 312, 377 A.2d 237, 240 (1977)). 17 Such facts must be disclosed so that it is possible “to assess whether the conclusions drawn from the facts possess sufficient probative force or, rather, are grounded in mere speculation or conjecture.” State v. Hanes, 783 A.2d 920, 927 (R.I. 2001) (quoting DeChristofaro v. Machala, 685 A.2d 258, 267 (R.I. 1996)). Another major purpose of this requirement is to facilitate intelligent cross-examination. Gorham v. Public Building Authority of Providence, 612 A.2d 708, 717 (R.I. 1992).', 'At times, the scientific foundation for a particular expert opinion is so common and well understood that the expert’s qualifications are sufficient to assure that the opinion has an adequate foundation. See, e.g., Gallucci, 709 A.2d at 1063-66 (holding expert’s qualifications as a board-certified orthopedic surgeon, the substantial nature of his examination, and his review of patient records to be a sufficient foundation for him to proffer opinion as to causation); cf. Owens, 838 A.2d at 892 (noting that under Rule 702 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, the scientific foundation for an expert’s theory may be so common and well understood that the proponent of the testimony can lay the foundation while qualifying the witness). We caution, however, that this narrow situation is not intended to subsume the rule.', 'It is our opinion that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion in permitting Dr. Swiatkowski to testify about the aging of the complaining witness’s bruising. The doctor’s 17', 'Rule 705 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence provides:', '“Unless the court directs otherwise, before testifying in terms of', 'opinion, an expert witness shall be first examined concerning the', 'facts or data upon which the opinion is based.”', '- 23 - opinion was not without a medical foundation; she explained that as a bruise ages progresses, it changes in coloration and that the coloration process helps determine when the injuries were sustained. She explained that older bruises present themselves in shades of green and yellow, whereas newer bruises are more red and purple. She stated that she based her judgment on other, additional facts—such as the redness of the skin around the bruises, indentations in the skin that appeared to be bite marks, and raised or swollen skin. She also explained that all the bruises were similar in appearance. Because Dr. Swiatkowski is an emergency room physician with experience and training at Women & Infants Hospital and Detroit Receiving Hospital, we believe that her qualifications, coupled with the factual basis for her opinion, are sufficient to assure this Court that the trial justice based her ruling on more than “mere speculation or conjecture.” Hanes, 783 A.2d at 927 (quoting DeChristoforo, 685 A.2d at 267). Furthermore, the doctor’s testimony was buttressed by photographs of Ms. Smith’s injuries, which showed her bruises changing color over time.', 'The doctor’s testimony also provided the information necessary for intelligent cross- examination. The defendant was able to extract from Dr. Swiatkowski the acknowledgement that the bruises on every patient age and heal differently and that bruising can be affected by medication, among other factors. The defendant also asked her whether the bruising could have occurred more than twenty-four hours before the patient was examined, to which the doctor replied in the negative. The defendant chose not to follow this line of questioning any further.', 'With these considerations in mind, we cannot say that the trial justice abused her discretion by allowing Dr. Swiatkowski’s to opine on the age of the complainant’s bruises.', '- 24 -', 'III', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of conviction entered in the Superior Court.
