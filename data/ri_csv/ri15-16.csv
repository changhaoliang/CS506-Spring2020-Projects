0,State : v. : Harry W. Brown. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court.', 'The defendant, Harry W. Brown, is before the Supreme Court on appeal from an adjudication by a justice of the Superior Court declaring him to be in violation of the terms and conditions of probation. The defendant applied for a transfer of his probation supervision from the State of Rhode Island to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania pursuant to the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision (ICAOS or Compact), G.L. 1956 chapter 9.1 of title 13. Pennsylvania accepted the transfer request and imposed additional conditions of supervision upon the defendant, to which the defendant acquiesced. The defendant ultimately violated the additional conditions. In this appeal, we are tasked with determining the effect to be given to these violations by this state under the Compact. For the following reasons, we affirm in part and vacate in part the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'In 1996, defendant entered a plea of nolo contendere to all counts of a twenty-seven- count indictment that charged him with first-degree child molestation sexual assault, second- degree child molestation sexual assault, first-degree sexual assault, second-degree sexual assault,', '-1- and assault with intent to commit first-degree sexual assault upon more than one victim. In total, the trial justice1 sentenced defendant to forty-five years at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI), twenty years to serve and twenty-five years suspended with probation. The trial justice also ordered that defendant would be required to obtain sex-offender counseling, register as a sex offender, and refrain from contact with the victims.', 'The defendant was released from the ACI on parole on November 16, 2005. Pennsylvania began supervising his parole two days later. In December 2008, defendant signed a document entitled “Special Conditions of Parole” prepared by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole; defendant agreed to abide by the following special condition of parole:', '“I shall refrain from using any computer and/or device to create', 'any social networking profile or to access any social networking', 'service or chat room (including but not limited to MySpace.com,', 'Facebook, Match.com, Yahoo Messenger/Yahoo 360, AOL/AOL', 'Instant Messenger, and any online dating service) in my own name', 'or any other name for any reason unless expressly authorized by', 'the District Parole Supervisor.”', 'On October 20, 2011, presumably at the conclusion of his parole term, defendant signed a document entitled “Rhode Island Department of Corrections Adult Probation and Parole Conditions of Supervised Probation” (Rhode Island Conditions of Supervised Probation) in which he acknowledged, “I must obey the * * * [c]onditions [set forth in the document] throughout the term of my [p]robation.”2 He also acknowledged that: “Failure to follow each 1', 'To distinguish between the two Superior Court justices who presided over the relevant proceedings in this case, we refer to the justice who accepted defendant’s plea and sentenced him as “the trial justice” and the justice who adjudicated defendant to be a probation violator as “the hearing justice.” 2', 'The document listed the following conditions: (1) “[o]bey all laws”; (2) “[r]eport to the Probation Officer as directed”; (3) “[r]emain within the State of Rhode Island, except with the', '-2- and every one of the [c]onditions of [p]robation could result in further [c]ourt action. If I violate my [p]robation, the [c]ourt could impose the sentence allowable by law.”', 'The defendant applied for transfer of his probation supervision from Rhode Island to Pennsylvania pursuant to the Compact. The transfer application, which is dated October 15, 2011 and was signed by defendant on January 4, 2012, provided, in pertinent part, that:', '“I, HARRY W. BROWN, am applying for transfer of my', 'parole/probation/other supervision from RHODE ISLAND', '(sending state) to PENNSYLVANIA (receiving state).', 'I', 'understand that this transfer of supervision will be subject to the', 'rules of the Interstate Commission for Adult Offender Supervision.', '“I understand that my supervision in another state may be different', 'than the supervision I would be subject to in this state.

On December 1, 2011, Pennsylvania sent Rhode Island a “Compact Action Request,” indicating that Pennsylvania authorities “allowed [defendant] to have limited access to the [I]nternet. He took advantage of this privilege [by] utilizing a cell phone to access online dating sites.” Through the Compact Action Request, one of the Pennsylvania parole agents assigned to defendant’s case requested “that [Rhode Island] propose a special condition [on defendant] to not utilize or have access to the [I]nternet at any time.” Rhode Island gave the following reply: “Per [C]ompact [R]ule 4.103, the receiving state can impose any conditions appropriate to offenders placed under supervision in the receiving state.', 'Therefore, if [Pennsylvania] wishes to impose a condition of no [I]nternet access, it has the authority to do so.”3', 'Pennsylvania thereafter imposed several additional conditions.', 'On July 31, 2012, defendant signed two documents in which he agreed to comply with the following pertinent additional conditions:', '“You must not possess, view, listen to[,] or read any sexually', 'explicit material, including any articles, literature, books,', 'magazines, photographs, e-mails, websites, digital images,', 'animated photographs or images, tapes, videos, or any content that', 'may be or is broadcast by radio, television[,] or computer', '(including by satellite).

Starzynski met with defendant and reviewed the Pennsylvania conditions with him. The defendant stated that he understood the conditions and acknowledged that he knew that he was subject to them before his meeting with Starzynski.', 'Notwithstanding this acknowledgment, defendant knowingly violated the Pennsylvania conditions.', 'On January 11, 2014, Starzynksi and other Pennsylvania parole agents searched defendant’s residence and cell phone. In defendant’s bedroom, parole agents found at least one pornographic DVD under his nightstand, as well as a stack of photographs depicting nude or partially clad women in his closet. The defendant admitted to parole agents that he used these materials to masturbate. In addition, on top of the stack of photographs that was discovered in his closet, parole agents found a photograph of a fully-clothed school-aged girl. The defendant admitted to parole agents that the girl in the photograph was the child of a woman with whom he recently had a yearlong dating relationship. Finally, a search of defendant’s phone revealed that he once again had been using dating and social-networking sites. The profile names used by', '-5- defendant this time were different from the earlier occasion when parole agents discovered his unauthorized use of social-networking sites.', 'Based on the evidence discovered during this search, defendant was charged with violating the Pennsylvania conditions. On January 14, 2014, defendant executed a form entitled “Waiver of Probable Cause Hearing and Admission Form” (waiver form), in which he proceeded to waive his right to counsel and his right to a probable-cause hearing in Pennsylvania; he also admitted that he violated the Pennsylvania conditions. The waiver form provided, in pertinent part, that:', '“I have been advised of my right to a probable[-]cause hearing and', 'counsel representation at that hearing. With full knowledge and', 'understanding of my right to counsel and a probable[-]cause', 'hearing, I hereby waive those rights. I waive these rights of my', 'own free will, without promise, threat[,] or coercion.', '“* * *', '“On the 14[th] day of January two thousand and [fourteen], I[,]', 'Harry Brown[,] do knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily admit', 'that I was in violation of the terms and conditions of my probation', 'or parole.

The Rule 32(f) violation report specified that “the grounds upon which action is sought to adjudge * * * defendant a violator” consisted of defendant’s failure “to comply with a specific condition of probation in that he failed to keep the peace and remain of', '-6- good behavior. Said violation of probation is not contingent upon any specific criminal offense.” At the probation violation hearing in Superior Court, Starzynski testified.', 'Among other evidence, the state also submitted, over defendant’s objection, the waiver form. The defendant’s objection centered on the fact that, because Starzynski was not present when defendant executed the waiver form, there was no evidence that it was signed knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently. The defendant did not cross-examine Starzynski or present any evidence, including any evidence bearing on the validity of the waiver form.', 'The hearing justice adjudged defendant to be a probation violator. He offered two grounds for his decision. First, at the state’s urging, the hearing justice determined that ICAOS Rules, Rule 4.103-1 (Rule 4.103-1) (2016) mandated that he treat the violations to which defendant admitted as a violation of his Rhode Island probation. Additionally, the trial justice went on to conclude that, irrespective of Rule 4.103-1’s application, defendant’s conduct in Pennsylvania amounted to a failure to keep the peace and remain of good behavior. With respect to this ground of decision, the hearing justice emphasized that “the actions that the [s]tate presented are sufficiently related to defendant’s prior sexual misconduct that * * * it is of serious concern to the [c]ourt as to * * * defendant’s ability to modify his sexual behavior so as not to be [a] danger to others, particularly children.” He also noted that defendant “promised to abide by certain conditions and he didn’t keep that promise.”', 'The hearing justice executed eight years of the twenty-five years remaining on defendant’s suspended sentence. The hearing justice considered the “number of serious charges” of which defendant stands convicted—twenty-seven counts of “criminal sexual behavior with his minor nieces when they visited him at his home and when he visited them in their home.” He further found that “the acts which form the basis of a violation * * * are particularly disturbing to', '-7- the [c]ourt as they involve sexual behavior which he knew was a violation of the [Pennsylvania conditions].” The hearing justice explained that, “rather than conform his behavior to norms of proper sexual behavior, [defendant] once again has played out his sexual fantasies in a manner that causes the [c]ourt concern that he has not yet learned appropriate sexual conduct.” The hearing justice found that “defendant presents a danger to the safety and well-being of the community.” Additionally, the hearing justice imposed two new conditions of probation for the remainder of his suspended sentence: (1) that he refrain “from being in the presence of or communicating with persons under the age of [eighteen]”; and (2) that he be “prohibited from the use of computers.” The defendant objected that eight years of imprisonment was excessive; he did not, however, raise any objection to the new probation conditions. The defendant timely appealed.', 'Analysis', 'Scope of Rule 4.103-1', '“[W]e review questions of statutory interpretation de novo.” State v. Hazard, 68 A.3d 479, 485 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Campbell v. State, 56 A.3d 448, 454 (R.I. 2012)). In this case, we must interpret a rule promulgated by the Interstate Commission on Adult Offender Supervision (Commission). Under the Compact, these rules “have the force and effect of statutory law and shall be binding in the compacting states.” Section 13-9.1-1.3, article V(2); see also id., article XIV, Section B.

We reject this assertion. Although defendant acknowledges in the transfer application that noncompliance “with all the terms and conditions that the sending state or the receiving state, or both, placed on me * * * will be considered a violation and I may be returned to the sending state,” there is nothing in that document that informs defendant that, if he violated the Pennsylvania conditions, he would be declared a probation violator in Rhode Island.', '- 10 -', 'To be sure, Rule 4.103-1 undeniably imposes a duty on a sending-state entity: “the probation or paroling authority of a sending state.” Neither the Compact nor the ICAOS Rules define this entity, but it clearly does not encompass the courts of a sending state. The third sentence of Rule 4.103-1 draws a distinction between a “court” in the sending state and “the probation or paroling authority of a sending state,” thus recognizing that they are separate entities. Id. (“[T]he original plan of supervision shall include, but not be limited to, any court orders setting forth the terms and conditions of probation, any orders incorporating a plan of supervision by reference, or any orders or directives of the paroling or probation authority.” (emphases added)).', 'Therefore, we interpret Rule 4.103-1 as mandating that the probation or paroling authority of a sending state undertake “revocation or other punitive action” against an offender for violating a condition imposed by the receiving state, irrespective of whether the condition was imposed by the sending state in the first instance.5 Failure to comply with the conditions imposed in the receiving state clearly forms the basis of punitive action in the sending state. The rule does not mandate, however, that a Superior Court hearing justice mechanically hold that a 5', 'Although the second sentence of Rule 4.103-1 does not explicitly identify the entity to which it is directed, it—like the first sentence of the rule—uses the term “punitive action,” which the first sentence connects to the probation or paroling authority of the sending state. See Rule 4.103-1 (“For purposes of revocation or other punitive action against an offender, the probation or paroling authority of a sending state shall give the same effect to a violation of special conditions or requirement[s] imposed by a receiving state as if those conditions or requirement[s] had been imposed by the sending state. Failure of an offender to comply with special conditions or additional requirements imposed by a receiving state shall form the basis of punitive action in the sending state notwithstanding the absence of such conditions or requirements in the original plan of supervision issued by the sending state.” (emphases added)). Therefore, we conclude that the first two sentences of Rule 4.103-1 work in tandem to specify the duty imposed on the probation or paroling authority of the sending state.', '- 11 - violation of a condition imposed by the receiving state constitutes a violation of defendant’s probation in the sending state.6 6', 'We note that the language of the Bench Book concerning Rule 4.103-1 departs somewhat from the text of the rule. The Bench Book provides, in pertinent part, that:', '“Revocation or Punitive Action by the Sending State – Special Conditions', '“For purposes of revocation or other punitive action, a sending state is', 'required to give the same effect to the violation of a special condition imposed by', 'the receiving state as if the condition had been imposed by the sending state.', 'Furthermore, the violation of a special condition imposed by the receiving state', 'can be the basis of punitive action even though it was not part of the original plan', 'of supervision established by the sending state. Special conditions may be', 'imposed by the receiving state at the time of acceptance of supervision or during', 'the term of supervision, [s]ee Rule 4.103. Thus by way of example, if at the time', 'of acceptance, a receiving state imposed a condition of drug treatment and the', 'offender violated that condition, the sending state would be required to give effect', 'to that violation even though the special condition was not a part of the original', 'plan of supervision.', '“PRACTICE NOTE: A sending state must give effect to the violation of a special', 'condition or other requirement imposed by the receiving state even if the', 'condition or requirement was not contained in the original plan of supervision.”', 'Bench Book § 4.5 at 98 (emphases added). Significantly, the focus of Rule 4.103-1, however, is not directed at the sending state generally, but at a particular entity of the sending state: namely, the probation or paroling authority of the sending state. Nothing in the Compact or the ICAOS Rules suggests that this entity is synonymous with the sending state; if that were so, the reference to “the probation or paroling authority” would be entirely superfluous. Cf. State v. Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 571-72 (R.I. 2009) (“[T]he Legislature is presumed to have intended each word or provision of a statute to express a significant meaning, and the [C]ourt will give effect to every word, clause, or sentence, whenever possible. * * * [N]o construction of a statute should be adopted that would demote any significant phrase or clause to mere surplusage.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). In any event, we are not concerned with any discrepancies between the Bench Book and Rule 4.103-1 because neither text purports to impose the duty to take punitive action on the courts of a sending state. Moreover, only the rule has the force of law, and the Bench Book may not be used to contradict the clear meaning of the ICAOS Rules. See ICAOS Advisory Op. No. 1-2008, at 2, 4- 5 (Mar. 18, 2008) available at http://www.interstatecompact.org/Portals/0/library/legal/ advisoryopinions/AdvisoryOpinion_1-2008_MA.pdf.', '- 12 -', 'We are not unmindful of the fact that our conclusion somewhat conflicts with the decision of the Florida District Court of Appeal in Critelli v. State, 962 So. 2d 341, 343-44 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2007), which appears to be the only reported judicial decision addressing the scope of Rule 4.103-1.', 'In Critelli, 962 So. 2d at 342, the offender completed a transfer application containing language similar to the transfer application in this case. The receiving state, Colorado, accepted the offender’s application and imposed several additional conditions of supervision (the Colorado conditions).', 'Id.', 'When the offender failed to comply with the Colorado conditions, Colorado notified the sending state, Florida, of this development, and the trial court in Florida “concluded that [the offender] had violated his probation by failing to abide by the Colorado conditions,” revoked his probation, and ordered that he be incarcerated. Id.', 'On appeal, the court first held that the offender voluntarily modified his probation when he filled out the transfer application and accepted the Colorado conditions:', '“[I]n this case, [the offender] asked to have his probation', 'transferred to Colorado. Colorado conditioned its acceptance on', 'his agreement to the Colorado conditions. We view this as a', 'voluntary modification of his probation. [The offender] signed an', 'Interstate Compact application under which he agreed to abide by', 'both Florida’s and Colorado’s conditions of probation. There can', 'be no doubt that [the offender] was fully aware of the conditions of', 'his probation added by Colorado and had the opportunity to object', 'to those conditions. If [the offender] did not wish to abide by the', 'Colorado conditions, he did not have to sign the Interstate', 'Compact and could have remained in Florida.” Critelli, 962 So. 2d', 'at 343. The court then rejected the argument that “the only penalty for a violation of the Colorado conditions was to return him to Florida, not the revocation of his probation.” Id. After quoting Rule 4.103-1, the court held: “This rule clearly refutes [the offender]’s argument. Further, [the offender] should not be able to accept the benefits of his transfer to Colorado, and then fail to carry out the required conditions.” Critelli, 962 So. 2d at 344.', '- 13 -', 'We agree with the Critelli court’s conclusion that Rule 4.103-1 foreclosed the offender’s argument that retaking by the sending state was the only consequence of violation of the receiving state’s additional conditions. However, Critelli relies upon the notion that the language of the transfer application in that case represented the offender’s “voluntary modification of * * * probation.” Critelli, 962 So. 2d at 343. The transfer application executed by defendant in this case leads us to a different conclusion. We are of the opinion that this transfer application did not constitute a modification of defendant’s probation; indeed, the application does not indicate that a violation of an additional condition imposed by Pennsylvania would automatically lead to an adjudication of probation violation in Rhode Island. See supra note 4. We also note that Critelli does not speak to what entity Rule 4.103-1 tasks with taking punitive action in the sending state—the probation or paroling authority. We deem the precise scope of Rule 4.103-1 to be critical to the issue with which we are confronted.', 'Although defendant challenges the authority of the Commission to mandate that courts of a sending state automatically adjudicate an offender to be a probation violator on the basis of a violation of a condition of supervision imposed by a receiving state, we need not address these contentions because the plain text of Rule 4.103-1 does not purport to exercise such authority.7 We hold that Rule 4.103-1 imposes upon the probation or paroling authority of the sending state the duty to undertake revocation or other punitive action against an offender for violation of a condition imposed by the receiving state, even where, as here, the additional condition was not 7', 'In particular, defendant argues that, if his violation of the Pennsylvania conditions must result in a probation violation adjudication in Superior Court under Rule 4.103-1, (1) the Compact constitutes an unconstitutional legislative delegation of judicial power; and (2) the addition of new conditions of probation to those ordered by the trial justice violates the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.', '- 14 - one that was imposed by the sending state.8 However, this rule does not impose a corresponding duty on the Superior Court. Therefore, the probation or parole authorities of this state are required under Rule 4.103-1 to take punitive action against an offender. Clearly, the conduct underlying a violation of an agreed-upon condition of supervision in the receiving state can form the basis for presentment pursuant to Rule 32(f) and a violation hearing in accordance with our settled law. A hearing justice must determine whether that conduct amounts to a failure to keep the peace and remain of good behavior. And, as we explain below, a hearing justice conducting a probation violation hearing in a Compact case such as this one—including one that involves a determination of whether a waiver form was executed knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily—should strive to accommodate the realities of such a case.', 'Hearing Justice’s Adjudication of Probation Violation', 'With the precise scope of Rule 4.103-1 in focus, we turn to the hearing justice’s adjudication of probation violation.', 'The sole focus of a probation violation hearing is to determine whether a defendant has failed to keep the peace and remain of good behavior or has otherwise violated the terms and conditions of his or her probation. State v. Gibson, 126 A.3d 427, 431 (R.I. 2015). The state bears the burden to “prove to the reasonable satisfaction of the 8', 'We note that neither the Compact nor the ICAOS Rules define the term “punitive action.” Under G.L. 1956 § 12-19-9, “[w]henever any person * * * violates the terms and conditions of his or her probation as fixed by the court, the police or the probation authority shall inform the attorney general of the violation, and the attorney general shall cause the defendant to appear before the court.” This occurred in this case. At oral argument, the state represented that there is confusion within the probation and parole unit of the Rhode Island Department of Corrections (DOC) regarding the requirements of the ICAOS in this area. The DOC is encouraged to seek an advisory opinion from the Commission in the event that such confusion arises in the future. See ICAOS Rules, Rule 6.101(c) at 71 (2016), available at http://www.interstatecompact.org/ LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=qGvYF9N1mNU%3d&tabid=358&portalid=0&mid=4264 (“Any state may submit an informal written request to the executive director [of the Commission] for assistance in interpreting the rules of [the] [C]ompact.”).', '- 15 - [hearing] justice” that the terms and conditions of probation have been violated.9 Id.

(quoting Hazard, 68 A.3d at 499). The defendant argues that the conduct that violated the Pennsylvania conditions was “perfectly non-criminal, normal conduct” that does not “even remotely approach[] a failure to be of good behavior.” We reject this argument.', 'There is no requirement that, for conduct to amount to a failure to keep the peace and remain of good behavior, it must be criminal in nature. See State v. Vieira, 883 A.2d 1146, 1148 (R.I. 2005) (“At a probation violation hearing, we faithfully have held that the state is not required to prove that a defendant has committed a crime; instead, the state must prove through reasonably satisfactory evidence that a defendant has failed to keep the peace or remain of good behavior.”); see also G.L. 1956 § 12-19-18(c) (recognizing “the ability of the court to revoke a suspended sentence or probationary period for an allegation of conduct that does not rise to the level of criminal conduct”); see, e.g., State v. Gautier, 774 A.2d 882, 887, 888 (R.I. 2001) (holding, in quashing entry of judgment finding that the defendant did not violate his probation, that “[t]he fact that [the] defendant was present during * * * a brutal slaying and that he had failed to notify the police after he fled the scene was enough to establish that his conduct on the day in question ‘had been lacking in the required good behavior expected and required by his probationary status’” (quoting State v. Godette, 751 A.2d 742, 745 (R.I. 2000))). 9', 'On June 21, 2016, this Court entered an order adopting an amendment to Rule 32(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure that changes the burden of proof at a probation violation hearing to “a fair preponderance of the evidence.” In re Amendments to Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure and Sentencing Benchmarks, at 1 (R.I., filed June 21, 2016) (mem.). This amendment has no bearing on this case.', '- 16 -', 'In this case, the hearing justice set forth two grounds to support his conclusion that defendant failed to keep the peace and remain of good behavior. First, he noted that defendant “promised to abide by certain conditions and he didn’t keep that promise.” Second, he found that defendant’s “actions * * * are sufficiently related to defendant’s prior sexual misconduct that * * * it is of serious concern to the [c]ourt as to * * * defendant’s ability to modify his sexual behavior so as not to be [a] danger to others, particularly children.” Viewing the totality of defendant’s conduct, we cannot say that the hearing justice acted arbitrarily and capriciously in finding that defendant failed to keep the peace and remain of good behavior.', 'For starters, defendant voluntarily agreed to abide by the Pennsylvania conditions in exchange for the benefit of remaining in Pennsylvania, and he persistently failed to uphold his end of the bargain.', 'In other words, defendant entered into a contract with Pennsylvania regarding the manner in which he would behave while residing in that state. In this respect, then, defendant’s agreement with Pennsylvania is not unlike the contract he signed with the DOC. The defendant agreed in the Rhode Island Conditions of Supervised Probation to obey several conditions that were not imposed by the trial court, including to “[r]emain within the State of Rhode Island, except with the * * * prior approval of [the] Probation Officer where you are seeking permission to leave the State of Rhode Island.” If a defendant leaves the state in violation of the contract that he or she signed with the DOC, that conduct is relevant in a probation violation hearing. See, e.g., State v. Murray, 22 A.3d 385, 386-87 (R.I. 2011) (mem.) (the defendant adjudged to be a probation violator where he left the state without permission); see also State v. Roberts, 59 A.3d 693, 695-96 (R.I. 2013) (state filed a probation violation report against the defendant based, in part, on his departure from the state without permission; the defendant admitted the violation).', 'Similarly, the hearing justice did not act arbitrarily or', '- 17 - capriciously in treating defendant’s breach of his contract with Pennsylvania as evidence that he failed to keep the peace and remain of good behavior.', 'Importantly, treating defendant’s breach of the Pennsylvania conditions as evidence of failure to keep the peace and remain of good behavior is not tantamount to making the Pennsylvania conditions part of the terms and conditions of the probationary sentence imposed by the trial justice. The violation of the Pennsylvania conditions is not itself a violation of defendant’s probation, but it is merely evidence of his failure to keep the peace and remain of good behavior. Cf. State v. Bellem, 56 A.3d 432, 435 (R.I. 2012) (affirming hearing justice’s conclusion that “the defendant failed to keep the peace and be of good behavior when he violated [two] no-contact orders [of which the hearing justice took judicial notice] by calling” the complaining witness). We by no means imply that every violation of an additional condition imposed by a receiving state will amount to a failure to keep the peace and remain of good behavior.', 'To the contrary, as we demonstrate in this opinion, each case will require an assessment of the particular conduct involved.', 'Additionally, defendant’s failure to comply with the condition relating to the use of dating and social-networking sites was persistent, willful, and alarming behavior by a convicted child molester. Starzynski testified that, before the violations of the Pennsylvania conditions that were the genesis of his return to Rhode Island, it was discovered that defendant used dating sites in violation of the relevant Pennsylvania condition. When Starzynski subsequently was assigned to his case, she reviewed the Pennsylvania conditions with defendant, and he stated that he understood the conditions and acknowledged that he was subject to them even before his meeting with Starzynski. And yet, despite being caught violating this condition on a prior occasion, defendant resumed the forbidden behavior and tried to obscure it by using a pseudonym. This', '- 18 - conduct reveals a persistent refusal to comply with the Pennsylvania conditions, to which defendant voluntarily agreed. Not only was his noncompliance repeated, the act of changing his username—ostensibly to avoid detection—indicates that defendant was acting with knowledge that he was violating this condition. Thus, defendant knowingly chose to engage in prohibited conduct and then sought to conceal his efforts. The testimony also reveals that defendant used several different dating sites the second time around. The defendant acted in brazen defiance of this agreed-upon behavioral condition.', 'Finally, contrary to another of the Pennsylvania conditions, defendant was in possession of a sizable stack of photographs of naked or scantily clad women in his bedroom closet. The defendant admitted that he used these photographs for masturbation. Significantly, sitting on the top of this stack was a photograph of a fully-clothed school-aged child. Given the numerous prior instances of first-degree child molestation for which defendant was on probation, the placement of a photograph of a minor child in a bedroom closet on top of the stack of images that defendant admittedly used for sexual gratification is highly suspicious and, indeed, disturbing behavior. Cf. State v. Pitts, 960 A.2d 240, 246 (R.I. 2008) (concluding that, even if the defendant’s conduct—“masturbating in his van near a school”—did not constitute the criminal offense of disorderly conduct, “there was sufficient evidence for the hearing justice to conclude that he had violated his probation by failing to keep the peace and remain [of] good behavior” because “the fact that [the defendant] was engaged in a sexual act in a vehicle on a public highway, at a time when he was on probation for prior sex offenses, constituted a violation of the terms of his probation[;] [e]specially in light of this defendant’s prior convictions', '- 19 - for child sexual molestation, his masturbating in his van near a school undoubtedly does not meet the test of good behavior”).10', 'For these reasons, we are satisfied that the hearing justice did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in finding that defendant failed to keep the peace and remain of good behavior.', 'Evidence from Receiving State', 'Before turning to defendant’s arguments concerning the hearing justice’s execution of a portion of his previously imposed sentence, we briefly pause to address the manner in which a hearing justice should proceed in a Compact case. The parties dispute the effect to be given to the waiver form signed by defendant in Pennsylvania in accordance with ICAOS Rule 5.108 (Rule', '5.108).', 'See', 'ICAOS', 'Rules,', 'Rule', '5.108(b)', 'at', '66', '(2016),', 'available', 'at http://www.interstatecompact.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=qGvYF9N1mNU%3d&tabid=358& portalid=0&mid=4264 (“No waiver of a probable[-]cause hearing shall be accepted unless accompanied by an admission by the offender to one or more significant violations of the terms or conditions of supervision.”). The defendant argues that the hearing justice erred in admitting and giving conclusive effect to the waiver form. The state counters that, once a waiver form is signed, it “constitutes ‘substantial evidence’ of the violation regardless of whether it is corroborated by independent evidence.” In this case, however, Starzynski appeared and testified, and her testimony and the other documentary evidence presented by the state provided a more than sufficient evidentiary basis to support the hearing justice’s adjudication of probation 10', 'At oral argument, defendant argued that the determination of what constitutes keeping the peace and remaining of good behavior needs to be the same for everyone, irrespective of the offenses of which a defendant stands convicted, or else the standard is unconstitutionally vague. This argument is not properly before us, however, because it was neither raised below nor argued in defendant’s brief to this Court. In any event, we note that, in State v. Pitts, 960 A.2d 240, 246 (R.I. 2008), this Court considered the offenses of which the defendant was convicted in assessing whether his conduct amounted to a failure to keep the peace and remain of good behavior.', '- 20 - violation.

Although a defendant in the probation violation context is not entitled to the full panoply of due process rights afforded to defendants in criminal proceedings, he or she is nonetheless entitled to “minimum due process protections: ‘notice of the hearing, notice of the claimed violation, the opportunity to be heard and present evidence [on the] defendant’s behalf, and the right to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against [the] defendant.’” State v. Bernard, 925 A.2d 936, 938 (R.I. 2007) (quoting State v. Vashey, 823 A.2d 1151, 1155 (R.I. 2003)). Of course, the right to confrontation is not absolute in a probation violation hearing; “hearsay may be admitted on issues central to determining whether a violation has been committed” so long as “the hearing justice first finds that ‘there is good cause for denying confrontation and/or cross-examination.’” Id. at 939 (quoting State v. DeRoche, 120', '- 21 - R.I. 523, 533, 389 A.2d 1229, 1234 (1978)).

(quoting State v. Casiano, 667 A.2d 1233, 1239 (R.I. 1995)).', 'These principles apply in Compact cases as well. For example, where a probable-cause hearing is held in the receiving state, see Rule 5.108(a) (“An offender subject to retaking for violation of conditions of supervision that may result in a revocation shall be afforded the opportunity for a probable[-]cause hearing before a neutral and detached hearing officer in or reasonably near the place where the alleged violation occurred.”),11 the offender is entitled to minimum due process protections, see Rule 5.108(d) (“The offender shall be entitled to the following rights at the probable[-]cause hearing: (1) Written notice of the alleged violation(s); (2) Disclosure of non-privileged or non-confidential evidence regarding the alleged violation(s); (3) The opportunity to be heard in person and to present witnesses and documentary evidence relevant to the alleged violation(s); (4) The opportunity to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses, unless the hearing officer determines that a risk of harm to a witness exists.”). Additionally, “[a]ny evidence or record generated during a probable[-]cause hearing shall be forwarded to the sending state.” Rule 5.108(e). In such cases, a hearing justice in this state has 11', 'Under the Compact, a probable-cause hearing is not required where the offender is convicted of a crime. See Rule 5.108(c) (“A copy of a judgment of conviction regarding the conviction of a new criminal offense by the offender shall be deemed conclusive proof that an offender may be retaken by a sending state without the need for further proceedings.”). Such a judgment of conviction would similarly be deemed conclusive proof of a probation violation in this jurisdiction. Cf. State v. Seamans, 935 A.2d 618, 623 (R.I. 2007) (“[B]ecause [the] defendant entered a nolo contendere plea to the very offense that [the] defendant is disputing in his probation violation appeal, his appeal is moot.

See Bernard, 925 A.2d at 939.12', 'The principles discussed in Bernard also apply in cases in which the offender waives the probable-cause hearing and admits to the violation. In cases where the validity of the waiver form is not challenged, the documentary evidence, including the violation reports and any other evidence compiled by the receiving state, is deemed sufficiently reliable, and a finding is made that requiring in-court testimony from the receiving-state actors is impractical or undesirable, the hearing justice is free to admit into evidence the record sent to this jurisdiction by the receiving state in accordance with the Compact. See Bernard, 925 A.2d at 939; cf. Sanders, 958 A.2d at 586 (“In this case, [the offender] signed the Waiver, which was entered into evidence without objection, listed the violations of the conditions of his parole, * * * and expressly stated: ‘I admit to violation of my release as stated above.’ * * * This admission alone constitutes substantial evidence for the [sending state] to make a finding that [the offender] violated his parole.”). In other circumstances, the hearing justice may decide that the offender is entitled to confront and cross-examine witnesses for a particular purpose.

We first tackle his challenge to the excessiveness of the executed portion of defendant’s suspended sentence. A trial justice is afforded substantial discretion in deciding whether “to execute all or a portion of a defendant’s previously suspended sentence after a finding of probation violation.” Roberts, 59 A.3d at 697. In recognition of this discretion, we will disturb that decision only where an abuse of discretion has occurred. Id. We discern no abuse of discretion in this case.', 'In explaining his rationale for executing eight years, the hearing justice first examined the gravity of the offenses of which defendant stands convicted and then considered the degree of similarity between those offenses and the conduct that formed the basis of the adjudication of probation violation. In this respect, the hearing justice ably followed our case law. See State v. McKinnon-Conneally, 101 A.3d 875, 879 (R.I. 2014) (“When a hearing justice is deciding how much of a previously suspended sentence to execute, his or her primary focus should be on the nature of the first offense. * * * The circumstances of the second offense, however, may also be taken into account.”).', 'The defendant complains that the hearing justice overstated the connection between his convictions and his conduct in Pennsylvania, but he overlooks the fact affidavits of the individuals who explained the waiver form and its consequences to the offender and in whose presence the waiver form was executed—a hearing justice certainly may deem witness testimony from the receiving-state officials unnecessary unless the offender first comes forward with evidence indicating that the waiver form is not valid. 14', 'These alternatives are merely examples of the options available to hearing justices who must perform this delicate balancing; we by no means foreclose the adoption of any other reasonable alternative in a particular case.', '- 24 - that he kept a photograph of a fully-clothed school-aged child on top of a stack of photographs that he admittedly used for purposes of masturbation—a highly troubling circumstance given defendant’s prior convictions for child molestation.', 'Finally, the hearing justice deemed defendant “a danger to the safety and well-being of the community.” In the circumstances of this case, we decline to second-guess this conclusion.', 'Additionally, although the eight-year incarcerative term ordered by the hearing justice was not insignificant, it represented only a fraction of the twenty-five years that remained on defendant’s suspended sentence. See § 12-19-9 (“Upon a determination that the defendant has violated the terms and conditions of his or her probation the court, in open court and in the presence of the defendant, may remove the suspension and order the defendant committed on the sentence previously imposed, or on a lesser sentence, or impose a sentence if one has not been previously imposed, or may continue the suspension of a sentence previously imposed, as to the court may seem just and proper.”). Therefore, even though defendant claims that he “had gone eight years without a single violation of parole or probation”—a claim that overlooks his prior violation of Pennsylvania’s social-networking condition—the hearing justice was not prevented from executing a portion (or, indeed, all) of his suspended sentence. See Vieira, 883 A.2d at 1149, 1150 (“[The] defendant’s assertion that he had been of good behavior from 1995 until he violated his probation in 2001 did not prevent the hearing justice from imposing the full sentence [of nine years and six months].”).', 'In short, the hearing justice appropriately considered the relevant conduct and stated plausible reasons for his decision on how much of the suspended sentence to execute; thus, he did not abuse his discretion in ordering defendant to serve eight years at the ACI.', '- 25 -', 'Finally, defendant challenges the hearing justice’s imposition of two additional conditions of probation.15', 'Although § 12-19-9 grants a hearing justice “‘considerable discretion’” in deciding how much, if any, of the suspended sentence to execute, “a probation- revocation justice has no discretion to fashion a sentence that is not allowed by law.” Roberts, 59 A.3d at 699 (quoting State v. Tucker, 747 A.2d 451, 454 (R.I. 2000)). It is well settled that, because', '“‘the intention of the justice who originally imposed the suspended', 'sentence[] is controlling and * * * the justice who finds a violation', 'of probationary status and executes the sentence is bound by the', 'initial determination[,]’ * * * a ‘trial justice at [a] violation hearing', '[does] not possess the statutory power to amend or decrease the', 'sentence as originally imposed and [is] bound by the terms of that', 'sentence.’” Id. (quoting State v. Heath, 659 A.2d 116, 116, 117', '(R.I. 1995)).', 'In State v. Taylor, 473 A.2d 290, 290 (R.I. 1984), the hearing justice executed the entirety of the defendant’s two previously suspended sentences; in addition, he “imposed an additional five-year period of probation to commence upon [the defendant’s] release.” We held that the hearing justice “plainly exceeded his statutory jurisdiction as explicitly defined in § 12- 19-9” because “[that] statute does not allow for the imposition of an additional probationary period after the execution of a suspended sentence by the revoking justice.” Taylor, 473 A.2d at 291. 15', 'The state contends that, because defendant failed to object to the imposition of these conditions below, he failed to preserve the issue for our review and that defendant’s arguments concerning these conditions should not be addressed until defendant files either a motion to correct an illegal sentence under Rule 35(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure or an application for postconviction relief. Although this argument is not without persuasive force, we decline to apply the raise-or-waive rule in the unique circumstances of this case. The hearing justice clearly lacked authority to impose any additional conditions, and, for that reason, we proceed to address this argument. However, we in no way retreat from our venerable raise- or-waive rule.', '- 26 -', 'So it is here. By its plain language, § 12-19-9 does not grant a probation violation hearing justice any authority to impose additional conditions not imposed by the trial justice who sentenced the defendant.16 Therefore, in imposing the two additional conditions, the hearing justice “plainly exceeded his statutory jurisdiction.” Taylor, 473 A.2d at 291. Accordingly, we vacate that portion of the judgment that purports to impose these conditions.', 'Conclusion', 'For these reasons, we affirm in part and vacate in part. We affirm the hearing justice’s adjudication of probation violation and his decision to execute eight years of the defendant’s twenty-five-year suspended sentence. We vacate the hearing justice’s imposition of two new conditions of probation.

On September 22, 2015, this Court granted the state’s petition for a writ of certiorari. Before us, the state argues that the Superior Court erred in vacating Tempest’s conviction on the basis of two Brady 1 violations founded on the state’s suppression of favorable evidence and a due process violation based on improper witness coaching by the Woonsocket Police Department.

When she entered through the back door of the house, she saw three-year-old Nicole Laferte (Nicole) crying, “saying her mother was downstairs sick.” LaDue disregarded Nicole’s behavior as simply a cry for attention because LaDue heard “some moving around downstairs[,]” so she went upstairs to wait for Heath to come home. Within a few minutes, she saw Heath pull into the driveway. Shortly thereafter, she heard Heath frantically call for her.', 'Heath testified that he arrived home approximately ten minutes after LaDue.

Heath asked Nicole what was wrong, and Nicole replied that her mother was downstairs “lying down.” Heath went down to the cellar, unprepared for the gruesome scene he was about to encounter—a body “basically sitting” between the washer and dryer, and a second body lying face down in a “puddle of blood.” Both bodies had been beaten beyond recognition.

Guarino testified that, while they were out one night having drinks in late 1982 or early 1983, Tempest confessed to killing Picard. Although Guarino testified that at the time he did not take Tempest’s confession “seriously,” he nevertheless went home and told Carrier what Tempest had said. Guarino further testified that, several weeks later, Tempest—who Guarino said appeared “very, very nervous”— came to his apartment and told him he “better keep [his] mouth shut and not say anything to anybody.” Tempest again told Guarino “that he did it” but that “they don’t have any proof that he did it.”', 'Carrier testified that she overheard this exchange between Guarino and Tempest.

The first was Ronald Vaz (Vaz), an acquaintance of Tempest, who had a long criminal record and who occasionally “snorted” cocaine with him. 5 Loretta Rivard, a prostitute with whom Tempest “part[ied]” one night in January 1988, also testified that Tempest took responsibility for the murder. To be sure, many of the state’s witnesses were not model citizens. Indeed, the trial justice said the following about them:', '“We didn’t have a parade of MDs or [s]umma [c]um [l]audes here.

Next, the state argues that the hearing justice erred in vacating Tempest’s conviction on the basis of the former prosecutor’s failure to disclose pretrial statements made by Carrier. Last, the state asserts that the hearing justice erred in determining that Tempest’s due process rights were violated as a result of improper police practices.

Carrier’s Pretrial Statements 10', 'Seventeen days before trial, Carrier provided the state’s former prosecutor with two novel statements: (1) that Tempest’s brother, Gordon Tempest (Gordon)—who was a detective with the Woonsocket Police Department at the time of the murder—hid the murder weapon (a pipe) in a closet on the first floor at 409 Providence Street in an effort to conceal it so as to protect his brother; and (2) that, on the day of the murder, Tempest’s children were “excited” about getting a puppy. 11 In response to receiving these statements from Carrier, the former prosecutor wrote in his notes: “more new info re: [Gordon Tempest] putting pipe in closet + dog for the kids—too late—don’t volunteer new info—will cause big problems.” Tempest argues that the former prosecutor deliberately failed to disclose this favorable evidence, and that such a deliberate nondisclosure automatically entitles him to a new trial.', '“In accordance with Brady, if a prosecutor has suppressed evidence that would be favorable to the accused and the evidence is material to guilt or punishment, the defendant’s due- process rights have been violated and a new trial must be granted.” DeCiantis v.

In our opinion, he covered all of the necessary bases in his analysis. First, he appropriately articulated our jurisprudence surrounding this issue. He even noted the former prosecutor’s purported reason for not offering the information to the defense: because he felt “it would lead to a continuance and to headaches.” The hearing justice then cited caselaw to support his contention that “[c]onstitutional rights cannot be tossed aside whenever they present the smallest inconvenience[,]” and concluded that the former prosecutor’s “‘considered decision to suppress’ [the statements] automatically necessitates relief.” (Quoting DeCiantis, 24 A.3d at 570.)', 'Furthermore, the former prosecutor’s own words—“don’t volunteer”—indicate a considered decision not to offer the new information to the defense. 12', 'While the hearing 12', 'The dissent accuses the majority of making improper factual determinations, especially as it pertains to the meaning and intent of the former prosecutor’s words “more new info re: [Gordon Tempest] putting pipe in closet + dog for the kids—too late—don’t volunteer new info—will cause big problems.” In doing so, the dissent makes its own factual determination that the former prosecutor was only referring to the fact that the new statements could be cause for a continuance, which was nothing more than the former prosecutor’s effort to avoid his prosecutorial dilemma. Furthermore, in finding that the former prosecutor deliberately failed to disclose the information, the hearing justice clearly rejected the former prosecutor’s proffered', '-8- justice’s analysis of this particular issue was admittedly brief—it spanned only two-and-one-half pages of a seventy-eight-page opinion—the length of the analysis is not a factor when determining the merits of his ruling. The hearing justice succinctly analyzed the issue, and we discern no clear error in his finding that the former prosecutor deliberately suppressed Carrier’s new statements. See Thornton, 68 A.3d at 539.', 'Moreover, it is our opinion that the “high value” of Carrier’s new statements to the defense could not have escaped the former prosecutor’s attention; thus, for this reason as well, his failure to disclose the statements constitutes a deliberate nondisclosure. See Wyche, 518 A.2d at 910 (“The prosecution acts deliberately when it makes ‘a considered decision to suppress * * * for the purpose of obstructing’ or where it fails ‘to disclose evidence whose high value to the defense could not have escaped * * * [its] attention.’” (emphasis added) quoting Keogh, 391 F.2d at 146-47).', 'Specifically, when Carrier made the statements in question, the former prosecutor was at least aware that there was an issue (albeit perhaps unresolved) with regard to Carrier’s assertion that Tempest lived in the same apartment complex as she and Guarino at the time of the murder. Three months prior to receiving the statements at issue, in December 1991, Pamela Miclette (Miclette), the Tempests’ babysitter, indicated that the Tempest family was living on Phoebe Street at the time of the murder, not on Winter Street where Carrier and Guarino lived. 13 At some point just before trial, the former prosecutor definitively found out that Carrier was in fact mistaken as to where Tempest lived at the time of the murder. Having realized that it was of high value to the defense because it seriously discredited much, if not all, of Carrier’s testimony about seeing Tempest on the day of the murder, the former prosecutor reason for failing to disclose the information. Such a factual finding is entitled to deference from this Court on appeal. See State v.

However, in doing so, he failed to also disclose Carrier’s new statements recorded in his March 10, 1992 note about Gordon and about the children being excited over the puppy on the morning of the murder.', 'The state argues that Carrier’s statement with regard to Gordon concealing the murder weapon was not new, but rather was cumulative of other statements Carrier made that had already been disclosed to the defense. This argument is not persuasive. At the outset, we note that the former prosecutor twice identified Carrier’s statements as “new.” The hearing justice also found that the statements were new, and we do not think he clearly erred in so determining. See Thornton, 68 A.3d at 539. Indeed, our own review of the evolution of Carrier’s statements leads us to this same conclusion.', 'From her initial statement to police in February 1987 through her testimony at trial, Carrier maintained that Tempest had said that Gordon was unaware of his involvement in Picard’s murder. Carrier first spoke to the police in February 1987, at which time she said that Tempest told her that Gordon knew nothing about his involvement in the murder and that, if Gordon did find out, he would turn Tempest in. She confirmed her statement during the grand jury hearing on November 30, 1990. While Carrier did indicate that Tempest told her that “everything ha[d] been taken care of[,]” she went on to say that Tempest told her that “my father is an important man” and that “it cost a lot of money for my father to make sure my name didn’t get brought up in this.” She also again confirmed that Tempest told her: “If my brother Gord[on] knew, he would turn me in.”', 'Similarly, at Tempest’s bail hearing in June 1991, in response to the former prosecutor’s question as to whether Tempest had ever said anything about “whether he expected to be prosecuted” for Picard’s murder, Carrier replied:', '-10-', '“[Tempest] said he didn’t think anything would come of it because his father was', 'the High Sherriff [sic] of Providence and his brother was the Detective on the', 'Woonsocket Police Force. He said if he told his brother Gord[on], Gord[on]', 'would go to the police and tell them what they knew, and that the murder weapon', 'was not there, it wasn’t available, and that all fingerprints were taken care of.”', '(Emphasis added.) Thus, Carrier still maintained that Tempest had told her that Gordon was not aware of his involvement in Picard’s murder.', 'Carrier’s witness statement on August 26, 1991, was a bit more vague, but it still did not specifically indicate that Gordon knew about Tempest’s involvement in the murder or that he participated in a cover-up. She stated that “[Tempest] said, ‘I won’t get caught, my father and brother won’t let me get caught. The weapon’s been all taken care of, he said.’” At trial, Carrier continued to maintain that Tempest said that “his brother didn’t know [about his involvement in Picard’s murder], but his father did” and that “[h]is father had paid off a large sum of money to make sure that [Tempest’s] name was never mentioned * * *.” She then testified that Tempest told her that “[t]he murder weapon would never be found [and that] it had been wiped clean of fingerprints and gotten rid of.”', 'Now turning to the statement in question, it is clear that Carrier dramatically changed her story both as it pertained to her understanding of Gordon’s knowledge of Tempest’s involvement in Picard’s murder as well as any involvement Gordon may have had in concealing the murder weapon. At Tempest’s postconviction-relief hearing, the former prosecutor testified that Carrier told him in March 1992—mere days before trial—that “Gordon Tempest had put the pipe in the closet” at 409 Providence Street, where it was ultimately found by police. We deem this a significant modification from Carrier’s previous statements and trial testimony, in which she stated not only that Tempest told her that Gordon was unaware of his involvement in Picard’s', '-11- murder, but which also seemed to indicate that it was Tempest’s father who helped him cover up his involvement in the crime.', 'The state pushes back and argues that Carrier’s statement regarding Gordon’s knowledge and involvement was not exculpatory, but rather was inculpatory, inasmuch as it lent itself to the theory that Tempest committed the murder and Gordon helped him cover it up. While the substance of Carrier’s statement regarding Gordon hiding the pipe may have been inculpatory, the statement nonetheless could have been used to impeach her credibility. The United States Supreme Court has unequivocally stated that “[i]mpeachment evidence * * * as well as exculpatory evidence, falls within the Brady rule,” United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 676 (1985), and that facially inculpatory evidence can be used to impeach a witness. See Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 282 n.21 (1999) (“We reject [the] respondent’s contention that these documents do not fall under Brady because they were ‘inculpatory.’ Our cases make clear that Brady’s disclosure requirements extend to materials that, whatever their other characteristics, may be used to impeach a witness.”). “Such evidence is ‘evidence favorable to an accused,’ * * * so that, if disclosed and used effectively, it may make the difference between conviction and acquittal.” Bagley, 473 U.S. at 676. Here, Carrier’s new statement about Gordon’s involvement in a cover-up, though perhaps inculpatory on its face, certainly could have been used by the defense to undermine her already shaky credibility.', 'Carrier’s statement with regard to Tempest’s children being excited about getting a puppy was also novel, and the state does little to belie this assertion. In her grand jury testimony, Carrier did mention that Tempest was “supposed to pick up a pitbull puppy from * * * either Doreen Picard or Sue Laferte” on the day of the murder. Yet, Carrier had never before offered that, on the morning of Picard’s murder, Tempest’s children were excited about getting a puppy.', '-12-', 'Her statement that Tempest’s children were excited about the prospect of getting a puppy on the morning of Picard’s murder also clearly had impeachment value. It had already been established that Carrier’s recollection was mistaken as to when Tempest and his family moved into the apartment complex where she and Guarino lived—the Tempests did not move into their apartment complex on Winter Street until 1983, the year after the murder—meaning that it was unlikely, if not altogether impossible, that Carrier could have seen Tempest’s children on Winter Street on the morning of the murder. Yet, mere days before trial, Carrier still continued to assert that she saw Tempest and his family on that day. Moreover, it was undisputed that John Allard, a friend of Tempest, was to be the recipient of the puppy in question. 14', 'Given that the evidence in the state’s case was nearly entirely circumstantial, “[t]he outcome * * * hinged on whom the jury believed[.]” State v. Haslam, 663 A.2d 902, 909 (R.I. 1995). Thus, had Carrier’s newly offered, inconsistent, and factually very dubious statements been disclosed to the defense, and had they been used effectively to further undermine Carrier’s already questionable credibility, they “may [have made] the difference between conviction and acquittal.” Bagley, 473 U.S. at 676.', 'Last, the state argues that the statements were not material. However, the materiality of the evidence is not germane when the prosecution’s failure to disclose the evidence is deemed to be deliberate. McManus, 941 A.2d at 230. Yet, even if a showing of materiality were required, Tempest could satisfy this burden. See DeCiantis, 24 A.3d at 571 (“[T]he applicant ‘bears the burden of establishing * * * that the nondisclosed evidence was material * * *.’” quoting Chalk, 816 A.2d at 419). 14', 'Notably, in his testimony at Tempest’s postconviction-relief hearing, in response to petitioner’s question asking whether he knew that the statements could be used to “cross[- examine] Carrier[,]” the former prosecutor admitted: “If you look at it that way, it was inculpatory—exculpatory.”', '-13-', '“Under the Bagley standard of materiality, ‘[t]he evidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.’” Lerner, 542 A.2d at 1091 (quoting Bagley, 473 U.S. at 682). To be clear, Tempest “need not show that he ‘more likely than not’ would have been acquitted had the new evidence been admitted.” Wearry v. Cain, 136 S. Ct. 1002, 1006 (2016) (quoting Smith v. Cain, 132 S. Ct. 627, 630 (2012)). Rather, “[a] ‘reasonable probability’ is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.” Lerner, 542 A.2d at 1091 (quoting Bagley, 473 U.S. at 682).', 'As we have already pointed out, the suppressed statements could have been used to impeach Carrier’s testimony even further. Carrier was one of four less-than-stellar witnesses (and arguably the most credible of the four) who testified that Tempest confessed to the murder. Had her testimony been further undermined, and her credibility perhaps crushed altogether, certainly there is, at the very least, a reasonable probability—one “sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome”—that the verdict against Tempest would have been different. See Wearry, 136 S. Ct. at 1006 (holding that “[b]eyond doubt, the newly revealed evidence suffices to undermine confidence in [the] conviction” when a witness’s credibility, “already impugned by his many inconsistent stories, would have been further diminished” by the revelation). Contrary to what the dissent suggests, whether the defense would have actually used the statements is not relevant to our analysis—the bottom line is that it should have been defense counsel’s choice to make.', 'B.

When the state exceeds those confines, it must suffer the consequences.', 'Tempest has met his burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that postconviction relief is warranted.

The materials associated with this case may be remanded to the Superior Court. 15', 'The dissent and concurrence admonish the majority for not taking the opportunity to provide “guidance” to the Superior Court regarding Tempest’s due process claim. However, doing so would be fruitless. First, if we were to decide Tempest’s due process claim on the basis of res judicata, such a determination would only be applicable to this particular postconviction relief action, and thus would have no effect on retrial. Further, were we to opine on the merits of the claim, our discussion would amount to nothing more than dicta.

Drug Enforcement Administration, 362 F.3d 786, 799 (C.A.D.C. 2004) (Roberts, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). In recognition of this “cardinal principle,” we decline to address the issue.', '-15-', 'Chief Justice Suttell, concurring in the result and dissenting in part. I concur with the majority’s holding that the Superior Court order vacating Tempest’s judgment of conviction should be affirmed, however, I depart from its reasoning. Rather, I agree with the conclusion of my dissenting colleague that the hearing justice failed to make the necessary findings of fact to support his ruling that the state made a deliberate decision not to disclose the statements of Donna Carrier.', 'It is my opinion that the hearing justice did not make a clear finding that the state’s failure to disclose statements made by Carrier was “deliberate” in line with Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), and its progeny, nor can such a finding be inferred. Although the hearing justice properly cited Lerner v. Moran, 542 A.2d 1089, 1092 (R.I. 1988), when he defined “deliberate [non-disclosure]” as “a considered decision to suppress[,]” he completely omitted the second half of that definition. “Deliberate,” in the Brady context and in Lerner, is defined as “a considered decision to suppress, taken for the very purpose of obstructing.” Id. (quoting United States v. Keogh, 391 F.2d 138, 146-47 (2nd Cir. 1968) (emphasis added). There was testimony from the former prosecutor at the postconviction-relief hearing that tended to negate the contention that his purpose was to obstruct and there was nothing in the hearing justice’s decision to support any inference that he discredited the former prosecutor’s testimony in this respect. To the contrary, as the majority points out, the hearing justice “even noted the former prosecutor’s purported reason for not offering the information to the defense: because he felt ‘it would lead to a continuance and to headaches.’” Lacking credibility determinations, therefore, the hearing justice’s decision does not adequately support the proposition that the former prosecutor’s failure to disclose the Carrier statements was “a considered decision to suppress,', '-16- taken for the very purpose of obstructing,” or that the high value of the statements to the defense “could not have escaped the [state’s] attention.” 1 Lerner, 542 A.2d at 1092 (quoting Keogh, 391 F.2d at 146-47) (emphasis added); see DeCiantis v. State, 24 A.3d 557, 572 (R.I. 2011) (“we are satisfied that we can infer from the hearing justice’s credibility determination that he did not find any deliberate nondisclosure on the part of the prosecution”). The equivocal nature of the former prosecutor’s testimony in this regard is emphasized in the hearing justice’s conclusion that “[b]y deciding not to disclose the newly arisen variations in [Carrier’s] story, [the former prosecutor] evidently sought to protect * * * [her] from additional impeachment.”', 'Accordingly, in my opinion, the majority at the very least should remand with instructions for the hearing justice to apply the proper standard and make credibility findings as it relates to the former prosecutor’s testimony. 2 See Butterfly Realty v. James Romanella & Sons, Inc., 45 A.3d 584, 591 (R.I. 2012) (case remanded for factual findings due to inconsistencies within the Superior Court decision). I do not advocate for such a remand, however, as I concur with the majority’s holding affirming the hearing justice’s decision to set aside Tempest’s conviction. I do so in reliance on the hearing justice’s ruling that the state’s failure to disclose certain evidence relating to the “maroon car” constituted a Brady violation. 3 1', 'A “suppression” is also “deliberate” when there is “a failure to disclose evidence whose high value to the defense could not have escaped the prosecutor’s attention.” Lerner v.

However, because the hearing justice did not consider this second definition provided in Lerner when discussing the statements of Donna Carrier—by completely failing to articulate it in his written decision and by failing to make findings relative thereto—it is my opinion that neither should this Court. 2', 'In my judgment the dissenting opinion suffers from the same malady as the majority by making credibility determinations. 3', 'I am also of the opinion that this Court should address the issue of improper police procedures and hold that the hearing justice erred in granting postconviction relief based upon this ground.', '- 17 -', 'I', 'Facts and Travel Relating to the Maroon Car', 'I begin by summarizing the facts relating to the maroon car Brady claim. John McMann owned a maroon Buick at the time of the February 19, 1982 murder. The maroon car was registered at that time to Lee’s Pharmacy, a store of which John McMann was part-owner. In 1983, John McMann sold the maroon car to Robert Monteiro. At the time of the sale, Lee’s Pharmacy purchased a blue Buick to replace the maroon Buick that Monteiro had purchased.', 'At Tempest’s criminal trial, the state presented a witness, Lisa LaDue, who resided in the second-floor apartment of 409 Providence Street. LaDue testified that on the day of the murder she observed a maroon car parked in the driveway of 409 Providence Street when she arrived home at approximately 3:20 p.m. 4', 'She also testified that upon entering the triple-decker apartment, she had “heard some moving around downstairs,” but that she had proceeded up the stairs to her apartment. Moreover, LaDue’s stepfather, Douglas Heath, testified that there was no vehicle in the driveway of 409 Providence Street when he arrived around 3:30 p.m. that day.', 'Significantly, Sherri Richards, Tempest’s sister-in-law, testified at trial that she observed Tempest between 4:30 and 4:45 p.m. in front of her house on the day of the murder standing next to the maroon car with Monteiro. She testified that Monteiro “used to borrow” the car from Kevin McMann and that “[h]e would later on purchase the car but not at that time.” 5 This portion of Richards’ testimony—that Monteiro borrowed the car from Kevin McMann—went 4', 'On cross-examination, LaDue testified that the first time she ever told anybody that she had seen a maroon car was “a couple of weeks” before the commencement of trial, more than ten years after the murder.

However, prior to trial, Richards gave a witness statement where she stated: “I know the car I saw [Monteiro] in was the one that [Monteiro] bought from Lee’s and that I had seen him driving around in that car several times at that time and that is why I thought he already owned it.”', '- 18 - uncontested at trial. The defense sought to impeach the witnesses who linked Tempest to “Monteiro’s” maroon car on the day of the murder by presenting Martin Leyden, an employee of the Rhode Island Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV), who testified that Monteiro did not yet own the maroon vehicle at the time of the murder and that neither Monteiro nor his wife had any vehicle registered in their names until 1983. Additionally, the state presented Ronald Vaz, who testified that Tempest had confessed to fleeing the crime scene in “Monteiro’s car.”', 'In 2000 or 2001, a private investigator hired to work on Tempest’s case discovered a hand-written letter from John McMann in defense counsel’s case file.

Cinotti met with John McMann’s adult children, Kevin McMann and Sharon McMann- Morelli. Kevin McMann provided an affidavit to the investigator attesting that “[p]rior to the sale in 1983, [John McMann] never lent his car to * * * Monteiro, nor did [Kevin McMann] ever lend [his] father’s car, or any other car, to * * * Monteiro.” At the postconviction-relief hearing, McMann-Morelli testified that she never observed John or Kevin McMann lend the maroon Buick to Monteiro at any time before Monteiro purchased it in 1983. McMann-Morelli testified that her father, John McMann, had told her that he had gone to the Woonsocket Police', '- 19 - Department to inform the police that he had never lent the maroon car to anyone. John McMann had done so at some point during the trial after reading in the newspaper that his car had been referenced in testimony. Kevin McMann also testified that he had never lent the maroon car to anyone and that he had also gone to the Woonsocket Police Department during Tempest’s trial with this information.', 'In his amended application for postconviction relief, Tempest claimed that his due process rights were violated by the state’s failure to disclose to the defense that John McMann and Kevin McMann had informed the Woonsocket Police Department that neither had ever lent the maroon Buick to Monteiro. Tempest claimed that this failure to disclose constituted a constitutional due process violation because the McManns’ statements were exculpatory evidence that the defense could have used to impeach Richards’ trial testimony that Monteiro would borrow the maroon car from Kevin McMann. Tempest argued that the evidence was also material as the maroon car was “the only thing” that tied Tempest to the crime scene during the time of the murder.', 'In response, the state raised the affirmative defense of laches, claiming that Tempest failed to timely pursue postconviction relief. Alternatively, the state maintained that there was no Brady violation because there was no direct evidence that the conversation between the McManns and the Woonsocket Police Department ever occurred. The hearing justice disagreed. He found that the state had failed to establish the affirmative defense of laches because Tempest’s delay in seeking postconviction relief was “reasonable—not ‘inexcusable’ or ‘unexplained,’” and the hearing justice also found that a Brady violation had in fact occurred. 6 6', 'More specific findings made by the hearing justice are discussed as they become pertinent to my analysis of the Brady claim.', '- 20 - Accordingly, as noted by the majority, the hearing justice entered an order vacating Tempest’s conviction relying in part on the maroon car Brady violation.', 'On appeal, the state’s argument that the hearing justice erred in vacating Tempest’s conviction based on the maroon car Brady claim is two-fold. First, the state argues that the doctrine of laches should have prevented Tempest from litigating the maroon car Brady claim altogether because his delay in seeking postconviction relief was unreasonable and prejudicial to the state. Second, the state argues that, even if the laches defense does not apply, any evidence that the McManns did not lend the maroon car to Monteiro was not “material” pursuant to Brady. I address these arguments separately herein.', 'II', 'Laches', 'To establish a laches defense, “the state has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that [(1)] the applicant [was] unreasonably delayed in seeking relief and [(2)] that the state is prejudiced by the delay.” Raso v. Wall, 884 A.2d 391, 395, 396 (R.I. 2005). These issues are questions of fact dependent on the circumstances of a particular case, id. at 396, and a reviewing court has discretion to weigh the equitable laches defense. Hazard v. East Hills, Inc., 45 A.3d 1262, 1270 (R.I. 2012). It is well settled that “time lapse alone does not constitute laches.” Rodriques v. Santos, 466 A.2d 306, 311 (R.I. 1983). Because “the application of the defense of laches is generally committed to the discretion of the trial justice,” School Committee of Cranston v. Bergin-Andrews, 984 A.2d 629, 644 (R.I. 2009) (quoting O’Reilly v. Town of Glocester, 621 A.2d 697, 703 (R.I. 1993)), this Court “will not reverse the trial justice’s decision on what constitutes laches on appeal ‘unless it is clearly wrong.’” Id. (quoting Arcand v. Haley, 95 R.I. 357, 364, 187 A.2d 142, 146 (1963)).', '- 21 -', 'A', 'Reasonableness of the Delay', 'Beginning with the first prong of the laches defense, the hearing justice found that the state had failed to prove that Tempest’s delay in seeking postconviction relief was unreasonable. Given the “myriad issues developed as potential claims * * * as well as the scope and complexity of the case as a whole,” the hearing justice determined that “the most balanced and equitable approach” to determining whether the laches defense applied was “to examine * * * Tempest’s general course of conduct over the past twenty years.” Although not bearing the burden of proof, 7 Tempest presented evidence at the postconviction-relief hearing to establish that his delay in pursuing postconviction relief was reasonable, including his own testimony and that of Martin Yant, Evelyn G. Munschy, Betty Anne Waters, Esq., and Gretchen Bennett, as well as an affidavit from Michael Kendall, Esq., a partner at McDermott Will & Emery. Based on the evidence presented at the postconviction-relief hearing, the hearing justice made extensive findings of fact concerning Tempest’s conduct throughout the twenty years between his criminal conviction and the latest amendment to his application for postconviction relief. 8', 'The hearing justice found that, following Tempest’s conviction, Tempest lacked the funds to hire a postconviction-relief attorney. He found that, as a result, Tempest wrote several letters to James McCloskey, a minister who directed an innocence project in New Jersey, seeking his assistance.

See State v.

Furthermore, the hearing justice found that Munschy and Tempest’s sister, Barbara Small, had each spent substantial sums of their personal money to hire a private investigator, Martin Yant, to investigate Tempest’s case beginning in 2000. The hearing justice found that Yant worked extensively on the case, billing over two hundred hours, but that the investigation ceased eighteen months later when Munschy could no longer afford to pay for Yant’s services. 9', 'Moreover, he found that Munschy wrote to Attorney Waters in 2001 and to the NEIP repeatedly from 2001 to 2004 seeking representation for Tempest. He found that Attorney Waters was volunteering at the NEIP when the NEIP agreed to review Tempest’s case and that Attorney Waters did “the ground work looking for evidence, talking to people in Rhode Island [while the NEIP] w[as] in charge of all the paperwork” and filings. He further found that Attorney Waters filed a petition for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing on behalf of Tempest in 2004 and that the last DNA result came in 2015 and “form[ed] the body of a core claim within [Tempest’s] petition—newly discovered evidence.” Additionally, the hearing justice found that 2009 was the first time “the NEIP expanded its case review to include evaluation of non-DNA postconviction issues.”', 'Furthermore, the hearing justice found that the “substantial costs and attorney hours expended by McDermott Will & Emery as well as the NEIP demonstrate[d] the expanse of 9', 'The hearing justice also found that, although Yant was no longer officially working on Tempest’s case, Munschy stayed in contact with Yant and he would assist when possible.', '- 23 - resources necessary to properly delve into such an investigation.” 10 He found that the state had contributed to the delay in Tempest’s application by seeking continuances and objecting to Tempest’s request for DNA testing, and that the state had failed to present any evidence that, had Tempest previously sought a public defender to file his postconviction-relief application, the Office of the Public Defender would have been able to litigate these claims faster than Tempest’s attorneys at McDermott Will & Emery and at the NEIP. Only “[a]fter consideration of the testimony and exhibits outlining the efforts of * * * Tempest to develop a comprehensive, multi- claim postconviction[-]relief petition,” did the hearing justice find that “Tempest’s delay was not unreasonable, and, as a result, [that] the [s]tate’s defense of laches fail[ed].” The hearing justice considered the “overriding interests of justice” and concluded that the state had failed to show that it would be inequitable to allow Tempest to enforce his legal rights, especially in light of Tempest’s allegations that the state had “manipulate[d] witness statements and physical evidence” in his criminal case.', 'All of the findings of fact made by the hearing justice are clearly supported by the evidence presented at the postconviction-relief hearing. 11 Notably, the state does not challenge any of these findings—put differently, there is no allegation that any of the specific findings of Tempest’s conduct are clearly erroneous or not supported by the record. Instead, the state argues that the trial justice’s ultimate denial of its laches defense was erroneous because Tempest’s delay was unreasonable as he had been on notice since 1992 that McMann could not have lent 10', 'An affidavit was submitted by Attorney Kendall outlining the work performed by his firm in Tempest’s case. He attested that McDermott Will & Emery, LLP, worked on a pro bono basis alongside the NEIP beginning in 2012. He estimated that roughly 6,000 hours were spent working on this case. 11', 'I agree, however, with the dissent that the state’s failure to present evidence that Tempest sought the assistance of the Office of the Public Defender or appointed counsel was an inappropriate consideration in a laches analysis. If Tempest were financially eligible, he would have been entitled to such representation.', '- 24 - Monteiro the maroon car. The state argues that Tempest “took absolutely no legal or other action with respect to uncovering [this claim] and bringing it as a basis for post[]conviction relief.” The state’s argument fails in my opinion for several reasons.', 'First, the state’s position ignores the lens through which the hearing justice considered the laches issues—he examined Tempest’s overall conduct and did not undertake a claim-by- claim laches analysis. Although the state suggests in a footnote that the hearing justice’s laches determination should have parsed out the complex claims from the “uncomplicated” claims such as the maroon car Brady claim, the hearing justice was in the best position to determine how to address the laches defense based on the circumstances of this particular case, and I see no error in his approach. Indeed, his method in addressing the laches defense was especially appropriate given that the state had originally sought to invoke the laches defense against all the claims in Tempest’s application for postconviction relief.', 'Nevertheless, even when reviewing the proposed laches defense specifically as it relates to the maroon car Brady claim, there is ample evidence in the record before this Court and findings made by the hearing justice to support his denial of such defense. There was testimony at the postconviction-relief hearing that Tempest became aware of the McManns’ statements to the Woonsocket Police Department regarding the maroon car in late 2013 when his private investigator approached Kevin McMann. At that time, Kevin McMann signed an affidavit attesting that neither he nor his father had ever lent the maroon car to Monteiro, and that they communicated this to the Woonsocket Police Department. Moreover, Kevin McMann testified at the postconviction-relief hearing that he never discussed what he disclosed to the police (regarding the maroon car) with Tempest or with any attorneys or investigators prior to meeting with Tempest’s investigator in 2013.', '- 25 -', 'The evidence the state relies on and claims was available to Tempest prior to this 2013 interview with Kevin McMann and McMann-Morelli is unavailing. The handwritten letter from John McMann contained in defense counsel’s file, which the state relies on for its assertion that Tempest was on notice, could, at best, have informed Tempest that John McMann would not have sold his vehicle to Monteiro and been “without a car” prior to 1983. This letter does not, however, indicate, let alone set forth, that neither John McMann nor Kevin McMann ever lent the maroon car to Monteiro in 1982. The letter also made no indication that John McMann or Kevin McMann actually had gone to the Woonsocket Police Department with this information. Accordingly, when this letter was discovered in Tempest’s file in 2001, it could not have placed Tempest on notice of a possible Brady claim.', 'Additionally, there was evidence before the hearing justice that Tempest has always maintained his innocence and that he, with the assistance of family and friends, has always actively sought some form of postconviction relief.', 'Munschy testified that she and Small initially hired a private investigator in 2000 because they both felt that they needed to uncover more material to present to an attorney. Bennett, a volunteer at the NEIP, testified, and the hearing justice found her testimony credible, that cases of this magnitude can take many years to properly litigate postconviction-relief issues.', 'Moreover, Rhode Island law, as codified in G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-8, provides that:', '“All grounds for relief available to an applicant at the time he or', 'she commences a proceeding under this chapter must be raised in', 'his or her original, or a supplemental or amended, application.', 'Any ground finally adjudicated or not so raised, or knowingly,', 'voluntarily and intelligently waived in the proceeding that resulted', 'in the conviction or sentence or in any other proceeding the', 'applicant has taken to secure relief, may not be the basis for a', 'subsequent application, unless the court finds that in the interest of', 'justice the applicant should be permitted to assert such a ground', 'for relief.”', '- 26 - Therefore, it is my opinion that the hearing justice was not clearly wrong in finding that Tempest’s delay was not unreasonable where there is ample evidence to support a finding that Tempest actively sought additional grounds for relief and that a premature filing of a postconviction-relief application could have barred future claims. See Ramirez v. State, 933 A.2d 1110, 1112 (R.I. 2007) (the defendant was precluded from raising new issues in his third application for postconviction relief, where § 10-9.1-8 requires that all grounds for relief be raised in the initial postconviction-relief application, and the defendant failed to establish a reason why his claims could not have been raised in his first application).', 'In my opinion, the hearing justice’s findings as they relate to the reasonableness of Tempest’s delay were all supported by the evidence presented at the postconviction-relief hearing. His ultimate conclusion that “the twenty-year period associated with the pursuit of this petition for postconviction relief was * * * reasonable—not ‘inexcusable’ nor ‘unexplained’” was also supported by the record, well within his discretion, and not otherwise clearly wrong.', 'B', 'Prejudice to the State', 'The state also argues that the hearing justice erred in finding that it was not prejudiced by Tempest’s delay. Notably, however, the laches defense is a two-prong analysis necessitating that the hearing justice find both that the applicant’s delay was unreasonable and that the state was prejudiced by the delay. Raso, 884 A.2d at 395. Because, as previously noted, there is ample evidence to support the hearing justice’s finding that Tempest’s delay was not unreasonable— and consequently that the state failed to meet the first prong of the laches defense—a discussion of the second prong is not necessary.', '- 27 -', 'It is my opinion that the hearing justice’s thorough analysis of the laches defense does not warrant a reversal. As this Court has previously noted, “‘[t]he standard of abuse of discretion is one that gives extreme deference to the [hearing] justice’s determination’” and “we may uphold a [hearing] justice’s ruling even if we would have ruled differently had we been in the [hearing] justice’s position.” State v. Gillespie, 960 A.2d 969, 980 (R.I. 2008) (quoting State v. Remy, 910 A.2d 793, 797 (R.I. 2006)). Accordingly, it was within the hearing justice’s discretion to weigh the evidence presented by both the state and Tempest, and to reach the outcome that he did; I discern no clear error in his conclusion that the state failed to prove the requisite elements of the laches defense.', 'Finally, I note that Tempest was convicted of murder in the second degree and sentenced to eighty-five years in prison. After rejecting the state’s defense of laches, the hearing justice presided over a postconviction-relief hearing that spanned twenty-four days, and he then determined, in a thoughtful and conscientious decision, that Tempest’s due process rights were violated and that Tempest was denied a fair trial. A fundamental principle animating our criminal justice system was articulated by Sir William Blackstone in his seminal work, Commentaries on the Laws of England: “[I]t is better that ten guilty persons escape, than that one innocent suffer.” 4 William Blackstone, Commentaries *352. In the circumstances of this case, I believe it to be in the interest of justice that the issues raised on appeal, which were fully vetted in the Superior Court, be decided on their merits.', 'III', 'Brady Claim', 'The state argues that, even if the laches defense does not bar Tempest’s application for postconviction relief, his Brady claim relating to the maroon car should fail because any evidence, if indeed withheld from the defense, was not material pursuant to Brady and was', '- 28 - discoverable with the exercise of due diligence. Specifically, the state argues that Tempest could have discovered that the McManns would not have lent the maroon vehicle to Monteiro prior to trial, and that, accordingly, this evidence was not Brady material. The state also argues that while Kevin McMann’s testimony, as credited by the hearing justice, contradicted Richards’ testimony that Monteiro borrowed the maroon car in 1982, that did not mean that Richards did not see Tempest standing beside a maroon car (although not necessarily John McMann’s maroon car). The state further suggests that, because there was already trial testimony from the DMV employee that Monteiro did not own any vehicle at the time of the murder, thus contradicting Richards’ account of seeing Tempest next to “Monteiro’s” maroon car on the day of the murder, this new evidence—that the McManns would not have lent the car to Monteiro in 1982—does not create a probability that the result of Tempest’s trial would have been different had this statement been available to the defense.', 'The state violates a defendant’s due process rights under Brady when it suppresses evidence favorable to the accused that is “material either to guilt or to punishment.” Brady, 373 U.S. at 87. “[W]here a nondisclosure is not deliberate, [an] applicant [is] required to make a showing of materiality * * *.” DeCiantis, 24 A.3d at 571. Evidence is “material” for purposes of Brady when a “reasonable probability” exists that “the result of the proceeding would have been different” if the suppressed evidence had been disclosed. Lerner, 542 A.2d at 1092 (quoting United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682 (1985)). Reasonable probability does not require that “the defendant ‘would more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence,’ only that the likelihood of a different result is great enough to ‘undermine[] confidence in the outcome of the trial.’” Smith v. Cain, 132 S.Ct. 627, 630 (2012) (quoting Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 434 (1995)). “Impeachment evidence * * * as well as exculpatory evidence, falls', '- 29 - within the Brady rule.” Bagley, 473 U.S. at 676.

Following Banks, several courts have expressly declined to adopt a due diligence requirement. See Amado v. Gonzalez, 758 F.3d 1119, 1137 (9th Cir. 2014); United States v.

Even with John McMann’s handwritten letter in Tempest’s file stating that he would not have been without a car prior to selling, there is no indication from the evidence presented at the postconviction-relief hearing that Tempest also knew that the McManns would not have lent the maroon car to Monteiro in 1992, as the state suggests.', 'This evidence, if properly disclosed to the defense, would have directly contradicted Richards’ trial testimony that Monteiro “used to borrow” the maroon car.

The 1982 brutal murder of Doreen Picard (Picard)—not unlike the attempted murder of Martha “Sunny” von Bulow, see State v. von Bulow, 475 A.2d 995 (R.I. 1984)—ranks as one of the most infamous crimes committed in this state during the last century. The fact that no arrest was made for several years was a festering sore in the community, compounded by a cover-up by sworn police officers. The majority affirms the hearing justice’s grant of postconviction relief—which vacates a twenty-four-year-old conviction for this murder—solely on the basis of the prosecution’s deliberate nondisclosure of two statements (the Carrier statements) of Donna Carrier (Carrier), one of four trial witnesses to whom Raymond Tempest Jr. (Tempest) confessed.', 'In his seventy-eight-page decision, the hearing justice devoted a grand total of two-and-a-half pages to this issue, including the factual background, the governing legal standard, and his analysis relating to this evidence.

Moreover, I am of the opinion that the majority, in reaching a contrary conclusion, improperly supplements the inadequate factual findings of the hearing justice with findings of its own in order to reach a result that is not supported by our jurisprudence and is a marked departure from well-settled law. It is not the business of this Court to make factual findings in a nonjury case. Therefore, I respectfully dissent. I would vacate the hearing justice’s grant of postconviction relief because (1) the nondisclosure of the Carrier statements was not a deliberate nondisclosure and the Carrier statements are not material; (2) Tempest’s Brady claim 1 with respect to the McMann evidence 2 not only is barred by the doctrine of laches, but it also is without merit under Brady; and (3) Tempest’s witness-coaching claim is barred by res judicata, and, additionally, the hearing justice’s inventive standard for judging this claim is erroneous and has no basis under this nation’s constitutional framework.

Tempest intended to give the puppy to John Allard (Allard). On that fateful afternoon, Sherri Richards (Richards)4 saw Tempest leave her apartment between 1:20 and 1:30 p.m. with Allard to pick out the puppy, return alone between 2 and 2:30 p.m., depart once more soon thereafter, and return once again between 4:30 and 4:45 p.m. When Tempest returned the second time, Richards noticed that he had changed his boots and was sporting a new bite mark or scratch on his wrist. Meanwhile, at 409 Providence Street, the severely beaten bodies of Picard and Laferte were discovered in the basement at approximately 3:30 p.m. Picard was pronounced dead at the scene at 4:30 p.m. Laferte was grievously injured. There were no eyewitnesses to this crime. 5', 'For several years, the homicide remained unsolved, which was unsurprising in light of the ongoing cover-up that was perpetrated by members of the Woonsocket Police Department, including Tempest’s brother, Det.

In this statement, Carrier stated that, at the time of the murder in 1982, she and her then-boyfriend, John Guarino (Guarino), lived on the third floor at 448 Winter Street in Woonsocket and that Tempest and his family lived at the same address on the floor below. As it turns out, however, Tempest and his family did not move to that address until 1983. But Carrier explained in her February 1987 statement that, in March 1982, Tempest confessed to the murder 4', 'Both the trial transcript and our opinion affirming Tempest’s conviction, State v. Tempest, 651 A.2d 1198, 1204 (R.I. 1995), list Richards’ first name as “Sherri.” However, her November 1991 police statement and her death certificate list it as “Sheri.” 5', 'Laferte’s daughter Nicole—who was three years old on the day of the murder—remembered a man arriving at her house that day; the man either proceeded into the basement at a time when Laferte was also in the basement or Laferte and the man went to the basement together, and Nicole heard her mother yell and a dog bark, followed by a “boom boom” noise and “a[ ]lot of banging in the cell[a]r.” Nicole was unable to identify this man, however.

Carrier first reviewed her February 1987 statement before the grand jurors. She also testified that, although she knew Tempest before the two became neighbors, she did not know Tempest’s then-wife, Jane Tempest (Jane), until after the Tempests moved into the Winter Street building.', 'Additionally, she testified, in detail, about certain observations she made of Tempest on the day of the murder:', '“A:', 'Johnny Allard was with [Tempest] that afternoon that they', 'came home, they were supposed to pick up a pit[ ]bull', 'puppy from um, either Doreen Picard or Sue La[f]erte, one', 'or the other, because they had had a pit[ ]bull dog that', 'mated with their dog and they were going to get the pick of', 'the litter.

Carrier’s testimony was consistent with the information she relayed in her February 1987 statement. At that hearing, Carrier was cross-examined by one of Tempest’s attorneys, William C. Dimitri (co-counsel). 6', 'In August 1991, Carrier gave another statement to police. Although this statement was generally consistent with Carrier’s February 1987 statement regarding the specifics of Tempest’s confession to her and Guarino in Carrier’s apartment, it diverged somewhat from the earlier 6', 'At trial, Tempest was represented by the late William A. Dimitri Jr. and his son, William C. Dimitri. To distinguish between the similarly named members of the defense team, I shall refer to the elder Dimitri as “defense counsel” and to his son as “co-counsel.”', '- 39 - statement with respect to Tempest’s explanation about the cover-up efforts of his father and brother. In the August 1991 statement, Carrier stated:', '“[Tempest] used to say [that] nothing would happen to him', 'because of who his father and brother were. At the beginning of', 'the conversation, he said, ‘[M]y father and brother don’t know', 'anything about this.’ Then in the course of the conversation,', '[Guarino] was asking questions, ‘What happens if you get caught?’', '[Tempest] said, ‘I won’t get caught[;] my father and brother won’t', 'let me get caught.’ ‘The weapon’s been all taken care of,’ he', 'said.” (Emphases added.) Thus, unlike Carrier’s February 1987 statement—which disclosed that Tempest stated that “[i]f my brother Gordie knew he would turn me in”—Carrier’s August 1991 disclosure implicated Gordon by stating that he would not let Tempest get caught and that the weapon had been taken care of. This statement clearly implied that Gordon was involved in cover-up activity. Like Carrier’s February 1987 statement, Tempest was in possession of this statement at the time of his trial.', 'On March 10, 1992, the lead prosecutor in Tempest’s criminal case (the former prosecutor), a well-respected member of the bar, learned of the Carrier statements. 7 The Carrier statements, which are reflected in the former prosecutor’s handwritten notes from that date, conveyed two discrete pieces of information. First, the former prosecutor’s handwritten notes from this date reveal that, according to Carrier, Tempest’s children were excited on the day of the murder because they were getting a puppy. Second, the former prosecutor’s notes also 7', 'At the postconviction-relief hearing, the former prosecutor could not remember whether he received this information directly from Carrier or through Sgt.

The notes contain the following notation:', '“More new [i]nfo re: GT [Gordon Tempest] putting pipe in closet', '+ dog for the kids – too late – don’t volunteer new info – will', 'cause big problems[.]” The former prosecutor did not disclose the Carrier statements to the defense. The reasons for his decision not to do so lie at the heart of this case.', 'The fact that Carrier was mistaken about the date that the Tempests became her neighbors at 448 Winter Street is clear.', 'Precisely when the former prosecutor learned about this discrepancy is not as clear, but it cannot be denied that defense counsel was aware of Carrier’s mistake before trial and that the former prosecutor nonetheless called her as a witness knowing full well that she would be severely impeached by the defense. Long before Carrier gave her police statement in 1987, the police were in possession of statements that Tempest gave shortly after the murder in 1982; in these statements, Tempest indicated that he lived at 42 Phoebe Street in Woonsocket. Additionally, the former prosecutor was aware in late December 1991 that Pamela Miclette told police earlier that month that she babysat Tempest’s children on the day of the murder and that the Tempests were living on Phoebe Street at that time. However, the former prosecutor testified at the postconviction-relief (PCR) hearing that, when Carrier made these disclosures, he was not certain whether he knew that she was mistaken about when the Tempests became her neighbors. In any event, it is evident that, by the start of trial on March 27, 1992—seventeen days after the former prosecutor received the Carrier statements—he knew that Carrier was mistaken in her earlier assertion that she and the Tempests lived in the same building', '- 41 - on the day of the murder. The defense, of course, was well aware of Carrier’s mistake before trial.', 'At trial, Carrier testified as a witness for the prosecution. Her testimony on direct examination was brief, spanning only thirteen pages of transcript. She recounted the details of Tempest’s confession to her and Guarino that occurred in her apartment at 448 Winter Street. Consistent with the details she provided in her February 1987 statement, Carrier gave the following testimony about Tempest’s explanation of cover-up efforts during his confession:', '“[Guarino] asked [Tempest] if his father and brother knew about', 'this. He said his brother didn’t know but his father did. His father', 'had paid off a large sum of money to make sure that [Tempest]’s', 'name was never mentioned about this. The murder weapon would', 'never be found[;] it had been wiped clean of fingerprints and', 'gotten rid of.”', 'For the first time, however, Carrier indicated that Tempest’s confession at 448 Winter Street occurred in 1983—not March 1982 as she had previously maintained. When asked why she recalled that the confession occurred in 1983, Carrier responded:', '“My ex-landlord, his mother is a resident at the facility that I work', 'at. When I saw Mr. Leroux, all of the neighbors had started', 'coming back to me and I realized that after one family moved', 'out[,] another family moved in. And when this other family', 'moved out[, Tempest] and Jane moved in and that was in 1983.” During her direct examination, Carrier did not mention her claimed day-of-the-murder observations that she related to the grand jury.', 'To no one’s surprise, Carrier was subjected to a scathing cross-examination at the hands of defense counsel. Defense counsel probed in depth whether Carrier had truly coincidentally realized her mistake about the date on which she heard Tempest confess or whether her memory had been corrected by the police or the prosecution. Even more strenuously, defense counsel', '- 42 - sought to establish that, because she and Tempest were not neighbors on the day of the murder, Carrier could not have made the day-of-the-murder observations that she recounted to the grand jury. Defense counsel’s cross-examination on this point was so effective that even the trial justice 8 pressed Carrier to admit that, contrary to what she told the grand jury, she never observed those details:', '“Q', 'Where did you get these observations that you made [on]', 'the day of the murder? By reading the Woonsocket Call, is', 'that where you got it?', '“A', 'No.', '“Q', 'Because you would agree with me, you certainly didn’t see', 'it, isn’t that a fact?

However, although defense counsel marked Carrier’s August 1991 statement—which referenced Gordon’s knowledge of Tempest’s culpability and suggested his involvement in a cover-up—as a defense exhibit for identification, he did not confront Carrier with that inconsistency. Indeed, the defense steered well clear of any reference to Gordon’s involvement in this cover-up.', 'At Tempest’s PCR hearing, when the former prosecutor was confronted with his handwritten notation from March 10, 1992, he explained that it reflected his thoughts that it was too late to supplement discovery at that juncture and that a supplementary response to use what he considered to be incriminating evidence would “cause [a] big problem[]” in the form of continuances and headaches. He did not believe that the evidence itself would have an adverse impact on the state’s case and said so more than once:', '“Q', 'And your response was it was ‘too late,’ you said, ‘don’t', 'volunteer new information,’ correct?', '“A', 'It was too late in a discovery sense, yeah. We were not', 'going to supplement discovery regarding that point because', 'we are on the eve of trial.', '“Q', 'And you wrote down ‘will cause big problems’?', '- 44 -', '“A', 'Well, cause a big problem supplementing at this point and', 'probably end up having to continue the case.', '“Q', 'And you thought it would lead to a continuance and to', 'headaches?', '“A', 'Headaches.', '“* * *', '“Q', 'You think, your thought at the time was if you produced', 'new information to [the] defense it might lead to a', 'continuance, correct?', '“A', 'Yeah.

Clearly, at the PCR hearing, the former prosecutor viewed the Carrier statements as inculpatory—which, of course, they were—and not exculpatory. It was only after Tempest’s', '- 45 - PCR counsel suggested to the former prosecutor that the evidence could be used for impeachment purposes that he understood its potential as favorable defense evidence.', 'Co-counsel testified at Tempest’s PCR hearing that, had the Carrier statements been disclosed to the defense, the evidence would have been used in cross-examination. Critically, however, the defense had Carrier’s August 1991 statement before trial, in which she explained that Tempest stated: “‘I won’t get caught[;] my father and brother won’t let me get caught.’ ‘The weapon’s been all taken care of’ * * *.” Although this statement clearly contradicted the portion of her February 1987 statement in which she stated that Tempest told her and Guarino that “[i]f my brother Gordie knew he would turn me in,” and although defense counsel marked Carrier’s August 1991 statement as a defense exhibit for identification, defense counsel did not impeach Carrier on the inconsistencies between her February 1987 and August 1991 statements.', 'The hearing justice granted Tempest postconviction relief on the basis of the former prosecutor’s nondisclosure of the Carrier statements. Unfortunately, this is the only aspect of the hearing justice’s decision that the majority is willing to address, a situation that will lead to future litigation concerning the witness-coaching claim, at least in the Superior Court and, potentially, in this Court.', 'Of the seventy-eight pages that comprised his decision, the following is the entirety of the two-and-a-half pages that the hearing justice devoted to the treatment of the background facts, controlling legal principles, and analysis of the issue:', '“Turning to Mr. Tempest’s second claim, the [c]ourt', 'examines the alleged nondisclosure of statements made by Ms.', 'Carrier to law enforcement shortly before trial.

To this effect, our Supreme Court has ‘adopt[ed] a sliding-scale analysis based on the blameworthiness of the prosecution in failing to disclose the evidence.’ State v. Brisson, 619 A.2d 1099, 1102 (R.I. 1993). In expanding a defendant’s constitutional rights beyond the requirements set forth by the United States Supreme Court, our jurisprudence provides that ‘the reason for the nondisclosure can be dispositive concerning the likelihood of a new trial.’ Id.

In this case, after reviewing the entirety of the record—including the former prosecutor’s testimony at the PCR hearing and his handwritten notes of March 10, 1992—I am left with the definite and firm conviction that the hearing justice clearly erred in concluding that the nondisclosure of the Carrier statements was deliberate under the Wyche doctrine.', 'The law surrounding this issue is neither complex nor difficult to understand. Under Wyche, a deliberate nondisclosure is not simply one that is purposeful or intentional, as the hearing justice erroneously concluded. Instead, to qualify as a deliberate nondisclosure, one of two specific tests must be met. First, “[t]he prosecution acts deliberately when it makes ‘a considered decision to suppress * * * for the [very] purpose of obstructing’ * * *.” Wyche, 518 A.2d at 910 (quoting Keogh, 391 F.2d at 146-47) (emphasis added). Alternatively, if the nondisclosure is not found to be for the very purpose of obstructing the defense, a deliberate nondisclosure can still be established if the prosecution “fail[ed] ‘to disclose evidence whose 11', 'Footnote 32 of the hearing justice’s decision reads: “See Sanborn v.

(quoting Keogh, 391 F.2d at 147). Neither test for deliberateness is met in this case.', '1. Considered Decision to Suppress for the Very Purpose of Obstructing', 'Notwithstanding the majority’s ipse dixit to the contrary, the hearing justice did not correctly set forth the test for deliberateness in this context. The closest the hearing justice came to touching on the test for deliberateness is the following sentence: “In finding a violation, ‘[t]he easy cases * * * are where the prosecutor’s suppression is deliberate, by which we include * * * a considered decision to suppress[.]’” (Quoting Lerner, 542 A.2d at 1092.) This selective snippet from Lerner does not accurately set forth the test for deliberateness. It is not enough that the nondisclosure constitutes “a considered decision to suppress.”', 'Instead, to constitute a deliberate nondisclosure under this prong of the Wyche test for deliberateness, the considered decision to suppress must be made “for the [very] purpose of obstructing”—that is, to impede the defendant’s case. Wyche, 518 A.2d at 910 (quoting Keogh, 391 F.2d at 146-47) (emphasis added). 12 This is our law, and it is strictly applied for a very good reason: A considered decision to suppress for the very purpose of obstructing leads to the conviction being vacated. This severe sanction may be imposed only when all components of one of the two tests for deliberateness are satisfied.', 'The hearing justice’s clearly erroneous determination that the former prosecutor’s nondisclosure of the Carrier statements rose to the level of a deliberate nondisclosure flowed 12', 'This necessary component of the considered-decision-to-suppress prong of the Wyche deliberateness standard is plainly evident from the entire passage of Lerner v. Moran, 542 A.2d 1089 (R.I. 1988), but not from the selective quote from the Superior Court decision. See id. at 1092 (“The easy cases—at least they now seem so—are where the prosecutor’s suppression is ‘deliberate,’ by which we include not merely a considered decision to suppress, taken for the very purpose of obstructing, but also a failure to disclose evidence whose high value to the defense could not have escaped the prosecutor’s attention.” (quoting United States v.

A close examination of the hearing justice’s analysis of this issue—which consisted of a single paragraph—readily reveals his error. The hearing justice began by noting that, “[h]ere, the willful nature of such suppression is readily apparent.” But, as is plainly obvious from the Wyche standard of deliberateness, willfulness is not enough; not every intentional failure to disclose qualifies as a deliberate nondisclosure under Wyche. Instead, there must be evidence that the nondisclosure was “taken for the very purpose of obstructing” the defense. Lerner, 542 A.2d at 1092 (quoting Keogh, 391 F.2d at 146-47) (emphasis added). The hearing justice next noted one aspect of the former prosecutor’s testimony at the PCR hearing regarding his failure to disclose the Carrier statements and emphasized that concerns about disclosure leading to a continuance “did not relieve [the former prosecutor] of his prosecutorial duty.” I wholeheartedly agree with this sentiment, but it does not answer the paramount question of whether the former prosecutor’s nondisclosure was deliberate under Wyche.', 'The hearing justice next cited three opinions—none of which involved a claimed Brady violation and one of which was not even a criminal case—for the uncontroversial proposition that “[c]onstitutional rights cannot be tossed aside whenever they present the smallest inconvenience”—a proposition that is utterly irrelevant to the question of whether the former prosecutor made “a considered decision to suppress * * * for the [very] purpose of obstructing” or “fail[ed] ‘to disclose evidence whose high value to the defense could not have escaped * * * [his] attention.’” Wyche, 518 A.2d at 910 (quoting Keogh, 391 F.2d at 146-47). 13 The hearing justice then noted that “the protean nature of Ms. Carrier’s testimony * * * was necessarily 13', 'Obviously, if the former prosecutor did not disclose the Carrier statements simply because they presented him with “the smallest inconvenience,” this would not amount to a considered decision to suppress for the very purpose of obstructing.', '- 51 - harmful to the [s]tate’s case.” Although this may or may not be accurate, it adds little to the relevant inquiry of whether the former prosecutor made a considered decision to suppress for the very purpose of obstructing or whether the evidence was of such a high value to the defense that it could not have escaped the former prosecutor’s attention.', 'The next sentence in the hearing justice’s decision is the closest thing I can find to a factual finding, and it unequivocally demonstrates that this case was wrongly decided. According to the hearing justice, “By deciding not to disclose the newly arisen variations in her story, [the former prosecutor] evidently sought to protect Ms. Carrier from additional impeachment.” (Emphases added.) Evidently? This sounds like speculation to me, a concern that is ignored by the majority. Additional impeachment? This aspect of the decision declares— perhaps unintentionally—that the value of this evidence rested on its cumulative impeachment value: that is, to show “variations in [Carrier’s] story.” Under our PCR statutory framework, “[t]he [Superior C]ourt [hearing justice] shall make specific findings of fact * * * relating to each issue presented.” General Laws 1956 § 10-9.1-7 (emphasis added). In order to find that the nondisclosure was deliberate, the hearing justice was obligated by § 10-9.1-7 and the Wyche doctrine to make specific findings of fact that the former prosecutor made a considered decision to suppress the Carrier statements for the very purpose of obstructing or a separate finding that the undisclosed evidence was of such a high value to the defense that the former prosecutor could not have overlooked it. Rather than make affirmative, specific findings on one of those two points, the hearing justice merely stated that “[the former prosecutor] evidently sought to protect Ms. Carrier from additional impeachment.” (Emphases added.) In order to vacate a twenty-four-year-old murder conviction under Wyche, more was required. Notably, the majority', '- 52 - does not even address this equivocal finding by the hearing justice, and, by failing to confront this issue, the majority deviates from our well-settled jurisprudence.', 'In any event, the evidence does not support the hearing justice’s finding that the former prosecutor’s nondisclosure was “evidently” for the purpose of protecting Carrier from additional impeachment. At the PCR hearing, the former prosecutor clearly and consistently explained what he meant by his handwritten notation “too late – don’t volunteer new info – will cause big problems”: He believed that it was too late to supplement the state’s discovery with respect to inculpatory proof it intended to present at trial and that any attempt to do so would lead to a continuance. The former prosecutor testified that “supplementing discovery at that point I thought would cause a big problem, not the information itself, but the * * * act of doing it.” He explained that his note that it was “too late” was similarly in relation to supplementing discovery: “It was too late in a discovery sense, yeah. We were not going to supplement discovery regarding that point because we are on the eve of trial.” A factfinder may reject this testimony but is not permitted to ignore it.', 'In his scant reference to the former prosecutor’s testimony, the hearing justice misconceived this material evidence. He noted the former prosecutor’s stated reasons for the note—which the hearing justice understood to be based on considerations of convenience (which, of course, would not rise to the level of a deliberate nondisclosure under Wyche)—but he deemed them to be irrelevant, concluding that the former prosecutor’s “concerns did not relieve him of his prosecutorial duty.” However, the former prosecutor’s testimony constituted critical evidence bearing on the important question of whether he failed to disclose the evidence for the very purpose of obstructing. Notably, the hearing justice made no credibility finding as to the former prosecutor’s testimony. Instead, the trial justice sidestepped this testimony altogether,', '- 53 - concluding that the former prosecutor “evidently sought” to protect Carrier from additional impeachment. In reaching this conclusion, the hearing justice overlooked and misconceived the former prosecutor’s testimony at the PCR hearing, which was highly relevant and material to the deliberateness inquiry. This was clear error. See Bido v. State, 56 A.3d 104, 110 (R.I. 2012) (“When reviewing the grant or denial of postconviction relief, the hearing justice’s factual findings and credibility determinations will be upheld ‘absent clear error or a determination that the hearing justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence.’” (quoting Lynch v. State, 13 A.3d 603, 605 (R.I. 2011))).', 'Finally, the concluding sentence of the hearing justice’s one-paragraph “analysis” of the issue of whether the nondisclosure was deliberate—“[s]uch a ‘considered decision to suppress’ automatically necessitates relief”—is simply wrong. This is not a rote exercise by the factfinder or by this Court; a finding of deliberate nondisclosure under Wyche has severe consequences and warrants careful analysis. A “considered decision to suppress” is not enough to constitute deliberate nondisclosure unless there is also a finding that the decision has been made for the very purpose of obstructing. Other than a finding that the former prosecutor “evidently” sought to protect the witness from additional (cumulative) impeachment, the hearing justice made no definitive finding of fact regarding the purpose of the nondisclosure and, to the extent that such a finding was attempted, it was clearly erroneous. It is my opinion that the hearing justice left this Court with no choice but to vacate his decision on this point.', 'The majority disagrees and, in doing so, compounds the problem by making its own findings of fact and substituting its judgment for that of the hearing justice. According to the majority, “the former prosecutor’s own words—‘don’t volunteer’—indicate a considered decision not to offer the new information to the defense.” This passage is problematic for two', '- 54 - reasons. First, the hearing justice never made this factual finding, and the General Assembly has authorized only lower-court justices—and not the justices of this Court—to make such findings in the PCR context. See § 10-9.1-7. Second, in making this factual finding, the majority commits the same legal error as the hearing justice. Even though the former prosecutor’s “don’t volunteer” notation may indicate a “considered decision” to suppress, a considered decision to suppress, as a matter of law, does not alone constitute deliberateness under Wyche. There must be an additional determination that the decision was made for the very purpose of obstructing the defense. The “don’t volunteer” notation tells us nothing of the reason for the nondisclosure. The former prosecutor’s reasons are set forth in the record in this case and were ignored by the hearing justice and the majority in making its own findings—an unwarranted exercise, I suggest—in such an infamous case.', 'The former prosecutor’s own testimony answers this question, and there is nothing to suggest that the nondisclosure was for the very purpose of obstructing. 14 14', 'The majority asserts that I “make[ my] own factual determination that the former prosecutor was only referring to the fact that the new statements could be cause for a continuance.” Even if this assertion were accurate—and it is not—the majority does not dispute that it makes a factual finding of its own with respect to the meaning of “the former prosecutor’s own words” (not to mention its findings with respect to the high value of the evidence). Moreover, my colleagues are incorrect that I make any factual findings. I simply recount the former prosecutor’s testimony, which constitutes the only evidence of the reason for nondisclosure, and note that the hearing justice did not explicitly deem this testimony to be not credible. The majority also asserts that, despite his silence on this testimony, “the hearing justice clearly rejected the former prosecutor’s proffered reason for failing to disclose the information”; this credibility determination, the majority reasons, is implicit from the hearing justice’s “finding that the former prosecutor deliberately failed to disclose the information.” This reasoning amounts to an assertion that, by simply stating a conclusion, a hearing justice in the PCR context is relieved of the obligation to state his or her credibility determinations and the reasons for such determinations. In my opinion, this is incorrect. See G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-7 (“The court shall make specific findings of fact, and state expressly its conclusions of law, relating to each issue presented.”). In this context, implicit does not carry the day.', '- 55 -', '2. High Value of the Evidence', 'The majority also sets forth another justification for affirming the hearing justice with respect to the nondisclosure of the Carrier statements and, in doing so, makes another forbidden finding of fact in a nonjury case: “[T]he ‘high value’ of Carrier’s new statements to the defense could not have escaped the former prosecutor’s attention.” I part company with the majority on this point for two reasons, one procedural and the second substantive.', 'At the outset, it is readily apparent to me that the hearing justice made no factual finding that the Carrier statements were of such high value to the defense that they could not have escaped the former prosecutor’s attention, nor did he make any factual findings to warrant this conclusion. 15 This is serious business; convictions should not be vacated unless these critical findings are actually made and are presented in a posture to be reviewable by this Court. Indeed, as explained above, the hearing justice did not even mention this alternative prong of the Wyche deliberateness standard in his decision, and the majority has no business doing so sua sponte. Under our law, the deliberateness determination is a factual finding reserved for the hearing justice. See State v. Briggs, 886 A.2d 735, 759 (R.I. 2005). Yet the majority takes it upon itself to find as fact that the Carrier statements meet Wyche’s high-value prong. The deferential standard of review through which we examine a lower tribunal’s factual findings does not, in my 15', 'My conclusion in this regard is unaffected by the hearing justice’s single statement in his decision that “the protean nature of Ms. Carrier’s testimony * * * was necessarily harmful to the [s]tate’s case.” The Wyche standard for deliberateness is not satisfied any time the suppressed evidence is harmful to the state’s case, such as, for example, cases where the evidence is merely cumulative impeachment evidence. Instead, only evidence of such high value to the defense that it could not have escaped the prosecution’s attention qualifies for this ground of deliberateness. Wyche, 518 A.2d at 910. The hearing justice’s finding that the Carrier statements were merely harmful to the state’s case cannot be understood as a factual finding that they had the requisite high value discussed in Wyche, especially since the hearing justice failed to even mention this prong of the Wyche standard in his decision.', '- 56 - view, grant this Court the creative license to make its own findings on an issue that was not even mentioned by the hearing justice. Because the hearing justice in this case neglected to make factual findings with respect to (or to even allude to) Wyche’s high-value prong of the deliberateness standard, this Court should not fill in the blanks on that prong.', 'Nonetheless, since the majority has elected to make its own factual determination regarding the high value of this evidence, I am compelled to state my reasons for concluding that the majority is clearly wrong. 16 As far as I can tell, the majority’s position appears to be that, because the Carrier statements constituted new evidence that was, in light of its impeachment value, favorable to the accused, the high value of this evidence could not have escaped the former prosecutor’s attention. 17 However, the high-value prong of the Wyche standard for deliberateness is not so summarily satisfied. High-value evidence means powerful proof—so powerful, in fact, that the prosecution could not have overlooked its value to the defense, see Wyche, 518 A.2d at 910, as the former prosecutor did in this case with this cumulative impeachment evidence.', 'As this Court has recognized, cases involving deliberate suppression—as that concept has been defined in our case law—“rarely present a problem as to the degree of prejudice [that] must 16', 'In doing so, I employ the same deferential standard of review that this Court employs when reviewing the factual findings of a hearing justice, even though I am uncertain whether the majority’s findings are entitled to such deference. 17', 'The majority also seeks to establish the high value of the Carrier statements by contrasting the former prosecutor’s nondisclosure of these statements with his disclosure of the fact that Carrier was mistaken about where Tempest lived on the date of the murder. According to the majority, the former prosecutor disclosed Carrier’s mistake to the defense after “[h]aving realized that [the mistake] was of high value to the defense because it seriously discredited much, if not all, of Carrier’s testimony about seeing Tempest on the day of the murder.” After scouring the record, I can find no support for this assertion about why this disclosure was made. Therefore, it is clear to me that this assertion represents nothing more than an unsupported factual finding by the majority. As such, it is not a legitimate foundation upon which to base a second factual finding of the majority—and not the hearing justice—about the high value of the Carrier statements.', '- 57 - be shown; almost by definition the evidence is highly material.” Lerner, 542 A.2d at 1092 (quoting Keogh, 391 F.2d at 147) (emphasis added). This language indicates that—while a full- blown inquiry into whether the evidence is material under the Bagley standard is not necessary— some degree of evaluation of the probative value of the evidence must be undertaken in order to conclude that the evidence is of the requisite high value. How else can its value be determined? In making its finding, the majority opinion fails to address this important point. Nor does the majority offer an opinion on precisely what makes this evidence sufficiently valuable.', 'A comparison of the Carrier statements to the evidence in Lerner and Wyche—the only two Brady cases from this Court where a deliberate nondisclosure was found—convinces me that the Carrier statements do not satisfy Wyche’s high-value prong.', 'In Wyche, 518 A.2d at 907, 908, a first-degree sexual assault case, the prosecutor deliberately withheld evidence relating to the victim’s blood-alcohol concentration on the morning that the offense was allegedly committed. The prosecution first learned of this evidence the day before the examining physician took the stand, but it did not disclose the evidence until after the jury returned its guilty verdict. Id. at 908. This Court held that “[t]he prosecutor’s conduct in this case was unquestionably deliberate,” id. at 910, and that, notwithstanding the admission of some testimony from the victim about the number of drinks she consumed, id. at 907-08, 909, “[t]he extremely high reading of alcohol in [the victim’s] blood, [.208,] coupled with the impact that such scientific evidence has on juries, was certainly evidence of such ‘high value’ to [the defendant] that it could not have eluded the prosecutor,” id. at 910. The Court went on to conclude that, “[g]iven the strength of the facts in this case, even were we to apply the Bagley reasonable-probability standard of materiality, [the] defendant would be entitled to a new trial.” Id.', '- 58 -', 'Similarly, in Lerner, 542 A.2d at 1089-90, many years after the defendant was convicted of murder, the chief prosecution witness admitted in a subsequent related trial that, at the direction of Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Special Agent Paul Rico (Rico), he committed perjury while testifying at the defendant’s trial. Among other areas of perjured testimony, the witness was instructed by Rico to withhold information about the full extent of promises that Rico made to him in exchange for his testimony against the defendant. Id. at 1090. In particular, the witness testified at the defendant’s trial that Rico had “promised him only immunity and ‘protection for his family’”; he further testified “that he was not promised income from the federal government, a new identity, or relocation.” Id. at 1091. In actuality, however, Rico had promised the witness income for life, a new identity, and relocation in exchange for his testimony. Id. This Court concluded that “[the witness’s] perjury at [the defendant’s] trial relating to the extent of promises made to [the witness] by the FBI in exchange for his testimony and * * * Rico’s corroboration of that perjury were material to [the witness’s] credibility and therefore to the issue of [the defendant’s] guilt,” id., and that “the perjured testimony by [the witness] concerning the promises made to him by the FBI agent is the ‘easy case’ that requires automatic reversal,” id. at 1092. The Court went on to note that “[t]he same result would follow even if we were to apply the Bagley standard of materiality to [the witness’s] perjury.” Id.; see also id. at 1093 (“[The witness’s] perjury, elicited by the FBI, constituted material exculpatory evidence withheld in violation of the applicant’s due[ ]process rights.”).', 'Thus, the high value of the undisclosed evidence in these two cases was obvious and substantial and, unlike in this case, was carefully examined by the Court.', 'In Lerner, we described the witness who gave perjured testimony as “the critical witness in the state’s case” and deemed his perjury “material exculpatory evidence.” Lerner, 542 A.2d at 1093. Similarly,', '- 59 - the victim in Wyche was the critical and perhaps the sole witness who testified regarding the first-degree sexual assault that the defendant allegedly committed against her in an “abandoned house”; the medical evidence did not tend to indicate that a sexual assault had occurred. Wyche, 518 A.2d at 908. The undisclosed evidence of her profound intoxication at the time of the alleged crime thus severely undermined the reliability of her recollection of the pertinent events. Significantly, these are the only cases in which this Court has applied the Wyche deliberate- nondisclosure doctrine, and, in each case, the Court analyzed the undisclosed evidence in light of its relevance at trial and concluded that it was material under the federal standard and, critically, not simply impeachment evidence that merely related to “facts that were collateral to the issue of [the defendant’s] guilt or innocence.” Lerner, 542 A.2d at 1090; see id. at 1093; Wyche, 518 A.2d at 910. None of that careful and considered analysis occurred in this case.', 'The value of the Carrier statements to Tempest’s case does not approach that of the deliberately suppressed evidence in Lerner and Wyche. First, Carrier was not the critical witness against Tempest; she was only one of four witnesses to hear him confess to the murder. Moreover, as the hearing justice implicitly recognized when he declared that the purpose of the nondisclosure was “evidently” to protect Carrier from “additional impeachment” (emphasis added), the Carrier statements were merely cumulative impeachment evidence—which has never been declared to be high-value evidence. With respect to the statement that Gordon put the pipe in the closet, Carrier previously disclosed Tempest’s statement that Gordon would not let him get caught and that the weapon had been “taken care of.” Additionally, the defense already was in possession of a plethora of discovery relating to Gordon’s involvement in the cover-up of his brother’s brutal murder of Picard, much of which came before the jury from another witness.', '- 60 - The defense had the opportunity to impeach Carrier’s testimony on this point, but defense counsel steered clear of using that information for impeachment purposes at trial.', 'Turning to the statements about the Tempest children being excited about getting a puppy, the defense was in possession of Carrier’s grand-jury testimony—in which she testified about her observations of Tempest on the day of the murder—and Carrier was painfully impeached with that testimony in the course of a lengthy cross-examination. Indeed, Carrier admitted before the jury that, contrary to her earlier testimony, she had not seen the things that she claimed to have observed on the day of the murder, including observations of Tempest’s movements and the highly incriminating testimony that she saw Tempest return wearing different clothes. In light of defense counsel’s devastating cross-examination of Carrier, it is a reach to say that one additional false observation—which concerned Tempest’s children and not Tempest himself—satisfies the high-value prong of Wyche.', 'Carrier’s credibility was so effectively destroyed at trial that any additional impeachment based on the Carrier statements would have been merely cumulative. 18', 'Finally, and critically for this prong of Wyche, in making its factual finding that the Carrier statements were of such high value to the defense that they could not have escaped the former prosecutor’s attention, the majority overlooks the uncontroverted evidence that the value of the Carrier statements to Tempest did, in fact, escape the former prosecutor’s attention because he considered this evidence to be incriminating. As is clear from his testimony at the PCR hearing, the former prosecutor viewed the Carrier statements as nothing more than belated inculpatory evidence that he would not offer at trial. It was only after Tempest’s PCR counsel 18', 'Defense counsel thought so too. At the hearing on Tempest’s motion for a new trial, he called Carrier “[t]otally incredible” and stated, “If anybody can believe Donna Carrier, then I’ll tell you something[,] I’ll sell them the Brooklyn Bridge.”', '- 61 - explained to him how the evidence could have been used to impeach Carrier that the former prosecutor appreciated the evidence’s value to the defense. There is no suggestion in this record that his failure to appreciate that the Carrier statements may have been useful for impeachment purposes was not the genuine and forthright testimony of an officer of the court. The hearing justice did not indicate otherwise, and this Court is in no position to assess the credibility of witnesses testifying before a Superior Court hearing justice. This evidence is uncontroverted. In my opinion, the fact that the value of the Carrier statements to the defense actually escaped the former prosecutor’s attention is a relevant consideration in determining whether the evidence was of such high value to the defense that it could not have escaped the prosecution’s attention. Yet the majority, in its rush to affirm the hearing justice on this alternative ground for deliberateness, wholly overlooks this evidence.', 'For all these reasons, the hearing justice clearly erred in determining that the former prosecutor’s nondisclosure of the Carrier statements was deliberate, as our law has defined this term, and the majority perpetuates this error by making its own clearly erroneous factual findings.', 'The evidence simply does not support a finding that either alternative prong of Wyche’s standard for deliberateness has been satisfied.', 'C. Materiality of the Carrier Statements', 'Because this case does not approach a deliberate nondisclosure under Wyche, Tempest is entitled to postconviction relief only if he can shoulder the burden of establishing that the undisclosed Carrier statements qualify as material evidence under Bagley. See DeCiantis, 24 A.3d at 571. Evidence is material if “there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.” State v. Nickerson, 94 A.3d 1116, 1125 (R.I. 2014) (quoting State v. Burnham, 58 A.3d 889, 900 (R.I.', '- 62 - 2013)). “A ‘reasonable probability’ is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.” Lerner, 542 A.2d at 1091 (quoting Bagley, 473 U.S. at 682). Although the majority concludes that the Carrier statements are material, it does so in conclusory fashion.', 'The materiality of undisclosed evidence must be assessed in light of all of the evidence adduced at trial. See DeCiantis, 24 A.3d at 573 (“[B]ased upon our review of the evidence presented at trial, * * * we hold that Mr. DeCiantis has not made the requisite showing of materiality.”); see also United States v. Paladin, 748 F.3d 438, 444 (1st Cir. 2014) (“The strength of impeachment evidence and the effect of suppression are evaluated in the context of the entire record to determine materiality.”); cf. Smith v. Cain, 132 S. Ct. 627, 630 (2012) (“[E]vidence impeaching an eyewitness may not be material if the [s]tate’s other evidence is strong enough to sustain confidence in the verdict.”). After conducting the requisite thorough review of the record, I conclude that the Carrier statements do not give rise to a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the guilty verdict. To the contrary, the Carrier statements are merely cumulative impeachment evidence.', 'To begin, I note my disagreement with the majority’s assertion that Carrier was “arguably the most credible of the four” witnesses who testified that Tempest confessed to the murder. For one thing, this type of credibility assessment is reserved for the hearing justice, not the members of this Court. The hearing justice made no such credibility determination in the relevant two- and-a-half pages of his decision, and the majority should not have ventured onto this forbidden terrain. In any event, my reading of the trial transcript convinces me that Carrier was the least credible witness offered by the state. Carrier admitted during cross-examination that she had not actually seen the things that she had earlier claimed to have observed on the day of the murder. After reading the entirety of the transcript of Carrier’s trial testimony, it is my opinion that the', '- 63 - inference that Carrier simply made up her day-of-the-murder observations out of whole cloth is inescapable. Of the four witnesses who testified at trial that Tempest confessed to the murder, only Carrier was demonstrated to have fabricated prior testimony.', 'It is my opinion that Tempest failed to demonstrate that either of the Carrier statements is material under Brady. Carrier’s claimed observation of the Tempest children’s excitement on the day of the murder was, in light of defense counsel’s extremely effective cross-examination as to her other observations from that day, merely cumulative impeachment evidence demonstrating, yet again, that she did not see Tempest on Winter Street on that fateful day. Indeed, this was noted by the hearing justice in his decision, who concluded that the former prosecutor “evidently sought to protect Ms. Carrier from additional impeachment.” (Emphasis added.) Therefore, it was not material evidence.', 'This Court has consistently declared that merely cumulative impeachment evidence is not material.', 'See Briggs, 886 A.2d at 755 n.8 (“Although impeachment evidence may be found to be material under Brady * * *, our subsequent cases have held that a due process violation does not occur when the state fails to divulge impeachment evidence that is merely cumulative.”); id. at 757, 757-58 (“[I]f the high number of [the witness’s] criminal convictions was insufficient to convince a jury that it should disbelieve his testimony, then three additional convictions would not have changed the minds of the jurors.', 'Put differently, this impeachment evidence is merely cumulative. * * * Although [the] defendant could have impeached [the witness’s] credibility further with the additional convictions, the fact that [the] defendant did, in fact, impeach [the witness] with the numerous convictions that were disclosed only warrants the conclusion that the additional convictions would not have resulted in [the] defendant’s acquittal. Thus, the trial justice properly concluded that they were not material under Brady.”); Chalk, 816 A.2d at 419, 419-20 (“The defendant’s cross-examination of [the', '- 64 - witness] delved into his numerous specific acts of misconduct and elicited from [the witness] multiple admissions of misdeeds and deception. * * * At most, had [the] defendant received the additional * * * documents earlier, defense counsel may have elicited from [the witness] some additional impeaching admissions.', 'In our opinion, [the] defendant’s merely raising the possibility of doing so is not sufficient to establish that, had the evidence been produced sooner, there is a reasonable probability that [the] defendant would not have been convicted. We conclude here, as we did in State v. Bassett, 447 A.2d 371, 377 (R.I. 1982), that any additional impeaching statements ‘would merely have been cumulative for impeachment purposes,’ and thus they ‘fail[] the test of the likelihood that [they] would have produced a reasonable doubt of guilt.’”).', 'Tempest fares no better with respect to Carrier’s statement about Gordon Tempest putting the pipe in the closet, which is closely akin to the claim in her August 1991 statement that Tempest stated: “‘[M]y father and brother won’t let me get caught.’ ‘The weapon’s been all taken care of[]’ * * *.” Clearly, the defense was in possession of evidence having the same sort of impeachment value as Carrier’s undisclosed statement relating to Gordon: Carrier’s August 1991 statement, the pretrial statements of Danny Shaw (Shaw) and Ronald Vaz (Vaz), and, as explained in more detail below, see Part II.C, infra, the trial testimony of Vaz, Michael Asselin (Asselin), and Robert Boisclair (Boisclair), the locksmiths who placed Gordon and another officer at the scene in possession of the pipe on the day after the murder. Notwithstanding, the defense wisely elected not to proceed down this avenue of impeachment in the course of defense counsel’s extensive and lengthy cross-examination of Carrier at trial. Tempest, therefore, cannot demonstrate a reasonable probability that, had this evidence—which defense counsel likely would not have used—been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have', '- 65 - been different. Accordingly, the undisclosed Carrier statement relating to Gordon was not material.', 'Moreover, Carrier was not the only witness who heard Tempest confess. Guarino, Vaz, and Loretta Rivard (Rivard) all similarly testified that Tempest confessed to them that he murdered Picard, and, as I explain in more detail in my cumulative evaluation of the materiality of the Carrier statements and the McMann evidence, see Part II.C, infra, the state’s evidence at trial was overwhelming. Therefore, even if Carrier’s credibility had not already been, to use the majority’s phrase, “crushed altogether” by defense counsel’s cross-examination (as I believe it was) and even if the impeachment value of the undisclosed Carrier statements was sufficiently high to create a reasonable likelihood that the jury would have rejected Carrier’s testimony in total, there were still three other witnesses who told the jury about Tempest’s confessions. In light of the testimony of these three other witnesses and the other incriminating evidence, see Part II.C, infra, there is not a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the jury’s guilty verdict that the result of the proceeding would have been different.', 'For this reason, this case is nothing like Wearry v. Cain, 136 S. Ct. 1002 (2016), cited by the majority. In that case, “[t]he [s]tate’s trial evidence resemble[d] a house of cards, built on the jury crediting Scott’s account rather than [the defendant’s] alibi.” Id. at 1006. Scott, the prosecution’s “star witness,” gave conflicting statements to the police—with which he was impeached by defense counsel at trial—but told the jury that he saw the defendant kill the victim. Id. at 1003. The prosecution failed to disclose, however, the statements of two inmates with whom Scott was incarcerated that tended to show that Scott had a motive to inculpate the defendant. Id. at 1004. One inmate “hear[d] Scott say that he wanted to ‘make sure [the defendant] gets the needle [be]cause he jacked over me.’” Id. The other reported that Scott', '- 66 - “suggested that lying about having witnessed the murder ‘would help him get out of jail.’” Id. In my opinion, this evidence—which showed that Scott had a motive to falsely implicate the defendant—is plainly material, and its nondisclosure alone would have constituted a Brady violation. But there was even more evidence that the prosecution failed to disclose in Wearry. 19', 'In this case, by contrast, Carrier was not the key witness for the state; there were three more witnesses to whom Tempest confessed, and the state presented additional incriminating evidence. Moreover, Carrier’s additional inconsistent statements—which, in my view, constitute merely cumulative impeachment—pale in comparison to the evidence in Wearry that the star witness who claimed to have witnessed the murder had reasons for falsely implicating the defendant. The Carrier statements do not reveal any motive to lie; at most, they tend to show that she was fabricating observations on the day of the murder—a circumstance that defense counsel unquestionably demonstrated to the jury at trial.', '***', 'In sum, the hearing justice failed to set forth or apply the correct legal standard for a deliberate nondisclosure under Wyche.', 'This is an error of law warranting reversal. 19', 'In particular, Scott’s tale of the events leading up to the murder indicated that Hutchinson, who was involved in the murder, ran “into the street to flag down the victim, pulled the victim out of his car, shoved him into the cargo space, and crawled into the cargo space himself.” Wearry v. Cain, 136 S. Ct. 1002, 1005 (2016); see also id. at 1003. However, Hutchinson’s medical records—which the prosecution did not disclose to the defendant—revealed that he underwent knee surgery nine days prior to the murder; according to an expert witness who testified at the defendant’s collateral-review hearing, Hutchinson would not have been able to perform the tasks described by Scott so soon after that surgery. Id. at 1005. Additionally, Scott’s testimony was bolstered by another witness, Brown, who testified that, on the night of the murder, he saw the defendant and others with a man who looked like the victim. Id. at 1003. Brown also told the jury that he “agreed to testify against [the defendant], not for any prosecutorial favor, but solely because his sister knew the victim’s sister,” and the prosecutor emphasized Brown’s purely altruistic motives during closing argument. Id. However, “the [s]tate had failed to disclose that, contrary to the prosecution’s assertions at trial, Brown had twice sought a deal to reduce his existing sentence in exchange for testifying against [the defendant].” Id. at 1004.', '- 67 - Additionally, he failed to make factual findings that the former prosecutor made a considered decision to suppress for the very purpose of obstructing or that the Carrier statements were of such a high value to the defense that they could not have escaped the former prosecutor’s attention. To the extent that the hearing justice made a factual finding regarding the reason for the former prosecutor’s nondisclosure—“evidently” to protect Carrier from additional impeachment—it was clearly erroneous. Compounding these errors, the majority makes its own clearly erroneous findings of fact to substantiate the hearing justice’s erroneous finding of a deliberate nondisclosure. On this record, the evidence does not support the conclusion that either prong of the Wyche standard was met. Additionally, the Carrier statements do not constitute material evidence; instead, this is merely cumulative impeachment evidence.', 'For all of these reasons, I would hold that the nondisclosure of the Carrier statements was not deliberate under Wyche and that the evidence was not material. Accordingly, the hearing justice’s grant of postconviction relief on this ground should be vacated.', 'II', 'The McMann Evidence', 'The majority’s affirmance of the hearing justice with respect to the nondisclosure of the Carrier statements entitles Tempest to a new trial. For this reason, the majority quite correctly declines to address Tempest’s other Brady claim relating to the McMann evidence. (For reasons discussed below, see Part III, infra, the same cannot be said for the majority’s refusal to address Tempest’s witness-coaching claim.) Even if it is assumed that the McMann evidence claim has merit, saying so would serve no useful purpose because Tempest will have the benefit of this evidence in his retrial. See United States v. Halloran, 821 F.3d 321, 342 n.14 (2d Cir. 2016) (“[T]he remedy for a Brady violation is vacatur of the judgment of conviction and a new trial in', '- 68 - which the defendant now has the Brady material available to her.” (quoting Poventud v. City of New York, 750 F.3d 121, 133 (2d Cir. 2014) (en banc))).', 'Because I would vacate the hearing justice’s grant of postconviction relief with respect to the Carrier statements, however, I am compelled to state my views on Tempest’s other Brady claim. In my opinion, the hearing justice abused his discretion in rejecting the state’s laches defense to this claim. As explained in more detail herein, my careful and conscientious review of the record below leads me to conclude that, notwithstanding the nondisclosure of the McMann evidence, Tempest has failed to establish that the defense did not know that Robert Monteiro (Monteiro) did not own the maroon car (McMann car) in 1982 or borrow it from Kevin McMann before he purchased it in 1983. And yet, despite this knowledge—which could have been further confirmed by a simple conversation with his friends and family—Tempest waited until 2013 to begin to develop this claim. If ever there was a case calling out for invocation of the doctrine of laches, this is that case. In addition, and completely apart from the alternative ground of laches, the claim fails on its merits because the McMann evidence does not qualify as material evidence.', 'A. Background', 'Before addressing the legal issues with respect to this claim, I first briefly sketch the relevant background. At Tempest’s trial, Lisa LaDue (LaDue) testified that, on the day of the murder, she returned to her apartment on 409 Providence Street at approximately 3:20 p.m. LaDue testified that, when she arrived home, she observed a “big,” “older” “maroon car” that she did not recognize in the driveway of 409 Providence Street. Upon entering the building, LaDue “heard some moving around [in the basement] downstairs.” Douglas Heath (Heath), LaDue’s stepfather, arrived at 409 Providence Street at 3:30 p.m. Heath testified that there were no vehicles in the driveway when he parked his truck there that afternoon.', '- 69 -', 'Richards testified that, between approximately 4:30 and 4:45 p.m. on the day of the murder, she observed Tempest in front of her house, “standing on the outside of Bobby Monteiro’s car with the door partly open[,] talking to him.” Richards then testified as follows:', '“Q', 'Would you describe Bobby Monteiro’s car?', '“A', 'It’s maroon, four door, and I’m not sure about the type of', 'car. It was a huge car, maybe a Chevrolet or Oldsmobile.', '“Q', 'Was that his car or was it a car that he just drove?', '“A', 'No, he used to borrow Kevin McMann’s car. He would', 'later on purchase the car but not at that time.” (Emphasis', 'added.) Vaz also testified that Tempest told him that, after the murder, he, Shaw, and Monteiro left the crime scene in “Bobby Monteiro’s car.”', 'It is undisputed that the expected testimony of LaDue and Richards concerning the maroon car was disclosed to the defense before trial. In fact, in her police statement, Richards stated the following:', '“Corky[, Tempest’s sister and Monteiro’s wife,] was telling me', 'about how the car I said [Monteiro] had on the day of the murder', 'was not sold to them as of that time. She tried to tell me that the', 'car was his brother[’]s which was the same color but different', 'make. I know the car I saw him in was the one that he bought', 'from Lee’s [Pharmacy20] and that I had seen him driving around in', 'that car several times at that time and that is why I thought he', 'already owned it.” 20', 'John McMann was a part owner of Lee’s Pharmacy, Inc.', '- 70 -', 'During the defense case, Martin Leyden (Leyden), an employee of the Rhode Island Registry of Motor Vehicles (DMV), testified.', 'Leyden’s testimony established that neither Monteiro nor his wife owned a vehicle—maroon or otherwise—registered with the DMV until 1983. In 1983, “a ’75 Buick, two[-]door, red” automobile was registered to the Monteiros. There is no dispute that this car is the McMann maroon car. Therefore, although Richards described the McMann car as a four-door model, it had two doors. Despite knowing about this inconsistency, defense counsel did not cross-examine Richards on this point. During closing argument, the former prosecutor twice mentioned that the maroon car observed by Richards and LaDue was the one that Monteiro borrowed from Kevin McMann (Kevin). 21', 'At the hearing on Tempest’s motion for a new trial, defense counsel argued that the evidence at trial showed that “[Monteiro] didn’t own a vehicle, nor did his wife own a vehicle” at the time of the murder. The following exchange then occurred:', '“THE COURT: The fact [that] he doesn’t have a vehicle', 'registered to him doesn’t mean he didn’t have the use of a', '[maroon] vehicle.', '“[Defense counsel]: You can infer that.” When defense counsel continued his argument that the state’s evidence connecting Tempest to the crime was rather weak, the trial justice responded: “[T]here’s no doubt in the [c]ourt’s mind that the connection [of] the [d]efendant to the crime was all furnished by his own words.”', 'Time marched on, and, in the intervening years, several of the important actors in this saga passed away. Carrier died in 2004. Defense counsel and Guarino died in 2006. Richards 21', 'To distinguish Kevin McMann from his father, John, and his sister, Susan, I refer to the McManns by their first names.', '- 71 - passed away in 2007. Additionally, Colleen “Corky” Monteiro (Corky), Tempest’s sister and Monteiro’s wife, has died as well.', 'The issue about the McMann car was not unknown to the defense. In 2001, a private investigator working on Tempest’s case located a letter from John McMann Jr. (John), Kevin’s father, in the defense team’s files that read:', '“To [w]hom it may concern:', '“Enclosed, find a copy of a [b]ill of sale, for a 1983 Buick,', 'purchased for Lee’s Pharmacy[,] Inc., on May 27, 1983.', '“The sale of my red Buick [i.e. the McMann car] to the', 'Monteiro[s] took place after I received my new car.', '“There is no way[] I was without a car[] before I picked up', 'my new one.” The investigator believes that he turned the letter over to Tempest’s sister Barbara. Nothing was done.', 'Twelve years would elapse before any action was taken with respect to this letter. Then, in 2013, another investigator working on Tempest’s case interviewed Kevin. It was at this point that Kevin told the investigator that he never loaned the McMann car to Monteiro in 1982 and that he had relayed this information to officers of the Woonsocket Police Department before trial. Kevin also executed an affidavit stating that his father, John, provided a bill of sale to the Woonsocket Police Department to establish when he sold the maroon car to Monteiro.', 'Sharon McMann-Morrelli (Sharon)—John’s daughter and Kevin’s sister—testified that John informed police during Tempest’s trial that he did not lend the maroon car to Monteiro', '- 72 - before he sold it to him in 1983. 22 John’s disclosure allegedly was prompted by a Woonsocket Call article discussing the trial that mentioned that Monteiro borrowed the McMann car on the day of the murder. Sharon testified that John allegedly spoke with then-Chief Rodney Remblad (Remblad). Similarly, Kevin testified at the PCR hearing that, at his father’s request, he too told police during the trial that he never loaned out the car. Kevin testified that he recalled speaking with two officers, and he believed, but was not certain, that one of those officers was Remblad. Inexplicably, however, Kevin never discussed the McMann car with Tempest’s defense team. The McMann evidence—that John and Kevin allegedly went to the police during Tempest’s trial and what they told the officers—was not conveyed to the former prosecutor or the defense.', 'Remblad testified at the PCR hearing and flatly denied discussing this issue with John or Kevin. There was no police report reflecting a conversation between either John or Kevin and any officer. The Woonsocket Police Department’s case file contained a bill of sale for the 1983 blue Buick Regal that had been purchased by John’s business before the sale of the maroon car to Monteiro in 1983—the same bill of sale referenced in the letter from John, addressed “[t]o [w]hom it may concern,” that was found in the defense team’s files in 2001.', 'Co-counsel testified at the PCR hearing that he and defense counsel reviewed John’s letter that related his purchase of a new vehicle, his sale of the maroon car to Monteiro in 1983, and the fact that John was not without a vehicle before he bought the 1983 Buick. Co-counsel also testified that he spoke with Corky on several occasions before trial, but he does not remember whether any of these conversations involved the McMann car. Nor could co-counsel recall whether he or defense counsel ever spoke with Kevin about the McMann car. Finally, co- counsel testified that, although he is “sure” that he spoke with Tempest about the McMann car 22', 'John was unable to testify at the PCR hearing because he had been suffering from the effects of Alzheimer’s disease.', '- 73 - and believes that defense counsel did so as well, he could not recall the specifics of these discussions. This understandable failure of memory of events occurring more than twenty years ago is problematic and leaves many unanswered questions about the McMann evidence, particularly in light of Tempest’s testimony at the PCR hearing.', 'Tempest testified that he was friendly with Monteiro, his sister’s husband. 23 In fact, Tempest testified that he was indeed in Monteiro’s car on the day of the murder; however, instead of the McMann car, Tempest insisted that Monteiro was driving a green Mercury Comet that day. Additionally, Tempest testified that he and Monteiro did not drive to 409 Providence Street but instead went on a so-called “buzz ride” in which the two smoked marijuana. Tempest further testified that, to his knowledge, Monteiro had not borrowed the McMann car in 1982 and did not purchase it until 1983. Tempest could not recall, however, whether he shared this information with his defense team. This failure of memory is equally problematic. Additionally, although he was released on bail pending trial, he does not recall asking his sister Corky whether her husband borrowed the McMann car in 1982, notwithstanding that Corky was discussing the issue with Richards, a witness for the state.', 'On the basis of this record, I am not satisfied—and it is impossible to conclude—that the substance of the McMann evidence was new information or that the defense team did not, before trial, explore, discuss, or ask their client, Kevin, John, Corky, or Monteiro himself whether Monteiro borrowed the McMann car. Because defense counsel was in possession of Richards’ police statement in which she claimed to have seen Monteiro driving the vehicle “several times” around the time of the murder, including on the day of the murder, and because Tempest’s 23', 'Monteiro was convicted of four counts of perjury based on his testimony before the grand jury, which purported to establish an alibi for Tempest. See State v. Monteiro, 632 A.2d 340, 340-41 (R.I. 1993) (affirming this conviction).', '- 74 - attorneys spoke with John, Corky, and their client before trial, it is inconceivable to me that this subject was not examined by the defense. Of course, we will never know what defense counsel did in relation to this issue before trial because Tempest waited until after defense counsel died before seeking to develop this claim. Based on this delay, the state cannot defend against this claim twenty-two years later.', 'The hearing justice, on the other hand, rejected the state’s laches defense and found a Brady violation with respect to the McMann evidence. First, the hearing justice found that both John and Kevin told police that they did not lend the maroon car to Monteiro before John sold it to him in 1983. Although the hearing justice determined—notwithstanding Tempest’s argument to the contrary—that the nondisclosure was not deliberate under the Wyche doctrine, he concluded that Tempest was entitled to postconviction relief because the McMann evidence was material.', 'B. Laches', 'An action for postconviction relief is a civil proceeding, Campbell v. State, 56 A.3d 448, 454 (R.I. 2012), subject to the same rules and statutes applicable in civil proceedings and affirmative defenses available in the civil context, see § 10-9.1-7, including the affirmative defense of laches, see Santos v. State, 91 A.3d 341, 344 (R.I. 2014); Raso v. Wall, 884 A.2d 391, 394 (R.I. 2005). “[L]aches is an equitable defense that precludes a lawsuit by a plaintiff who has negligently sat on his or her rights to the detriment of a defendant.” Santos, 91 A.3d at 344 (quoting School Committee of Cranston v. Bergin-Andrews, 984 A.2d 629, 644 (R.I. 2009)). To prevail on a laches defense, the state must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) the PCR “applicant unreasonably delayed in seeking relief” and (2) the state was “prejudiced by the delay.” Id. (quoting Heon v. State, 19 A.3d 1225, 1225 (R.I. 2010) (mem.)).', '- 75 -', 'It is incumbent upon this Court to review the hearing justice’s laches determination in a deferential manner. “Whether or not there has been unreasonable delay, and whether the state has been prejudiced by the delay, are both questions of fact, which require that specific determination[s] * * * be made in light of the circumstances of the particular case.” Santos, 91 A.3d at 345 (quoting Heon, 19 A.3d at 1225). Consequently,', '“[f]or the purposes of appellate review, the application of the', 'defense of laches is generally committed to the discretion of the', '[hearing] justice. * * * [This Court] will not reverse the [hearing]', 'justice’s decision on what constitutes laches on appeal unless it is', 'clearly wrong.” Id. at 344 (quoting Bergin-Andrews, 984 A.2d at', '644).', 'Our deferential review, however, must not be confused with rubber-stamp approval of a hearing justice’s treatment of a laches issue. As this Court has explained:', '“Judicial discretion is necessarily broad—but it is not', 'absolute.', 'Abuse occurs when a material factor deserving', 'significant weight is ignored, when an improper factor is relied', 'upon, or when all proper and no improper factors are assessed, but', 'the court makes a serious mistake in weighing them.” Hogan v.', 'McAndrew, 131 A.3d 717, 722 (R.I. 2016) (quoting Independent', 'Oil and Chemical Workers of Quincy, Inc. v. Procter & Gamble', 'Manufacturing Co., 864 F.2d 927, 929 (1st Cir. 1988)). Along similar lines, clear error exists when “the reviewing court[,] on the basis of the entire evidence[,] is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.” Bido, 941 A.2d at 835-36 (quoting Perez, 882 A.2d at 588). This Court can, in appropriate circumstances, hold that a lower-court justice abused his or her discretion in rejecting a laches defense. See, e.g., Pukas v. Pukas, 104 R.I. 542, 548, 247 A.2d 427, 430 (1968). In my opinion, this is such a case. In this case, there has been an egregiously unreasonable delay that has', '- 76 - resulted in such prejudice to amount to a manifest injustice, all of which is compounded by the hearing justice’s erroneous findings.', 'In rejecting the state’s laches defense in this case, the hearing justice focused exclusively on the unreasonable-delay prong. First, the hearing justice explained that, because Tempest “lacked the funds with which to retain a postconviction attorney,” Tempest “took it upon himself to repeatedly write letters to a minister * * * who ran an innocence project * * * whom he had heard about from fellow inmates.” The hearing justice also emphasized that the state had put forth no evidence demonstrating that the Office of the Public Defender (Public Defender) would have been able to take the case, dedicate sufficient resources to developing Tempest’s claims, and bring the PCR application faster than Tempest’s counsel. The hearing justice characterized the necessary investigation of Tempest’s case as a “Herculean task,” and he emphasized the complexity of the case. Additionally, the hearing justice noted the efforts of Evelyn G. Munschy (Munschy), which involved “hunt[ing] through the case file of [the defense team]” and “spen[ding] approximately thirty to forty thousand dollars of her own personal money to hire a private investigator * * * to look into Mr. Tempest’s case.” The hearing justice also chronicled the efforts of Betty Anne Waters to obtain DNA testing on Tempest’s behalf. 24 Finally, the hearing justice noted the substantial attorney hours expended by Tempest’s PCR attorneys. None of these observations address the issue of whether there was unreasonable delay with respect to the McMann evidence claim.', 'Before the hearing justice, the state sought to invoke the doctrine of laches as a complete bar to all of Tempest’s claims. On appeal, the state has narrowed the focus of its laches 24', 'Although Tempest asserted PCR claims based on the evidence of DNA testing, the hearing justice rejected those claims because the DNA evidence “[did] not import ‘a reasonable probability of a different result.’” (Quoting Powers v. State, 734 A.2d 508, 514 (R.I. 1999).)', '- 77 - argument; it now invokes the doctrine only with respect to Tempest’s Brady claim relating to the McMann evidence. The hearing justice erroneously failed to address whether laches should bar discrete claims, as he was required to do. Instead, he made sweeping—and, in my view, flatly incorrect—assessments on such matters as the complexity of the case, Tempest’s statutory right to counsel, and the institutional capacity and ability of the Public Defender.', 'These generalizations are simply inapplicable to the Brady claim involving the McMann evidence.', 'Complexity, for example, clearly does not weigh in Tempest’s favor with respect to this claim. Whatever may be said for the other PCR claims he asserted, Tempest’s Brady claim relating to the McMann evidence was anything but complex; it was straightforward. Tempest knew before trial that Richards would testify that the maroon car that she saw Monteiro with on the day of the murder was the vehicle that he later purchased from the McManns. Tempest also testified that, to his knowledge, his brother-in-law did not borrow the McMann car before the Monteiros purchased it in 1983. Despite actual knowledge and the fact that Tempest and his attorneys could have asked Monteiro, Corky, John, or Kevin about Richards’ expected testimony, Tempest did nothing to investigate the claim until 2013. Instead, he sat silent for many years. At the PCR hearing, Tempest could not even recall whether he told his attorneys about what he knew about the McMann car or the vehicle—a green Mercury Comet—that he claimed Monteiro was driving on the day of the murder. This is not reasonable diligence. Moreover, even though defense counsel was in possession of a letter from John that indicated that he was not without a car before he sold the maroon car to the Monteiros in 1983—i.e. he never loaned it to anyone—and, even though that letter was unearthed by a private investigator in 2001, no effort was made to contact Kevin until 2013—twelve years later. During that time period, three trial witnesses, another potential witness regarding the McMann car, and defense', '- 78 - counsel all died, and John became unavailable to testify because of disease. The hearing justice overlooked all of this evidence and failed to consider this lengthy period of delay. In this regard, the hearing justice ignored material factors deserving significant weight. See Hogan, 131 A.3d at 722.', 'The hearing justice’s reliance on Tempest’s lack of resources was erroneous as a matter of law. In accordance with § 10-9.1-5, an indigent applicant for postconviction relief is entitled to be represented by the Public Defender, or appointed counsel when there is a conflict, in connection with a PCR application. Therefore, regardless of Tempest’s financial circumstances, he was guaranteed the right to counsel. The state does not shoulder a burden to establish that an applicant is entitled to appointed counsel or that the Public Defender is up to the job. There is not a scintilla of evidence in this record suggesting that the Public Defender was not capable of pursuing this claim.', 'The hearing justice improperly faulted the state for “present[ing] no evidence that the Public Defender’s [o]ffice would have been able to a) take the case; b) dedicate sufficient resources to developing the present claims; or c) bring the petition faster than Mr. Tempest’s counsel.” With respect to the McMann evidence claim, the prejudicial delay was not the time that was spent actually investigating and developing the claim after an investigator interviewed Kevin in 2013. Instead, the pertinent delay was the inordinate amount of time from Tempest’s trial in 1992 until 2013—a period of time when virtually nothing was done with respect to this claim, and during which Tempest knew that Richards’ testimony did not comport with his understanding of Monteiro’s use of the McMann car and knew the identity of the potential witnesses—Monteiro, Corky, and Kevin—that could have rebutted that testimony. Did a member of the defense team approach Kevin or John about this issue before trial? There is no', '- 79 - way of knowing. 25 In those twenty-one years, the McMann evidence, to the extent it existed, could have been discovered and verified or debunked with reasonable diligence.', 'In fact, the presence of John’s letter in the defense team’s files suggests that defense counsel met with at least one member of the McMann family about the McMann car. How else could that letter have been prepared and delivered? It seems wholly unreasonable to suggest that, despite knowledge of Richards’ expected testimony about Monteiro’s use of the car, defense counsel made no inquiry of Monteiro, Tempest, Corky, or the McManns. And, because there was nothing complex about the McMann evidence or its discovery, there is nothing to suggest that the Public Defender was not capable of developing the claim. Tempest simply could have filed a PCR application, obtained appointed counsel, and told counsel of the issue with respect to Monteiro’s use of the McMann car.', 'The hearing justice clearly erred in basing his decision that the delay was not unreasonable on his assessment of the capabilities of the Public Defender. The constraints under which the members of the Public Defender’s office perform their responsibilities—with stunning success, I believe—would not have prevented an investigator of that office from speaking with Kevin, or with John before his illness, about the McMann evidence. Relying on the complexity of Tempest’s failed DNA claims to justify the delay—twenty-one years from the date of his conviction and twelve years from the discovery of John’s letter in the defense team’s files—on the remainder of Tempest’s other claims is reversible error. From this faulty premise and in the absence of any proof, the hearing justice assumed that the Public Defender was across-the-board unable to develop Tempest’s claims in an expeditious manner. In doing so, he constructed an improper factor and then heavily relied on it, to the exclusion of a material factor deserving 25', 'Although Kevin testified at the PCR hearing that he did not discuss the McMann car with the defense team, defense counsel was unavailable to provide his side of the story.', '- 80 - significant weight: Tempest’s unexplained failure to develop this claim, in the face of actual knowledge at the time of trial of Monteiro’s use of the car and the several individuals who could have contradicted Richards’ testimony that Monteiro borrowed the car from Kevin in 1982, for twenty-plus years. See Hogan, 131 A.3d at 722.', 'For these reasons, I am of the opinion that the hearing justice’s assessment of the unreasonable-delay prong of the laches inquiry was clearly wrong and that he abused his discretion in concluding that the state failed to shoulder its burden on this prong.', 'The second prong of the laches inquiry—prejudice to the state—was not addressed by the hearing justice, save for his fleeting characterization of the state’s effort to carry its burden as “fall[ing] woefully short” because the state “rest[ed] entirely on its cross-examination of witnesses and the offer of nine death certificates into evidence” and the penultimate sentence of his laches analysis: “A thorough rummaging for truth ought not prejudice the [s]tate.” Of course, it is not the “rummaging for truth” that prejudices the state, but Tempest’s unreasonable delay in bringing the McMann evidence claim and the death of material witnesses during that period of delay. The evidence adduced by the state amply carries its burden to show two types of prejudice: (1) an inability to defend against the claim; and, (2) in the event that the claim succeeds, the difficulties that would accompany a retrial in the circumstances of this case.', 'For starters, Tempest’s unreasonable delay in bringing the McMann evidence claim has prejudiced the state in its ability to defend against the claim itself. This is the essence of laches. Most glaringly, defense counsel’s death in 2006 has irrevocably foreclosed any inquiry into whether defense counsel discussed Monteiro’s use of the McMann car on the day of the murder with Kevin, John, Monteiro, Corky, or his client. How did John’s letter find its way into the defense team’s files? We know from John’s letter, found in 2001, and the DMV evidence at trial', '- 81 - that defense counsel knew that Monteiro did not buy the McMann car until 1983, that the car was a two-door model, and that John would not have been without a car before that sale. We know that the defense was in possession of Richards’ statement, in which she stated that she saw Monteiro driving the car several times before he purchased it and that she saw him with it on the day of the murder. Additionally, defense counsel and co-counsel spoke with Tempest about the McMann car, and the defense team also spoke with Corky, Monteiro’s wife.', 'When these established facts—awareness of Richards’ knowledge of Monteiro’s use of the car, the defense team’s discussions with Tempest and individuals who could have evaluated the accuracy of Richards’ knowledge, and the trial defense, supported by the DMV evidence, that Monteiro did not own the car until 1983—are considered together, I am not convinced that defense counsel overlooked the question of whether Monteiro borrowed the car in 1982. John’s letter establishes that defense counsel was aware of this issue and broached the subject of the McMann car with at least one member of the McMann family.', 'Unfortunately, because defense counsel died while Tempest delayed bringing the claim, the state was denied an opportunity to pursue this line of inquiry in its effort to defend against the McMann evidence claim. Moreover, defense counsel’s death did not follow closely on the heels of Tempest’s trial; instead, fourteen years elapsed between these two events. During that time frame, Tempest made no effort whatsoever to raise this claim.', 'In addition, the state’s ability to defend against this claim has been compromised in other respects. During the long period in which Tempest failed to assert this claim, John developed Alzheimer’s disease, which rendered him unable to testify and, consequently, be cross-examined, and Kevin has forgotten precisely when he allegedly went to the police and with whom he spoke. The prejudice resulting from the inability to cross-examine John to test his assertion that he met', '- 82 - with police about the McMann car is self-evident.', 'This prejudice is compounded by the questions surrounding John’s letter, which was found in the defense team’s files in 2001. With respect to Kevin’s lapses of memory, if only Tempest had asserted his claim in a timely fashion, perhaps Kevin would have been able to accurately identify the police officers with whom he allegedly spoke, such that the officers could verify whether the alleged conversation actually took place. Additionally, if the alleged conversations between the McManns and Remblad and Remblad’s testimony at the PCR hearing were closer in time, perhaps Remblad’s unequivocal denial that these conversations occurred would have been given more weight. To the extent that any of these lines of defense were viable at some earlier time, Tempest’s delay prevented the state from utilizing them.', 'Finally, apart from any prejudice in defending against the McMann evidence claim, the delay in its assertion clearly will prejudice the state upon remand. For example, Richards is now deceased. On retrial, her former testimony will be admissible. See Rule 804(b)(1) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. But see Part III, infra. However, Tempest may call Kevin as a witness to rebut Richards’ testimony that he loaned his car to Monteiro in 1982 generally and on the day of the murder, in particular. Although this option was available to the defense during Tempest’s first trial, the balance on this score has shifted decidedly in Tempest’s favor in the intervening decades.', 'Kevin’s testimony on this point may be unrebutted because of Richards’ death. Notably, in her November 19, 1991 police statement, Richards explained how Corky tried to convince her that she had not seen Monteiro driving the McMann car on the day of the murder; in response, Richards was emphatic about the car that she observed:', '“Corky was telling me about how the car I said [Monteiro] had on', 'the day of the murder was not sold to them as of that time. She', 'tried to tell me that the car was his brother[’]s which was the same', 'color but different make. I know the car I saw him in was the one', '- 83 -', 'that he bought from Lee’s [Pharmacy] and that I had seen him', 'driving around in that car several times at that time and that is why', 'I thought he already owned it.” If she were still living, Richards would be able to explain to the jury the basis of her knowledge and contradict Kevin’s testimony in this fashion. 26', 'For these reasons, I conclude that the hearing justice’s assessment of the unreasonable- delay prong of the laches inquiry was clearly wrong and that his rejection of the state’s laches defense—which was based on the failure to consider relevant factors and the improper consideration of other factors—constituted an abuse of discretion. In my opinion, the state carried its burden of demonstrating that Tempest unreasonably delayed in asserting his McMann evidence claim and that it has been prejudiced by that delay. Accordingly, I would hold that this claim is barred by laches. Notwithstanding this conclusion, however, I am also of the opinion that the claim fails on its merits.', 'C. Materiality', 'As previously explained, see Part I.C, supra, evidence is material for Brady purposes if “there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.” Nickerson, 94 A.3d at 1125 (quoting Burnham, 58 A.3d at 900). “A ‘reasonable probability’ is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.” Lerner, 542 A.2d at 1091 (quoting Bagley, 473 U.S. at 682). This Court reviews the question of whether evidence is material under Brady in a de novo manner. 26', 'Tempest asserts that a court cannot consider prejudice to the state in retrying a defendant in the laches inquiry. This assertion seems inconsistent with this Court’s case law on laches in this context. See Raso v. Wall, 884 A.2d 391, 396 n.14 (R.I. 2005) (suggesting that “[t]here may well be much merit in” the state’s argument that it was prejudiced for purposes of laches because “[i]t might [have been] virtually impossible at [that] point in time, 20 some years later to try” the defendant).', '- 84 - DeCiantis, 24 A.3d at 573. In reviewing the materiality question de novo, and even when the McMann evidence is analyzed cumulatively with the Carrier statements as Wearry, 136 S. Ct. at 1007, requires, I am convinced that the McMann evidence was not material. 27', 'The hearing justice reached the opposite conclusion. In the hearing justice’s opinion, “the assertion that Mr. Tempest was a passenger in a maroon car on February 19, 1982 was integral to the [s]tate’s case.” He further reasoned that “[t]he statement by Ms. La[D]ue that she saw a maroon car upon returning home the afternoon of the murder, and the corresponding testimony from Ms. Richards that she saw Mr. Tempest standing by a maroon car driven by Mr. Monteiro that same afternoon, constitute the only piece of evidence linking Mr. Tempest to the crime scene at the appropriate time.” As was true for the hearing justice’s treatment of the Carrier statements, this cursory analysis of the materiality of the McMann evidence is flawed.', 'For starters, the finding that the maroon-car testimony of LaDue and Richards was the only piece of evidence linking Tempest to the crime scene at the appropriate time is erroneous. As our late colleague Justice Bourcier, who presided over Tempest’s trial, stated at the hearing on the motion for a new trial: “[T]here’s no doubt in the [c]ourt’s mind that the connection [of] 27', 'Tempest claims that, because the state failed to argue to the hearing justice that the McMann evidence was not material, the state’s materiality argument has been waived. I am unpersuaded by this contention. First, materiality of the McMann evidence was treated as little more than an afterthought by Tempest below. The clear thrust of Tempest’s argument below was that the nondisclosure of the McMann evidence was deliberate under the Wyche doctrine; materiality of the evidence was addressed only briefly in one paragraph of Tempest’s proposed findings of fact, which were filed on the same day as the state’s proposed findings. Thus, it is hardly surprising that the state similarly focused on the Wyche doctrine for this evidence. Moreover, materiality is an essential element of a Brady claim, see Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 281-82 (1999), and this Court reviews the materiality determination de novo, see DeCiantis v. State, 24 A.3d 557, 573 (R.I. 2011). This Court is therefore obligated to consider whether this essential element is met. Finally, Tempest himself raised the issue of materiality of the McMann evidence, and the hearing justice considered that issue, as he was required to do in order to find a Brady violation. See Strickler, 527 U.S. at 281-82. Accordingly, the purposes of this Court’s raise-or-waive rule are simply not implicated here. See State v. Isom, 135 A.3d 1210, 1218 n.10 (R.I. 2016).', '- 85 - the [d]efendant to the crime was all furnished by his own words.” (Emphases added.) In my opinion, the trial justice hit the nail on the head.', 'As mentioned above, see Part I.C, supra, the materiality of undisclosed evidence must be assessed in light of all of the evidence adduced at trial. See DeCiantis, 24 A.3d at 573; see also Paladin, 748 F.3d at 444. And, as this Court has recognized:', '“A confession is like no other evidence. Indeed, the', 'defendant’s own confession is probably the most probative and', 'damaging evidence that can be admitted against him * * *. * * *', 'Certainly, confessions have profound impact on the jury * * *.”', 'State v. Oliveira, 961 A.2d 299, 313 (R.I. 2008) (quoting State v.', 'Bettencourt, 763 A.2d 636, 639 (R.I. 2000)).', 'In this case, three 28 separate witnesses—who had little, if any, connection with one another 29—testified that Tempest confessed to the murder in their presence. Rivard testified that Tempest told her: “Do you remember the girl that was killed in the basement in Woonsocket? * * * I killed her * * * [b]ut I’ll get away with it[.] I’m a Tempest[.] I’ll slide.” Neither the Carrier statements nor the McMann evidence would have had any effect on Rivard’s testimony.', 'Additionally, Guarino testified that, when he and Tempest went to a bar in Providence, he asked Tempest whether he committed the murder. Guarino further testified that Tempest: 28', 'I focus only on Vaz, Guarino, and Rivard because, in my opinion, Carrier’s credibility was eviscerated by defense counsel’s vigorous cross-examination. See Part I, infra. When assessing materiality under Brady, undisclosed evidence must be viewed cumulatively and not in isolation. See Wearry, 136 S. Ct. at 1007; Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 436, 441 (1995). Therefore, favorably to Tempest, I completely disregard Carrier’s trial testimony in assessing the materiality of the McMann evidence on the assumption that the undisclosed Carrier statements would have caused the jury to completely reject her testimony: a circumstance I am convinced transpired even without the Carrier statements. 29', 'Rivard did not know Vaz or Guarino. Vaz and Gaurino knew each other through Tempest, although it is clear from the record that the two had met each other on only a handful of occasions.', '- 86 -', '“told me he went into the basement of the house where the Picard', 'girl lived and he said that he had--his right hand was moving up', 'and down when he was talking to me and he told me that he hit one', 'of them over the head and another woman came down [into the', 'basement] and he had to beat her up, too.” Guarino also told the jury about the confession that occurred in his and Carrier’s apartment at 448 Winter Street a few weeks later.', 'The McMann evidence would have in no way undermined Guarino’s testimony.', 'His testimony would have been similarly unaffected by the Carrier statements. Although, like Carrier, Guarino was a little unclear on the precise date that Tempest confessed to him, first at a Providence bar and again at his 448 Winter Street apartment, there was no other inconsistency between Guarino’s police statement and his trial testimony, and no aspect of the Carrier statements contradicted Guarino’s trial testimony. This is hardly surprising, since Guarino and Carrier had long since separated before speaking with police.', ""Additionally, Tempest made numerous incriminating statements to Vaz. Two days after the murder, Vaz saw Tempest jogging in Woonsocket. Vaz pulled his vehicle over to the side of the road, and Tempest approached Vaz. Tempest asked, “Danny [Shaw] told you everything [about it]?” Vaz responded in the affirmative, and Tempest told Vaz that he was in serious trouble and that “‘[t]hey’ll get me for this one’[;] * * * ‘[m]y father won’t get me out of this one.’” Vaz testified that, on another occasion, Tempest admitted that he and Laferte got into an argument in the basement of 409 Providence Street on the day of the murder. Tempest told him that the argument escalated when Laferte hit Tempest. On yet another occasion, Tempest showed Vaz pictures of the severely beaten bodies of Picard and Laferte and boastfully stated: “‘They said I did a bad job’[;] * * * ‘I don't think I did a bad job, do you?’”"", 'Vaz’s testimony would not have been impacted by the Carrier statements. Similarly, the McMann evidence would not have affected Vaz’s testimony. To be sure, with respect to one of', '- 87 - the several independent occasions when Tempest discussed the events surrounding the murder with Vaz, Vaz testified that Tempest explained how he left the murder scene with Monteiro and Shaw in “Monteiro’s car.” However, Vaz did not testify that Monteiro’s car was maroon or otherwise indicate that it was the McMann car. 30 Additionally, unlike Richards, who saw the car, Vaz did not claim that Tempest told him that Monteiro had borrowed the car from Kevin but instead that Tempest referred to the car simply as “Monteiro’s car.” The jury was also made aware that Monteiro did not have registered ownership of the McMann car or any other vehicle on the day of the murder. In any event, Vaz testified about several other instances in which Tempest made inculpatory statements about this horrific crime, and none of these statements involved Monteiro’s car.', 'Finally, the evidence in this case placed Tempest at 409 Providence Street earlier on the afternoon of the murder. Carol Rivet, Laferte’s sister, testified that she was present at 409 Providence Street when Tempest and Allard arrived to pick out a puppy and when they left shortly thereafter. Therefore, the state put forth overwhelming evidence—even when the maroon-car testimony of Richards and LaDue is completely disregarded—connecting Tempest to this homicide.', 'Additionally, there was a plethora of evidence—both from the confession witnesses and from others—that established Tempest’s guilty conscience. Vaz, for example, testified that Tempest told him that he was in “some serious trouble.” He also recounted an instance when Tempest told Vaz of his fear that Monteiro was “the weak link in [the] case” and that Monteiro would say something about the murder to the wrong person. Vaz further testified that, on yet 30', 'In our opinion affirming Tempest’s conviction, this Court stated that “Vaz testified that [Tempest] stated that he had left the crime scene with Shaw and Monteiro in Monteiro’s big maroon car.” Tempest, 651 A.2d at 1205. However, a careful reading of Vaz’s trial testimony reveals that he nowhere refers to Monteiro’s car as “big” or “maroon.”', '- 88 - another occasion, Tempest told him of the fear he experienced when Laferte, who by then had been released from the hospital, arrived at his house. Tempest told Vaz that “he literally shit in his pants” when, in response to a knock on his door, he opened the door and saw Laferte standing there. Tempest also told Vaz “that he thought that the cops were right behind her and that she was going to point the finger to him and say, ‘You did this to me.’” 31 Tempest described that event as “the scariest thing that had ever happened to him.” Similarly, Guarino testified that, when Tempest discussed the murder at 448 Winter Street a few weeks after confessing to Guarino at a bar in Providence, he appeared “very, very nervous.” He told Guarino that the police were watching his house.', 'Along similar lines, evidence was admitted that there was a cover-up afoot and, importantly, that Tempest was aware of it. Vaz testified that Tempest gave him the following account of the cover-up. On the day of the murder, Tempest attempted to call his father. When this attempt was unsuccessful, Tempest then called his brother Gordon. Gordon was able to reach their father, along with then-Captain (later Chief) Francis J. Lynch (Lynch) of the Woonsocket Police Department, at the Gridiron Club.', 'Tempest called Gordon again, and Gordon related that their father and Lynch were en route to the crime scene. When they got to 409 Providence Street, Tempest’s father parked across the street, and Lynch went into the building and ordered everyone out so that Gordon could wipe the pipe clean. When Gordon was unable to locate the pipe, he told his father, who, in turn, called Tempest for information about where the pipe could be found. After the information was related to Gordon, he went back into the basement, located the pipe, wiped it clean, and changed its location. When police were later unable to find the murder weapon, Gordon and other officers returned to the crime scene to 31', 'As it turns out, Laferte, who had no memory of the attack, simply intended to visit Tempest’s wife.', '- 89 - locate the pipe.', 'According to Vaz, when relating this detail, Tempest laughed at the incompetence of the police.', 'On another occasion, Tempest told Vaz that his father had instructed him to get some “strong” alibis. Significantly, many of the details that Tempest disclosed in his confessions to others were corroborated at trial.', 'Although Lynch, Gordon, and Tempest’s father all denied that they participated in any cover-up, 32 testimony from other witnesses supported what Tempest told Vaz. For example, Terrence Gelinas (Gelinas), who, at the time of the murder, lived on Providence Street not far from the crime scene, testified that he ran to 409 Providence Street when he heard rescue personnel respond to the scene. Gelinas saw Tempest’s father parked in his car across the street from the crime scene. Additionally, the testimony of the two locksmiths who installed deadbolt locks at 409 Providence Street on the morning after the murder further supports Vaz’s testimony about Gordon’s involvement in the cover-up and concealment of the murder weapon. One of the locksmiths, Asselin, testified that two police officers were present during their work and that Gordon was one of these officers. The second locksmith, Boisclair, testified that he saw the officers holding a pipe wrapped in a piece of cloth. According to Sgt. Richard Flood (Flood) of the Woonsocket Police Department, he and Gordon returned to the crime scene days later, and it was Gordon who found the concealed pipe and showed it to Flood.', 'Tempest’s knowledge of the cover-up effort was similarly established by the testimony of several witnesses and, in many cases, by his own words. For example, Rivard—a virtual stranger Tempest met in a bar one evening—testified that Tempest not only confessed to her, but also boastfully stated: “I’ll get away with it[.] I’m a Tempest[.] I’ll slide.” Similarly, Tempest 32', 'Gordon was convicted of seven counts of perjury based on the testimony he gave before the grand jury and at Tempest’s trial. See State v. Tempest, 660 A.2d 278, 279 (R.I. 1995) (affirming this conviction).', '- 90 - related to Vaz the information concerning the cover-up efforts of his father and brother, Lynch, and Maurice Jallette (Jallette) of the Woonsocket Police Department.', 'Moreover, Tempest’s threats to multiple witnesses revealed his knowledge of a cover-up and his guilty conscience. Tempest warned Guarino that he “better keep [his] mouth shut.” Likewise, when, many years later, the investigation focused in on Tempest as the prime suspect, he threatened Gelinas in no uncertain terms. Tempest told Gelinas that “[y]ou are going to wish you never got involved in this.”', 'He further informed Gelinas that he was going to kill Pennington and that his father was going to “take care of other people,” including the former prosecutor. Tempest continued: “I wouldn’t want to be you. * * * I wouldn’t want anybody to talk. [Jallette] and [Gordon] are just waiting. * * * If I get convicted, my father is taking care of you.”', 'For these reasons, my de novo review of the entire record convinces me that the state presented overwhelming trial evidence against Tempest. Viewing the Carrier statements and the McMann evidence against this backdrop, I am satisfied that this evidence does not undermine confidence in the jury verdict.', 'There is no reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different had this evidence been disclosed to the defense. Therefore, I would vacate the hearing justice’s grant of postconviction relief with respect to Tempest’s two Brady claims.', 'III', 'Witness Coaching', 'Although the majority correctly concludes that its decision affirming the hearing justice’s grant of postconviction relief based on the nondisclosure of the Carrier statements renders a consideration of Tempest’s other Brady claim unnecessary, this reasoning does not extend to the', '- 91 - ruling on Tempest’s witness-coaching claim because, if this aspect of the decision is not vacated, it may lead to confusion and unnecessary further litigation. In refusing to address this claim, the majority leaves a gaping hole rather than a clear mandate on remand. I believe that it is incumbent upon the majority to consider this issue because it is not clear what remedy, if any, lies in the face of this ill-conceived due process violation.', 'The hearing justice employed the eyewitness-identification standard of Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U.S. 98 (1977), and its progeny to Tempest’s witness-coaching claim. As I explain below, the hearing justice erred in doing so. Separate and apart from this erroneous aspect of the hearing justice’s analysis of the witness-coaching claim, however, another problematic piece of the decision needs to be addressed by members of this Court. As it stands now, the majority has affirmed the vacatur of Tempest’s conviction, and he faces a new trial. What is the remedy, if any, upon remand for the witness-coaching due process violation found by the hearing justice?', 'The hearing justice does not say in his decision, nor could he have fashioned a remedy; that is not within the parameters of an application for postconviction relief. In the course of finding a due process violation, the hearing justice determined that the testimony of LaDue and Richards relating to the maroon car was “faulty” because it was fostered in an unnecessarily suggestive “environment.” 33 He also determined that this testimony “evince[s] an inherent unreliability that undercuts any confidence in such testimony and the resultant verdict.” He then 33', 'As far as I can tell, the hearing justice concluded that the admission of only those portions of LaDue’s and Richards’ testimony that dealt with the maroon car violated due process. I do not read his decision as declaring that the totality of these witnesses’ testimony is unconstitutionally unreliable.', '- 92 - suggested that this evidence was “constitutionally inadmissible as a matter of law.” (Quoting State v. Porraro, 121 R.I. 882, 887, 404 A.2d 465, 469 (1979).)', 'These rather extraordinary findings—which have no jurisprudential support in this state (or anywhere else, for that matter)—must be understood as limited to the context in which they were made. In the PCR context, the hearing justice’s task was limited to determining whether Tempest’s “conviction or the sentence was in violation of the constitution of the United States or the constitution or laws of this state.” Section 10-9.1-1(a)(1). A PCR hearing justice has no authority to address the admissibility of evidence in a retrial, and nothing the hearing justice stated in his decision should be interpreted as deciding that question.', 'In fairness to the next Superior Court justice who may be confronted with this issue at the new trial, the majority should have decided this question in order to provide guidance to the parties and the trial justice or to declare it erroneous as a matter of law. The majority’s refusal to address this issue will create more litigation in the Superior Court and, quite possibly, again before this Court. However, notwithstanding the majority’s unfortunate failure to address this issue, it is clear to me that the trial justice on remand is not bound by law-of-the-case principles or any other doctrine to exclude the testimony of trial witnesses or the use of former testimony of those witnesses who are no longer with us. 34 Furthermore, should this testimony be excluded 34', 'The majority claims that it “would be fruitless” to address the witness-coaching claim because a conclusion that the claim is barred under principles of res judicata “would have no effect on retrial.” In my opinion, this reasoning is flawed. As it stands today, the hearing justice’s decision on the witness-coaching claim remains undisturbed. On remand, Tempest may argue, and a Superior Court justice might agree, that the hearing justice’s determination that the evidence is “constitutionally inadmissible as a matter of law” applies to Tempest’s retrial. (Quoting State v. Porraro, 121 R.I. 882, 887, 404 A.2d 465, 469 (1979).) Vacating the hearing justice’s decision on res judicata grounds would eliminate any such danger. Moreover, if the majority simply recognized that the witness-coaching claim fails on its merits, the issue would not even come up at the retrial. Cf. Harvard Pilgrim Health Care of New England, Inc. v. Gelati,', '- 93 - after a pretrial hearing in Superior Court, the state has a statutory right of review of that decision in this Court prior to the commencement of Tempest’s retrial. See G.L. 1956 § 9-24-32 (“In any criminal proceeding, the attorney general shall have the right to object to any finding, ruling, decision, order, or judgment of the [S]uperior [C]ourt or [F]amily [C]ourt, and the attorney general may appeal the findings, rulings, decisions, orders, or judgments to the [S]upreme [C]ourt at any time before the defendant has been placed in jeopardy * * *.”); see, e.g.. State v. Morris, 92 A.3d 920, 923-24 (R.I. 2014) (appeal by state under § 9-24-32 from trial justice’s grant of the defendant’s pretrial motion to suppress). Should such an appeal come before us, the Superior Court proceedings will be stayed and the Court will confront the issue that it avoids today.', 'However, there is no basis to employ the reasoning utilized by the hearing justice in this case because, as I explain herein, it is simply wrong. Moreover, it is my opinion that the hearing justice should not have even considered the witness-coaching claim in the first place because that claim was raised and waived at trial, and defense counsel repeatedly emphasized to the jury and 865 A.2d 1028, 1039 (R.I. 2004) (“[W]e address several of the city’s arguments that are likely to arise in conjunction with our remand of the 1999 assessments.” (emphasis added)). Finally, the majority cannot justify its failure to address this issue by invoking then-Judge (now Chief Justice) Roberts’ pithy phrase that “if it is not necessary to decide more, it is necessary not to decide more.” (Quoting PDK Laboratories, Inc. v. United States Drug Enforcement Administration, 362 F.3d 786, 799 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (Roberts, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment)). As the Chief Justice has since explained:', '“It should go without saying * * * that we cannot embrace a narrow ground of', 'decision simply because it is narrow; it must also be right. Thus while it is true', 'that ‘[i]f it is not necessary to decide more, it is necessary not to decide more,’', '* * *, sometimes it is necessary to decide more. There is a difference between', 'judicial restraint and judicial abdication. When constitutional questions are', '‘indispensably necessary’ to resolving the case at hand, ‘the court must meet and', 'decide them.’” Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, 558 U.S. 310,', '375 (2010) (Roberts, C.J., concurring) (quoting Ex parte Randolph, 20 F. Cas.', '242, 254 (C.C. Va. 1833) (No. 11,558) (Marshall, C.J.)).', '- 94 - the trial justice that the state’s witnesses were unworthy of belief because their testimony had been influenced by Sgt. Ronald Pennington (Pennington) and other officers. Thus, that claim is now barred by principles of res judicata. For either or both of these reasons, Tempest was not entitled to postconviction relief on this claim.', 'A. Background', 'A brief background of the relevant portions of the record is necessary to put this issue in proper context. Before trial, defense counsel took the position that, due to the manner in which the police interviewed witnesses in this case, much of the testimony offered against Tempest was suspect. Defense counsel filed a pretrial motion to dismiss the indictment on due process grounds, alleging that the police had suborned witness perjury and “intimidated witnesses to give false statements and testimony.” Before the jury was empaneled, the motion was, at defense counsel’s request, held, and there is no indication that defense counsel pressed this motion any further. This amounts to waiver.', 'Defense counsel did, however, raise the same issue to the jury throughout trial. A review of his cross-examinations of Richards and LaDue—the two witnesses of concern to the hearing justice—as well as Pennington demonstrates that defense counsel consistently sounded this theme.', 'Indeed, Richards admitted on cross-examination that she had been questioned by police—and by Pennington in particular—on several occasions.', 'Richards testified that Pennington “kept asking me the same questions over and over and over and over going again hour after hour until I could give him an answer.” She also stated that Pennington “kept * * * getting upset with me when I told him I couldn’t remember because at the time I could not remember.', 'He told me that is no answer, that I could not give that answer that I can’t remember.” Critically, Richards even acknowledged that Pennington “[s]ometimes” “put words', '- 95 - in [her] mouth,” and she further testified that “[h]e started the statements and I would finish them.”', 'LaDue similarly was subjected to vigorous cross-examination at the hands of defense counsel. In particular, defense counsel focused on her sudden recollection of seeing the maroon car in the driveway of 409 Providence Street ten years earlier. Although LaDue claimed that she simply did not disclose this recollection because her interviewers did not ask whether she saw this vehicle, cross-examination suggested that she had been encouraged by Pennington to give testimony about a maroon car. When asked whether Pennington “remind[ed] [her] that [she] saw a maroon car,” LaDue answered: “Yes. He asked me if I seen [sic] any cars.”', 'Defense counsel also subjected Pennington to a lengthy and forceful cross-examination. Defense counsel elicited testimony from Pennington that he interviewed all of the key state’s witnesses and that he spoke with many of them shortly before trial. During questioning, defense counsel referred to Pennington as “the common denominator” with respect to the statements of the various witnesses.', 'During closing argument, defense counsel once again stressed his theme that the testimony of the state’s witnesses was unworthy of belief because of the suggestive manner of the police’s investigation. He described for the jury “a consistent pattern in this case where everybody is struck by lightning in 1991 and 1992 and remember[s] things that they never told the police before.” Defense counsel argued that Pennington persuaded “people to lie in 1991 and 1992” and “fabricate[d] and manufacture[d] a case against [Tempest].” Pennington, defense counsel told them, simply “[made] the pieces fit into the puzzle.” He suggested that LaDue had fabricated her recollection of the maroon car after Pennington had suggested that she do so.', '- 96 - Similarly, he argued that Richards’ testimony was the product of Pennington’s repeated questioning of Richards until she gave him the answer that he wanted to hear. The jury rejected this defense.', 'At the motion for a new trial, defense counsel reiterated these arguments to the trial justice. With respect to Richards, defense counsel argued:', '“[Richards] testified that words were put into her mouth. She', 'testified, your Honor, that * * * Pennington would start a sentence', 'of her statement and she would have to complete it. Again, the', 'implication, your Honor, [is] that the testimony was coerced and', 'the testimony is untrue, and I ask the [c]ourt to consider that,', 'considering the course and nature of the methods of interrogation', 'of Miss Richards, and I respectfully submit to the [c]ourt, your', 'Honor, that that testimony should be discounted.” Defense counsel also emphasized that Vaz suspiciously claimed to have additional detailed recollections shortly before trial. Additionally, defense counsel unsuccessfully pressed similar arguments regarding the credibility of the witnesses in his brief before this Court on the direct appeal from Tempest’s conviction. In particular, he argued that:', '“It was * * * painfully obvious that the Woonsocket Police', 'Department, particularly * * * Pennington, influenced [Richards’]', 'testimony. The heavy[-]handed and coercive nature inherent in the', 'handling of this witness should have disparaged her testimony on', 'many levels.”', 'At the PCR hearing, Pennington testified that, at times during the Picard investigation, he would “suggest[] facts the witness had not raised to prod [the witness’s] memory.” He also testified that he interviewed Richards more than ten times.', '- 97 -', 'Edward F. Davis (Davis), the former police commissioner of the City of Boston, also testified at the PCR hearing as an expert witness on proper police practices and procedures during the period from 1982 to 1992. Davis testified that Pennington’s technique of suggesting facts when interviewing witnesses was not a proper police practice and is “extremely problematic in any investigation” because it can lead “a witness [to] craft a statement that is not true [but, at the same time, is] very believable.” Davis explained that this practice creates “a danger of planting information in [the witness’s] mind that will eventually be regurgitated * * * as if the witness knows it.”', 'Davis also testified that the preferable police practice when interviewing a witness is to conduct “one long interview that is very thorough” as opposed to several interviews.', 'After hearing this testimony—which, in my opinion, closely resembled inadmissible expert testimony on witness credibility—the hearing justice considered Tempest’s witness- coaching claim, but he declined to “discuss each piece of allegedly tainted evidence.” Instead, the hearing justice elected to examine “the more propitious of Mr. Tempest’s claims.” The hearing justice thus limited his analysis of Tempest’s witness-coaching claim to two witnesses who testified at trial—Richards and LaDue—and a third individual—Shaw—who did not testify at trial (and is, therefore, wholly irrelevant to this claim).', 'The hearing justice, noting that Pennington interviewed Richards more than ten times, found that “her story shifted in lockstep with the [s]tate’s theory of the case.” He explained that: first, Richards claimed to have not seen Tempest arrive at her house after the murder; then she “suddenly remember[ed] Mr. Tempest’s return and vividly recall[ed] the sight of him standing by Mr. Monteiro’s car on the day of the murder”; and, finally, “[w]hen the police discovered Mr. Monteiro did not own the car at this time, her narrative changed once again—the maroon car', '- 98 - transmogrified into one that Mr. Monteiro ‘used to borrow[.]’” Relying on Davis’s opinion testimony, the hearing justice concluded:', '“With regard to the evolving statements by Ms. Richards, * * *', 'Davis opined that she was ‘attempting to correct the record’ in', 'matching her account to police theorizing—‘an indication of', 'coaching by the detectives.’ * * * As such, it is clear that Ms.', 'Richards, after being subjected to a barrage of recurrent suggestive', 'questioning, was led to conform her statements to the prosecution’s', 'case theory.”', 'The hearing justice also offered the following assessment of LaDue’s testimony:', '“In three interviews following the murder, she never mentions', 'seeing an unfamiliar car in the driveway at the house. * * * Then,', 'ten years later, Ms. La[D]ue has a revelation. Following a phone', 'conversation with * * * Pennington, her memory is conveniently', 'jogged. Just in time for trial, she miraculously recalls seeing a', 'strange car parked outside 409 Providence Street on that fated day', 'ten years prior. The color of this car? Maroon. After a decade-', 'long amnesia, Ms. La[D]ue is now able to provide police with', 'exactly what they want—eyewitness testimony linking Mr.', 'Tempest to the scene.” The hearing justice concluded his discussion of these witnesses by stating that “the dramatic shift in the statements of Ms. Richards and Ms. La[D]ue self-evidently would not have occurred without police prompting.”', 'Finally, the hearing justice deemed a recording of a conversation between Remblad and Shaw to be “the most telling example of police coaching.” Because Shaw was not called as a', '- 99 - witness at Tempest’s trial, 35 the hearing justice conceded that “[Shaw’s] improper questioning [by police] cannot serve as a basis for a due process violation.” Nonetheless, he proceeded to consider this evidence from an institutional standpoint and reasoned that the recording of the Shaw conversation “provide[d] invaluable insight into the interrogation techniques of the Woonsocket Police Department at the time and how [Shaw’s] statements were shaped prior to his testimony before the [g]rand [j]ury that would indict Mr. Tempest.” The hearing justice noted that, during this conversation (which occurred outside a Woonsocket bar), Shaw, who may have been an eyewitness to this murder, was “very intoxicated”—so much so that he “struggled to string together a coherent sentence.” He further explained that, in what he characterized as “apparent” “manipulation of Mr. Shaw by police,” Remblad “pushed Mr. Shaw to implicate Mr. Tempest,” “fed a motive to Mr. Shaw,” and “coached Shaw on how the murder took place.” The hearing justice then relied on Davis’s opinion about the conversation to conclude that it was improper:', '“As * * * Davis testified, ‘a commander of the Police Department', 'who is four ranks above a detective * * * just bump[ing] into * * *', 'somebody at 11:00 at night outside of a barroom’ is ‘really', 'problematic.’ * * * He noted that * * * Remblad ‘crossed the line', 'into coaching’ in ‘offering a smorgasbord of facts that the witness', 'c[ould] pick from[.]’ * * * Additionally, he found that ‘planting', 'reasons for motive in the case to the witness’ that the witness can', 'then adopt within his or her own narrative, as * * * Remblad did', 'with Mr. Shaw, ‘is a huge problem.’ * * * The same holds true for', '* * * Remblad’s provision of facts relative to the manner of 35', 'The former prosecutor testified at the PCR hearing that Shaw was “a witness from hell.” He explained that Shaw “came with a lot of baggage” and “was really mentally unstable.” He also testified that Shaw lied to him. The final straw was when, in January 1992, Shaw recanted his statements inculpating Tempest and claimed that Remblad had forced him to say he was present for the murder; then, “immediately” thereafter, Shaw “reversed completely 180 degrees and said he was kidding” about his recantation. The former prosecutor explained that “that [was] about the time that we decided we had about enough of [Shaw],” and he was not called as a witness.', '- 100 -', 'attack—‘The role is to find out what that * * * witness knows, not', 'to tell them what happened at the crime scene.’”', 'In finding a due process violation in the actions of the police, the hearing justice concluded: “[C]onfidence in the verdict rested on a faulty record; due process strictures necessitate vacation of Mr. Tempest’s conviction.”', 'B. Res Judicata', 'The doctrine of res judicata is codified in § 10-9.1-8, see Campbell, 56 A.3d at 457, which provides that:', '“All grounds for relief available to an applicant at the time', 'he or she commences a proceeding under this chapter must be', 'raised in his or her original, or a supplemental or amended,', 'application.

The question presented is whether, “in the interest of justice[, Tempest] should be permitted to assert,” § 10-9.1-8, this argument— which otherwise would unquestionably be barred by res judicata—in this PCR action. This Court has explained that, although the applicability of the interest-of-justice exception is case- specific, “there nevertheless must be some sufficient finding, articulation, or explanation by the', '- 101 - motion justice that an issue barred by the doctrine of res judicata merits consideration in the interest of justice.” Ferrell v. Wall, 971 A.2d 615, 621 (R.I. 2009).', 'The hearing justice erroneously determined that the res judicata principles enshrined in § 10-9.1-8 did not bar Tempest’s witness-coaching claim because of the interest-of-justice exception.', 'This conclusion was premised on the hearing justice’s determination that Pennington’s testimony at the PCR hearing that he would “suggest[] facts the witness had not raised to prod [the witness’s] memory” constituted newly discovered evidence that “confirmed” “Tempest’s past conjecture regarding the possibility of such witness coaching.” It was the hearing justice’s opinion that this testimony established “that the police fed witnesses information in an effort to move the case against Mr. Tempest forward.” The hearing justice thus concluded that, “[i]n light of this new evidence, the [c]ourt finds that justice requires a second look at Mr. Tempest’s claims of police-tainted witness testimony.” (Emphasis added.)', 'In my view, the hearing justice erred in invoking the interest-of-justice exception to the § 10-9.1-8 res judicata bar because Pennington’s testimony at the PCR hearing did not amount to new evidence. Contrary to the hearing justice’s conclusion, defense counsel already knew that the police conducted numerous witness interviews and suggested facts “in an effort to move the case against Mr. Tempest forward” because Richards had admitted as much at trial. According to Richards, Pennington told her that “I don’t remember” was not an acceptable answer and continually pressed her for an answer when she stated that she could not recall. Additionally, Richards testified that Pennington “[s]ometimes” “put words in [her] mouth” and “started the statements and I would finish them.”', '- 102 -', 'This testimony clearly conveys the same message as that related by Pennington at the PCR hearing: In an effort to prod a witness’s memory, he suggested facts known to the police at the time. The hearing justice overlooked Richards’ trial testimony in his haste to avoid the res judicata bar of § 10-9.1-8. Had he not done so, he would have concluded that Pennington’s testimony cannot be considered “new” evidence that warrants invocation of the interest-of- justice exception. Because this decision does not set forth a “sufficient finding, articulation, or explanation by the [hearing] justice that an issue barred by the doctrine of res judicata merits consideration in the interest of justice,” Ferrell, 971 A.2d at 621 (emphasis added), the exception does not apply. That alone is reason to vacate the hearing justice’s decision on this point. But there is an additional reason to do so: The decision is wrong as a matter of law.', 'C. Merits', 'In selecting the legal standard to apply to Tempest’s witness-coaching claim, the hearing justice noted that Tempest’s claim was “analogous to the due process concerns surrounding impermissibly suggestive eyewitness identifications.”', 'For this reason, the hearing justice adopted the two-part inquiry employed in analyzing unduly suggestive eyewitness identifications:', '“Under this doctrine, a trial justice ‘must consider whether the', 'procedure used * * * was unnecessarily suggestive.’ State v.', 'Brown, 42 A.3d 1239, 1242 (R.I. 2012). If this consideration is', 'answered affirmatively, a second inquiry is engaged, examining', 'whether the ‘totality of the circumstances’ indicate that—despite', 'police misconduct—the elicited statement is ‘nonetheless reliable.’', 'State v. Gallop, 89 A.3d 795, 801 (R.I. 2014) * * *.” Applying this standard to witness interviews, the hearing justice declared: “When interviews rise to the level of being impermissibly suggestive, information derived therefrom becomes ‘so', '- 103 - defective as to make the [evidence] constitutionally inadmissible as a matter of law.’” (Quoting Porraro, 121 R.I. at 887, 404 A.2d at 469.)', 'None of the cases cited by the hearing justice fit the square peg that is a witness-coaching claim into the round hole of the eyewitness-identification standard.', 'When asked at oral argument before this Court, Tempest conceded that he was unaware of a single case in which this mishmash was attempted. As far as I can tell, this is the first time a judge in this country has sought to engraft the eyewitness-identification due process rubric to claims that the police improperly coached witnesses. This dearth of authority is understandable, because to do so would turn a criminal trial into an endless pretrial hearing about the manner in which the police investigated the offense and whether the officers’ conduct crossed an amorphous divide drawn by the hearing justice. In braving this new terrain, the hearing justice strayed far afield.', 'As an initial (and, in my view, dispositive) matter, the hearing justice’s inventive approach ignores principles of stare decisis. The hearing justice was not writing on a clean slate. In State v. Garcia, 743 A.2d 1038 (R.I. 2000), the defendant claimed that, because “the police statements and trial testimony given by two of the witnesses against him were coerced” (not merely coached), “his federal constitutional right to due process of law was violated” by the admission of the witnesses’ testimony. Id. at 1043 (emphasis added). This Court explained:', '“[E]ven when a witness has been coerced into providing the police', 'with a pretrial statement that implicates the accused, the mere fact', 'that a witness has given the police such a statement during the', 'investigation of a crime does not necessarily prevent the witness', 'from testifying voluntarily at trial in a manner consistent with the', 'pretrial statement. As we said in State v. Damiano, 587 A.2d 396,', '399 (R.I. 1991): ‘We know of no precedent from the Supreme', 'Court of the United States that would require a jury to ignore the', 'testimony of a live witness on the basis of having a reasonable', '- 104 -', 'doubt concerning whether a prior statement containing the', 'substance of such testimony had been produced by coercion.’”', 'Garcia, 743 A.2d at 1043-44.', 'The hearing justice was bound (as am I) to follow this Court’s decision in Garcia. Had he done so, he would have been obliged to reject Tempest’s witness-coaching claim. If the Due Process Clause is not offended when police coerce a statement from a witness, I cannot fathom how it would be offended when police coach, but do not go so far as to coerce, a witness.', 'Under Garcia, a criminal defendant is not powerless to combat the effects of the manner in which police interview witnesses. Instead, “[c]ross-examination and [closing] argument are the primary tools for addressing improper witness coaching.” United States v. Sayakhom, 186 F.3d 928, 945 (9th Cir. 1999); cf. Perry v. New Hampshire, 132 S. Ct. 716, 723 (2012) (“The Constitution * * * protects a defendant against a conviction based on evidence of questionable reliability, not by prohibiting introduction of the evidence, but by affording the defendant means to persuade the jury that the evidence should be discounted as unworthy of credit.”). Defense counsel wielded those tools with precision in this case, subjecting witnesses to devastating cross- examination on whether their testimony was simply the product of Pennington’s suggestion and asserting in closing argument that Pennington shaped witness testimony to make the puzzle pieces fit. This is the nature of our adversary system of justice.', 'Additionally, an effort to combat witness coaching need not end when a guilty verdict is returned. As occurred in this case, a defendant can file a motion for a new trial, asking the trial justice to “sit[] as the legendary thirteenth juror” and independently weigh the evidence and assess witness credibility. State v. Covington, 69 A.3d 855, 862 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Smith, 39 A.3d 669, 673 (R.I. 2012)). In the event that a trial justice agrees that improper police', '- 105 - conduct sufficiently mars the credibility of an important witness or several witnesses, he or she is empowered to grant the motion. The trial justice’s grant or denial of such a motion is reviewable by this Court, thereby providing yet another opportunity to subject alleged police misconduct to judicial scrutiny. This is the heart of our system’s check on witness credibility and where the question of witness coaching rests. Credibility decisions should not be susceptible to a “second look” by a different justice.', 'To the extent that a standard has emerged elsewhere for evaluating due process claims of witness coaching by police, it bears no resemblance to the hearing justice’s decision. For example, in Wilcox v. Ford, 813 F.2d 1140, 1147-48 (11th Cir. 1987), the Eleventh Circuit held that, to the extent that a due process claim that the police engaged in improper conduct in order to secure incriminating statements from witnesses is even cognizable, it must meet the test of United States v. Russell, 411 U.S. 423, 431-32 (1973), which requires a showing that the conduct “is so outrageous that it violates ‘fundamental fairness, shocking to the universal sense of justice.’” Wilcox, 813 F.2d at 1147 (quoting Russell, 411 U.S. at 432). This is a substantive due process violation. The court explained that the standard is met only “in the ‘rarest and most outrageous circumstances.’” Id. (quoting United States v. Tobias, 662 F.2d 381, 387 (5th Cir. 1981)). This case does not come close to meeting this standard.', 'Finally, at the risk of gilding the lily, I remain troubled by the manner in which the hearing justice addressed Tempest’s witness-coaching claim. In my opinion, the hearing justice approached the question of whether Tempest’s conviction must be vacated on due process grounds as if it were a garden-variety negligence claim. He allowed expert testimony on the standard of care (proper police practices and procedures), and he relied on Davis’s testimony to establish that the police breached that standard with respect to Richards, LaDue, and Shaw. In', '- 106 - what can only be characterized as an extraordinarily irregular proceeding, the hearing justice went so far as to fault the state for not putting on its own expert testimony: “[T]he [s]tate put forth no expert of its own to rebut the opinions offered by * * * Davis.” Since when does the constitutional question of whether the Due Process Clause was violated require a battle of the experts? This is not a negligence case, and, when determining whether the Due Process Clause has been violated, “we must never forget, that it is a constitution we are expounding.” Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327, 332 (1986) (quoting McCulloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316, 407 (1819) (Marshall, C.J.)).', 'For these reasons, I am of the opinion that the hearing justice erred when he granted Tempest postconviction relief on his witness-coaching claim. It is my belief that, on remand, the trial justice to whom this case is assigned should not exclude the testimony of Richards or LaDue on this basis.', 'Conclusion', 'Tempest is not entitled to postconviction relief. The hearing justice failed to follow the appropriate legal standard and clearly erred in determining that the former prosecutor’s nondisclosure of the Carrier statements constituted a deliberate nondisclosure under the Wyche doctrine. Rather than acknowledge this error, the majority improperly makes its own findings of fact—which are also clearly erroneous—to support the hearing justice’s conclusion. The record, however, simply does not support the conclusion that there was a deliberate nondisclosure of the Carrier statements. Additionally, Tempest’s McMann evidence Brady claim is barred by the doctrine of laches and also must fail on the merits because the McMann evidence is not material.', '- 107 - Finally, Tempest’s witness-coaching claim must be rejected because it is barred by principles of res judicata and fails on the merits under the controlling legal standard.', 'Tempest received a fair trial. His conviction should not be disturbed. The Picard family has been deprived of what little justice they received in 1992, ten years after they buried their young, innocent daughter.', '- 108 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S', 'OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'Raymond D.

2,,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. The petitioner, Patrizia Prew (Prew), filed a petition for a writ of certiorari seeking review of a decision by the City of Providence (city) Retirement Board (board) that denied her application for accidental-disability retirement. This Court granted the petition, and this case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on March 2, 2016, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. Having carefully considered the memoranda submitted by the parties and the arguments of counsel, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown, and the appeal may be decided at this time. We quash the decision of the board.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On March 5, 2013, Prew, who held the rank of detective after more than fifteen years of service in the Providence Police Department, injured her right hand and wrist as she attempted to detain a juvenile following a disturbance outside his school. Thereafter, her status was “injured on duty,” and she was diagnosed with post-traumatic carpal tunnel syndrome. Her physician', '-1- recommended surgery, but, due to a fear of surgical complications, Prew opted against surgery and elected treatment with nonsurgical measures.', 'In August 2013, Prew underwent a series of tests to determine whether her injury interfered with her ability to handle a firearm. It did. The Providence Police Department concluded that Prew no longer could operate a firearm safely and took possession of her service weapon. Later that month, on August 23, Prew applied to the board for accidental-disability retirement.', 'In accordance with the applicable ordinance, Prew was evaluated by three independent medical examiners (IMEs) who were retained by the board.', 'In letters mailed from the city’s human resources department, they were asked to determine whether Prew had a disability and if so, whether the disability was “caused by an accident while on the performance of * * * her duty.” The letters further requested that, should the IMEs deem Prew to have a work-related disability, the IMEs submit “a statement as to whether [Prew] can perform the duties of * * * her job. If not, a statement as to what work [Prew] can perform.” The IMEs also were asked for “[a] statement concerning prognosis, the necessity of further treatment, and expectation of return to work.”', 'All three IMEs diagnosed Prew with right carpal tunnel syndrome, which each found to be causally related to her on-the-job injury. The records reflect that, during their examinations, each IME informed Prew about the benefits of surgical release of the carpal tunnel, but Prew declined this course of treatment. Michael P. Bradley, M.D., concluded that, although he could not “guarantee” improvement, surgery is the best course of treatment and, without it, Prew is “rendered * * * completely disabled” and unable to work. Philip J. Reilly, M.D., reported to the city that Prew will be unable to perform her duties as a detective “so long as she elects to', '-2- proceed on a conservative path and avoid surgery.” Manuel F. DaSilva, M.D., determined that Prew “is currently partially disabled, unable to perform her full[-]duty job requirements.”1 He further opined that:', '“It is well proven that carpal tunnel release done by a certified', 'hand surgeon has a 90% to 95% success rate with improvement', 'even if not complete improvement of the symptoms. This means', 'that the vast majority of people are able to go back to their', 'occupation. * * * I find it very difficult for me to agree that [Prew]', 'is unable to do her job due to the fact that she has one of the most', 'treatable ailments that we see in the hand.”', 'On July 23, 2014, the board voted to deny Prew’s application for accidental-disability retirement. In its written decision, issued on August 14, 2014, the board stated:', '“The evidence provided does not establish that Prew is', 'incapacitated for the performance of her job duties if she elects not', 'to have surgery to release the carpal tunnel of her right wrist.', 'Prew, who would otherwise be found permanently disabled, failed', 'without justifiable cause to follow the treatment prescribed by her', 'treating physician.', '“* * * The record * * * indicates that Prew’s condition is', 'easily correctable with a surgical release of the carpal tunnel and,', 'by virtue of her ‘failure’ to follow prescribed treatment, she cannot', 'be found disabled. As a result, the [b]oard denies Prew’s', '[a]pplication due to her failure to follow prescribed medical', 'treatment and her failure to mitigate an injury resulting in a', 'permanent disability.” Prew filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on October 6, 2014, which was granted by this Court on June 8, 2015. 1', 'During an executive session of the board’s medical subcommittee meeting on April 23, 2014, the board’s medical advisor, Guy Geffroy, M.D., who had reviewed Prew’s application materials, clarified to the subcommittee that, in this context, the term “partially disabled” means that “[Prew] would be able to do some type of sedentary work but it’s not * * * compatible with working as a police officer.”', '-3-', 'Standard of Review', '“This Court reviews decisions of the board by a writ of certiorari.” Pierce v.

We hold that it does not.', 'Accidental-disability retirement is one of the three retirement schemes encompassed within the City of Providence Retirement System (retirement system). See Providence Code of', '-4- Ordinances, Supp. No. 1, § 17-189 (June 13, 2016) (Supp. No. 1); see also Pierce, 15 A.3d at 961. The other two schemes are known as service retirement and ordinary-disability retirement. Section 17-189(a), (d). Service retirement is available to employees2 based on their age and length of service. Section 17-189(a). Employees who became disabled as a result of an injury that was suffered in the line of duty are eligible for accidental-disability retirement, § 17-189(f), and ordinary-disability retirement is available to all other participating employees who can no longer work due to disability, § 17-189(d).', 'Section 17-189(f) of the Providence Code governs eligibility requirements for employees in pursuit of an accidental-disability pension.3 This Court recently had the occasion to review a 2', 'While not all employees participate in the retirement system, see Providence Code of Ordinances, Supp. No. 1, §§ 17-181.3, 17-187(a) (June 13, 2016), for the sake of simplicity, in this opinion, we shall refer to all members of the retirement system as “employees.” 3', 'We pause to express our concern that the decision issued by the board on August 14, 2014 quoted from an obsolete version of the accidental-disability-retirement ordinance. The board quoted language from a version that had not been in effect for nearly eight months.

In addition to quoting outdated language, the board incorrectly cited to § 17-189(6) rather than to § 17-192(f), the subsection in effect at the time of the decision. While the differences between the erroneously cited language and the actual law at the time the board issued its decision are not substantive for the purposes of this case, these errors are troubling.', 'We further are mystified by the pendulum-like nature of the placement of the accidental- disability-retirement ordinance within the Providence Code. Multiple changes to Chapter 17 of the Providence Code over the past three years have rendered the ordinance a moving target, bouncing throughout the chapter in such a manner that only those highly experienced in complex legal research can accurately determine where in the Providence Code the ordinance lies at any given point in time. See, e.g., Supp. No. 1, § 17-189(f) (listing accidental-disability-retirement ordinance at § 17-189(f)); Providence Code, Republication, § 17-192(f) (Oct. 21, 2015) (listing ordinance at § 17-192(f)); Providence, R.I., An Ordinance in Amendment of Chapter 17, Article VI of the Code of Ordinances, Entitled “Retirement System” Regarding Pension Matters Related to Certain Members of the Retirement System, ch. 2015-50, § 17-189(6) (Sep. 17, 2015) (Ordinance 2015-50) (listing ordinance at § 17-189(6)); Providence Code, Supp. No. 82, § 17- 192(f) (Dec. 20, 2013) (listing ordinance at § 17-192(f)); Providence, R.I., An Ordinance in', '-5- previous version of § 17-189(f) in Morse v.

Pierce, 15 A.3d at 963 (noting that the rules of construction applied to statutes also apply to ordinances). If its language is “clear and unambiguous,” this Court must apply its “plain and ordinary meaning” and abstain from judicial construction. Id. (quoting Murphy v. Zoning Board of Review of South Kingstown, 959 A.2d 535, 541 (R.I. 2008)).

See Supp. No. 83, § 17-181. 6', 'Despite some minor changes to grammar and punctuation, the language in effect at the time of the board’s decision is substantively the same. See Supp. No. 83, § 17-182.', '-8-', 'Within Article VI, the accidental-disability-retirement ordinance is located in § 17-189, which outlines the three types of retirement schemes available to city employees. See Pierce, 15 A.3d at 961. Each scheme determines the amount of the pension to which employees are entitled, and the retirement system confers the most generous benefits upon employees who become disabled while in the performance of their duties. Id. (citing a previous version of § 17- 189(f)). Eligibility requirements for employees who seek accidental-disability retirement also are more rigorous than those that must be satisfied by employees who seek to retire on the basis of age and length of service or a disability not causally related to an on-the-job injury. Id. at 962. The hierarchy of the retirement schemes, with accidental-disability retirement bestowing the most benefits yet requiring the most stringent qualifications for eligibility, demonstrates that this ordinance is intended to redress the harm suffered by employees who become permanently disabled as a result of performing their job duties. It is remedial in nature. See Esposito v. O’Hair, 886 A.2d 1197, 1203 (R.I. 2005) (“In the parlance of statutory construction, a remedial statute is ‘one which affords a remedy, or improves or facilitates remedies already existing for the enforcement [of] rights [or] redress of wrongs * * *.’” (quoting Ayers-Schaffner v. Solomon, 461 A.2d 396, 399 (R.I. 1983), recognized as superseded on other grounds by statute in Lake v. State, 507 A.2d 1349, 1352 (R.I. 1986))); see also Criminal Injuries Compensation Board v.

This Court previously has determined that the clause, “the retirement board shall retire the said member for accidental disability,” § 17-189(f) (emphasis added), is of a “mandatory, not discretionary” nature. Connelly v. City of Providence Retirement Board, 601 A.2d 498, 500 (R.I. 1992) (construing identical language contained within “An Act to Provide for the Retirement of Employees of the City of Providence,” P.L. 1923, ch. 489, § 9(5)), which was “the state retirement act in existence before the city created its own retirement system pursuant to its home rule charter,” Arena v. City of Providence, 919 A.2d 379, 393 (R.I. 2007)); see id.

Amaral, 460 A.2d 7, 10 (R.I. 1983))). Consequently, this Court has declared that, once the employee has established that he or she qualifies for accidental- disability retirement, the board is not vested with discretion to deny the application. Id.', 'A close reading of § 17-189(f) outlines all that is required for an employee to establish qualification for accidental-disability retirement. First, an application for accidental-disability retirement must be submitted by the employee or on the employee’s behalf within eighteen months of the accident or upon a waiver granted by the city council. Section 17-189(f). The', '- 10 - application must allege that the employee is eligible for accidental-disability retirement, and it is incumbent upon the city to conduct an “investigation of all statements and certifications” made by the employee or on his or her behalf. Id. The employee must submit to medical examinations by three independent medical examiners selected and retained by the city. Id. The examinations, along with any additional investigation undertaken by the city’s director of personnel, must establish the following: (1) the employee “is physically or mentally incapacitated for the performance of service any [sic]”;7 (2) that the incapacitation is “a natural and proximate result of an accident” or accidents;8 (3) such accident or accidents occurred “while [the employee was] in the performance of duty”; (4) the disability was not caused by the employee’s willful negligence or misconduct; (5) the disability “is not the result of age or length of service”; (6) the employee “should be retired”; and (7) the definite time, place, and conditions of the duty that resulted in the employee’s disability.', 'Id.; see also Pierce, 15 A.3d at 962 (discussing requirements of a previous version of § 17-189(f)). There is no language in the ordinance that indicates that an employee must undergo surgery to mitigate his or her permanent disability in order to qualify for accidental-disability retirement. The absence of such a requirement must be construed in favor of the employee. See McCarthy, 865 A.2d at 1063. 7', 'It appears that the placement of the word “any” is a typographical error. Since the meaning of the phrase “performance of service any” is not relevant to the issues raised in this case, we shall not endeavor to determine the intent of the drafters. Cf. City of Cranston v. Rhode Island Laborers’ District Council, Local 1033, 960 A.2d 529, 533 (R.I. 2008) (declaring that this Court “generally refrain[s] from addressing issues that the case at hand does not require [it] to address” (quoting State v. Lead Industries Association, Inc., 951 A.2d 428, 470 (R.I. 2008))). However, we are cognizant that the apparent error reflects a lack of careful proofreading not only in 2013, when the error first appeared, but also in the subsequent amendments to Chapter 17. 8', 'See Pierce v. Providence Retirement Board, 15 A.3d 957, 966 (R.I. 2011) (“hold[ing] that the board erroneously limited the phrase ‘of an accident’ to mean one and only one accident” (citing a previous version of § 17-189(f))).', '- 11 -', 'We also do not perceive a mitigation requirement when considering Article VI in its entirety. Surely, Article VI’s stated purpose is to limit the city’s already grave fiscal challenges, and the legislative findings accompanying Article VI elucidate the reason behind this goal. See §§ 17-181.1, 17-181.2. However, in articulating their goal to protect the city’s fiscal stability, the drafters did not dismantle the city’s long-standing accidental-disability-retirement scheme. Nor did the drafters impose a mitigation requirement within the language of § 17-189(f), as is contained within a similar remedial statutory scheme, the Rhode Island Workers’ Compensation Act. See G.L. 1956 § 28-33-6, as amended by P.L. 1954, ch. 3297, § 1 (“[T]he refusal of the employee to accept treatment reasonably required to lessen or terminate his or her incapacity shall bar the employee from receiving compensation during the period of refusal.”).9', 'Despite the absence of an express mitigation requirement within § 17-189(f), the city argues that such a requirement must be read into the ordinance in order to protect “the integrity of the retirement system.”10 The city contends that an employee who, like Prew, refuses to 9', 'Although not raised by the city or argued to this Court, we are satisfied that our opinion in Mancini v. Superior Court, 78 R.I. 373, 375, 380, 82 A.2d 390, 391, 393 (1951), which examined an employee’s refusal to undergo surgery within the context of the Workmen’s Compensation Act, G.L. 1938, chapter 300, does not apply to this case. Since Prew is a police detective, the circumstances of this case are not controlled by the Workers’ Compensation Act, G.L. 1956 chapters 29-37 of title 28, the successor to the Workmen’s Compensation Act, but rather the comprehensive ameliorative statutory scheme regarding police officers and fire fighters injured on duty, as set forth in G.L. 1956 § 45-19-1, the state’s injured-on-duty statute. Notwithstanding our opinion in Mancini and its subsequent codification in 1954 by the General Assembly, P.L. 1954, ch. 3297, § 1, the city has not seen fit to address in its retirement ordinances the question of whether otherwise disabled employees must mitigate their injuries through surgery in order to qualify for an accidental-disability pension. The city merely has set forth in many permutations the eligibility requirements for accidental disability. We therefore deem Mancini to be inapplicable to the case at bar. 10', 'In support of this proposition, the city points to the ordinance now codified at § 17-183(a), which reads:', '- 12 - undergo surgery might “take advantage” of the retirement system by “obtain[ing] benefits and then at some point in the future obtain[ing] corrective surgery, rendering her capable of performing the essential functions of the job while collecting accidental[-]disability retirement.” A review of § 17-189(h) of the Providence Code demonstrates why this claim is unavailing.', 'Section 17-189(h) strikes a balance between the drafters’ aim to maintain fiscal stability through protection of the retirement system and the desire to compensate employees who have incurred permanent disabilities as a result of their service with the city. It provides that all retired employees who receive a disability pension must submit a physician’s certification of their disability on a yearly basis. Additionally, the city may require employees retired pursuant to § 17-189(f) to undergo an annual medical examination. Section 17-189(h). Refusal to submit to that examination will result in the “discontinu[ation]” of pension benefits, and, if the retired employee continues to refuse the medical examination, a complete revocation of the pension may result. Id. If the medical examination demonstrates “that the disability * * * has been removed” and the retired employee has not yet reached the age of service retirement, he or she may be appointed to a comparable position within his or her former municipal department.', 'Id. Consequently, the provisions set forth in § 17-189(h) safeguard the retirement system from the form of abuse the city claims could arise by granting accidental-disability retirement to a', '“The general administration and the responsibility for the proper operation of the', 'retirement system and for making effective the provisions of this article are', 'hereby vested in a retirement board. The retirement board shall from time to time', 'establish rules and regulations for the administration and transaction of the', 'business of the retirement system, and shall perform such other functions as are', 'required for the execution of this article.” The city also cites to § 908(b)(1) of the Providence Home Rule Charter of 1980, as amended in 2006, which provides, in relevant part, that the board has the authority “[t]o establish rules and regulations for and be responsible for the administration and operation of the city employee retirement systems under its jurisdiction[.]”', '- 13 - physically incapacitated employee whose only prospect for recovery includes a surgical procedure to which the employee refuses to submit. Contrary to the city’s contention, if an employee mitigated his or her permanent disability at a later date and the disability subsequently ceased, the retired employee’s entitlement to accidental-disability pension benefits would end. Since the clear purpose of Article VI, the legislative scheme in which § 17-189(f) is situated, would not fail in the absence of a mitigation requirement, we decline to judicially impose a requirement that was omitted by the drafters of the ordinance. See Wehr, Inc., 700 A.2d at 1088.', 'In the case before us, the board determined that Prew, “who would otherwise be found permanently disabled,” was not eligible for accidental-disability retirement based on its finding that “[t]he evidence * * * does not establish that Prew is incapacitated for the performance of her job duties if she elects not to have surgery.” The board was without authority to impose that condition, and, in so doing, committed an error of law warranting relief.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we quash the decision of the City of Providence Retirement Board and remand this case to that tribunal for proceedings consistent with this opinion.

He argues that the trial justice erred by refusing to include a self-defense instruction in the jury charge. We agree; and, for the reasons set forth herein, we vacate the defendant’s conviction for felony assault.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On September 5, 2005, an altercation occurred on Pine Street in Central Falls between defendant, his cousins Roy and Lauriz1 Morillo, and the complaining witness, Anstrom Paula.2 Everyone involved in the incident knew each other well; defendant and his cousins had met Paula years earlier when Paula started dating one of their other cousins, Felicia Garcia. Paula and Garcia had a child together, became engaged, and lived together for a period of time before the relationship ended. By September 5, 2005, Paula had been dating Garcia’s sister, Amanda 1', 'The trial transcripts also spell Lauriz’s name as “Lauris.” It is not clear which spelling is correct. 2', 'Throughout the record of this case, the complaining witness is referred to as either Anstrom Paula or Anstrom Paula Diaz. It is unclear which format is correct, but because this witness introduced himself to the court as Anstrom Paula when he testified, we will refer to him as Paula.', '-1- Perez; this relationship had been kept secret from her family, however, until Perez’s mother and sister found out about it the day before the altercation occurred. On the night of September 4, Perez and Paula slept at a friend’s house. Paula drove Perez home around noon on September 5, dropping her off a short distance from her home. Before Paula had pulled away from the curb, defendant, the Morillo brothers, and a friend drove up beside Paula’s automobile, and the altercation immediately began. Several minutes later, Paula was bleeding from his head and had sustained injuries to his neck, back, right elbow, and right leg. In addition, several windows of Paula’s Honda had been broken.', 'On October 27, 2005, defendant was charged by information with two counts of felony assault pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 11-5-23 and one count of vandalism pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 11- 44-1.4 The criminal information alleged that defendant had assaulted Paula with two dangerous weapons (a baseball bat in count 1 and a shod foot in count 2) and that defendant had willfully or maliciously vandalized Paula’s vehicle (count 3). A jury trial was held in May 2006, at which the witnesses for the prosecution and the witnesses for the defense presented drastically different versions of what had transpired during the altercation. 3', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-5-2(a) states that: “Every person who shall make an assault or battery, or both, with a dangerous weapon, or with acid or other dangerous substance, or by fire, or an assault or battery which results in serious bodily injury, shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than twenty (20) years.” 4', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-44-1(a) states, in pertinent part, that:', '“Every person who shall willfully and maliciously or', 'mischievously injure or destroy or write upon, paint, or otherwise', 'deface the property of another, or obstruct the use of the property', 'of another, or obstruct another in the prosecution of his or her', 'lawful business or pursuits, in any manner, the punishment of', 'which is not specifically provided for by statute, shall be guilty of', 'a misdemeanor and shall be fined not exceeding one thousand', 'dollars ($1,000) and/or be imprisoned not exceeding one year, and', 'shall be liable to make restitution for the injury or damage caused.”', '-2-', 'According to Paula, as he pulled his car over to the curb about a block away from Perez’s house to let her out, a red car stopped in front of him. Paula testified that, while he was still sitting in the driver’s seat of his car, defendant emerged from the red car and, without speaking a word, punched him, then retrieved a red baseball bat from the red car and started hitting Paula’s car with the bat, breaking several windows. Paula “threw [him]self through the side window” of his car, and then defendant began hitting him on his head, back, and knee with the bat. Paula specifically denied ever having a knife in his possession during the confrontation. Paula testified that the assault lasted seven or ten minutes.', 'Perez’s testimony about the incident paralleled Paula’s. She recalled that, as Paula was dropping her off, a car full of her cousins and a family friend pulled up to Paula’s car. Perez testified that defendant immediately got out of his car, punched Paula in the face, then started smashing Paula’s car windows with a bat. Perez had already exited the vehicle before defendant began smashing the windows of Paula’s Honda. Perez also testified that Paula jumped out of the open front passenger window of his car, that defendant hit Paula more than eight times with the bat, and that the attack lasted more than five minutes. She also denied that Paula brandished a knife during the incident. In addition, Perez admitted that her family was angry about her relationship with Paula and that her mother may have been worried about her when she had not returned home the previous evening because she had not called her mother that night.', 'Lauriz Morillo, a New York resident, testified as a defense witness that he had been in Central Falls on September 5 to help his aunt—Perez’s mother—move to New York. Morillo testified that he, his brother Roy, and his cousin had been on their way to a barbershop when he saw Paula and Perez in a car near his aunt’s house. Morillo stated that he had been worried about Perez because he knew that she had not returned home to sleep the night before; he added', '-3- that he was not happy that Perez and Paula were dating. According to Morillo, when defendant pulled over near Paula’s car, Morillo asked Perez if she was all right and Paula told him to mind his own business. Morillo testified that, as he started to walk Perez home, Paula was arguing with him, his brother, and defendant, and that Paula pulled out a knife. Morillo also testified that his brother retrieved a baseball bat from their car. According to Morillo, Paula “was attacking [his brother] with the knife like he was going to stab him”; Paula also swung the knife at defendant, who “put his hand up and [backed] away from [Paula].”', 'Morillo further testified that his brother dropped the bat and backed away; then defendant grabbed it off the ground and moved it around in a sweeping motion. Morillo demonstrated for the jury how Paula had been jabbing with the knife while defendant had swept the bat back and forth. Significantly, Morillo testified that he observed the bat and knife collide. Morillo stated that he then watched Paula move backwards, trip over the curb, drop the knife, and hit his head on the concrete. (Conversely, Paula had denied falling over a sidewalk curb or hitting his head on the concrete.) According to Morillo, he then kicked the knife away from where Paula had fallen while defendant dropped the bat and left the area.5 Morillo testified that Paula stood up and “put his fist on [him],” and that he defended himself by striking Paula “in the face a couple of times” and “in the stomach.” Morillo further testified that defendant’s “sweeping” motion with the bat broke the windows on Paula’s car. According to Morillo, defendant did not strike Paula with the bat at any time. 5', 'Officer Anthony Paone with the Central Falls Police Department testified that, when he responded to the scene on September 5, 2005, for a “[f]ight call in progress,” he found a kitchen knife in the fenced yard adjacent to Paula’s car and he bagged the knife as evidence. Officer Paone also testified that, when he first saw the knife, it was located approximately sixteen feet from Paula’s car. The knife was admitted as a full exhibit at trial.', '-4-', 'The jury also heard testimony from one eyewitness who, while in his apartment on Pine Street at noon on September 5, 2005, observed three men attacking a woman and a man with a baseball bat. This eyewitness testified that he asked his wife to call the police and that he then went outside to stop the attack. The eyewitness stated that the only weapon he saw was the bat and that he had observed the bat complete “two blows,” one to a person’s shoulder and one to a ribcage.', 'On the fifth day of trial, defendant did not appear and his attorney was unable to locate him. Before the trial proceeded to closing arguments, the trial justice considered the state’s motion to preclude defendant from arguing self-defense during his closing argument—a motion that ultimately evolved into arguments regarding a self-defense jury instruction. The trial justice ruled that she would not instruct the jury on self-defense and that defendant would not be allowed to mention self-defense in his closing argument. After deliberations, the jury found defendant guilty of felony assault with a bat and vandalism, but acquitted defendant of felony assault with a shod foot. Counsel for defendant timely filed a motion for new trial, which was heard and denied nearly seven years later on March 5, 2013, after defendant had been arrested in Massachusetts and extradited to Rhode Island. On April 30, 2013, the trial justice sentenced defendant to a ten-year term of incarceration, with three years to serve and seven years suspended, with probation, for the felony assault conviction, and a one-year suspended term of incarceration on the conviction for vandalism, to run concurrently with the assault sentence.', 'In his appeal from the judgment of conviction, defendant argues that the trial justice erred when she granted the state’s motion to preclude defendant from discussing self-defense in his closing argument and by refusing to instruct the jury on the law of self-defense. This case initially came before us pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues', '-5- raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After oral argument we concluded that this Court would benefit from additional briefing and argument, and we reassigned this case to the full argument calendar.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“This Court conducts a de novo review of a trial justice’s refusal to instruct the jury on self-defense.” State v. Pineda, 13 A.3d 623, 631 (R.I. 2011). “If the trial justice ‘concludes that the requested instruction is not applicable, the effect of the defendant’s exception to such ruling is to require this [C]ourt to independently review the evidence and determine whether the trial justice’s concept [on self-defense] was correct.’” Id. (quoting State v. Butler, 107 R.I. 489, 491, 268 A.2d 433, 434 (1970)). “In so doing, we examine the record in a light most favorable to the defendant.” Id. “[W]e will affirm if the instructions adequately cover[ed] the law and neither reduce[d] nor shift[ed] the state’s burden of proof.” State v. Martin, 68 A.3d 467, 473 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Lopez, 45 A.3d 1, 22 (R.I. 2012)).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Waiver', 'Before we reach the merits of defendant’s claims of error by the trial justice, we must address the state’s contention that defendant has failed to adequately preserve the self-defense jury-instruction issue for review by this Court. The state’s argument that defendant has waived appellate review of this issue is two-fold; first, the state argues that defendant waived the issue by not objecting to the omission of the self-defense instruction at the end of the actual jury', '-6- charge, especially because, at the conclusion of the charge, the trial justice specifically inquired whether either party had exceptions to the charge as given and defendant’s counsel replied in the negative. Second, the state asserts that, prior to the charge, defendant’s argument that a self- defense instruction was warranted did not specify that there was sufficient evidence of assault as opposed to battery to require the self-defense instruction. According to the state, the trial justice therefore did not have the opportunity to consider whether there was sufficient evidence of assault to warrant the self-defense instruction, and the state contends that, if defendant thought that the trial justice had erred, then defendant was obligated to make this specific objection after the conclusion of the jury instructions.', 'Rule 30 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure requires that:', '“At the close of the evidence or at such earlier time during the trial', 'as the court reasonably directs, any party may file written requests', 'that the court instruct the jury on the law as set forth in the request.', 'At the same time copies of such request shall be furnished to', 'adverse parties. If a defendant relies upon an affirmative defense,', 'or justification, or matter in mitigation and wishes the court to', 'instruct the jury with respect to such, he or she shall so advise the', 'court in writing no later than at the close of the evidence. No party', 'may assign as error any portion of the charge or omission', 'therefrom unless the party objects thereto before the jury retires to', 'consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which the party', 'objects and the grounds of the party’s objection. Objections shall', 'be made out of the presence of the jury.” “The purpose of the rule is to ensure that the trial justice is alerted to any deficiencies in the charge while there is still an opportunity for cure.” State v. Davis, 131 A.3d 679, 689 (R.I. 2016) (quoting State v. Hanes, 783 A.2d 920, 924 (R.I. 2001)). “In the numerous cases where this Court has declined to address a particular issue on appeal, the reasoning is frequently directed at trial counsel’s failure to alert the trial justice to the particular objection at any point in the trial.” Id. (emphasis added). We are also mindful that another ground for waiver of an issue on appeal', '-7- is often based on our well-settled requirement that objections must be sufficiently specific “as to call the trial justice’s attention to the basis for said objection.” State v. Brown, 9 A.3d 1240, 1245 (R.I. 2010) (quoting State v. Warren, 624 A.2d 841, 842 (R.I. 1993)). We have recently held that, when a defendant objected on the record to a trial justice’s denial of a request for a specific instruction, review of the denial on appeal was preserved even though the defendant had not renewed the objection after the jury charge. Davis, 131 A.3d at 691. In doing so, we recognized that the substance of the discussions on the record regarding a particular instruction was more important than the precise form or timing of the objection. Id.', 'In the case presently before us, there is no doubt that defendant’s trial strategy involved convincing the jury that defendant’s actions on September 5, 2005, were justifiable because he had acted in self-defense. The defendant’s opening statement included specific assertions that defendant had acted in self-defense when he wielded the baseball bat.', 'The trial justice acknowledged at least twice that self-defense was an issue defendant had raised in his opening statement. In addition, during several bench conferences or sidebars throughout the trial—and prior to the state’s request to bar any mention of self-defense during closing arguments—the trial justice commented sua sponte that the evidence on the record at each point in time was not sufficient to warrant a self-defense instruction.6 6', 'During the second day of witness testimony, the trial justice asked defendant to provide her with a chronology of events, in the light most favorable to defendant, that led defendant to defend himself as well as the details of why defendant contended that “self-defense [wa]s an appropriate defense.” Later, after Morillo had testified on direct examination on the third day of witness testimony, the trial justice stated, sua sponte, that she would have been “hard pressed to instruct on self-defense” if defendant had nothing more than Morillo’s testimony because that testimony did not include that defendant struck Paula at all, just that Paula tripped, fell, hit his head and that the damage to the car windows was an accident. Partway through Morillo’s cross- examination, during a bench conference on the record, the trial justice stated, “[i]t is not self- defense. * * * Stop talking self-defense. It’s a legal defense and there is no evidence right now to suggest it.” At the conclusion of Morillo’s cross-examination, she called for a sidebar, in', '-8-', 'On the fifth day of trial, when defendant failed to appear and the parties and the trial justice agreed that the trial would continue, the state moved to preclude defendant from arguing self-defense in his closing argument. After the trial justice heard argument about whether there was sufficient evidence to support a self-defense theory, she stated that she would “exercise [her] discretion” and that while', '“the trial justice is obligated to give instructions as to those rules', 'of law that of necessity must be applied to the issue raised at trial', 'to secure a fair trial, that does not require speculation and', 'conjecture and creativity beyond the evidence. Where there is no', 'evidence to support the defense offered by an accused which raises', 'an issue of fact favorable to him, the [c]ourt should not instruct.', 'That would merely le[a]d to confusion.', '“I grant the motion. There will be no instruction on self-', 'defense, defense of others. There will be no mention in final', 'argument of that defense. This case is a case as it seems that if', 'they believe your witness, then the defendant did not in any way', 'commit a battery on the complaining witness and the defendant did', 'not in any way cause malicious damage of his property. If they', 'merely think that your witness creates a reasonable doubt as to', 'whether it occurred, there is an acquittal.” The trial justice explicitly noted defendant’s exception to her ruling. At the conclusion of the jury charge, the trial justice summoned the attorneys to the bench and asked if they had any exceptions to the charge. The defendant’s counsel replied “[n]o exception.”', 'In our opinion, defendant was not required to restate his exception at this point in time because the trial justice had already explicitly noted his exception after she initially made her ruling. In so concluding, we agree with defendant that “Rule 30 does not mechanically bar appellate review where defense counsel failed to object after the instructions were given, so long as defense counsel objected, on the record, in time for the trial court to address the complained- which she provided the attorneys with a sua sponte “heads up” that, before the redirect examination began, there was no testimony that Morillo saw contact between the bat and Paula’s hand “and unless [Morillo] actually saw it, that’s not going to support a self-defense argument.”', '-9- of error.” Given the numerous instances on the record throughout the trial in which the theory of self-defense was discussed, the trial justice was clearly on notice that defendant sought to incorporate self-defense into the jury charge and that defendant objected to the trial justice’s refusal to so instruct. The purpose of Rule 30 was, therefore, fulfilled. See Davis, 131 A.3d at 689, 691. We also conclude that defendant properly preserved this issue for our review because, when the trial justice was considering the state’s motion to preclude this affirmative defense, defendant specifically argued evidence that existed on the record that he had both assaulted and battered Paula in self-defense.', 'B', 'Self-Defense Instruction', 'The defendant argues that he was entitled to a self-defense instruction because there was sufficient evidence introduced during the trial to support his self-defense theory. The state contends, however, that there was no evidence to support a self-defense hypothesis because Morillo denied seeing defendant strike Paula’s body with the bat and maintained, rather, that Paula received head injuries when he tripped over the curb.', '“It is axiomatic that self-defense excuses or justifies an otherwise criminal assault and battery because the actor fears for [his or] her own safety and is entitled to use appropriate force to prevent, avoid, or combat an advancing attacker.” Pineda, 13 A.3d at 632. “By definition, [therefore,] the self-defense hypothesis presumes that the defendant actually committed the charged assault * * *.” Id. “[U]nder the law relating to self-defense, one may defend oneself whenever one reasonably believes that he or she is in imminent danger of bodily harm at the hands of another.” State v. Van Dongen, 132 A.3d 1070, 1079 (R.I. 2016) (quoting State v. Urena, 899 A.2d 1281, 1288 (R.I. 2006)). “Although ‘[o]ne need not wait for the other to strike', '- 10 - the first blow[,] * * * such a person must use only such force as is reasonably necessary for his [or her] own protection.’” Id. (quoting Urena, 899 A.2d at 1288). “The permissible degree of force used in defense of oneself varies with the particular set of circumstances in which he or she acts, but in no set of circumstances may one apply more than that degree of force necessary to prevent bodily injury.” Id. (quoting State v. Linde, 876 A.2d 1115, 1129 (R.I. 2005)). “In addition, a defendant who was the initial aggressor of the combative confrontation is generally not entitled to rely on self-defense.” Id. (quoting Urena, 899 A.2d at 1288).', 'A self-defense jury instruction is warranted when “the record as a whole * * * contain[s] at least a scintilla of evidence supporting the defendant’s theory.” Martin, 68 A.3d at 474 (quoting Pineda, 13 A.3d at 634). “However slight and tenuous the evidence may be on which the self-defense hypothesis is advanced, it is nevertheless there for the jury’s consideration, and the fair[-]trial concept requires that the jury consider it under an appropriate instruction.” Butler, 107 R.I. at 496, 268 A.2d at 436-37. “The fact that a trial justice does not believe the accused’s defense does not alter his [or her] obligation to submit such defense to the jury under proper instructions.” Id. at 495-96, 268 A.2d at 436. In determining whether a scintilla of evidence exists on the record to support a defendant’s self-defense theory, we have previously acknowledged that it is appropriate to “refer to other evidence not specifically elicited from the defendant.” Pineda, 13 A.3d at 631 (citing and quoting Murphy-Bey v. United States, 982 A.2d 682, 690 (D.C. 2009) (“[E]vidence [related to a theory of defense] may come from either the prosecution or the defense, or a combination of the two.”)).', 'In the case at bar, the trial justice seemingly focused on the lack of evidence that defendant actually struck Paula. Morillo’s testimony was that defendant employed a bat in a sweeping motion to keep a knife-wielding Paula at bay, and that Paula tripped over the curb,', '- 11 - hitting his head on the concrete, and then was punched in the face and stomach by Morillo. Morillo never saw the bat come into contact with any part of Paula’s body, although he said he did observe the bat and knife collide. The trial justice opined that there was no evidence of self- defense. The jury would believe either the prosecution’s version, in which Paula never had a knife, and thus convict, or the jury would credit defendant’s version, in which Paula’s injuries resulted not from being struck with the bat but rather by his tripping and hitting his head on the concrete, in which case it would acquit.', 'As a practical matter, there is much sagacity in the trial justice’s analysis. The two versions are so diametrically opposed that it would be highly unlikely that a jury would believe Paula’s testimony that defendant brutally beat him with a bat, while at the same time disbelieving Paula’s testimony that he was unarmed. The analysis overlooks the fact, however, that Morillo’s testimony that the bat came in contact with the knife may be enough to establish a battery.', 'It is well settled that “[b]attery refers to an act that was intended to cause, and does cause, an offensive contact with or unconsented touching of or trauma upon the body of another, thereby generally resulting in the consummation of the assault.” State v. McLaughlin, 621 A.2d 170, 177 (R.I. 1993) (quoting State v. Messa, 594 A.2d 882, 884 (R.I. 1991)). We have previously held that an “offensive contact with an object attached to or identified with [a person’s] body was sufficient to constitute a battery.” Picard v. Barry Pontiac-Buick, Inc., 654 A.2d 690, 694 (R.I. 1995) (where the defendant had intended to strike the camera in the plaintiff’s hand and not the plaintiff’s body). In addition, “[a]side from the obvious higher standard of proof required to establish criminal battery, the law recognizes no distinction between criminal and civil battery.” State v. Albanese, 970 A.2d 1215, 1221 (R.I. 2009) (quoting Fenwick v. Oberman, 847 A.2d 852, 855 (R.I. 2004)).', 'Here, Morillo testified that, when', '- 12 - defendant was sweeping the bat back and forth, it collided with the knife held by Paula. In our opinion, this testimony provided the required scintilla of evidence for the contact element of battery. We conclude, therefore, that defendant presented sufficient evidence, albeit slight and tenuous, to warrant a self-defense jury instruction.', 'The evidence in this case alleging self-defense suggests a similar degree of “slight and tenuous” as the case wherein we set this “slight and tenuous” threshold. See Butler, 107 R.I. at 496, 268 A.2d at 436. In Butler, 107 R.I. at 490-92, 268 A.2d at 434-35, the defendant was convicted of second-degree murder after her altercation with a man she had met in a bar ended with fatal injuries to the man. The trial justice refused the defendant’s request to instruct the jury on self-defense. Id. at 491, 268 A.2d at 434. The testimony at trial included testimony from an eyewitness, the defendant, and the pathologist who had performed the autopsy. Id. at 491-95, 268 A.2d at 434-36. The eyewitness testified that she had seen a man and a woman walk into a vacant lot, heard what sounded like someone hitting someone else with a rock, then saw the woman leave the area from which the sounds came and depart in a waiting car. Id. at 491-92, 268 A.2d at 434. This Court held that the trial justice had erred by refusing to provide a self-defense instruction to the jury because the defendant had testified that the decedent sustained his fatal head injuries after she fended off his unprovoked attack by pushing him to the ground, and the pathologist had testified that the decedent’s head injuries were consistent with either blows or falls. Id. at 493-95, 496-97, 268 A.2d at 435, 436-37. As we commented in Pineda, 13 A.3d at 633 n.9:', '“when the defendant in Butler asserted that she responded to the', 'victim allegedly grabbing her throat with a panicked push that', 'caused the victim to fall and fatally injure his head, she offered an', 'alternate theory and justification why her victim was killed by her', 'actions and why she should not be criminally responsible for', 'second-degree murder.”', '- 13 - A similar alternate theory and justification for Paula’s injuries exists in the case at bar: Morillo’s testimony that defendant struck a knife in Paula’s hand with a bat, causing Paula to stumble backwards over a curb and hit his head, coupled with Morillo’s testimony that he punched Paula after defendant had left the scene—if believed by the jury as the true version of events on September 5, 2005—provides a justification for Paula’s injuries and why defendant should not be held criminally responsible for them. Because it is well settled that “a trial justice is obligated to give a proposed instruction on self-defense ‘regardless of how slight and tenuous the evidence may be on which the self-defense hypothesis is advanced,’” Martin, 68 A.3d at 474 (quoting Linde, 876 A.2d at 1130), we conclude that the lack of a self-defense instruction as part of the jury charge entitles defendant to a new trial.', 'We turn now, briefly, to the defendant’s argument that he was entitled to a self-defense instruction on the charge of vandalism because the record reflects the required scintilla of evidence to support this affirmative defense. This Court has not recognized self-defense as justifying behavior that leads to a conviction for vandalism pursuant to § 11-44-1, and we decline the invitation to do so now. As the trial justice pointed out, the affirmative defense of accident would have been the appropriate justification defense for this charge against the defendant. Our holding with respect to the felony assault conviction does not affect the defendant’s conviction for vandalism.7 7', 'The defendant also argues that the trial justice erred as a matter of law by focusing only on the battery part of § 11-5-2—the felony assault statute—when there was sufficient evidence on the record that defendant committed assault against Paula, and that the trial justice’s proscription of a self-defense argument during the defendant’s closing argument violated his right to effective assistance of counsel. Because we are holding that there was sufficient evidence to warrant a self-defense instruction with respect to the offense of battery within the felony assault statute, we need not address the defendant’s remaining arguments on appeal.', '- 14 -', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the defendant’s conviction for felony assault with a dangerous weapon. The record in this case may be remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings.', 'Justice Goldberg, dissenting. In my opinion, the defendant, Juan Soler, waived any argument concerning the trial justice’s failure to give the jury a self-defense instruction when he went to sidebar after the trial justice instructed the jury and explicitly stated that he had “[n]o exception” to the charge. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.1', 'In my opinion, this case is distinguishable from our recent decision in State v. Davis, 131 A.3d 679 (R.I. 2016), on two significant grounds. First, Davis involved an in-court charging conference that occurred after a chambers conference and after the trial justice had provided the parties with written copies of his proposed jury instructions. See id. at 690. The defendant in Davis requested that the court instruct the jury to disregard what the prosecutor said during his opening statement about a witness who subsequently refused to testify at trial. Id. Further, defense counsel contended that, if the court refused to so instruct, then he should be allowed during his closing argument to the jury to refer to the fact that the witness did not testify.2 Id. In this case, by contrast, the colloquy that preceded the trial justice’s ruling that she would not give a self-defense instruction was precipitated by the state’s motion to preclude defendant from 1', 'I begin by noting that the case was tried in the Superior Court ten years ago. The defendant fled midtrial and was not apprehended until sometime in 2012. The defendant’s motion for a new trial was denied in March 2013, and he was sentenced in April of that year. It has taken another three years for his case to come before this Court. 2', 'This issue was not addressed by this Court.', '- 15 - arguing self-defense in his closing argument. Although the discussion morphed into one about a self-defense instruction and whether defense counsel would be permitted to argue self-defense to the jury, this exchange clearly was not a charging conference. Significantly, there was no written request to charge submitted by defendant in accordance with Rule 30 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. It is my opinion that our holding in Davis must be limited to cases in which the objection is raised on the record at a charging conference or charging hearing, after counsel has been provided with the instructions the court intends to deliver. Otherwise, we are embarking upon judicially created exceptions to our Rules of Criminal Procedure to be applied on an ad hoc basis. Such a practice will lead to inconsistent results and is wrong.', 'Second, and more significantly, in Davis, this Court was not confronted with a situation in which defense counsel went to sidebar and declared that he had no objection to the court’s instructions. In Davis, defense counsel proffered several objections at sidebar that were in addition to those raised during the earlier hearing on jury instructions. See Davis, 131 A.3d at 691. In the case at bar, defense counsel did not simply fail to object. He went much further. After the trial justice charged the jury, she asked the attorneys at a sidebar conference, “Any exceptions to the charge?” Defense counsel responded, “No exception.” Words have meaning. “No exception” means no exception. It does not mean no exception other than what was discussed earlier or no exception other than the objection to the failure to give a self-defense instruction.', 'In my opinion, Davis should not stand for, nor should it be read as having created, a court-made escape clause for cases in which counsel declares that he has “[n]o exception” or no objection to the charge. If a party wishes to preserve his objection to the jury charge, he or she should say so when asked on the record if he or she has any objection after the charge is given.', '- 16 - In this case, defense counsel never made an objection at any point in the trial. After today, a defendant could silently abandon, as a matter of trial strategy, a request for a particular jury instruction and then, if the strategy backfires, claim on appeal that the issue nevertheless was preserved under the majority opinion in this case. This Court has been careful to guard against such a situation. In State v. Cotty, 899 A.2d 482, 496-97 (R.I. 2006), this Court declared that the defendant failed to preserve for appellate review any objection to the trial justice’s refusal to give a particular instruction (request No. 30) relating to character evidence concerning the complainant. After the initial charge to the jury, defense counsel objected to the failure of the trial justice to give several instructions, including request No. 30, whereupon the court gave another series of instructions that did not include request No. 30. Id. at 497. When the trial justice again inquired of counsel if he had any objections, defense counsel responded, “No, Judge, it’s fine.” Id. This Court declared that the objection was not preserved for appellate review because', '“[t]his response could reasonably be understood to mean (1) that', 'defense counsel was satisfied that the instructions given by the trial', 'justice after [the] defendant’s objection had cured any perceived', 'error contained therein or (2) that defense counsel, for tactical', 'reasons, had opted not to pursue the matter further. If, at the end', 'of the trial justice’s supplemental charge to the jury, [the]', 'defendant still felt that the substance of the content of request No.', '30 had been omitted improperly, [the] defendant should have', 'distinctly stated his objection and the grounds for same on the', 'record at that time.” Id. (emphasis added). In the case before us, because we are confronted with an affirmative response by defense counsel that he had no exception to the trial justice’s instructions to the jury, we should follow our holding in Cotty.', 'More fundamentally, I am of the opinion that the majority’s decision today extends Davis and is a marked departure from the plain text of Rule 30. In pertinent part, Rule 30 provides that', '- 17 - “[n]o party may assign as error any portion of the charge or omission therefrom unless the party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds of the party’s objection.” (Emphasis added.) This means that, in order to assign error to any portion of a jury charge or an omission from the charge, a party must object to the charge—and that cannot be done unless the charge has been given. See State v. Williams, 432 A.2d 667, 669 (R.I. 1981) (explaining that, under Rule 30, “an objection at the conclusion of the charge [is] essential to preserve the claim of error”). Unless, as was the situation in Davis, a party actually has the written instructions in hand, I am hard-pressed to countenance a situation in which a party preserves for appellate review an objection to jury instructions that have not yet been given.', 'Significantly, in this state, Rule 30 is “patterned upon” Rule 30 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (Federal Rule 30). Reporter’s Notes to Super. R. Crim. P. 30 at 621. The practice in the federal courts, at least in the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, under the version upon which Rule 30 was patterned as well as under the current version, is that an objection must be made after the charge is given and before the jury retires to deliberate. Prior to 2002, Federal Rule 30 contained nearly identical language to that contained in our Rule 30: “No party may assign as error any portion of the charge or omission therefrom unless that party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which that party objects and the grounds of the objection.” United States v. O’Connor, 28 F.3d 218, 221 (1st Cir. 1994) (quoting Federal Rule 30). Although the pertinent language of the federal rule was amended in 2002, “[t]he amendment [did] not address the issue of whether objections to the instructions must be renewed after the instructions are given[] in order to preserve a claim of error. No change in practice [was] intended by the amendment.” Federal', '- 18 - Rule 30, Advisory Committee Notes, 2002 Amendments (emphasis added). Consistent with the explanation given in the Advisory Committee Notes to Federal Rule 30, the First Circuit has continued to apply the preservation rule that existed in that circuit before the 2002 amendment. See, e.g., United States v. Meadows, 571 F.3d 131, 146 (1st Cir. 2009); see also United States v. Gemma, 818 F.3d 23, 38 (1st Cir. 2016).', 'Thus, at the time when Federal Rule 30 contained language nearly identical to that contained in our Rule 30, federal law, which serves as our guidepost, was abundantly clear: In order to be preserved for appellate review, the objection must be made after the charge was given to the jury.3 The 2002 amendment did not change that law in any way. Our learned colleagues on the First Circuit have explained:', '“As we have repeatedly held, [Federal Rule 30] means what it', 'says. A party may not claim error in the judge’s charge to the jury', 'unless that party ‘objects’ after the judge gives the charge but', 'before the ‘jury retires,’ and, when objecting the party must ‘stat[e]', '* * * distinctly the matter to which that party objects and the', 'grounds of that objection.’” O’Connor, 28 F.3d at 221 (quoting', 'United States v. Wilkinson, 926 F.2d 22, 26 (1st Cir. 1991)', '(Breyer, C.J.), overruled in part on other grounds as stated in', 'United States v. Vázquez, 724 F.3d 15, 22 (1st Cir. 2013)). See also Meadows, 571 F.3d at 146 (“To preserve an objection to a jury instruction under [Federal Rule 30], a litigant must lodge a specific objection and state the grounds for the objection after the court has charged the jury and before the jury begins deliberations. * * * Objections registered during pre-charge hearings are insufficient to preserve the issue.” (quoting United States v. Roberson, 459 F.3d 39, 45 (1st Cir. 2006))).

Newport County Regional Young Men’s Christian Association, 966 A.2d 1242, 1246 (R.I. 2009)).', '- 19 - confronted with a case requiring us to decide whether, in the absence of a charging conference, an objection to a jury charge made before the charge is given to the jury suffices to preserve the issue for our review.', 'I am persuaded by the soundness of the First Circuit’s consistent interpretation of either version of Federal Rule 30: that the rule requires that an objection must be made after the charge is given; if no such post-charge objection is made, a pre-charge objection cannot preserve the claim of error.4', 'Because of my conclusion that the text of Rule 30 mandates that a litigant object to the jury charge after it is given, I cannot join the majority opinion in this case. In Davis, 131 A.3d at 691, this Court concluded that “we would be elevating form over substance if we were to hold that [the] defendant failed to adequately preserve the issue of the trial justice’s denial of a request for a limiting instruction.” The majority invokes a similar rationale in this case. I appreciate the concerns of my colleagues, but, in my opinion, there is no place for this sympathy. When an attorney goes to sidebar after the trial justice instructs the jury and states “[n]o exception” to the charge, particularly when that lawyer has never before articulated an objection on the record, the issue is closed.', 'The conclusion that defendant failed to preserve this issue because he failed to object after the charge was given may well represent the elevation of form over substance, but it is important to consider precisely why that is necessary. In my opinion, the text of Rule 30 4', 'I note that in State v. Palmer, 962 A.2d 758, 765-66 (R.I. 2009), this Court held that, notwithstanding the defendant’s pre-charge objection to the trial justice’s indication that he would give the jury a flight instruction, the defendant failed to preserve the issue for our review when he failed to object after the charge was given because the trial justice told the attorneys that objections to the charge should be made after it was given. In a footnote, we added that “[w]e are aware that Rule 30 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure does not explicitly mandate that objections to instructions be made after the instructions are given.” Id. at 766 n.5. In my opinion, this comment—contained in a footnote—about what the rule does not “explicitly mandate” overlooks the First Circuit’s persuasive interpretation of a once similarly worded rule upon which Rule 30 was patterned.', '- 20 - mandates that objections to the jury charge must be made after the charge is given in order to be properly preserved. It is the text of the rule that commands the triumph of form over substance, and we fail to fulfill our roles as judges when we cease to enforce clear rules whenever we deem the result unpalatable. After all, the drawbacks of a bright-line rule often go hand in hand with its virtues. Furthermore, a hard-and-fast rule provides clear guidance to the bench and bar.', 'To the extent that Davis represented the first step in a judicial departure from the language of Rule 30, this case is a leap into the unknown world of judicial fiat. It is a journey upon which I decline to embark. Unless and until Rule 30 is amended, it should be enforced as written.

4,Pedro Reyes : v. : State of Rhode Island. :,criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. The applicant, Pedro Reyes (Reyes or applicant), appeals from the denial of his postconviction-relief application. 1 It is Reyes’s contention that his 1994 plea of nolo contendere to the offense of maintaining a narcotics nuisance should be vacated because the plea was not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. He also argues that the hearing justice erroneously entered judgment for the state on his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, that the hearing justice failed to consider other arguments, and that the attorney appointed in connection with his application failed to fulfill his assigned role. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on December 1, 2015, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After carefully considering the written and oral submissions of the parties, we are satisfied that this appeal may be resolved without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'The record is unclear as to Reyes’s full name. Reyes signed his application with the name Pedro Reyes, but the caption of that document identifies him as Pedro Muriel Reyes. Additionally, during a change-of-plea hearing in 1994, Reyes indicated that his name was “Pedro Jaun [sic] Reyes Muriel.” We simply shall refer to applicant as Reyes.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In October 1993, the Attorney General’s Narcotics Strike Force (strike force) was conducting an investigation into heroin trafficking in an area near Central Falls High School. On October 5, 1993, Investigator Carl Barovier (Barovier), a member of the strike force, approached Jose Romero (Romero) to purchase heroin. 2 Romero entered Barovier’s vehicle, and the two drove to the vicinity of Central Falls High School. After Barovier parked his vehicle, Romero exited and approached Ismael Cepeda (Cepeda). 3 The two conversed briefly, and then Cepeda entered a brown Datsun vehicle that was driven by another male. The vehicle drove off, returning about ten minutes later.', 'Cepeda exited the vehicle and gave Barovier five bags containing heroin. Barovier relayed his description of the driver of the Datsun to Inspector Edward H. Randall (Randall); Randall showed Barovier a photograph of Reyes, and Barovier identified Reyes as the driver of the Datsun. Reyes was charged, along with Cepeda and Romero, with conspiracy to distribute heroin within three hundred yards of a school (count 1) and distribution of heroin within three hundred yards of a school (count 2).', 'Reyes was represented with respect to these charges by privately retained counsel (trial counsel). Eventually, the state dismissed count 2 in accordance with Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure in exchange for Reyes’s plea of nolo contendere on count 1 to an amended charge of maintaining a narcotics nuisance.

During the plea colloquy, Reyes was able to respond, in English, to the trial justice’s questions. 4 Reyes provided his name and date of birth, and he indicated that he wished to change his plea even before trial counsel responded to that question from the trial justice. Reyes stated that he understood that, by pleading nolo contendere, he was forfeiting several constitutional rights, and, when asked whether he had any questions about those rights, he responded that he did not. After the prosecutor provided the facts in support of the amended charge, Reyes accepted those facts as true. The trial justice found that Reyes “does have the capacity to understand the nature and consequences of his plea including but not limited to the waiver of those rights which I have reviewed with him” and that there was a sufficient factual basis for a plea of nolo contendere. He therefore accepted Reyes’s plea and sentenced him to a two-year suspended sentence with three years of probation. In consideration of Reyes’s plea, the state elected to refrain from presenting Reyes as a violator of a previously imposed probationary sentence.', 'Time marched on, and Reyes did not reform his behavior. He subsequently was adjudged to be a probation violator and served a period of incarceration as a result. Additionally, in 2002, he was convicted of second-degree murder, discharging a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence that resulted in death, and carrying a pistol without a license. See State v. Reyes, 984 A.2d 606, 609, 612 (R.I. 2009). 5 For those charges, Reyes was sentenced to two consecutive life sentences. Id.

Reyes received a ten-year sentence on the habitual-offender charge, to be served concurrently with his second life sentence.', 'In September 2012, Reyes filed a pro se application, in which he sought to vacate his 1994 nolo contendere plea. 6', 'The application set forth several allegations of ineffective assistance by trial counsel, which fell into two general categories:', 'failure to adequately investigate the case and prepare a defense; and failure to communicate with Reyes through an interpreter so that Reyes could meaningfully participate in the preparation of his defense, even though, according to Reyes, trial counsel knew that he “barely spoke English.” With respect to the failure-to-investigate category, Reyes averred that his codefendants in the proceedings that culminated in his 1994 plea “exonerated [Reyes] at a bail hearing,” but trial counsel failed to interview these witnesses. One of the paramount allegations in the second category—lack of communication—was that, because trial counsel failed to engage a translator, he was unable to adequately inform Reyes about the nature and consequences of his plea. In addition to his ineffectiveness claims, Reyes also alleged, citing Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238 (1969), that the trial justice erred in accepting his plea because (i) Reyes did not understand the nature of the amended charge, (ii) the trial justice overlooked the exculpatory statements of Reyes’s codefendants, and (iii) the lack of factual basis for the plea. In addition to his application, Reyes also filed a motion for appointment of counsel as an indigent applicant under G.L. 1956 § 10- 9.1-5.', 'In accordance with § 10-9.1-5, the hearing justice first referred the matter to the Office of the Public Defender. Because a conflict of interest precluded a member of that office from 6', 'Despite the lag time between the 1994 plea and the filing of the application, the state opted not to argue below that the application should be dismissed as untimely under the doctrine of laches.', '-4- representing Reyes, an attorney (postconviction counsel) was appointed to represent Reyes in connection with his application. In connection with his investigation, postconviction counsel met with Reyes on four occasions; he did not, however, speak with trial counsel. Postconviction counsel also searched for transcripts or recordings of the allegedly exculpatory bail-hearing testimony that Reyes claimed was given by his codefendants. Postconviction counsel’s search revealed that the bail hearing was continued twice with no testimony; the records for the third and final day of the bail hearing revealed that, once again, no witnesses testified and that the defendants had admitted that the state had satisfied its burden of showing that bail was not appropriate. This search led postconviction counsel to conclude that the allegedly exculpatory bail-hearing testimony did not exist. Because postconviction counsel’s investigation of Reyes’s claims led him to the conclusion that Reyes’s postconviction claims lacked merit, he moved to withdraw and filed an accompanying forty-two-page no-merit memorandum explaining the reasons behind that conclusion, in accordance with the procedure outlined by this Court in Shatney v. State, 755 A.2d 130 (R.I. 2000). 7 7', '“In Shatney [v. State, 755 A.2d 130 (R.I. 2000)], [this Court] established a procedure by which an attorney * * * who has been appointed to represent an applicant for postconviction relief may later seek to withdraw from that representation under specific and limited circumstances[.]” Campbell v. State, 56 A.3d 448, 455 (R.I. 2012). Specifically, we provided that:', '“[U]pon notice to the applicant, counsel for an applicant may request permission', 'from the court to withdraw, based upon an assessment that the application has no', 'arguable merit.

Reyes acknowledged that the memorandum discussed all of the issues that he sought to raise in his application. 8 When Reyes cryptically alluded to a letter from postconviction counsel to Reyes that, according to Reyes, indicated that postconviction counsel represented the state and not Reyes, the hearing justice properly assured Reyes that postconviction counsel was his attorney. Reyes objected to the motion to withdraw on the grounds that postconviction counsel failed to hire an interpreter or an investigator and that he failed to interview trial counsel in connection with his investigation. Postconviction counsel responded that he did not deem an interview with trial counsel to be necessary or appropriate based on his conclusion that Reyes knowingly and voluntarily entered into his plea in 1994. Postconviction counsel also explained that he did not think that an interpreter was necessary during his meetings with Reyes because Reyes had taken English classes while incarcerated and his proficiency with the English language allowed', 'applicant that he or she shall be required to proceed pro se, if he or she chooses to', 'pursue the application.” Shatney, 755 A.2d at 135. 8', 'Postconviction counsel identified twelve claims, many of which overlapped one another, that Reyes raised in his application: (1) ineffective assistance of counsel in failing to adequately prepare for representation of Reyes; (2) ineffective assistance of counsel in failing to research and interview the important state witnesses; (3) ineffective assistance of counsel in trial counsel’s failure to meet with Reyes and to communicate with him through an interpreter; (4) ineffective assistance of counsel in failing to file appropriate pretrial motions; (5) Reyes’s plea was “tainted and coerced” by the illegal and improper actions of the strike force; (6) ineffective assistance of counsel in allowing Reyes to plead nolo contendere without the assistance of an interpreter; (7) ineffective assistance of counsel in trial counsel’s failure to discuss the law governing the crimes with which Reyes was charged; (8) ineffective assistance of counsel in failing to advise Reyes as to the legal consequences of a plea of nolo contendere; (9) ineffective assistance of counsel in allowing Reyes to enter his plea when trial counsel knew, or reasonably should have known, that exculpatory evidence existed that, at the very least, cast reasonable doubt on Reyes’s guilt; (10) the photo identification in which Reyes was identified as the driver of the automobile was unconstitutional; (11) the trial justice should not have accepted his plea in 1994 because it was unclear whether Reyes understood the consequences of entering into the plea; and (12) the trial justice failed to review the case to determine whether Reyes was guilty of the charged offenses.', '-6- adequate communication between them. Postconviction counsel professed to having “absolutely no problems communicating with [Reyes] at all.”', 'The hearing justice granted the motion to withdraw and explained to Reyes that he could still proceed pro se on his application or retain another attorney at his own expense. Additionally, she gave Reyes approximately six weeks to submit a memorandum outlining why he was entitled to postconviction relief. She also notified him, in accordance with § 10-9.1-6, that she was inclined to dismiss his application on the merits unless he came forward with “something of great significance * * * that persuades the [c]ourt that [he] would have gone to trial” on the 1994 charges. During the hearing, Reyes filed a pro se motion for funds to hire a private investigator to track down his codefendants from the 1994 case. The hearing justice denied the motion, concluding that the private investigator’s efforts would reach the same conclusion that postconviction counsel had reached after his search for the bail-hearing testimony.', 'At the next hearing, Reyes provided a witness statement from Cepeda (Cepeda statement), one of his codefendants in the 1994 case. 9 In that statement, which was taken over the telephone by a private investigator, Cepeda explained that he gave testimony to the effect that he never distributed drugs with Reyes. The hearing justice continued the matter to give the state adequate time to review the Cepeda statement and to decide how to proceed.', 'At the hearing justice’s behest, the state filed a motion for summary dismissal. At the hearing on the motion for summary dismissal, the hearing justice gave Reyes an opportunity to be heard. Reyes responded as follows: “I don’t have anything to say right now. Everything that I wanted to say, I put in the memorandum.” This memorandum mentioned only two documents 9', 'See Appendix A.', '-7- in support of it: the Cepeda statement and a notice of the state’s intent to pursue a habitual offender sentence. The hearing justice determined that there were no genuine issues of material fact as to any of the claims raised in the application and granted the state’s motion. First, with respect to the allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel, the hearing justice reasoned that, because Reyes ultimately received a “less-than-jail sentence on an amended charge” and was not presented as a probation violator as a result of the plea agreement, Reyes was unable to satisfy the prejudice prong of the ineffectiveness inquiry. In addition to noting this favorable plea disposition, she observed that the Cepeda statement was neither an original document nor executed by Cepeda under the penalty of perjury and that, in any event, it was directed at the offenses with which Reyes was originally charged. The hearing justice therefore concluded that the statement “ha[d] no bearing on the amended charge to which [Reyes] pled.”', 'With respect to Reyes’s challenge to the adequacy of the 1994 plea colloquy, the hearing justice, while acknowledging the presence of the Spanish plea form, found no fault in the trial justice’s colloquy. She noted that there was no evidence in the plea-colloquy transcript that indicated that Reyes had difficulty understanding the trial justice’s questions; there was no indication that Reyes needed to speak with trial counsel during the colloquy; no request for an interpreter was made; and Reyes responded in the affirmative on numerous occasions when asked by the trial justice whether he understood a particular consequence of his guilty plea. The hearing justice rejected Reyes’s argument that either the trial justice or trial counsel was required to inform Reyes about any collateral consequence that might arise from his plea or that it might form the basis of a habitual-offender sentencing enhancement in the event that Reyes continued down the criminal path. Ultimately, the hearing justice concluded that Reyes understood the nature and consequences of his plea and that the plea was voluntary. Accordingly, the hearing', '-8- justice granted the state’s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the application under § 10-9.1-6. Reyes timely appealed. 10', 'II', 'Standard of Review for Summary Dismissal', 'Before turning to the merits of Reyes’s arguments on appeal, we first set forth the parameters under which an application can be summarily dismissed under § 10-9.1-6—the procedure utilized by the hearing justice in this case. Section 10-9.1-6 provides, in pertinent part, as follows:', '“(b) When a court is satisfied, on the basis of the', 'application, the answer or motion, and the record, that the', 'applicant is not entitled to post conviction relief and no purpose', 'would be served by any further proceedings, it may indicate to the', 'parties its intention to dismiss the application and its reasons for so', 'doing. The applicant shall be given an opportunity to reply to the', 'proposed dismissal. In light of the reply, or on default thereof, the', 'court may order the application dismissed or grant leave to file an', 'amended application or direct that the proceedings otherwise', 'continue. Disposition on the pleadings and record is not proper if', 'there exists a genuine issue of material fact.', '“(c) The court may grant a motion by either party for', 'summary disposition of the application when it appears from the', 'pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions', 'and agreements of fact, together with any affidavits submitted, that', 'there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is', 'entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”', 'Dismissal under § 10-9.1-6(b) is akin to a dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure and is subject to the same standard. Palmigiano v. State, 120 R.I. 402, 404-05, 387 A.2d 1382, 1384 (1978). In contrast, summary dismissal under § 10-9.1-6(c) 10', 'After Reyes appealed but before oral argument in this case, the General Assembly amended § 10-9.1-9 to require a party aggrieved by a final judgment entered in a postconviction-relief proceeding to seek review by filing a petition for writ of certiorari with this Court. See P.L. 2015, ch. 91, § 1; P.L. 2015, ch. 92, § 1.', '-9- “closely resembles” a grant of summary judgment under Rule 56 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, Palmigiano, 120 R.I. at 405, 387 A.2d at 1384, and “[t]he standards for granting a § 10-9.1-6(c) [summary dismissal] are identical to those utilized in passing on a summary judgment motion.”', 'Palmigiano, 120 R.I. at 406, 387 A.2d at 1385.', 'Critically, summary dismissal is improper if a genuine issue of material fact exists. See § 10-9.1-6(c). Thus, a hearing justice’s role in considering whether to dismiss an application summarily under § 10-9.1- 6(c) is limited to determining whether genuine issues of material fact exist; the hearing justice cannot resolve those issues or “pass on the weight or credibility of the evidence.” Doyle v. State, 122 R.I. 590, 594, 411 A.2d 907, 909 (1980). On appeal from a summary dismissal under § 10- 9.1-6, “[w]e will uphold the [hearing] justice’s decision only if the record shows that no genuine issue of material fact exists and the state is entitled to summary disposition as a matter of law.” Palmigiano, 120 R.I. at 406-07, 387 A.2d at 1385. As in cases in which we review the grant of summary judgment, our review is de novo. 11 See Estrada v. Walker, 743 A.2d 1026, 1028 (R.I. 1999).', 'III', 'Analysis', 'A', 'Sufficiency of Rule 11 Inquiry', 'Reyes first contends that his 1994 nolo contendere plea should be vacated because it did not conform to Rule 11 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure and was not a 11', 'In past cases involving summary dismissal of an application, we have remarked that we defer to the factual findings of a hearing justice in the postconviction-relief context. See, e.g., Miguel v. State, 774 A.2d 19, 21 (R.I. 2001). Although undeniably a correct explication of the manner in which we review the factual findings of a lower tribunal, this standard of review is inapposite in cases where the application is summarily dismissed because no such findings can be made by the hearing justice at this juncture.', '- 10 - knowing, intelligent, and voluntary plea. He argues that the trial justice’s brief colloquy at the change-of-plea hearing was insufficient to ensure that he understood the nature of the charge and consequences of his plea and that the trial justice should have exercised his discretion to appoint an interpreter. At oral argument before this Court, Reyes took his contention one step further, arguing that, whenever a Spanish language plea form is utilized, a trial justice must appoint an interpreter even when one is not requested. Neither Rule 11 nor this Court’s jurisprudence supports such an absolute rule.', 'Rule 11 provides in pertinent part:', '“The court * * * shall not accept [a plea of guilty] or a plea of nolo', 'contendere without first addressing the defendant personally and', 'determining that the plea is made voluntarily with understanding of', 'the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea. * * *', 'The court shall not enter a judgment upon a plea of guilty or nolo', 'contendere unless it is satisfied that there is a factual basis for the', 'plea.” Rule 11 thus sets forth two prerequisites that must be satisfied at the plea colloquy before a plea of nolo contendere can be accepted: (1) a determination “that the plea is made voluntarily with understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea”; and (2) a finding “that there is a factual basis for the plea.” Id. Notably, neither prerequisite imposes the bright- line rule that Reyes champions before this Court.', 'Similarly, this Court has never declared that a trial justice must appoint an interpreter in every case in which a non-English plea form is utilized. To the contrary, we have held that the trial justice has discretionary authority to appoint an interpreter, see State v. Ibrahim, 862 A.2d 787, 798 (R.I. 2004), and we afford the the trial justice “‘large discretion’ in the ‘selection, appointment, and retention of an interpreter.’” State v. Lopez-Navor, 951 A.2d 508, 513 (R.I.', '- 11 - 2008) (quoting State v. Deslovers, 40 R.I. 89, 115, 100 A. 64, 73 (1917)). 12 Absent “clear evidence of prejudice, we will not disturb the trial justice’s discretion.” Id.', 'In this case, “it is not readily apparent [from our review of the transcript of Reyes’s change-of-plea hearing] that [Reyes] did not have a basic, functional understanding of English.” Ibrahim, 862 A.2d at 798. Reyes answered all of the questions posed to him, and there is no indication that he was confused or had difficulty understanding the discourse at any point during the hearing. Reyes contends that the transcript of the change-of-plea colloquy “suggest[s] a lack of actual understanding since his responses [to the trial justice’s questions] were all non- descriptive ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ answers.” We disagree. When the trial justice asked whether Reyes wished to change his plea, Reyes answered affirmatively even before trial counsel was able to do so. Reyes also provided, without any apparent difficulty, his name and date of birth upon request. We glean nothing from the record to suggest that anything occurred at the hearing to put the trial justice on notice to inquire further into whether Reyes required an interpreter. In short, there is nothing in this record that suggests that the trial justice abused his discretion by failing sua sponte to appoint an interpreter.', 'We are also convinced that the change-of-plea colloquy otherwise satisfied Rule 11 and that Reyes’s plea was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. The trial justice explained to Reyes that he was forfeiting several constitutional rights by entering a plea of nolo contendere, and he ensured that Reyes had no questions about those rights and understood the consequences of his plea.', 'Additionally, the state recited the facts supporting the amended charge, Reyes acknowledged that those facts were true, and the trial justice found that there was a factual basis for the plea. See Rodrigues v. State, 985 A.2d 311, 315 (R.I. 2009) (“This Court ‘shall not 12', 'General Laws 1956 chapter 19 of title 8 is not implicated in this case because Reyes entered his plea before the effective date of that chapter.', '- 12 - vacate a plea unless the record viewed in its totality discloses no facts that could have satisfied the trial justice that a factual basis existed for a defendant’s plea.’” (quoting State v. Frazar, 822 A.2d 931, 935-36 (R.I. 2003))). Finally, the trial justice explained to Reyes the sentence that he would be imposing and ensured that Reyes had no questions about the consequences of the suspended sentence and accompanying probationary term. On this record, we must conclude that the trial justice’s finding that Reyes understood the nature and consequences of his plea is unassailable.', 'B', 'Ineffective Assistance of Counsel', 'Reyes next contends that the hearing justice improperly dismissed his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel because a genuine issue of material fact existed that precluded summary dismissal. Before addressing the propriety of the summary dismissal of his claims, however, we first briefly clarify the legal framework under which such a claim must be decided.', 'It is well established that, in this jurisdiction, ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims are assessed under the familiar two-pronged test announced by the United States Supreme Court in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984). See Bido v. State, 56 A.3d 104, 110 (R.I. 2012); Brown v. Moran, 534 A.2d 180, 182 (R.I. 1987); Barboza v. State, 484 A.2d 881, 883-84 (R.I. 1984). Under this framework, an applicant for postconviction relief first “must establish that counsel’s performance was constitutionally deficient; ‘[t]his requires [a] showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed * * * by the Sixth Amendment.’” Bido, 56 A.3d at 110-11 (quoting Neufville v. State, 13 A.3d 607, 610 (R.I. 2011)); see also Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687. To satisfy the performance prong, “the [applicant] must show that counsel’s representation fell below an objective standard of', '- 13 - reasonableness.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 688. Courts evaluate counsel’s performance “in a ‘highly deferential’ manner,” Bido, 56 A.3d at 111 (quoting Lynch v. State, 13 A.3d 603, 606 (R.I. 2011)), employing “a strong presumption that counsel’s conduct falls within the permissible range of assistance,” id. (quoting Neufville, 13 A.3d at 610). See also Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689.', 'The second prong of the Strickland standard requires an applicant to “show that he [or she] was prejudiced by this deficient performance.” Bido, 56 A.3d at 111 (quoting Lynch, 13 A.3d at 605). To satisfy the prejudice prong, “[t]he [applicant] must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694; see also Bido, 56 A.3d at 111.', 'In the years since our adoption of Strickland’s performance and prejudice prongs, however, a handful of our cases have somewhat amplified that standard. In State v. Dunn, 726 A.2d 1142 (R.I. 1999), we stated, in dictum, 13 that:', '“We note also that rarely, if ever, following conviction has', 'any federal or state court permitted a defendant who has been', 'represented by private counsel to later question, in post-conviction', 'proceedings, the ineffectiveness or inefficiency of the trial counsel', 'that the defendant chose and selected to represent him or her at', 'trial.

Dunn, 726 A.2d 1142, 1145-46 (R.I. 1999), we held that the trial justice clearly erred in granting the defendant’s motion for a new trial on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel—an issue that was not raised by the defendant.', '- 14 -', '(quoting Annotation, Incompetency of Counsel, 74 A.L.R.2d 1390,', '1397 (1960)) (emphasis added). Although by no means a constant feature of our ineffective-assistance-of-counsel jurisprudence, this farce-and-mockery language has reappeared on several occasions, both in cases where defense counsel evidently was privately retained 14 and in cases where it was unclear whether defense counsel was retained or appointed. 15 In this case, postconviction counsel and the hearing justice referenced this language when assessing Reyes’s allegations that trial counsel, who was privately retained, was ineffective. On appeal, Reyes argues that this language “is not part of the Sixth Amendment effective[-]assistance[-]of[-]counsel jurisprudence.”', 'We take this opportunity to abandon any distinction in our ineffective-assistance-of- counsel jurisprudence between privately retained defense counsel and court-appointed defense counsel. In Evitts v. Lucey, 469 U.S. 387, 395 (1985), the Supreme Court declared that “the constitutional guarantee of effective assistance of counsel at trial applies to every criminal prosecution, without regard to whether counsel is retained or appointed.” Similarly, in Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335, 344-45 (1980), the Supreme Court cautioned that:', '“A proper respect for the Sixth Amendment disarms', 'petitioner’s contention that defendants who retain their own', 'lawyers are entitled to less protection than defendants for whom', 'the State appoints counsel. * * * Since the State’s conduct of a', 'criminal trial itself implicates the State in the defendant’s 14', 'See, e.g., Brown v.

The farce-and-mockery standard evidently was first announced in Diggs v. Welsh, 148 F.2d 667, 669, 670 (D.C. Cir. 1945), and, by the time the United States Supreme Court decided Strickland in 1984, every federal circuit had rejected it in favor of a standard requiring reasonably competent or effective assistance. See Trapnell v. United States, 725 F.2d 149, 151-53, 155 (2d Cir. 1983) (chronicling origin of and gradual departure from farce-and-mockery standard and adopting standard of reasonably competent assistance in its place). 16 Nothing the Supreme Court said in Strickland purported to revive the farce-and-mockery standard. Moreover, the farce-and-mockery standard has its roots in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, see Diggs, 148 F.2d at 669; see also Trapnell, 725 F.2d at 154, while claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are grounded in the guarantee of the assistance of counsel contained in the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, see Strickland, 466 U.S. at 684-86, and its Rhode Island counterpart, the Declaration of Rights, article 1, section 10 of the Rhode Island Constitution, see Merida v. State, 93 A.3d 545, 549 (R.I. 2014). Henceforth, claims of ineffective assistance of counsel— whether the attorney is privately retained or court appointed—shall continue to be decided by reference to the familiar performance and prejudice prongs of the Strickland standard. 17 16', 'We also note that the annotation from which we quoted the farce-and-mockery language in Dunn, 726 A.2d at 1146 n.4, similarly predated Strickland. 17', 'We do not imply that the difference in phraseology between the performance and prejudice prongs of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), and the farce-and-mockery language would necessarily make a difference in the adjudication of an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel', '- 16 -', 'With the governing standard in proper focus, we turn to its application in this case. On appeal, Reyes contends that the Cepeda statement raised a genuine issue of material fact that precluded summary dismissal of his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. We take no issue, however, with the hearing justice’s determination that no genuine issue of material fact existed. While the Cepeda statement may cause some to have doubts about Reyes’s involvement in the 1994 incident, the statement is riddled with maladies that barred it from the hearing justice’s consideration on summary dismissal.', ""Part and parcel of our summary judgment standard (which the summary dismissal standard so closely mirrors) is that the evidence to be considered when determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists must be admissible.

Town of South Kingstown, 131 A.3d 705, 708 (R.I. 2016) (“We will affirm a lower court's decision only if, after reviewing the admissible evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, we conclude that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” (emphasis added) (quoting Daniels v.

First, the witness statement is not presented in the form of an affidavit or other type of sworn testimony, as is made obvious based upon the method of delivery (via telephone). Furthermore, the statement was somehow “notarized” by one Nicholas Cardarelli, with, in place of the witnesses’s signature, the words “RECORDED OVER TELEPHONE.” 18 In addition, to the extent that the witness statement contains statements delivered to and transcribed by Cardarelli, the statements constitute hearsay. To that end, we have held that, where statements within a sworn affidavit would constitute hearsay, such statements should not be considered in ruling on a summary judgment motion. See Nichola, 463 A.2d at 513-14. Thus, the hearing justice properly concluded that the Cepeda statement did not create a genuine issue of material fact. 19 Aside from a notice of the state’s intent to pursue a habitual offender sentence, Reyes produced nothing 18', 'Although we are not in a position to opine as to whether any of the Standards of Conduct for Notary Publics were violated, we are troubled by the fact that Cardarelli affixed his signature and notary seal to a statement that was not given in person by Cepeda, nor was it signed by Cepeda. 19', 'The dissent downplays the defective and untrustworthy nature of the Cepeda statement and suggests that the notary public’s “mistake” should not foreclose Reyes’s postconviction claim. However, because of the notary’s disregard for his duties, it is unclear whether Cepeda was even the person with whom he spoke on the telephone and from whom he received a statement. Contrary to the dissent’s insistence, the Cepeda statement was useless for purposes of opposing summary dismissal consistent with the standards underlying Rule 56 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.', '- 18 - else in opposition to the state’s motion for summary dismissal; the hearing justice properly granted the motion. 20', 'C', 'Postconviction Counsel’s Compliance with § 10-9.1-5 and Shatney', 'Finally, Reyes contends that the efforts of his postconviction counsel were inadequate. Specifically, he faults postconviction counsel for “simply respond[ing]” to Reyes’s postconviction claims instead of “mak[ing] an effort to narrow [the] issues, re[]frame[,] or supplement them,” not speaking with trial counsel or reviewing his files, and failing to hire an investigator. We reject these contentions.', '“[T]he right to counsel in a postconviction-relief proceeding is a matter of legislative grace, not constitutional right.” 21 Campbell v. State, 56 A.3d 448, 454 (R.I. 2012). Section 10- 20', 'In concluding that the production of the Cepeda statement should have precluded summary disposition, the dissent suggests that we turn both our existing postconviction relief case law and § 10-9.1-6(c) on its head. When a hearing justice grants a motion to withdraw pursuant to Shatney, the applicant has the option of proceeding pro se on his application or retaining another attorney at his own expense. See Shatney, 755 A.2d at 135. Independent of this withdrawal, if the circumstances warrant, the hearing justice “may grant a motion by either party for summary disposition of the application when * * * there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Section 10-9.1-6(c). The applicant is not entitled to any special treatment because—after his postconviction claims were determined to be meritless—he is forced to now proceed pro se. Nevertheless, the dissent suggests the system should bend over backwards for an applicant after withdrawal of postconviction counsel by allowing an applicant to oppose summary dismissal with inadmissible evidence, or, in the alternative, entitling the applicant to a warning and a second shot when he submits inadmissible evidence. This is not only impractical, but also flies in the face of longstanding authority. 21', 'Although Reyes cites Martinez v. Ryan, 132 S. Ct. 1309 (2012), in his show-cause statement for an unrelated proposition, he did not argue to the Superior Court and has not argued to this Court on appeal that there is a constitutional right to counsel in this collateral proceeding with respect to his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. The United States Supreme Court in Martinez noted that it is an open question “whether a prisoner has a [constitutional] right to effective counsel in collateral proceedings [that] provide the first occasion to raise a claim of ineffective assistance at trial,” but it did not decide that question in Martinez, id. at 1315, and has not decided it since. Because it is not properly before us in this case, we express no opinion on this issue.', '- 19 - 9.1-5 provides that, in cases like this one where the Office of the Public Defender is unable to represent the applicant, “the court shall assign counsel to represent the applicant.” As is true in other contexts, “[t]he hallmarks of a meaningful attorney-client relationship * * *, including zealous advocacy and the protection of the [client’s] confidences,” exist between the applicant and counsel appointed under § 10-9.1-5. Campbell, 56 A.3d at 454-55; see also id. at 455 (“Section 10-9.1-5 cannot be satisfied with anything less than a meaningful attorney-client relationship between appointed counsel and his or her client.”).', 'Of course, relations between attorney and client do not always remain harmonious. In some cases, postconviction applicants insist on pressing claims that are frivolous or mendacious, notwithstanding the risk of sanctions for violating Rule 11 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. 22 Attorneys who are appointed to represent a postconviction applicant, on the other hand, cannot ignore the requirements of Rule 11. In recognition of this potential conflict, we adopted a mechanism in Shatney so “that an attorney * * * appointed to represent an indigent applicant may withdraw from that representation when it becomes clear, after a reasonable investigation, that some or all of the applicant’s claims lack merit.” Campbell, 56 A.3d at 455- 56.', 'Within this framework, Reyes’s assignments of error regarding postconviction counsel are unpersuasive. Our decision in Campbell involved the paradigm example of noncompliance with § 10-9.1-5. In that case, despite the applicant’s repeated requests for counsel, the hearing justice appointed an attorney to conduct an “independent examination” of whether the 22', 'Rule 11 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, which applies in the postconviction context, see Campbell, 56 A.3d at 455, gives the trial court discretion to impose sanctions where a signed pleading, motion, or other paper is not “well grounded in fact and * * * warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law * * *.” Rule 11; see generally FIA Card Services, N.A. v.

The hearing justice repeatedly informed the applicant that the appointed counsel did not represent him. Id. at 452- 53. We determined that the appointment of counsel in Campbell failed to comply with the requirements of § 10-9.1-5. Campbell, 56 A.3d at 456, 461-62.', 'This case is nothing like Campbell. The record is clear that postconviction counsel functioned as Reyes’s attorney; 23 he met with Reyes on four separate occasions and expended considerable effort to locate the alleged exculpatory bail-hearing testimony about which, according to Reyes, trial counsel knew or should have known. At the hearing on the motion to withdraw, postconviction counsel represented that he “spent hours” attempting to locate the alleged bail-hearing testimony, and he chronicled his efforts in detail. In denying Reyes’s motion for funds to hire a private investigator, the hearing justice explained that “[postconviction counsel] did everything that [he] could do to determine if there was any recording from that hearing.” Against this backdrop, Reyes’s argument with respect to postconviction counsel’s failure to hire an investigator rings hollow. It was permissible for postconviction counsel to take it upon himself to perform the investigative responsibilities that he deemed necessary; he was not required to hire an investigator to undertake duplicative efforts. Cf. Campbell, 56 A.3d at 455- 56 (“The procedure set forth in Shatney simply applies Rule 11’s proviso to the context of the postconviction remedy, such that an attorney * * * appointed to represent an indigent applicant may withdraw from that representation when it becomes clear, after a reasonable investigation, that some or all of the applicant’s claims lack merit.” (emphasis added)). 23', 'Indeed, when Reyes expressed some confusion about whether postconviction counsel represented him or the state, the hearing justice promptly reassured him that postconviction counsel was his attorney.', '- 21 -', 'Reyes’s complaint about postconviction counsel’s failure to discuss the case with trial counsel or review his files similarly misses the mark.', 'In his no-merit memorandum, postconviction counsel focused on Reyes’s inability to establish prejudice because of the favorable disposition that trial counsel secured for his client. Postconviction counsel noted that, in marked contrast to the potential for significant jail time that Reyes faced if convicted on the original charges, trial counsel was able to persuade the state to dismiss one charge, amend the other charge to a lesser offense, agree to a non-incarcerative sentence, and refrain from presenting Reyes as a probation violator. While Reyes was insisting that exculpatory testimony mirroring the allegations in the Cepeda statement was given at his bail hearing, postconviction counsel had expended considerable effort to locate this alleged bail-hearing testimony to no avail, and the hearing justice appropriately concluded that “there was no testimony given under oath exonerating [Reyes in] this matter.” Thus, Reyes’s claim attacking postconviction counsel’s alleged shortcomings is without merit.', 'Finally, it is significant that, pursuant to Shatney, 755 A.2d at 135, postconviction counsel filed a comprehensive memorandum in which he—as Reyes acknowledged at the hearing on the motion to withdraw—correctly identified each of the many claims asserted in Reyes’s application and thoroughly explained the reasons why, in counsel’s professional opinion, they lacked merit. On appeal, Reyes complains that postconviction counsel failed to narrow or reframe the claims contained in his application, but appellate counsel similarly makes no effort to articulate how those claims could have been reworked, and an attorney will not always be able to salvage a meritless application from the scrap heap. Cf. Campbell, 56 A.3d at 458 (explaining that “appointed counsel may, in an appropriate case, frame the applicant’s claims in such a way as to avoid § 10-9.1-8’s waiver rule”).', 'We note that a tension is', '- 22 - unavoidable in cases in which the Shatney procedure is invoked. Our decisions in Campbell and Shatney recognize that, in some cases, appointed counsel’s efforts must, at some point, shift from diligent investigation and meaningful representation to dispassionate explanation of why, in the exercise of counsel’s professional judgment, the claims lack merit. See Campbell, 56 A.3d at 455-56; Shatney, 755 A.2d at 135. Importantly, this is a case where the paradigm shift properly occurred, whereas Campbell involved a situation where counsel acted as an objective, independent, and dispassionate outsider from the outset.', 'For these reasons, we conclude that postconviction counsel functioned as Reyes’s attorney and, because he deemed Reyes’s application to be meritless based on the record that existed at that time, he complied with the procedure outlined in Shatney. See Shatney, 755 A.2d at 135. Similarly, the hearing justice complied with our directive in Shatney that a hearing be held at which Reyes was able to respond to the no-merit memorandum, and, at the conclusion of the hearing, she appropriately granted the motion to withdraw. 24 See id.', 'Although we affirm the hearing justice’s decision to allow postconviction counsel to withdraw, we nonetheless pause to remind the bench and the bar that the Shatney procedure is not the endgame. An attorney is not appointed under § 10-9.1-5 to perform a screening function or to steer the case towards the filing of a no-merit memorandum and then withdraw from the arena. Rather, § 10-9.1-5 directs that an attorney be appointed to represent the applicant in connection with the litigation of his or her application, see Campbell, 56 A.3d at 454-56, 461, 24', 'The dissent states that it is “compelled to express [its] belief that the time has come to abrogate Shatney, at least as it relates to first-time applicants.” As the dissent recognizes, however, “Shatney’s life expectancy was not addressed by the parties in this case[,]” and, thus, is not before this Court. We agree that this issue is not before us, and decline to address it further. The hearing justice and postconviction counsel properly followed the Shatney procedure, which was the law at the time of the hearings below and the time the appeal was taken, and which continues to be the law today.', '- 23 - and the Shatney procedure is a judicially created escape hatch to be opened only in those cases where the appointed attorney’s obligations under Rule 11 require withdrawal because the only alternative, in counsel’s professional opinion, is the impermissible pursuit of irremediably frivolous claims. 25', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons articulated above, we affirm the judgment summarily dismissing Reyes’s application. The papers may be remanded to the Superior Court. 26 25', 'We reiterate that an attorney’s reluctance or refusal to accept an appointment “is not embraced by the dictates of Shatney * * *, and the fact that counsel may decline the appointment should not result in the summary dismissal of an applicant’s claims absent compliance with § 10-9.1-5.” Campbell, 56 A.3d at 456 n.5; see also Shatney, 755 A.2d at 136 (“The appointment of Shatney’s first counsel, who then limited her entry of appearance and apparently declined to pursue the application and/or withdrew before pursuing petitioner’s claim, before the court allowed her to withdraw, and before the court passed on the alleged lack of merit of such an application, did not fulfill the requirements of § 10-9.1-5 in this case.”). 26', 'Notwithstanding the state’s failure to raise the doctrine of laches before the hearing justice, the state argued in its papers to this Court that review of that issue “is not necessarily foreclosed.” At oral argument, however, the state conceded that, because this affirmative defense was not raised below, it has been waived. This concession is well-taken. See Andrukiewicz v. Andrukiewicz, 860 A.2d 235, 241 (R.I. 2004) (holding that the plaintiff failed to preserve defense of laches for appellate review where the plaintiff failed to raise it before the trial justice).', '- 24 -', 'Justice Goldberg, with whom the Chief Justice joins, concurring in part and dissenting in part.

Dunn, 726 A.2d 1142, 1146 n.4 (R.I. 1999), and its progeny and to reiterate that Rhode Island is, henceforth, a strictly Strickland 2 jurisdiction with respect to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.', 'I part company with my colleagues, however, on the issue of whether the hearing justice’s summary dismissal of Reyes’s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel was proper. These claims alleged violations of a fundamental constitutional right. This first PCR application 1', 'I note that I am not convinced that the trial justice properly concluded that there was a sufficient factual basis for the plea—a requirement of Rule 11 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. However, Reyes’s argument on appeal focused exclusively on the trial justice’s failure to appoint an interpreter sua sponte. Apart from one sentence in his show-cause statement in which he asserted “there is neither a discussion of Mr. Reyes’[s] role in the amended charge of maintaining a narcotics nuisance, nor of his understanding of that charge,” the entirety of his argument on appeal concerns the failure to appoint an interpreter. In my opinion, this single sentence fails to adequately develop—and, therefore, preserve for this Court’s review—any argument concerning the lack of factual basis for the plea. See McMahon v. Deutsche Bank National Trust Co., 131 A.3d 175, 176-77 (R.I. 2016) (mem.); see also United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (“It is not enough merely to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way, leaving the court to do counsel’s work, create the ossature for the argument, and put flesh on its bones. * * * ‘[A] litigant has an obligation to spell out its arguments squarely and distinctly, or else forever hold its peace.’” (quoting Rivera-Gomez v. de Castro, 843 F.2d 631, 635 (1st Cir. 1988)). 2', 'Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 688 (1984).', '- 25 - was Reyes’s one and only chance to assert these claims. The attorney who was appointed to represent Reyes concluded—without conferring with Reyes’s trial counsel—that these claims lacked merit. This determination was premature. Reyes was then forced to represent himself and was instructed by the hearing justice to come forward with “something of great significance.” He did so. Reyes presented the hearing justice with the Cepeda statement before the state filed its motion for summary dismissal under G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-6(c). Although the majority claims that the Cepeda statement is “riddled with maladies,” all of the supposed “maladies” stem from one aspect of the statement: The registered notary public took the statement over the telephone and notarized it, rather than having Ismael Cepeda (Cepeda) swear to its contents in his presence. 3 The hearing justice considered the Cepeda statement and nonetheless summarily dismissed Reyes’s ineffectiveness claims.', 'In concluding that the hearing justice was “barred” from considering the Cepeda statement, the majority overlooks four critical facts. First, Reyes was forced to proceed pro se after postconviction counsel, who was statutorily required to represent him zealously, jumped ship long before Rule 11 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure required such a drastic course of action. Second, the Cepeda statement—which the majority analyzes as if it were a document submitted in opposition to a summary-judgment motion—was submitted before the state moved for summary dismissal under § 10-9.1-6(c). Third, the state did not coherently raise any argument that the hearing justice was barred from considering this document at the summary-dismissal stage, nor did the hearing justice hold that she was so constrained. Fourth, the “maladies” of which the majority complains were caused by the actions of the notary and not by Reyes, who remained in prison, stripped of counsel and forced to proceed pro se. In my 3', 'A copy of the Cepeda statement is appended to this opinion. The notary seal is visible in a copy of the statement in the lower-court file.', '- 26 - opinion, summary dismissal of these claims was improper; an evidentiary hearing, at which Reyes would have been accorded his right to counsel, was required. Therefore, I respectfully dissent and express my concern about the posture the majority has taken in this appeal.', 'Timing and Nature of Claims of Ineffective Assistance of Counsel', 'In this jurisdiction, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel ordinarily cannot be addressed by this Court on direct appeal; instead, such claims must be asserted in a PCR application. 4 See State v. Brouillard, 745 A.2d 759, 768 (R.I. 2000). At the same time, the statutory framework governing the PCR context mandates that, in most cases, an applicant will have but one opportunity to press a claim for postconviction relief. Section 10-9.1-8 provides that:', '“All grounds for relief available to an applicant at the time', 'he or she commences a proceeding under this chapter must be', 'raised in his or her original, or a supplemental or amended,', 'application. Any ground finally adjudicated or not so raised, or', 'knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived in the proceeding', 'that resulted in the conviction or sentence or in any other', 'proceeding the applicant has taken to secure relief, may not be the', 'basis for a subsequent application, unless the court finds that in the', 'interest of justice the applicant should be permitted to assert such a', 'ground for relief.” 4', 'A narrow exception to this general rule exists where the claim is based on a “specific, reviewable ruling” by the trial justice. State v. Pineda, 13 A.3d 623, 635 (R.I. 2011). It is the rare case in which this exception applies.', '- 27 - The upshot is that, in this jurisdiction, a criminal defendant has one and only one opportunity to assert a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, and that opportunity almost always must occur in the PCR context. See Martinez v. Ryan, 132 S. Ct. 1309, 1315 (2012) (explaining that, when claims of ineffective assistance of counsel can be raised only in a collateral proceeding, such as the PCR context in this state, “the initial-review collateral proceeding [is] a prisoner’s ‘one and only appeal’ as to an ineffective-assistance claim”).', 'Compounding matters, a claim alleging ineffective assistance of counsel is of paramount importance. As the United States Supreme Court has explained, “[t]he right to the effective assistance of counsel at trial is a bedrock principle in our justice system” and “the foundation for our adversary system.” Martinez, 132 S. Ct. at 1317. For this reason, it is critical that a PCR applicant be afforded a meaningful opportunity to vindicate such a claim. As the Supreme Court has suggested, such an opportunity may require effective assistance of counsel in the PCR context:', '“Without the help of an adequate attorney, a prisoner will have', '* * * difficulties vindicating a substantial ineffective-assistance-of-', 'trial-counsel claim. Claims of ineffective assistance at trial often', 'require investigative work and an understanding of trial strategy.', 'When the issue cannot be raised on direct review, moreover, a', 'prisoner asserting an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim', 'in an initial-review collateral proceeding cannot rely on a court', 'opinion or the prior work of an attorney addressing that claim.', '* * * To present a claim of ineffective assistance at trial in', 'accordance with the [s]tate’s procedures, then, a prisoner likely', 'needs an effective attorney.” Id. The majority concludes—correctly, in my opinion—that this case does not present the question of whether the United States Constitution requires that a PCR applicant asserting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel be afforded effective assistance of counsel in the PCR context. See id. at 1315 (noting this open question).', 'However, Martinez instructs that a claim of', '- 28 - ineffective assistance of counsel cannot be given short shrift merely because it is asserted for the first time in the PCR context and not on direct appeal. To the contrary, the claim must receive serious consideration. 5', 'Postconviction Counsel’s Compliance with § 10-9.1-5', 'The General Assembly has mandated that:', '“An applicant who is indigent shall be entitled to be', 'represented by the public defender. If the public defender is', 'excused from representing the applicant because of a conflict of', 'interest or is otherwise unable to provide representation, the court', 'shall assign counsel to represent the applicant.” Section 10-9.1-5. This unambiguous statutory text contains no exception: A PCR applicant has the unqualified statutory right to appointed counsel who “represent[s] the applicant.” Id.', 'This Court, however, has qualified and cabined a PCR applicant’s right to counsel. In Shatney v. State, 755 A.2d 130, 135 (R.I. 2000), this Court “established a procedure by which an attorney * * * who has been appointed to represent an applicant for postconviction relief may 5', 'During one of the hearings in this case, the following exchange transpired between the hearing justice and Reyes:', '“[THE COURT:] * * * Now, sir, I also have to note that you are doing a', 'life sentence for a separate offense.', '“THE DEFENDANT: Yes.', '“THE COURT: Why are we going through this exercise?', '“THE DEFENDANT: Based on this case, I got a different sentence in the', 'other case, habitual.', '“THE COURT: But you’re still doing two life sentences.” The length of the sentences that Reyes may have received in other, unrelated cases was, of course, utterly irrelevant to the merits of Reyes’s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.

State, 56 A.3d 448, 455 (R.I. 2012). In broad strokes, Shatney allows an applicant’s appointed counsel to withdraw after filing a so-called “no-merit” memorandum containing a description of the extent of counsel’s review of the case and an explanation of why the issues raised in the application lack merit. Shatney, 755 A.2d at 135. At that point, the hearing justice is obligated to conduct a hearing in the applicant’s presence. Id. If the hearing justice agrees that the claims “lack any arguable merit,” the motion to withdraw may be granted, and the applicant is advised of the right to proceed pro se. Id. (emphasis added).', 'As aptly set forth by the majority, the Shatney procedure represents nothing more than “a judicially created escape hatch” available only when continued litigation of the PCR application would violate Rule 11 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. See Campbell, 56 A.3d at 455-56 (“The procedure set forth in Shatney simply applies Rule 11’s proviso to the context of the postconviction remedy, such that an attorney * * * appointed to represent an indigent applicant may withdraw from that representation when it becomes clear, after a reasonable investigation, that some or all of the applicant’s claims lack merit.”). In other words, Shatney was not meant to water down the quality or extent of the legal representation that § 10-9.1-5 clearly grants to an indigent PCR applicant.', 'In the sixteen years since Shatney was decided, the procedures that have arisen scarcely resemble what was envisioned by the Shatney Court. A veritable cottage industry has arisen whereby court-appointed lawyers are proceeding as if charged with screening out meritless applications for the ax of summary dismissal. Along the way, Shatney has been transmuted from an interpretive effort to achieve coexistence between § 10-9.1-5 and Rule 11 into a high hurdle that PCR applicants must surmount in order to receive serious consideration of their claims on', '- 30 - the merits. Our decision in Campbell, which the majority characterizes as the most egregious example of how Shatney has evolved, is by no means an outlier. See, e.g., Garcia v. State, 91 A.3d 359, 359-60 (R.I. 2014) (mem.); Motyka v. State, 91 A.3d 351, 351-52 (R.I. 2014) (mem.); Ramirez v. State, 89 A.3d 836, 838-40 (R.I. 2014); Rodriguez v.

This Court’s concerns about the denial of the right to counsel and an evidentiary hearing have caused us to modify Shatney’s application to cases involving life without parole. See Tassone v. State, 42 A.3d 1277, 1287 (R.I. 2012). I am compelled to express my belief that the time has come to abrogate Shatney, at least as it relates to first-time applicants. 6', 'See Campbell, 56 A.3d at 458-59 (explaining important distinction between first application and subsequent applications with respect to right to appointed counsel under § 10-9.1-5).', 'I am mindful, however, that Shatney’s life expectancy was not addressed by the parties in this case. I therefore proceed to analyze postconviction counsel’s efforts under the existing regime, such as it is. In my opinion, the hearing justice erred in permitting postconviction counsel to withdraw pursuant to Shatney and in failing to reappoint counsel after the Cepeda statement was produced. 7 In order to conclude that Rule 11 required him to withdraw under the Shatney procedure, postconviction counsel must have reached the point that, in his opinion, Reyes’s claims were not “well grounded in fact and * * * warranted by existing law or a good[-]faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law.” Rule 11 of 6', 'As a member of the Shatney Court, I can state with confidence that “‘[t]he matter does not appear to me now as it appears to have appeared to me then.’” McGrath v.

In his no-merit memorandum, postconviction counsel concluded that Reyes’s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel were meritless because Reyes could not satisfy either the performance or prejudice prong of Strickland. In my opinion, postconviction counsel’s efforts on Reyes’s behalf were insufficient to justify this conclusion. Indeed, postconviction counsel did not even speak with trial counsel.', 'Assessment of whether an alleged ground of ineffective assistance of counsel meets the performance and prejudice prongs is a case-specific inquiry. In the past, this Court has not hesitated to vacate the summary dismissal of an applicant’s claims of ineffectiveness where the record did not clearly support the conclusion that one of the prongs had not been met. See, e.g., Tassone, 42 A.3d at 1286 (“[T]he absence of a transcript, coupled with the lack of an evidentiary hearing, precluded the court from conducting an adequate, independent review of trial counsel’s actions and from ‘look[ing] at the entire performance of counsel.’ * * * No evidentiary hearing was conducted to explore the validity of [the] applicant’s arguments, thus leaving unexamined the foundation for a ‘reasonable probability’ that[,] but for trial counsel’s errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.” (quoting Brown v.

Critically, Reyes’s 1994 conviction resulted from a plea of nolo contendere in the Superior Court to an amended charge of maintaining a narcotics nuisance. Because there was no trial, a trial transcript from which an assessment of trial counsel’s efforts can be made is not available. Cf. State v. D’Alo, 477 A.2d 89, 91 (R.I. 1984) (“In determining whether a trial counsel’s performance was effective, no evidence is more probative than the trial transcript, for through the transcript a trial justice hearing a petition for postconviction relief can observe, albeit second-hand, what actually happened as far as the trial counsel’s actions are concerned. Accordingly, the trial justice hearing the petition in the present case had sufficient evidence before him to assess the performance of [the] defendant’s trial counsel.”). Although the four- page transcript of the change-of-plea colloquy was attached to Reyes’s PCR application, the vast majority of Reyes’s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel had nothing to do with trial counsel’s actions or inactions at the plea hearing.', 'The transcript sheds no light on the reasonableness of trial counsel’s performance with respect to these allegations of ineffectiveness. Notwithstanding this deficiency, postconviction counsel elected not to confer, in any way, with trial counsel. Even more remarkably, he concluded that Reyes failed to satisfy the performance and prejudice prongs. In doing so, postconviction counsel failed to function as Reyes’s attorney.', 'For starters, he made unfounded assumptions regarding trial counsel’s performance and overlooked the fact that it was his job—in the course of fulfilling his duty to represent Reyes zealously—to determine if a nonfrivolous argument could be asserted that trial counsel’s performance was unreasonable. “[A] fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel’s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel’s perspective at the', '- 33 - time.” Lynch v. State, 13 A.3d 603, 606 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 689 (1984)) (emphasis added).', 'By failing to even speak with trial counsel, postconviction counsel wholly failed to perform this fair assessment.', 'Instead, he simply assumed that trial counsel rendered effective assistance. For example, he speculated that trial counsel “had a good understanding as to the state of the evidence against his client.” How do we know that from this record? Likewise, he stated that trial counsel “was not provided concrete information that there was additional exculpatory evidence other than what already existed.” I see no evidentiary support for this statement in the record.', 'The undeniable fact that postconviction counsel simply was assuming away the critical issue of whether trial counsel’s performance violated the Strickland standard is evident from the following passage of his no- merit memorandum:', '“In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, it is fair to', 'assume that Reyes’[s] counsel complied with his responsibilities as', 'an attorney concerning open and honest communications with his', 'client, and that he communicated with his client in a means', 'efficient enough so that they had meaningful discussions regarding', 'the case.” (Emphasis added.) Fair to whom? Certainly not to Reyes, his client, who was owed a duty of zealous advocacy. In the absence of at least a conversation with trial counsel, postconviction counsel’s conclusion that Reyes’s claims were meritless must be recognized for what it is: a premature effort to withdraw from the case. 8 Cf. Tassone, 42 A.3d at 1286 (“[T]he absence of a transcript, coupled with the 8', 'These are not merely isolated passages in postconviction counsel’s no-merit memorandum. Rather, the notion that trial counsel must have rendered effective assistance of counsel is a theme that permeates the entirety of the memorandum. See, e.g., Postconviction Counsel’s No-Merit Memorandum at 25 (“[Reyes] was represented by very competent defense counsel who obviously did not feel that the services of an interpreter were necessary in order for his client to understand the plea colloquy with the [c]ourt.” (emphasis added)); id. at 15 (“Reyes has not presented any evidence to prove that his attorney acted in anything other than a competent manner.”); id. at 19 (“In and [of] itself[, trial counsel’s failure to file a pretrial discovery motion]', '- 34 - lack of an evidentiary hearing, precluded the court from conducting an adequate, independent review of trial counsel’s actions and from ‘look[ing] at the entire performance of counsel.’” (quoting Brown, 964 A.2d at 528)).', 'At the hearing on the motion to withdraw, postconviction counsel explained that he “did not feel it was necessary to speak to [trial counsel]” because he concluded that Reyes entered into a knowing and voluntary plea. However, the fact that the 1994 plea may have been voluntary, knowing, and intelligent does not bar claims of ineffective assistance of counsel relating to trial counsel’s advice leading to the decision to enter the plea. See State v. Dufresne, 436 A.2d 720, 722, 723 (R.I. 1981) (“The focus of a postconviction inquiry when there has been a guilty plea is the nature of counsel’s advice concerning the plea and the voluntariness of the plea. * * * A defendant who pleads guilty on the advice of counsel must demonstrate at his postconviction hearing that that advice was not within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.”). Reyes’s claims attack the effectiveness of trial counsel in advising him to enter a plea of nolo contendere. Therefore, the fact that Reyes’s plea was otherwise voluntary, knowing, and intelligent was no excuse for postconviction counsel’s failure to speak with trial counsel.', 'Postconviction counsel alluded to a second reason for not interviewing trial counsel: that, irrespective of whether Reyes could satisfy the performance prong, he was unable to satisfy the does not mean that counsel was anything less than diligent in his representation of [Reyes]; there are many reasons why counsel might elect not to file for discovery. In many cases, it is because counsel might not want to file an Answer to the State’s Motion for Reciprocal Discovery, thereby having to give to the [s]tate any evidence that they might not want to divulge.” (emphases added)); id. at 9 (“I should point out that the defense counsel in this case was, and is, a very experienced and respected member of the defense bar who has represented hundreds of criminal defendants in all levels of the judicial system, both [s]tate and [f]ederal. He enjoys a well-deserved reputation as a hard[]working, top-notch criminal defense attorney who is not afraid to try a case in front of a jury.”); id. at 28 (“It is difficult to second guess the work of an attorney when there was a negotiated plea.”).', '- 35 - prejudice prong because of the highly favorable disposition of the charges. To be sure, this Court previously has explained that, “when counsel has secured a shorter sentence than what the defendant could have received had he gone to trial, the defendant has an almost insurmountable burden to establish prejudice.” Neufville v. State, 13 A.3d 607, 614 (R.I. 2011). The assessment of the strength of a negotiated agreement, however, cannot occur in a vacuum. The need for a conversation with trial counsel flows in no small part from the unique relationship between the facts of this case and the amended charge to which Reyes pled. Anyone familiar with the disposition of criminal cases in this state would recognize that the plea agreement in this case— in which, based on a single delivery of heroin, a two-count criminal information charging distribution of heroin within three hundred yards of a school and conspiracy to commit that offense was amended to a single count of maintaining a narcotics nuisance—was not a typical disposition.', 'A conviction for maintaining a narcotics nuisance under G.L. 1956 § 21-28- 4.06(b)(1)(a) requires proof of “acts [that] are recurrent or of [a] habitual nature”; a single drug transaction is an insufficient basis upon which to convict for this offense. State v. Reis, 430 A.2d 749, 753 (R.I. 1981); see id. at 754 (“[Section] 21-28-4.06 requires a showing of more than an isolated instance of the prohibited activity.”); see also id. at 753, 754 (reversing the defendant’s convictions for maintaining a narcotics nuisance where “[t]here was absolutely no evidence, apart from this single incident, that [the] defendant used his apartment or his car for the unlawful keeping or sale of a controlled substance.” (emphasis added)). Accordingly, the single drug buy set forth in the criminal information was insufficient as a matter of law to constitute the offense of maintaining a narcotics nuisance.', 'This fact should have alerted postconviction counsel of the need to consult trial counsel.', '- 36 -', 'The disposition in this case might have been highly favorable if the state’s evidence was strong and Reyes had little in the way of a defense. On the other hand, the negotiated plea agreement appears less favorable if the state’s evidence was weak, Cepeda is deemed a credible witness, and exculpatory evidence exists and is sufficiently persuasive to create a reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been an acquittal. When compared to an acquittal, the disposition in this case—even without jail time—loses much of its luster; it operated as a felony conviction, it carried a term of probation (the violation of the terms and conditions of which landed Reyes in prison), and it served as one of the predicate offenses that qualified Reyes as a habitual offender. It is therefore unsurprising that the assessment of the strength of the disposition in relation to the prejudice prong of Strickland is not often made at the summary-dismissal stage. See Neufville, 13 A.3d at 611, 614 (commenting on the effect of a shorter sentence on the prejudice prong in a case where an evidentiary hearing was held and findings of fact were made); Rodrigues v. State, 985 A.2d 311, 316, 317 (R.I. 2009) (similar); Hassett v. State, 899 A.2d 430, 436-37 (R.I. 2006) (similar); cf. Tassone, 42 A.3d at 1286 (“No evidentiary hearing was conducted to explore the validity of [the] applicant’s arguments, thus leaving unexamined the foundation for a ‘reasonable probability’ that[,] but for trial counsel’s errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.”). Consequently, postconviction counsel’s premature assessment of the strength of the disposition did not justify his failure to interview trial counsel.', 'In granting postconviction counsel’s motion to withdraw, the hearing justice failed to set forth her reasons for accepting his assessment of Reyes’s claims as meritless. Indeed, the hearing justice notified Reyes that she was “not determining whether or not there’s merit to your case.” (Emphasis added.) This is error. There is no showing on this record that the hearing', '- 37 - justice conducted the independent review that Shatney requires as a prerequisite to permitting counsel to withdraw; in fact, she declared just the opposite. See Shatney, 755 A.2d at 135 (“If, based upon its review of counsel’s assessment of the potential grounds for seeking post[]conviction relief and of any other issues that the applicant wishes to raise, the court agrees that those grounds appear to lack any arguable merit, then it shall permit counsel to withdraw * * *.” (emphases added)). Without a finding that the grounds set forth in the application lack any arguable merit—which, in my opinion, could not be made when no effort was made to contact trial counsel—the hearing justice should not have permitted postconviction counsel to withdraw.', 'In sum, postconviction counsel failed to appreciate his role as Reyes’s attorney, and the hearing justice erroneously granted him a free pass in permitting him to withdraw from the representation. This case is yet another example of the injustice that can accompany the Shatney procedure, which operates simultaneously as an additional court-made hurdle for PCR applicants to overcome and a mechanism for less-than-full-fledged representation of indigent applicants. Indeed, had Reyes received the counsel envisioned by § 10-9.1-5—to which he was undeniably entitled—his counsel likely would have recognized the “maladies” of the Cepeda statement and rectified them to ensure that Reyes received full and fair consideration of his constitutional claims.', 'Consideration of the Cepeda Statement', 'The hearing justice’s error in granting postconviction counsel’s motion to withdraw, standing alone, supplies adequate and persuasive grounds to vacate the summary dismissal of Reyes’s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.', 'Nonetheless, I proceed to note my', '- 38 - disagreement with the majority’s incongruous decision to affirm the hearing justice’s summary dismissal of the application on the ground that she erred in considering the Cepeda statement.', 'Immediately after the hearing justice granted postconviction counsel’s motion to withdraw, Reyes moved for funds to hire a private investigator. Reyes explained that, because “the records [of the alleged exculpatory testimony of one of his accomplices] are nowhere to be found,” “the investigator would only need to get the testimony from the witness.” The hearing justice denied the motion. She then warned Reyes that, “unless there is something of great significance in your memorandum that persuades the [c]ourt that you would have gone to trial and the result would have been different, then the [c]ourt may very well be dismissing your case.”', 'Against all odds, Reyes—who remained incarcerated, indigent, and uncounseled— persuaded Nicholas Cardarelli (Cardarelli), a private investigator and notary public in this state, to work on his behalf in an effort to come forward with “something of great significance.” He did so. Cardarelli tracked down Cepeda and took a statement from him that directly bears on the question of Reyes’s innocence. Reyes produced the Cepeda statement at the next hearing, before the state filed—at the hearing justice’s suggestion—its motion for summary dismissal under § 10-9.1-6(c). Although noting certain “infirmities” of the Cepeda statement, the hearing justice explicitly considered it: “On the basis then of the application, all of the materials that have been submitted, including, for what it’s worth, the statement by Mr. Cepeda, that is not a sworn statement or an affidavit by Mr. Cepeda, the [c]ourt finds that there is no need to proceed further.” (Emphasis added.) The majority declares that the hearing justice erred in considering the statement because it concludes that the Cepeda statement “is riddled with maladies that', '- 39 - barred it from the hearing justice’s consideration on summary dismissal.” In my opinion, this conclusion is erroneous on at least three independent grounds.', 'First, the majority treats the Cepeda statement as if it were submitted in opposition to the state’s summary-dismissal motion. It was not. The Cepeda statement was submitted in response to the hearing justice’s notice, required by statute, of her intention to dismiss Reyes’s application and her corresponding warning that she would dismiss the application unless Reyes came forward with “something of great significance.” See § 10-9.1-6(b) (“When a court is satisfied, on the basis of the application, the answer or motion, and the record, that the applicant is not entitled to post[]conviction relief and no purpose would be served by any further proceedings, it may indicate to the parties its intention to dismiss the application and its reasons for so doing.”). At the time that Reyes produced the Cepeda statement, the state’s motion for summary dismissal under § 10-9.1-6(c) had not yet been filed. Therefore, the majority’s conclusion that the Cepeda statement could not be considered by the hearing justice because it is not the type of admissible evidence that can competently defeat a summary-dismissal motion flows from an erroneous starting premise.', 'Because the Cepeda statement was submitted in response to the hearing justice’s notice of proposed dismissal under § 10-9.1-6(b), that statutory section—and not the requirements of Rule 56(e) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure and this Court’s summary-judgment case law—governs its consideration. In my opinion, the hearing justice, after reviewing the Cepeda statement (which exculpates Reyes), should have realized her mistake in allowing postconviction counsel to withdraw and directed that further proceedings occur at which—at a minimum—Reyes would be provided with an attorney willing to confer with trial counsel or with a view toward securing his testimony at an evidentiary hearing. See § 10-9.1-6(b) (“The', '- 40 - applicant shall be given an opportunity to reply to the proposed dismissal. In light of the reply, or on default thereof, the court may order the application dismissed or grant leave to file an amended application or direct that the proceedings otherwise continue.” (emphases added)). Instead, the hearing justice invited the state to file a motion for summary judgment, considered the Cepeda statement, and concluded—erroneously, in my view, see infra—that it was irrelevant. The hearing justice’s authority to consider the Cepeda statement was not restricted by this Court’s summary-judgment jurisprudence because the state had not yet proceeded down that path.', 'Second, neither the state nor the hearing justice warned Reyes that the Cepeda statement could be rejected on the basis of the so-called maladies until, if at all, the very hearing at which his PCR application was summarily dismissed.', 'The majority overlooks this aspect of the proceeding. When Reyes first produced the Cepeda statement, the hearing justice did not, in any way, suggest that it could be rejected on the basis of any defects; instead, she indicated that it might not be relevant. Nor did the state advocate rejection of the statement based on its defects. Instead, the state devoted a single paragraph to the Cepeda statement and proffered a merits argument:', '“As to the second document, the purported[ly] notarized', '(document does not contain a notary’s seal or Mr. Cepeda’s', 'signature) statement of Ismael Cepeda, the [s]tate cannot speculate', 'as to the purpose of this document. Mr. Cepeda testified at', '[Reyes]’s bail hearing, well prior to the resolution of the instant', 'case (and, in fact, before [Reyes]’s charges were amended pursuant', 'to his attorney’s negotiations). Mr. Cepeda is not a ‘previously', 'unknown’ witness, nor, by his own account, is Mr. Cepeda’s', 'statement different from that which he testified to at the bail', 'hearing. * * * Therefore, without further clarification, the [s]tate', 'cannot adequately respond.”', '- 41 - Nothing in the above-quoted passage puts Reyes on notice that the state was advocating outright rejection of the Cepeda statement. 9 A hearing was required at this point.', 'In my opinion, the lack of any notice to Reyes is important in this case because he had no counsel and was expected to develop and litigate a fact-intensive claim concerning the deprivation of a fundamental constitutional right on his own, while incarcerated. Once forced to proceed pro se, Reyes ably attempted to address the concerns raised by the hearing justice and the state. When the hearing justice told him that he had better show her “something of great significance” or else face dismissal of his PCR application, Reyes produced the Cepeda statement. When the state argued that the Cepeda statement “does not contain a notary’s seal or Mr. Cepeda’s signature,” Reyes attempted to address that concern too, correctly pointing out in a supplemental memorandum that the document does, in fact, contain Cardarelli’s notary seal. Had Reyes been warned about the issues with the Cepeda statement before his application was summarily dismissed, he at least would have had an opportunity to remedy them. The hearing justice did not afford Reyes such an opportunity because she did not reject the document. Both Reyes and his appellate counsel have been blindsided in this Court—after oral argument—by the holding of the majority: that, contrary to the understanding of all involved, the hearing justice was “barred” from considering the Cepeda statement. 9', 'In fact, to the extent that the state intended to make such an argument, its attempt to do so was wholly ineffectual to preserve the argument for our review. Perhaps in light of its failure to preserve the argument that the Cepeda statement could not be considered by the hearing justice, the state on appeal simply highlights in a footnote the infirmities of the Cepeda statement that were noted by the hearing justice. To its credit, the state does not attempt to revive an argument that was not clearly and distinctly made below. The majority is raising sua sponte a ground of decision that was not addressed in the Superior Court. In my opinion, it is not the function of this Court to launch a rescue mission to resurrect an argument that was abandoned in the proceedings below.', '- 42 -', 'Finally, the majority improperly attributes to Reyes—an indigent prisoner forced to proceed pro se—the error of a registered notary public of this state that is squarely within the notary’s expertise. 10 Under these circumstances, Reyes cannot be expected to recognize that the Cepeda statement was improperly notarized. This is a fiction that I refuse to embrace. The majority relies upon the notary’s mistake and, on that basis alone, has foreclosed consideration of the merits of Reyes’s claims that his fundamental constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel has been violated.', 'This is not a just result.', 'For all of these reasons, I am of the opinion that the conclusion of the majority that the hearing justice was barred from considering the Cepeda statement was erroneous. 11', 'Relevancy of the Cepeda Statement', 'Finally, I note my disagreement with the hearing justice’s conclusion that the Cepeda statement was not relevant to the charge to which Reyes pled and her decision that summary dismissal of Reyes’s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel was proper because Reyes was unable to satisfy the prejudice prong of Strickland. Contrary to the hearing justice’s assessment, the Cepeda statement is relevant to the prejudice prong. It specifically relates to the criminal 10', 'The majority concedes that the Cepeda statement’s infirmities are the result “of the notary’s disregard for his duties.” 11', 'The majority charges me with “suggest[ing] that we turn both our existing postconviction relief case law and [G.L. 1956] § 10-9.1-6(c) on its head” and that “the system should bend over backwards for an applicant” in the circumstances of this case. In my opinion, postconviction counsel did not comply with § 10-9.1-5. Under “our existing [PCR] case law,” it was reversible error to enter a summary dismissal before Reyes received the assistance of counsel to which he was statutorily entitled. See Campbell v. State, 56 A.3d 448, 458-62 (R.I. 2012). To the extent that the system permits the summary dismissal of the ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims of a first-time, pro se applicant who has been deprived of counsel and who nonetheless comes forward with evidence suggesting actual innocence, the system is broken. It should bend backwards, forwards, and every other conceivable way so that the applicant receives his day in court. To hold otherwise turns the postconviction remedy enacted by the General Assembly into an illusion.', '- 43 - conduct giving rise to the offense to which Reyes entered a plea of nolo contendere. The statement of facts read in support of the amended charge was as follows: “Pedro [Reyes] on or about the 5th day of October 1993 at Central Falls in the County of Providence did maintain a narcotics nuisance in violation of the Rhode Island General Laws.” It is clear that the amended charge arose from his arrest and prosecution for the acts that gave rise to the two counts of the criminal information. Because the Cepeda statement concerns—and purports to absolve Reyes from—that conduct, it is relevant to the amended charge. 12', 'The Cepeda statement creates a genuine issue of fact as to whether at least one of Reyes’s codefendants in the 1994 case gave exculpatory testimony—during a bail hearing or elsewhere— of which trial counsel knew or should have known. Maybe Cepeda did so testify. Maybe trial counsel discussed this circumstance with Cepeda and his client. Maybe the state amended the charges because of this circumstance. Postconviction counsel’s investigation indicated that the alleged exculpatory bail-hearing testimony did not exist.', 'However, the Cepeda statement, although it does not specifically mention bail-hearing testimony, indicates that Cepeda gave testimony at a judicial proceeding that tended to exculpate Reyes from the charged offenses. Therefore, at the time that Reyes’s application was summarily dismissed, there was a genuine issue of fact as to whether Cepeda provided exculpatory evidence. See Bucci v. Hurd Buick Pontiac GMC Truck, LLC, 85 A.3d 1160, 1175 n.7 (R.I. 2014) (“A ‘genuine’ issue is one that 12', 'I also note that, even if the Cepeda statement related only to the original charges, it would still be relevant to the prejudice inquiry. In the plea context, the prejudice prong requires a defendant to “‘demonstrate a reasonable probability that[,] but for counsel’s errors, he or she would not have pleaded guilty [or nolo contendere] and would have insisted on going to trial’ and, importantly, that the outcome of the trial would have been different.” Neufville v. State, 13 A.3d 607, 610-11 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Figueroa, 639 A.2d 495, 500 (R.I. 1994)); see also Lopes v. State, 111 A.3d 344, 349 (R.I. 2015).

United States Department of Justice, 355 F.3d 6, 19 (1st Cir. 2004))).', 'This genuine issue concerned a fact that is, at least at this early juncture, material to the prejudice inquiry. If the exculpatory testimony exists, it bears on the question of whether, if Reyes had proceeded to trial on the original charges, he would have been acquitted. From my review of the record, it appears that the only evidence linking Reyes to the charged offenses was Carl Barovier’s eyewitness identification of Reyes as the driver of the Datsun from which Cepeda emerged with heroin. There is no indication from the police reports that accompanied the criminal information that the driver ever exited the vehicle, nor is there information about the length of time that and the distance from which Barovier observed the driver, the lighting, his degree of certainty, or the time that elapsed before Barovier identified Reyes.', 'Moreover, Barovier did not identify Reyes from a photo lineup; instead, when Edward Randall (Randall) provided Barovier a show-up photograph of Reyes—which Randall had selected based on Barovier’s description of the driver as having “light[-]black skin” and appearing to be “approximately 5’8” tall[ and] between 19 and 23 years of age”—Barovier identified him as the man he saw driving the vehicle. 13 Contrary to the account that Barovier provided in the police reports, however, the Cepeda statement indicated that Reyes was not involved in the drug deal in question. In particular, the Cepeda statement asserts that Cepeda testified that he and Reyes did 13', 'Recently, this Court recognized “the problematic nature of eyewitness identification and its potential for misidentification,” State v. Davis, 131 A.3d 679, 696 (R.I. 2016), and “the growing concern in other jurisdictions with reliance on eyewitness identification testimony, the growing body of scientific and psychological studies regarding the questionable accuracy of the accounts of eyewitnesses, and the efforts made to prevent a miscarriage of justice,” id. at 696 n.13. We therefore announced that, henceforth, “the better practice would be for courts to provide the jury with more comprehensive instructions when eyewitness testimony is an issue, similar, for example, to those that were imparted in [State v. ]Austin, 114 A.3d [87,] 92-93 [(R.I. 2015),] and [State v. ]Figuereo, 31 A.3d [1283,] 1290-91 [(R.I. 2011)].” Davis, 131 A.3d at 697.', '- 45 - not engage in drug transactions with one another as a general matter and that Reyes was not with him when he sold the heroin to Barovier. Therefore, because the Cepeda statement tended to discredit the accuracy of Barovier’s identification of Reyes, the existence of Cepeda’s exculpatory testimony is a material fact that potentially bears on the resolution of the question of whether, had Reyes gone to trial, “the outcome of the trial would have been different.” Neufville, 13 A.3d at 611; see Bucci, 85 A.3d at 1175 n.7 (“[A] ‘material fact’ is one that has the potential of affecting the outcome of the case.” (quoting Calero-Cerezo, 355 F.3d at 19)).', 'Finally, I acknowledge that, even if Cepeda’s exculpatory testimony does exist, the prejudice prong of the Strickland standard would not necessarily be resolved in Reyes’s favor. To the contrary, several additional factors would first need to be considered, including an assessment of the circumstances under which the testimony was provided, Cepeda’s credibility (or lack thereof), and the strength of the state’s evidence against Reyes. In the end, Reyes would bear the burden of demonstrating the requisite prejudice. 14 See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 693. But the genuine issue of material fact as to whether Cepeda provided exculpatory testimony—as well as the additional considerations that flow from the resolution of that issue—cannot and should 14', 'Even if Reyes were able to demonstrate prejudice under Strickland, he would still need to meet the performance prong to obtain postconviction relief. Additional questions would arise before trial counsel’s performance could be deemed deficient, such as whether trial counsel knew or should have known of the existence of the exculpatory testimony, cf. Neufville, 13 A.3d at 611- 12 (affirming the hearing justice’s rejection of the applicant’s claim that his trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to interview potential defense witnesses where, after an evidentiary hearing, the hearing justice supportably credited trial counsel’s testimony that the applicant never disclosed any potential witnesses over the applicant’s contrary testimony), and, if trial counsel had such actual or constructive knowledge, whether it was constitutionally deficient to nonetheless advise Reyes to accept the state’s generous plea offer. Because the trial justice did not consider the performance prong and because the genuine issue of material fact as to whether the exculpatory testimony existed must be resolved before these additional questions can be answered, Reyes’s claims cannot be summarily dismissed on the basis of an inability to satisfy the performance prong.', '- 46 - not be resolved at the summary-dismissal stage.

It is my opinion that the hearing justice erred in granting postconviction counsel’s motion to withdraw and that Reyes did not receive the assistance of counsel to which he was statutorily entitled. That alone warrants a remand for further proceedings. Moreover, the majority improperly concludes that the hearing justice was precluded from considering the Cepeda statement, which was undeniably relevant to Reyes’s claims. The upshot of the majority’s decision is that Reyes will not receive full consideration of the merits of the claimed violations of his fundamental constitutional right. Although Reyes may look to a more hospitable forum for adjudication of this claim, see Martinez, 132 S. Ct. at 1318, 1320, the merits should have been adjudicated in this jurisdiction. Instead, the one-two punch of the Shatney procedure, followed by an artificial application of this Court’s summary-judgment standard to a document that was not submitted in opposition to a summary-dismissal motion, has rendered the postconviction remedy a nullity in this case.

5,:,criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. This case came before the Supreme Court on May 4, 2016, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. The respondent, Tony Gonzalez, appeals from a decree entered in the Family Court terminating his parental rights with respect to his daughter, Izabella G., who was born on August 2, 2007.1 On appeal, the respondent initially argued that the hearing justice erred, first, in terminating his parental rights based on his incarceration; second, in concluding that the Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) made reasonable efforts to maintain contact between him and Izabella; and, third, in determining that termination of the respondent’s parental rights was in Izabella’s best interest. While this case was pending on appeal, the respondent submitted a supplemental briefing in which he contended that this Court’s opinion in State v. Gonzalez, No. 2013-289-C.A. (R.I., filed March 29, 2016), which vacated his criminal convictions, required this Court to vacate the judgment in this case and remand the case to the Family Court for reconsideration. Having carefully considered the memoranda filed by the parties and the arguments of counsel, we are of the opinion that cause 1', 'Parts of the record, including the hearing justice’s decision, refer to respondent’s daughter as “Isabella.” However, the child’s birth certificate spells the child’s name “Izabella,” and so shall we.', '-1- has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the appeal at this time. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the decree of the Family Court and remand the case for further proceedings.', 'Facts and Travel', 'This case presents this Court with a unique circumstance in which the Family Court decree that terminated respondent’s parental rights rested primarily on criminal convictions— namely, a conviction of first-degree murder—and their concomitant prison sentences that subsequently were vacated before the instant appeal was heard and decided. We briefly set forth the salient facts.', 'The respondent has been incarcerated at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI) since January 2012, after he was arrested in connection with a murder investigation. He subsequently was indicted by a grand jury for first-degree murder, assault with intent to commit murder, and discharging a firearm during the commission of a violent crime. Although at one time Izabella resided with respondent and his mother, at the time of respondent’s arrest, Izabella was living with her mother—respondent’s ex-wife—and maternal half-sister.', 'On March 27, 2012, DCYF received a report that Izabella’s mother had been hospitalized for substance abuse and mental-health issues. At that time, Izabella and her half-sister were staying with their step-grandmother, Kristin Lomberto (Lomberto), who had been married to their mother’s father before he passed away. DCYF obtained an ex parte order granting the agency temporary custody of Izabella and her half-sister, and the two children were formally placed with Lomberto.', 'On March 30, 2012, DCYF filed a neglect petition against both respondent and Izabella’s mother, which alleged that “the parents have failed to provide [Izabella] with a minimum degree of care, supervision[,] or guardianship.” This was not the', '-2- family’s first contact with DCYF. In particular, in October 2010, respondent was indicated for physical abuse when he admitted to tying Izabella’s hands and feet in order to restrain the three- year-old child.', 'When DCYF again became involved with the family in March 2012, the agency initially set a goal of reunification between Izabella and her mother. According to a DCYF caseworker assigned to Izabella’s case, respondent had not been “considered a permanency option for Izabella” “[b]ecause of his incarceration and the length of his incarceration.” The respondent sought visitation with Izabella while he was incarcerated, but his motion at first was denied. The Family Court subsequently amended the visitation order, and respondent was permitted periodic supervised visits with his daughter at the ACI. The record reveals that Izabella appeared pleased to see respondent and disappointed when each visit ended. While respondent was incarcerated, he wrote more than sixty-five letters to Izabella and participated in an ACI parenting program.', 'On February 25, 2013, following a jury trial, respondent was convicted of the crimes set forth in the indictment, and he subsequently was sentenced to, inter alia, two consecutive terms of life imprisonment.2 DCYF thereafter abandoned its initial goal of reunification between Izabella and her mother and prepared a new case plan, which provided that Lomberto would adopt both Izabella and her maternal half-sister. The respondent refused to sign the new case plan and objected to Lomberto’s adoption of Izabella. The respondent preferred that Izabella be placed with his mother rather than Lomberto. 2', 'The circumstances of that case, in which the judgment was vacated, are set forth in State v. Gonzalez, No. 2013-289-C.A. (R.I., filed March 29, 2016).', '-3-', 'On November 7, 2013, DCYF filed a petition in the Family Court seeking to terminate respondent’s parental rights with respect to Izabella.3 In the petition, DCYF alleged that the child had been placed in its custody for at least twelve months, that the parents were offered or had received services to correct the situation that led to Izabella’s placement in the agency’s custody, and that there was not a substantial probability that she would be able to return safely to respondent’s care within a reasonable period of time. Additionally, the petition alleged that respondent “is unfit by reason of conduct or conditions seriously detrimental to the child, such as [the] institutionalization of [respondent], including imprisonment, of such duration as to render it improbable for [him] to care for [Izabella] for an extended period of time.”', 'A termination hearing was held in the Family Court in December 2014. On April 2, 2015, the Family Court issued a decree that terminated respondent’s parental rights with respect to Izabella. The hearing justice found, by clear and convincing evidence, that respondent was an unfit parent pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 15-7-7(a)(2)(i), (3).4 The hearing justice largely based the 3', 'Izabella’s biological mother consented to adoption of the child by Lomberto and is not a party to this appeal. 4', 'General Laws 1956 § 15-7-7(a) provides, in relevant part:', '“The court shall, upon a petition duly filed by a governmental child', 'placement agency or licensed child placement agency after notice to the parent', 'and a hearing on the petition, terminate any and all legal rights of the parent to the', 'child, including the right to notice of any subsequent adoption proceedings', 'involving the child, if the court finds as a fact by clear and convincing evidence', 'that:', '“* * *', '“(2) The parent is unfit by reason of conduct or conditions seriously', 'detrimental to the child; such as, but not limited to, the following:', '-4- decision on her finding that respondent had been convicted of crimes of violence for which he was serving two consecutive terms of life imprisonment.

As noted, however, on March 29, 2016, while this appeal was pending, this Court vacated respondent’s criminal convictions based on the illegal seizure of evidence in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. See Gonzalez, No. 2013- 289-C.A., slip op. at 2, 38. That case was remanded for a new trial. Id. at 2. Our decision to vacate respondent’s criminal convictions raised additional issues in this case for which the parties filed supplemental briefing.', 'Standard of Review', '“On appeal, ‘[t]his Court reviews termination of parental[-]rights rulings by examining the record to establish whether the [Family Court] justice’s findings are supported by legal and competent evidence.’” In re Amiah P., 54 A.3d 446, 451 (R.I. 2012) (quoting In re Victoria L., 950 A.2d 1168, 1174 (R.I. 2008)). “These findings are entitled to great weight, and this Court will not disturb them unless they ‘are clearly wrong or the [hearing] justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence.’” Id.

We do not disagree with this contention.', 'Our careful review of the record convinces us that the respondent’s criminal convictions and concomitant prison sentences are so intertwined with the Family Court decision that it is 5', 'The hearing justice found that respondent’s “desire that [Izabella] be placed with his mother is not relevant to his own fitness as a parent.”', '-6- impossible to separate the convictions from the remaining findings. Although, in her decision, the Family Court justice noted that, “[i]n addition to the lengthy sentence[,] * * * the [c]ourt finds by clear and convincing evidence that additional factors render [the respondent] unfit,” most of those factors directly or indirectly relate to the now-vacated criminal convictions. Those factors include: (1) “[Izabella] has been in the care of DCYF for three years”; (2) “[a]t no time during the past three years, has [the respondent] been released from prison”; and (3) “[the respondent] presented no evidence of how he would provide for [Izabella]’s care in the highly unlikely event of his release.” Therefore, it is our opinion that the decision must be vacated in light of the changed circumstances. We make this holding mindful, however, that the respondent faces a new trial and has been incarcerated for much of Izabella’s life, and that the factual circumstances, if established in this case, may serve as powerful evidence of unfitness.6', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the decree terminating the respondent’s parental rights with respect to Izabella and remand this case to the Family Court for further proceedings as expeditiously as practicable. On remand, the case need not be heard de novo. Rather, it is within the hearing justice’s discretion whether to allow further evidence, as the hearing justice sees fit. 6', 'At oral argument, the attorneys for all parties noted, upon information and belief, that, at that time, respondent was being held at the ACI awaiting retrial.', '-7-', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S', 'OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'In re Izabella G.

6,State : v. : Armando Garcia. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. This case stems from the gruesome murder of a young mother in her home in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. After a jury trial, the defendant, Armando Garcia, was convicted of one count of first-degree murder, one count of failure to report a death, and one count of operating a motor vehicle without the consent of the owner. The trial justice sentenced the defendant to life imprisonment on the murder count and imposed a five-year sentence for each of the remaining counts, to be served concurrently with each other and consecutively with the life sentence.1 On appeal, the defendant assigns error to the denial of his motion to suppress the confession he made to the police, certain evidentiary rulings made at trial, and the denial of his motion for a new trial. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'The defendant also was adjudged to be a habitual criminal and sentenced to an additional twenty-five years to be served consecutively, pursuant to the habitual offender statute, G.L. 1956 § 12-19-21.', '-1-', 'Facts and Travel', 'Brooke2 and defendant were friends in junior high school, and, by high school their relationship developed into what defendant later characterized as “friends with benefits”— presumably of the romantic kind. As they reached adulthood, the two went their separate ways. Brooke married Joe in 2002, and, in 2007, their daughter, Ella, was born. Brooke became a stay- at-home mom and sold Avon products in her spare time. As Brooke was building her life with Joe, defendant was in and out of jail, serving time at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI) for multiple convictions, including possession of a stolen motor vehicle, breaking and entering, and drug possession.', 'In late 2009, shortly after being released from his most recent stint at the ACI, defendant visited the home of Brooke’s mother and stepfather, Michelle and Roy, and arranged for Brooke to contact him in order to renew their acquaintance. She did so, and the old friends soon began to spend a substantial amount of time together. The defendant’s re-entry into Brooke’s life coincided with the deterioration of her previously happy seven-year marriage. Her relationship with Joe became fraught with tension as he began to suspect an affair. By mid-May 2010, Brooke told Joe that she no longer loved him. He moved out in mid-June. Meanwhile, Brooke and defendant discussed moving in together. She spent time with his family, and he introduced her to his relatives as his girlfriend.', 'Interactions between Brooke and Joe remained hostile even after Joe moved out of the house. In particular, on Monday, June 21, when Joe arrived at the house to pick up two-year-old Ella, he argued with Brooke about the nature of her relationship with defendant; Brooke 2', 'In order to protect the privacy of the victim’s surviving relatives, we refer to the victim and the adult members of her immediate family by only their first names; we intend no disrespect. The victim’s minor daughter has been given a pseudonym.', '-2- continued to insist that they were only friends, even after Joe had discovered photographs suggesting otherwise. According to Joe, during the argument, Brooke “struck [him] multiple times.” In order to subdue her during these outbursts, Joe claims to have “grabbed her * * * [and] moved her to the side onto a chair.” Later that day, Brooke told Michelle that she and Joe “got into a scuffle and he pushed her down the stairs.” She showed Michelle “a red mark on her * * * right side.” At trial, Joe denied pushing her down the stairs.', 'Despite their quarrel earlier in the week, Brooke and Joe were cordial to each other when they met on Wednesday, June 23, and even decided to attend a wedding together—as friends— that Saturday night. The next night, Thursday, June 24, Brooke and Joe had sex, and he spent the night at the house. According to Joe, who continued to love his wife, “It felt like we were married again.” Also that night, Brooke told her mother and a friend that “she was done with” defendant because she had learned that he was selling cocaine and she wanted to protect Ella.', 'Brooke’s plans to break up with defendant were short-lived, however. On Friday night, June 25, Brooke told her mother that she had decided to “giv[e] [defendant] another chance” and that she and Ella were going to spend the evening with him. However, when Brooke arrived at defendant’s home as planned, there was a note on the door informing her that defendant was out with his cousin. This was not the case. A furious Brooke called her mother and declared, “I can’t believe that [f---ing] [racial epithet] stood me up.” Brooke told Michelle that she intended to leave him a letter. In fact, defendant was in his home and could hear her in the driveway cursing him and using a racial slur.', 'An hour later, Brooke told her mother that she was waiting for defendant to come to her house. When Michelle told her daughter that she had been watching a true-crime show on television, Brooke mentioned that defendant had told her to tell her mother that, “if you ever find', '-3- me dead, Joe thinks about ways to kill me and get away with it.” That was the last time Michelle spoke with her daughter.', 'The next morning, Saturday, June 26, Michelle, who was scheduled to babysit Ella that afternoon, attempted to call Brooke multiple times, but there was no answer. By mid-afternoon, an alarmed Michelle drove to Brooke’s home and noted that Brooke’s Cadillac Escalade was not in the driveway. She observed a window screen, which usually covered the window over the air conditioner, lying against the side of the house. Entering the house through the kitchen, she discovered the home in disarray. All of the cabinets were open, and items “were thrown or tossed around the room.” Michelle saw a note on the counter that was addressed to defendant: “You [t]old me [y]ou would be right back[.]', 'It [d]on’t [t]ake over an [h]our [t]o [g]o 2 [b]locks[.] This night is almost exactly [l]ike Monday[.] I’ll [t]alk [t]o you [l]ater[.]” A knife also lay on the counter.', 'In the dining room, Michelle found a butter knife lying on the floor near “a big pool of blood,” as well as blood in other areas in the room. Intending to call 9-1-1, Michelle reached for the landline telephone, but it was missing. Brooke’s two mobile telephones also were not in the house.3 Michelle heard Ella call out to her from Brooke’s bedroom.', 'Michelle found Ella, in a soiled diaper, sitting on the bed next to her mother’s lifeless body.4 Brooke was partially naked under a blanket. Her pants were tied in a knot near her ankles. There was a bottle of K-Y Jelly on the bed near Brooke’s head and a bloody tampon on the floor. On the bureau sat a condom wrapper covered with dried blood, but no condom. In a frantic call to 9-1-1 from her mobile telephone, Michelle told the operator that she had found her 3', 'Apparently, Brooke had a second mobile telephone to facilitate her affair with defendant. 4', 'At trial, Michelle testified that Ella was able to climb out of her crib and into her mother’s bed.', '-4- daughter dead, and, based on what Brooke had told her the previous evening, that she believed Joe had murdered his wife. Michelle repeated the allegation when the police arrived.', 'Meanwhile, Joe had been trying to contact Brooke without success about their plans to attend their friend’s wedding that evening.', 'Joe received a text message from a coworker informing him that emergency vehicles were parked by the house, and, still unable to reach Brooke, he drove to the home. When he arrived, Michelle identified Joe to the police, and he immediately was arrested. At the police station, detectives interrogated him until late into the night. Fervidly protesting his innocence, Joe consented to searches of his car and apartment. Neither search yielded anything. By the next day, having corroborated Joe’s statements to the police concerning his recent whereabouts, Joe was released.5', 'While Joe was in custody, the police received an anonymous tip that led them to Brooke’s missing car. The tip came from Blanca Mateo-Merced (Mateo-Merced), defendant’s sixteen-year-old cousin. Early Saturday morning, defendant had visited the home Mateo-Merced shared with their grandmother and told them that “[t]hey killed my baby.” He explained that he had arrived at Brooke’s home and “found her lying in a pool of blood.” Also that morning, defendant asked a family friend who runs a car-cleaning service to clean the Cadillac Escalade he was driving. The defendant explained that he had been in a fight after “[getting] caught up in the wrong place at the wrong time.” The friend observed blood in the interior of the car, which he thought was defendant’s because defendant had blood on his ear and his clothing. After the vehicle was cleaned, the friend parked it on Dodge Street in Pawtucket, at defendant’s request. 5', 'At trial, the state presented as witnesses two of Joe’s neighbors, who also worked with Joe, who testified that they saw Joe’s car parked in his assigned parking space late Friday night and early Saturday morning. They further testified that they saw him on Saturday morning at work and did not observe anything unusual. Joe testified that he was alone in his apartment during the hours Brooke likely was killed.', '-5- Forensic testing subsequently revealed that residual blood in the car was consistent with DNA from Brooke, not defendant.', 'Meanwhile, defendant told more relatives and another family friend that Brooke had been killed; he explained that Brooke died from a gunshot wound and that the bullet entered the house through a window. The family pleaded with defendant to report Brooke’s death to the police, but to no avail; he refused to come forward because he was on probation and feared being falsely accused of the murder. He revealed to Mateo-Merced that he was contemplating going to Pennsylvania, and he asked his father for money. Later in the day, Mateo-Merced and other relatives discovered the Cadillac Escalade parked on Dodge Street, and, when confronted, defendant admitted that the car belonged to Brooke. While Mateo-Merced spoke with defendant, she noticed a small bloodstain on his shorts.6 When she watched the 10 p.m. news that evening, Mateo-Merced learned that the police were looking for Brooke’s car. She called the police from a pay phone and, without giving her name, told them where to find the vehicle.', 'When the police discovered Brooke’s relationship with defendant, they visited his last known address. The defendant was not home, but his father answered the door and informed the officers that defendant had admitted to him that he found Brooke dead in her home.', 'In the early morning hours of Sunday, June 27, defendant was arrested at his grandmother’s home. While being handcuffed, defendant asked, “Is this about Brooke?” When a detective responded affirmatively, defendant volunteered, “I loved her. I would never do anything to hurt that girl.” At the station, police observed a cut on defendant’s hand, a scratch on his thigh, and a wound on his ear. 6', 'At trial, a DNA expert testified that the blood on defendant’s shorts was “an exact match to Brooke.”', '-6-', 'At approximately 3:25 a.m., at the Pawtucket police station, Dets. Donti Rosciti (Det. Rosciti) and David Silva (Det. Silva) commenced a nine-hour interview with defendant, in which defendant waived his Miranda7 rights.', 'The defendant initially denied any involvement in Brooke’s murder. He stated that he and Brooke had sex at her house on Friday evening and that he then borrowed her car and left for the night.', 'After defendant documented this story in a formal handwritten statement, the detectives advised him that his father had disclosed that defendant had discovered Brooke’s body. The defendant then proceeded to expand upon his statement; he claimed to have returned to Brooke’s home after leaving the first time, found her dead in her bedroom, and fled out of fear that he would be implicated. He memorialized this new version of his story in a second handwritten statement.', 'During the interview, defendant learned that, because he was on probation for another offense, he would be presented in the District Court as a probation violator. The defendant stated, without prompting, that he preferred to delay transfer to the ACI and stay at the police station overnight. The defendant signed a document—prepared by the detectives—in which he “agree[d] to remain in the custody of the Pawtucket Police Department” and “waiv[ed] any right to appear in the District Court [that] morning.”', 'The following morning, Monday, June 28, before bringing defendant to the District Court, Dets. Rosciti and Silva resumed their questioning in a videotaped second interview.8 The detectives asked defendant to review his statements from the day before and to write another statement “in case [he] wanted to add” more details. The defendant complied. However, while 7', 'Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 444-45 (1966). 8', 'The first interview was not videotaped. As we held in State v. Barros, 24 A.3d 1158, 1164 (R.I. 2011), a criminal suspect does not possess a state or federal due process right to an electronically recorded custodial interrogation. However, the subsequent interview was so recorded.', '-7- writing the third statement, defendant paused and asked for assurances that his involvement in the murder would not be reported to the media. He alluded to an off-camera discussion from the day before. When the detectives responded that they only wanted to know the truth, defendant “abruptly” put down his pen, pushed the third statement away, and asked for a cigarette.', 'He added, “Seriously and * * * I’m gonna [sic] give you what you want.” Detective Silva was “surprise[d]” and asked, “For real[,] though[,] you’re not [messing with us]?”', 'The defendant replied, “Yo[,] you guys, I’m sorry for everything[,] man,” and began to cry.', 'The defendant then disclosed that, when he returned to Brooke’s house for the second time that night, she confronted him about his sexual relationship with another woman. He stated that Brooke had hit him repeatedly, tried to choke him, and spit on him and that he responded by punching her, choking her, and stabbing her with a butter knife.9 He demonstrated for the detectives how he swung at both sides of Brooke’s head with his fists. The defendant explained that he had been drunk and had not intended to kill Brooke. When he realized Brooke was dead, he carried her to her bed and fled, but he later returned to stage a break-in. He attempted to remove the air conditioner from the window, tied Brooke up, tossed a condom wrapper nearby, and “threw * * * out” the soiled tampon Brooke had been wearing before they had sex. In addition to orally confessing to the crime, defendant recorded his confession in a fourth handwritten statement. The video shows that, when the detectives left the interview room for a moment, defendant sighed and whispered, “I’m sorry, Brooke.”', 'A jury trial was held in Providence County Superior Court in September and October 2012.', 'The defendant professed his innocence at trial and proffered yet another version of the 9', 'At trial, the state’s medical examiner testified that, even though he observed multiple stab wounds on Brooke’s body, neither the butter knife nor the knife found on the kitchen counter were the instrumentalities that caused Brooke’s sharp-force injuries.', '-8- events leading up to this murder. His defense strategy was to point the finger at Joe. Testifying on his own behalf, defendant stated that he and Brooke were not dating seriously and that she merely was one of many women with whom he was involved at the time of her death. He testified that he “wasn’t really feeling it” anymore and had been “ducking and dodging” Brooke recently, including the night of her death when he initially lied about his whereabouts to avoid spending time with her.', 'The defendant testified that he changed his mind later that evening and visited Brooke at her house. He stated that, after they had sex, he lied that he had “something important to do” and borrowed Brooke’s car.', 'He drove around and “smoke[d] and chill[ed],” then returned to Brooke’s house and smoked a blunt in the driveway before going inside. He discovered Brooke dead on the floor and “ran right to her [and] * * * started crying[,] * * * hugging, [and] kissing her.” He testified that, at the time, he believed her injuries to be bullet wounds. When defendant found Ella safe in her crib, he concluded that Joe had killed Brooke. The defendant carried Brooke to her bed and set out to look for Joe. He testified that he took both of Brooke’s mobile telephones because he thought they might help him find Joe. However, after defendant left the house, he abandoned his efforts to find Joe because he did not wish to insert himself into a murder investigation. He testified that, “after that, [he] got in the vehicle, [he] went toward [his grandmother’s neighborhood] and threw the phone somewhere on [his grandmother’s street].” The defendant explained that he felt responsible for Brooke’s death because he had left her at her house to drive around and smoke a blunt. This feeling of remorse purportedly led defendant to provide the police with a “false confession.”', '-9-', 'On October 11, 2012, the jury returned a guilty verdict on all three counts charged. On appeal, defendant alleges error in the denial of his motion to suppress the confession, certain evidentiary rulings made by the trial justice, and the denial of his motion for a new trial.', 'Motion to Suppress', 'Prior to trial, defendant moved to suppress the statements he made to the police at the time of his arrest and during the two subsequent custodial interrogations at the Pawtucket police station. After a two-day evidentiary hearing, the trial justice denied the motions. On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice erred by not suppressing his confession.10', 'We begin by addressing defendant’s assertion that the trial justice should have suppressed his confession because the state failed to prove that it was the product of a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver of his constitutional rights. The defendant places particular emphasis on assurances by the detectives that they would not report his involvement to the media, his claim that he was deprived of food while in police custody, and his assertion that he was provided cigarettes despite the police station’s official no-smoking policy.', 'This Court’s review of the denial of a motion to suppress a confession that a defendant claims was involuntary is governed by a two-prong analysis. State v. Humphrey, 715 A.2d 1265, 1273 (R.I. 1998). We first examine, with great deference, “the trial justice’s findings regarding the historical facts relevant to the voluntariness of the challenged confession.” Id. If we accept the findings, we then proceed to the second prong of our analysis, in which “we apply those historical facts and review the trial justice’s determination as to the voluntariness of the challenged confession de novo.” Id. A statement is voluntary if “it is ‘the product of [the 10', 'This Court has not been asked to review the propriety of the admission of the other statements defendant made to the police.', '- 10 - defendant’s] free and rational choice’” and not “extracted from the defendant by coercion or improper inducement, including threats, violence, or any undue influence that overcomes the free will of the defendant.” Id. at 1274 (quoting State v. Amado, 424 A.2d 1057, 1062 (R.I. 1981)). In making such a determination, we assess “the totality of the circumstances surrounding the challenged statement.” Id.', 'In the case at bar, the state presented evidence that defendant—who was no stranger to the criminal-justice system—was alert, understood the questions being asked, and showed no signs of discomfort or unjustifiable stress during his interview on Monday, June 28, 2010. He was advised of his Miranda rights both orally and in writing on multiple occasions throughout his detention at the police station, and there was ample evidence that demonstrated that defendant understood those rights and waived them of his own volition. The defendant wrote the confession in his own handwriting and used his own words to describe his acts. The video recording demonstrates that, when Det.

The trial justice rejected defendant’s claim that the detectives’ willingness to violate the no-smoking policy implied that they also may have violated defendant’s constitutional rights. She observed that defendant received food when he requested it. Summarizing the contents of the video recording, she stated, “I don’t think you could find a * * * situation under which [defendant] was questioned where it was more non[-]threatening than', '- 11 - we had here.” She concluded that there was clear and convincing evidence to demonstrate that defendant voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived his right to freedom from self- incrimination.', 'Having reviewed the record in this case, we accept the trial justice’s findings of historical fact. Further, in light of defendant’s admissions at trial that the police “kept it professional” and did not extract his confession through threats, force, or coercion,11 we are hard-pressed to accept his argument that he was “emotional[ly] coerc[ed]” into falsely confessing to Brooke’s murder. In fact, defendant’s own testimony belies that contention. He testified that he fabricated the confession not because of police coercion, but because he blamed himself for not having been with Brooke at the time she was killed and for having “let [her] family down.” After considering the totality of the circumstances surrounding the confession, we are of the opinion that the statements were the product of defendant’s free will and were not the product of coercion, threats, or promises made by the police.', 'The defendant also contends that suppression was required because his custodial statements purportedly resulted from the state’s failure to promptly present him before a judicial officer after his arrest. Rule 5(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure provides, in relevant part, that “[a]ny person making an arrest without a warrant shall take the arrested person 11', 'The defendant testified, “Them guys [Dets. Rosciti and Silva] are professionals. They treated me * * * normal, * * * nice, nothing out of the ordinary, * * * they treated me quiet, asking me questions, stuff like that.” Moreover, the following exchange occurred on cross-examination:', '“Q', 'And there was no question nobody forced you, threatened you, coerced', 'you into giving a statement; isn’t that correct?', '“A', 'Not at all, not at all.”', '- 12 - without unnecessary delay before a judge of the District Court * * *.”12 This rule is not one of constitutional dimension, but, rather, it serves as “a prophylactic measure designed to prevent other constitutional infirmities.” State v.

Brown, 898 A.2d 69, 75, 78 (R.I. 2006) (describing the similarly-worded Rule 9(a) of the District Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, which applies to misdemeanors, as “operat[ing] as [a] procedural instruction[] or guideline[] that notif[ies] the police of the steps that must be taken after they effectuate an arrest”). A confession should be suppressed on the basis of “undue” delay in presentment only if it “had any ‘causative effect upon [the defendant’s] * * * decision to confess.’” Nardolillo, 698 A.2d at 199 (quoting State v. Lionberg, 533 A.2d 1172, 1178 (R.I. 1987)). We are not confronted with such a case.', 'The right to prompt presentment is subject to waiver. United States v. McDowell, 687 F.3d 904, 910 (7th Cir. 2012); United States v. Bell, 740 A.2d 958, 963 (D.C. 1999). When the defendant waives his or her right to presentment after receiving the requisite Miranda warnings, he or she “must be treated as having waived consideration of any unreasonable delay in presentment occurring during that period * * *.” Bell, 740 A.2d at 965; see id. at 959 (reversing the suppression by the trial court of the defendant’s incriminating statements, made after a fifty- four-hour delay between arrest and presentment, because the defendant had waived his rights under Rule 5(a) of the District of Columbia Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure—which requires that “[a]n officer * * * making an arrest without a warrant * * * shall take the arrested person without unnecessary delay before the [c]ourt”). 12', 'In his appellate brief, defendant relies on Rule 5(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. The state suggests that the applicable rule is Rule 9(a) of the District Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. Because the relevant portions of the rules are substantively identical for the purposes of this case, we need not resolve this discrepancy.', '- 13 -', 'In the case before us, the agreement signed and initialed by defendant on Sunday, June 27, 2010 stated, in pertinent part: “I understand that I am waiving any right to appear in the District Court this morning, and understand that I will be presented to the District Court on June 28, 2010.” Detective Rosciti’s testimony at the pretrial suppression hearing suggested that, had defendant not signed the document, defendant immediately would have been presented to a bail commissioner and transported to the ACI because courts are closed on Sundays.', 'On appeal, defendant claims that the detectives “unduly influenced him to sign that form by falsely informing him that his request to remain at the Pawtucket [p]olice [s]tation, as opposed to being transported to the ACI, could only be granted if he were to sign it.” This argument ignores the fact that it was defendant who first requested that he be allowed to remain at police headquarters rather than be transported to the ACI. He merely memorialized that waiver in writing.', 'Secondly, defendant makes this argument in spite of the clause in the agreement—which he initialed—declaring that “nothing has been promised to me in return for my decision to enter into [this agreement].” The defendant points to Det. Rosciti’s testimony that defendant had “expressed interest in staying in [the] Pawtucket [police station] for the night. So, we [Dets. Rosciti and Silva] said we could make that happen if he wanted to sign an agreement.” He argues that the detectives’ promise to defendant was a ploy because “[t]here was nothing preventing the detectives from allowing [defendant] to stay at the police station until he could be brought to court first thing Monday morning.” We reject this contention. The written waiver executed by defendant in this case reflects both a voluntary waiver of his rights under Rule 5(a) and sound police practices.', 'We also note that the video recording from Monday, June 28, 2010 demonstrates that defendant was in no rush to be presented in the District Court. After confessing to Brooke’s', '- 14 - murder, and, without prompting, he twice voiced his desire to delay presentment again until Tuesday. In so doing, he specifically requested that he not be presented in court that day; he made no mention of wanting to avoid spending the night at the ACI. The spontaneity of defendant’s request on Monday to further push back his court appearances and the fact that he made that request independent of an expressed wish to spend another night at the police station suggest that defendant was eager to delay his court appearances irrespective of any desire to avoid transfer to the ACI.', 'Consequently, we cannot say that the waiver of his right to presentment on June 27, 2010 was the product of undue influence or that the final confession was the causative effect of any undue delay in presentment.', 'Evidentiary Issues', 'The defendant also challenges two evidentiary rulings made by the trial justice. First, he assigns error to the admission of Joe’s testimony regarding the dress in which Brooke was buried.13 Although it is doubtful that the issue was adequately preserved, we conclude that the 13', 'The following exchange occurred on direct examination regarding Brooke’s dress:', '“Q', 'You mentioned you had plans to go out with your wife on the 26th of June', 'to a wedding; is that correct?', '“A', 'That’s correct.', '“Q', 'And she had shown you a dress that she had purchased according to your', 'testimony; is that correct?', '“A', 'That’s correct.', '“Q', 'And at some point in time did you ever see that dress again?', '“A', 'What happened was Brooke’s mother, Michelle, she took the dress, and', 'that was the dress that we buried Brooke in.', '“[PROSECUTOR]:', 'Judge, can I have one moment, please?', '- 15 - alleged error, if any, was harmless in the wake of the substantial evidence supporting defendant’s conviction.14 See State v. Robertson, 740 A.2d 330, 337 (R.I. 1999) (“[T]he admission of impermissible evidence need not be prejudicial in a case in which there is independent overwhelming evidence of a defendant’s guilt.”). Here, the state introduced a video recording of defendant confessing to Brooke’s murder, as well as his handwritten confession. A forensic expert testified that blood on defendant’s shorts and in Brooke’s car, which he was driving, was consistent with Brooke’s. It was undisputed at trial that, in the first several hours after the murder, defendant was observed with multiple injuries. There was testimony, including from defendant himself, that, despite his professed innocence, he doggedly refused to report Brooke’s murder to the police and considered fleeing to Pennsylvania. In light of such overwhelming evidence of defendant’s guilt, even if we were to determine that the testimony about the dress lacked relevance and its admission constituted error, the testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and did not contribute to defendant’s conviction.', 'In addition to challenging the testimony about the dress, defendant also assails the denial of his motion in limine to exclude a single autopsy photograph of Brooke’s brain, in which the brain was exposed in order to show the specific injuries she suffered when she was beaten to death.', 'Although the trial justice denied the motion, she properly limited the use of the', '“THE COURT:', 'Can I see counsel at the side bar?” At sidebar, the parties discussed the admission of a different piece of evidence. The prosecutor asked defense counsel if he objected to the admission of that evidence, and he responded, “Yeah, I do. I just move to strike that last piece about the burial of the dress. I don’t think it’s relevant.” The trial justice overruled his objection. The question had been asked and answered, without objection, and the only ground for the motion to strike the testimony was relevance. 14', 'Our longstanding raise-or-waive rule precludes a party from “argu[ing] an issue on appeal that has not been articulated at trial.” Battle v. State, 125 A.3d 130, 134 (R.I. 2015) (quoting State v. Ciresi, 45 A.3d 1201, 1212 (R.I. 2012)).', '- 16 - photograph. The state was directed to crop the photograph and to display it on a large screen only “as briefly as possible” during the medical examiner’s testimony. At trial, the medical examiner explained that Brooke died from multiple injuries to her brain caused by blunt-force trauma. He testified that, during the autopsy, he observed hemorrhaging to Brooke’s brain, and he used the photograph to explain that “direct impact” had caused her brain “to move and crush itself on the bone.” Due to a malfunction in the projector, the photograph was not displayed on a large screen; rather, the medical examiner stood before the jury with a hard copy and explained what the image depicted. It was not published to the jury. On appeal, defendant contends that the admission of the photograph was not essential to explain the cause of Brooke’s death, particularly where the state had introduced multiple autopsy photographs without objection, and that its only purpose was to inflame the passions of the jurors. We disagree.', 'The decision to admit or exclude photographs presented at trial rests firmly within the discretion of the trial justice. State v. Brown, 88 A.3d 1101, 1119 (R.I. 2014). Consequently, our review is limited to', '“whether the trial justice carefully considered whether the', 'probative value of the evidence was outweighed by undue', 'prejudice, ‘keeping in mind that even if the evidence offered is of a', 'gruesome nature and might tend to influence the jury unduly, it', 'may nevertheless be admissible if it is otherwise material and', 'competent.’” State v.

We have acknowledged that, although “[a]utopsy photographs * * * may be difficult for jurors to see,” they are “unquestionably relevant” to the state’s need “to prove each element of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt.” Brown, 88 A.3d at 1120 (quoting State v. Carter, 744 A.2d 839, 847 (R.I. 2000)). The cause of death need not be in dispute for such photographs to be relevant. Id. at 1121.', '- 17 -', 'In Brown, 88 A.3d at 1120, this Court was asked to determine whether the admission of some, but not all, autopsy photographs at trial was in error given that the victim’s cause of death was not in dispute. We responded in the negative. Id. at 1121. The medical examiner had used the photographs—similar in nature to the photograph at issue here—as “visual aids to explain [his] testimony about the effect of the blunt-force trauma on the victim’s skull and brain.” Id. The Court observed that, “[E]ven though the cause of death was not in dispute, the state still bore the burden of proving every element of the case beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id. Accordingly, the Court determined that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in admitting the photographs. Id.', 'As in Brown, the autopsy photograph in the case at bar facilitated the jury’s understanding of highly complex testimony by the medical examiner about the cause of Brooke’s death. The medical examiner’s explanation of the photograph also tended to demonstrate the veracity of defendant’s video-recorded confession to police, in which he mimicked how he punched Brooke on both sides of her head. We note the very narrow and cautious ruling by the trial justice, in which she restricted the scope of the photograph and the amount of time the jury viewed it. We perceive no abuse of discretion.', 'Motion for a New Trial', 'Lastly, defendant argues that the trial justice overlooked and misconceived material evidence in denying his motion for a new trial. “When ruling on a motion for a new trial, the trial justice acts as a thirteenth juror, exercising ‘independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.’” State v. Gregson, 113 A.3d 393, 398 (R.I. 2015) (quoting State v. Matthews, 88 A.3d 375, 387 (R.I. 2014)). The task before the trial justice is to “(1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of', '- 18 - the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” Id. (quoting Matthews, 88 A.3d at 387-88). After following these steps, the trial justice should deny the motion if he or she would have reached the same conclusion as the jury or upon a finding that “reasonable minds could differ.” State v. Nickerson, 94 A.3d 1116, 1128 (R.I. 2014) (quoting State v. Buchanan, 81 A.3d 1119, 1127 (R.I. 2014)), cert. denied, 135 S. Ct. 1907 (2015) (mem.). This Court gives the trial justice’s decision “great weight” if sufficient rationale was articulated for denying the motion. Id. at 1129 (quoting Buchanan, 81 A.3d at 1127). We will not disturb the decision unless the trial justice “overlooked or misconceived material evidence or otherwise was clearly wrong.” Id. (quoting Buchanan, 81 A.3d at 1127).', 'Still clinging to his theory that it was Joe who killed Brooke, the defendant contends on appeal that the trial justice failed to consider evidence of Joe’s motive to murder Brooke and the supposed “gaping hole in his alibi,” and that she overlooked the defendant’s lack of motive to kill Brooke. This argument is unavailing. Importantly, in reviewing the evidence adduced at trial, the trial justice found Joe to be a credible witness.', 'She addressed but rejected the defendant’s theory that Joe killed Brooke and noted that there was “not one scintilla of evidence” to support either Joe’s involvement or a motive. In contrast, she concluded that there was substantial evidence of the defendant’s guilt. She found him not to be credible as a trial witness; she instead concluded that his confession had been truthful and demonstrated consciousness of guilt. The trial justice declared that, “[T]he video speaks for itself.” Contrary to the defendant’s contention that he lacked a motive to murder Brooke, the trial justice recounted evidence that his relationship with Brooke had soured by the night of her murder. The trial justice also noted the wealth of forensic evidence linking the defendant to the crime scene, his behavior after', '- 19 - supposedly finding Brooke’s body, the multiple variations to the defendant’s story, and his videotaped impromptu apology to Brooke when left alone in the interview room at the police station. The trial justice concluded that she would have reached the same result as the jury.

This case came before the Supreme Court on May 4, 2016, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. The defendant, Jonathan Martinez, appeals from a judgment of conviction after a jury found him guilty of one count of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, one count of possession of a firearm while in possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, and one count of conspiracy to possess a controlled substance with intent to deliver. Before this Court, the defendant argues that the trial justice erred in not permitting him to present either an opening statement to the jury or oral argument in support of his motion for judgment of acquittal. He also challenges a portion of the jury instructions and a statement made by the trial justice to the jury regarding the availability of transcripts during their deliberations. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the appeal at this time. We vacate the judgment of conviction entered by the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'Facts and Travel', 'The facts of this case are straightforward. During the course of a three-week surveillance of 30-32 Frederick Street in Providence, a narcotics detective from the Providence Police Department observed defendant—the target of the investigation—enter and exit the multi-family residence approximately five or six times. The detective also observed numerous individuals entering the premises and departing soon after—a pattern consistent with retail narcotics activity. On August 20, 2013, armed with an arrest and search warrant, detectives stopped defendant’s vehicle less than a mile away from the premises, after having observed him leave the building and drive away with two men. The detectives arrested defendant and his passengers—his co- defendant, Felix Ramos (Ramos), and another individual. At that time, detectives seized a set of keys from defendant’s person that subsequently unlocked an exterior door and a bedroom door in the apartment located on the second floor of 32 Frederick Street.', 'Thereafter, the detectives executed the search warrant for the second-floor apartment. Their search of the kitchen uncovered three bags of cocaine, which together weighed 0.5 grams, and a plate containing 5.2 grams of loose crack cocaine. In the bedroom—where the door was unlocked by using one of the keys seized from defendant—detectives discovered a gun case containing a loaded semi-automatic handgun and a receipt for the gun with defendant’s name on it. From another bedroom, detectives seized three bags of heroin, which weighed a total of 1.7 grams. The bags had been stored in a small box containing loose rice, which—according to the testimony of the detective who seized it—often is utilized by drug dealers to keep heroin dry before sale. Also in that bedroom, detectives found two bottles of clonazepam and diazepam, which were prescribed to individuals other than defendant and Ramos. The detectives also seized from the apartment a digital scale, two .45-caliber ammunition rounds, two boxes of', '-2- sandwich bags and a glass bottle containing several “piece[s] of plastic from * * * sandwich fold-top bag[s],”1 a 100-gram weight, a calculator, large sums of cash,2 and a suspected cutting agent.3', 'The state charged defendant with three counts of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 21-28-4.01(a)(4)(i) (count 1—heroin; count 2—cocaine; and count 3—clonazepam); one count of possession of a firearm while possessing a controlled substance with intent to deliver, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-47-8(c) (count 4); and one count of conspiracy to possess a controlled substance with intent to deliver, in violation of § 21-28-4.08 (count 5).', 'A jury trial was held in Providence County Superior Court in November 2014.

See State v. Bryant, 888 A.2d 965, 971 (R.I. 2006); State v. Turner, 746 A.2d 700, 704 (R.I. 2000).

The jury was not persuaded; on November 24, 2014, it convicted defendant on counts 2, 4, and 5. The trial justice imposed three sentences of eight years at the Adult Correctional Institutions, with two years to serve and six years suspended with probation. The sentences imposed for counts 2', '-4- and 4 run consecutively, and the sentence imposed for count 5 runs concurrently with the sentence imposed for count 2.4 This timely appeal ensued.', 'The defendant raises a bevy of issues before this Court.

The defendant was charged with that offense in count 4 of the original criminal information, but count 4 subsequently was amended to the offense of possession of a firearm while possessing a controlled substance with intent to deliver. 5', 'The defendant additionally asserts on appeal that the trial justice erred in ruling on defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal without first hearing oral argument, in instructing the jury regarding defendant’s decision not to testify at trial, and in informing the jury that transcripts would not be available during its deliberations. None of these issues has been preserved for our review. See State v. Gregson, 113 A.3d 393, 398 (R.I. 2015) (“[This] Court ‘shall not review issues that were not presented to the trial court in such a posture as to alert the trial justice to the question being raised[.]’” (quoting Berard v.

The defendant asserts that his attorney did not object because he did not wish to annoy the trial justice. Unfortunately, the failure to object for strategic reasons is insufficient to overcome the hurdle of this jurisdiction’s well-established raise-or-waive rule. State v. Fry, 130 A.3d 812, 825-26 (R.I. 2016).', 'As to the remaining two issues, defendant concedes that he did not object to either the jury instructions or the trial justice’s comments regarding the availability of transcripts.', '-5-', 'Analysis', 'Rule 26.2 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure permits a defendant to make an opening statement either immediately before the prosecution presents its evidence or just before the presentation of the defense. The purpose of an opening statement is to concisely inform the jury of the issues raised in the case and of the evidence to be introduced by the parties. State v. DePina, 810 A.2d 768, 774 (R.I. 2002). An opening statement does not provide a defendant with an opportunity to argue the merits of the evidence or to impeach the state’s witnesses. Id.; State v. Byrnes, 433 A.2d 658, 664 (R.I. 1981). Instead, the scope of an opening statement is restricted to a summation of the evidence that the parties intend to introduce through witness testimony. DePina, 810 A.2d at 774. This restriction is not limited to a party’s case-in- chief and may embrace the state’s case as well. Id. The evidence, or lack thereof, referred to in an opening statement “may include affirmative evidence that the defendant reasonably expects to solicit on cross-examination of a witness, provided that counsel brings that evidence to the trial court’s attention.” Id.', 'An opening statement may be precluded when a defendant who has not stated with certainty that he will present witnesses in his own defense also fails to “specify what affirmative evidence he reasonably expect[s] to solicit on cross-examination of the state’s witnesses * * *.” Bryant, 888 A.2d at 970; see id. at 971 (holding that the defendant did not have a right to present an opening statement where his attorney had informed the trial court that the defendant had not yet decided whether to present witnesses and she vaguely suggested that the opening statement would provide an “outline for the jury the facts that I think will be elicited * * * on cross- examination”); see also Turner, 746 A.2d at 703-04 (upholding the trial justice’s refusal to allow the defendant to give an opening statement because he did not yet know whether he would call', '-6- witnesses and indicated to the court that he intended to elicit new evidence on cross-examination but refused to specify what that evidence would be).', 'For evidence to be affirmative, it must “[s]upport[] the existence of certain facts.” Black’s Law Dictionary 70 (10th ed. 2014); accord State v. Hass, 265 P.3d 1221, 1226 (Mont. 2011) (defining “affirmative evidence” as “evidence demonstrating that certain facts actually exist”). Generally, “[e]vidence suggesting that an alleged fact does not exist” is not affirmative, Black’s Law Dictionary at 676 (defining “negative evidence”), and an offer of such evidence, standing alone, is insufficient to meet the threshold required for a party to be permitted to give an opening statement, see DePina, 810 A.2d at 774-75.', 'However, a negative assertion can constitute affirmative evidence under certain circumstances. Black’s Law Dictionary at 676. For example, testimony that a witness did not observe the occurrence of an alleged event, on its own, is not affirmative evidence. See id. However, if the alleged event only could have transpired in a single location for a discrete duration of time and the witness observed that location in its entirety during the whole period of time in question, the witness’s testimony to that effect qualifies as affirmative evidence that the event did not happen. Id.', 'In the case at bar, although defense counsel did not describe with specificity what evidence defendant planned to solicit on cross-examination, our review of the record demonstrates that he did not have the opportunity to do so. When defense counsel informed the trial justice that, “I expect that there’s going to be things that * * * I’m going to bring out on cross[-examination] [that] the [s]tate is not going to be able to establish,” it was incumbent upon the trial justice to inquire further. Instead, the trial justice summarily declared that he would not permit defendant to present an opening statement. Our review of the trial transcript leads us to conclude that the trial justice’s summary determination deprived defendant of the opportunity to', '-7- make an offer as to precisely what evidence he intended to elicit. It was incumbent upon the trial justice to inquire further at this juncture and to allow defense counsel to provide a more detailed explanation. Cf. State v. Manning, 973 A.2d 524, 536 (R.I. 2009) (trial justice did not abuse his discretion in precluding question on cross-examination on the basis that it lacked probative value where the defendant was given “the opportunity to explain” why he believed his proposed question had probative significance); Laurence v. Nelson, 785 A.2d 519, 521 (R.I. 2001) (trial justice did not err in declining to allow the plaintiff to make an offer of proof where the plaintiff “was allowed to explain the question he would ask, the response he would elicit, and what he hoped to prove with this evidence[,] * * * [and was] allowed * * * to finish his statement”).', 'Without the benefit of defense counsel’s responses to further inquiry, we cannot conclude one way or another whether defendant reasonably expected to elicit affirmative evidence on cross-examination of the state’s witnesses. However, since the mainstay of his defense was that he did not exercise control over the incriminating evidence seized, it is entirely conceivable that defendant intended to solicit negative assertions from the state’s witnesses that—in this particular set of circumstances—would constitute affirmative evidence.', 'The state urges that the facts in this case are analogous to Byrnes, 433 A.2d at 664, in which this Court held that the defendant was not entitled to use an opening statement to direct jurors to “pay attention to such factors as the witnesses’ demeanor, their prior criminal involvement, their explanation[s] about particular aspects of evidence which might be developed on cross-examination, and the reasons for any inconsistencies in their testimony.” We disagree. Unlike the defendant in Byrnes, who sought to use his opening statement to discuss what is best classified as impeachment evidence, id., defendant in this case intended to address evidence that tended to show the absence of a prima facie case against him. Neither this evidence nor', '-8- defendant’s theory at trial that he had not exercised control over the apartment was impeaching in nature. Consequently, the state’s reliance on Byrnes is misplaced.', 'This case also differs from Bryant, 888 A.2d at 971, where the defendant’s attorney informed the trial justice that her proposed opening statement would “outline for the jury the facts that I think will be elicited * * * on cross-examination.” Indeed, the descriptions provided by the attorneys in both Bryant and the case at bar lacked specificity, but there exists a critical difference. Defense counsel in Bryant gave no hint as to what evidence she expected to bring out on cross-examination; she stated only, in a conclusory manner, that “facts * * * [would] be elicited.” Id. Unlike the attorney in Bryant, defense counsel in this case attempted to make an offer: He pointed to potential negative assertions that would be made by the state’s witnesses on cross-examination.', 'Defense counsel “[brought the] evidence to the trial court’s attention,” DePina, 810 A.2d at 774, albeit somewhat nebulously, while the attorney in Bryant did not.', 'This Court is mindful that—although the burden of proof in a criminal trial rests squarely on the state—a trial is the accused’s only opportunity to defend himself against the substantive charges levied by the prosecution. “It is * * * the defendant’s trial.” State v. Arciliares, 108 A.3d 1040, 1052 (R.I. 2015) (Goldberg, J., concurring). The trial justice erred in this case by not permitting the defendant to make an opening statement without affording him the opportunity to articulate the nature of the affirmative evidence he intended to elicit on cross-examination. Since the defendant described potentially affirmative evidence in a less-than-precise fashion, further probing by the trial justice was warranted to ensure that the defendant would not summarily— and, perhaps, erroneously—be denied the opportunity to present an opening statement.', '-9-', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons articulated above, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court and remand the case to that tribunal for a new trial.

8,": Realty Trust v. : America Condominium Association, Inc., : et al.",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. The saga continues between the plaintiff, Bennie Sisto (Sisto or plaintiff), and the defendants, America Condominium Association, Inc., and the members of its executive board, (collectively, defendants). This time, the plaintiff appeals the Superior Court’s award of $8,924.60 to the defendants for their attorney’s fees incurred in defending the plaintiff’s claim on appeal pursuant to Rhode Island’s strategic lawsuit against public participation (anti-SLAPP) statute, G.L. 1956 chapter 33 of title 9. This matter came before the Supreme Court on February 25, 2016, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised should not be summarily decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and reviewing the memoranda submitted on behalf of the parties, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown. Accordingly, we shall decide the matters at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Setting the various nuances and nitty-gritty details of this seemingly never-ending case aside, the facts essential to the instant appeal are as follows. 1 The plaintiff owns a condominium unit within the Goat Island South (GIS) condominium community.', 'In 2006, he filed an application with the Coastal Resources Management Council (CRMC) seeking to expand his unit. The defendants filed an objection to his proposal, asserting, inter alia, that plaintiff did not own the property upon which he sought to expand his unit and that his proposal failed to comply with certain CRMC requirements. As a result of this objection and other correspondence with defendants, the CRMC questioned whether plaintiff owned the land he sought to expand upon and denied his application.', 'In March 2008, plaintiff took his grievances to the courthouse and filed a complaint in Newport County Superior Court alleging slander of title and breach of contract and seeking a declaratory judgment that he had the right to file an application with the CRMC to expand his unit. Not to be outdone, defendants moved for partial summary judgment, arguing that our anti- SLAPP statute protected them from any liability for questioning plaintiff’s ownership of the land in their communications with the CRMC. The trial justice granted defendants’ partial summary judgment motion; and, in accordance with § 9-33-2(d) of the anti-SLAPP statute, awarded defendants $9,685.31 in attorney’s fees. The plaintiff appealed to this Court, and we affirmed the Superior Court’s grant of the partial summary judgment motion in favor of defendants on the 1', 'For a full recitation of the facts surrounding this ten-year odyssey, we refer the reader to our opinion in Sisto v. America Condominium Association, Inc., 68 A.3d 603 (R.I. 2013).', '-2- anti-SLAPP claim. 2 Sisto v. America Condominium Association, Inc., 68 A.3d 603, 617 (R.I. 2013).', 'Following that opinion, defendants filed an amended motion for an assessment of attorney’s fees in Superior Court seeking to recover $29,748.65 incurred in defending the anti- SLAPP judgment on appeal. 3', 'In that proceeding, the hearing justice first issued a decision in which he determined that the Superior Court had subject matter jurisdiction to hear defendants’ motion, rejecting plaintiff’s myriad contentions to the contrary. The hearing justice then issued a subsequent decision awarding defendants $8,924.60 in attorney’s fees in connection with the appeal. Final judgment was entered on April 30, 2015. The plaintiff filed a timely appeal. 4', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'On appeal, plaintiff argues that the hearing justice erred when he determined that the Superior Court had subject matter jurisdiction over defendants’ motion for assessment for attorney’s fees. He also posits that the fees awarded to defendants were unreasonable. We discuss the specifics of his quarrels below. 2', 'We also concluded that the Rhode Island Condominium Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 36.1 of title 34, required plaintiff to obtain unanimous consent from the other 153 unit owners in the Goat Island Community to expand his townhouse on to the shared land. Sisto, 68 A.3d at 614. 3', 'The defendants’ original motion sought attorney’s fees in the amount of $152,122.55. The motion was amended to “eliminat[e] fees mistakenly included in the original motion” and sought a total of $39,433.96, which included the outstanding $9,685.31 in attorney’s fees that were previously awarded by the Superior Court. 4', 'According to defendants, shortly after plaintiff filed the instant notice of appeal, defendants received a check from plaintiff in the amount of $8,924.60 along with a memorandum which stated that plaintiff was making payment “without prejudice and with full reservation of rights.” From what we can discern from the record and the parties’ prebriefing statements, the previous award of $9,685.31 remains unpaid.', '-3-', 'III', 'Discussion', 'To begin, we sketch a brief overview of attorney’s fees as they relate to the anti-SLAPP statute. Section 9-33-2(d) provides: “If the court grants the motion asserting the immunity established by this section, * * * the court shall award the prevailing party costs and reasonable attorney’s fees, including those incurred for the motion and any related discovery matters.” (Emphasis added.) Thus, in Alves v. Hometown Newspapers, Inc., 857 A.2d 743, 757 (R.I. 2004), we held that when a party prevails under the anti-SLAPP statute, “an award of costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees [is] mandatory.” We have also stated that the statutorily mandated fees include those in connection with an appeal “for the defense of [such] judgment.” Karousos v. Pardee, 992 A.2d 263, 273 (R.I. 2010). This statutory authority results in a deviation from our otherwise “staunch adherence to the ‘American rule’ that requires each litigant to pay its own attorney’s fees * * *.” Moore v. Ballard, 914 A.2d 487, 489 (R.I. 2007) (citing Eleazer v. Ted Reed Thermal, Inc., 576 A.2d 1217, 1221 (R.I. 1990)).', 'The plaintiff does not dispute that defendants “prevailed” under the anti-SLAPP statute, both in the Superior Court and on appeal. Thus, under our case law, an award of reasonable attorney’s fees in defendants’ favor—including those incurred in connection with defending the judgment on appeal—is mandatory. The plaintiff nevertheless attacks the award both as to its propriety and reasonableness.', 'A. Propriety of the Award of Attorney’s Fees', 'Whether the issue of attorney’s fees was properly before the Superior Court is a threshold matter in this appeal, so we address this issue first.', '-4-', 'i. The Mandate Rule', 'The plaintiff’s most tenable argument is that the Superior Court improperly deviated from our mandate in Sisto, 68 A.3d at 617, by awarding defendants attorney’s fees because the mandate provided no such direction.', '“The ‘mandate rule’ can be summarized as follows:', '‘When a case has been once decided by this court on appeal, and remanded to the', '[Superior Court], whatever was before this court, and disposed of by its decree, is', 'considered as finally settled. The [Superior Court] is bound by the decree as the', 'law of the case, and must carry it into execution according to the mandate. That', 'court cannot vary it, or examine it for any other purpose than execution; or give', 'any other or further relief; or review it, even for apparent error, upon any matter', 'decided on appeal; or intermeddle with it, further than to settle so much as has', 'been remanded. * * * But the [Superior Court] may consider and decide any', 'matters left open by the mandate of this court.’” Pleasant Management, LLC v.', 'Carrasco, 960 A.2d 216, 223 (R.I. 2008) (quoting United States v. Thrasher, 483', 'F.3d 977, 981 (9th Cir. 2007)).', 'Our mandate in Sisto, 68 A.3d at 617, stated, in relevant part, “we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court * * * with respect to Sisto’s standing to file the application for expansion with the CRMC, as well as with respect to the anti-SLAPP issue. * * * The papers may be remanded to the Superior Court.” The mandate makes no mention of attorney’s fees in connection with that appeal because that issue was not before us. Nevertheless, the fact that we did not explicitly mention attorney’s fees in the mandate did not preclude the Superior Court from subsequently awarding defendants attorney’s fees incurred in defending the judgment on appeal. See Perkins v. Standard Oil Co. of California, 399 U.S. 222, 223 (1970).', 'Indeed, the assessment of attorney’s fees is best handled by the Superior Court. See Keystone Elevator Co. v. Johnson & Wales University, 850 A.2d 912, 920 (R.I. 2004) (noting that “[t]he trial justice is in the unique position of observing the attorneys requesting the fees and is better able to judge the merits of a particular request.”). Because it was silent with regard to attorney’s fees—which, we reiterate,', '-5- are mandatory under § 9-33-2(d)—our mandate left the determination of the proper award of fees to the Superior Court. See Perkins, 399 U.S. at 223. Therefore, the Superior Court did not vary from our mandate when it considered defendants’ motion for appellate attorney’s fees. 5', 'ii. Res Judicata', 'Battling on, plaintiff also argues that the doctrine of res judicata barred the Superior Court from entertaining defendants’ motion for attorney’s fees. However, res judicata is not applicable to the case at hand because that doctrine bars the relitigation of issues in a second cause of action. Torrado Architects v. Rhode Island Department of Human Services, 102 A.3d 655, 658 (R.I. 2014). Here, no second cause of action has been filed. Rather, the original cause of action remains ongoing. Thus, the doctrine of res judicata is inapposite. 6', 'B. Reasonableness of the Fees', 'The plaintiff next argues that the Superior Court erroneously awarded defendants attorney’s fees because they failed to submit sufficient documentation to substantiate their request. Specifically, he contends that the records submitted by defendants did not identify the hours expended on the anti-SLAPP claim versus the other issues on appeal and may have been duplicative. Thus, plaintiff contends that the hearing justice abused his discretion by arbitrarily awarding defendants $8,924.60 in fees. 5', 'This line of reasoning also effectively disposes of plaintiff’s contention that defendants’ failure to explicitly request an award of fees from this Court prevented the Superior Court from awarding them. Furthermore, while the better practice may have been to request the fees in their initial appeal, plaintiff does not point to any statutory or common law rule that requires it. 6', 'In a last-ditch effort, plaintiff argues that defendants cannot recover attorney’s fees because they did not actually pay the fees; rather, their insurance company did. However, there is no requirement that a prevailing party pay its fees out of pocket in order to recover, and, at oral argument, defendants’ counsel represented that all but approximately $1,000 of the fee award would be recouped by their insurance company, presumably pursuant to a subrogation agreement.', '-6-', 'This Court reviews an award of attorney’s fees for an abuse of discretion. Pearson v. Pearson, 11 A.3d 103, 108 (R.I. 2011) (citing Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island v. Najarian, 911 A.2d 706, 709 (R.I. 2006)). “It is well within the authority of the trial justice to make an attorneys’ fee award determination after considering the circumstances of the case.” Keystone Elevator Co. v. Johnson & Wales University, 850 A.2d 912, 920 (R.I. 2004) (citing Schroff, Inc. v. Taylor-Peterson, 732 A.2d 719, 721 (R.I. 1999)). After reviewing the record and the hearing justice’s decision, we conclude that he did not abuse his discretion when he awarded attorney’s fees to defendants in connection with their appeal. The hearing justice carefully considered the circumstances surrounding this unique and drawn-out case. He conducted an in camera review of the invoices submitted with defendants’ motion and calculated a fee in light of what he had before him.', 'In determining the “lodestar,” 7 the hearing justice first reduced defendants’ request of $29,748.65 by 75 percent to more accurately reflect the time spent on the “tangentially-related” anti-SLAPP claim and eliminate time that may have been spent on the other issues that were on appeal.', 'While an across-the-board reduction is certainly not the most precise method for 7', 'The “lodestar” is the starting point for determining the reasonableness of attorney’s fees and is “the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.” Matter of Schiff, 684 A.2d 1126, 1131 (R.I. 1996) (quoting Pontarelli v. Stone, 781 F. Supp. 114, 120 (D.R.I. 1992) and Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433 (1983)). Since our opinion in Colonial Plumbing & Heating Supply Co. v. Contemporary Construction Co., 464 A.2d 741, 744 (R.I. 1983), “affidavits or expert testimony establishing the criteria on which a fee award is to be based” have been required. Furthermore, we note that our recent opinion in Tri- Town Construction Co. v. Commerce Park Associates 12 LLC, Nos. 2015-22-A & 2015-146-A, slip. op. at 18 (R.I., filed June 22, 2016) held that such affidavits or testimony must be submitted by independent counsel who are “not representing the parties to the action in which fees are sought.” In that case, however, the propriety of the affidavit completed by the party seeking attorney’s fees—which was indeed completed by the party’s own attorney—was specifically challenged. Our holding in that case did not extend to the scenario in which neither the reasonableness of the fees nor the propriety of the affidavit submitted by the party seeking fees is challenged, as was the case here.', '-7- calculating an award of attorney’s fees, the hearing justice was forced to make do with what he had—which were billing records that, in his words, “d[id] not even begin to approach a diligent accounting of the hours spent on the anti-SLAPP appeal” and from which he could not “distinguish work performed on anti-SLAPP issues [from] time dedicated to other matters.” Sisto v. America Condominium Association, Inc., 2015 WL1620069 * 3 (R.I. Super. April 8, 2015). In view of the records submitted by defendants, we cannot say that the trial justice abused his discretion in making this reduction. See Codex Corp. v. Milgo Electronic Corp., 717 F.2d 622, 632 (1st Cir. 1983) (holding that it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to reduce an award of attorney’s fees where the submissions were “inadequate”); see also Role Models America, Inc. v. Brownlee, 353 F.3d 962, 973 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (allowing reimbursement for only 50 percent of attorney’s fees in light of the party’s “inadequate documentation, failure to justify the number of hours sought, inconsistencies, and improper billing entries”).', 'The hearing justice then increased the already-reduced fee by 5 percent based on the complexity of the anti-SLAPP claim (relying largely on the fact that there was a dissent in Sisto as to that issue) to reach a final award of $8,924.60. We see no abuse of discretion with this determination, either. See Cohen v. West Haven Board of Police Commissioners, 638 F.2d 496, 505 (2d Cir. 1980) (“the court may adjust the lodestar figure upward or downward to take account of such factors as the * * * complexity of the litigation”).', 'Given the record he was presented with and the protracted nature of this case, it is our opinion that the hearing justice issued a particularly comprehensive and well-thought-out thirteen-page decision explaining his case-specific reasoning for arriving at his final award of attorney’s fees. As such, we cannot say he abused his discretion in doing so. However, we must', '-8- caution that, in the future, we will require more meticulous recordkeeping by attorneys seeking an award of fees—our tolerance today is limited to the circumstances of this case.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the aforementioned reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. The papers in this case shall be returned to that court.', 'Chief Justice Suttell did not participate.', 'Justice Goldberg, dissenting. I respectfully dissent. This is chapter two of what I consider to be an abuse of a citizen’s right to access our courts, particularly the Supreme Court. After this Court’s decision in the underlying case, Sisto v. America Condominium Association, Inc., 68 A.3d 603 (R.I. 2013) (Sisto I), the emboldened defendants submitted a request for attorney’s fees to the Superior Court for a whopping $152,122.55. No explanation has been provided for this exorbitant request that subsequently was reduced to $29,748.65, again without explication. No contemporaneous billing records reflecting the actual time spent on this discrete issue exist. No disinterested attorney testified by affidavit that the submission was, in his or her opinion, a reasonable attorney’s fee request. Indeed, the only attorney who so opined was the attorney requesting the fee, a circumstance overlooked by the trial justice.', 'Cf. Colonial Plumbing & Heating Supply Co. v. Contemporary Construction Co., 464 A.2d 741, 744 (R.I. 1983) (declaring that, for the explicit purpose of providing a record upon which this Court may review the propriety of the fee award, “affidavits or testimony establishing the criteria on which a fee award is to be based should be required”); Kenney v. Hickey, 486 A.2d 1079, 1084 (R.I. 1985) (vacating fee for guardian ad litem based on the failure of the Family Court to follow the majority rule set forth in Colonial Plumbing, 464 A.2d at 744, and requiring expert testimony on', '-9- the question of the reasonableness of an award of attorney’s fees). In Sisto I, the defendants’ Supreme Court brief for the anti-SLAPP issue consists of a scant nine pages and does not concern a novel or difficult issue of law.', 'In this case, it was impossible for the trial court, or anyone else for that matter, to determine the lodestar for this extraordinary demand. It is well settled that “[t]he starting point or ‘lodestar’ for determining the reasonableness of a fee is ‘the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.’” In re Schiff, 684 A.2d 1126, 1131 (R.I. 1996) (quoting Pontarelli v. Stone, 781 F. Supp. 114, 120 (D.R.I. 1992) (attached as an appendix to In re Schiff) and Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433 (1983)). This is the guiding light for fee-shifting jurisprudence. Its absence in this case was excused by the trial justice and, sadly, again by this Court. Indeed, the trial justice found that “[t]he billing records here do not even begin to approach a diligent accounting of the hours spent on the anti-SLAPP appeal.” The trial justice declared that he could not,', '“by review of these records, both redacted and unredacted,', 'distinguish between work performed on anti-SLAPP issues and', 'that time dedicated to other matters. * * * For example, it is', 'impossible to determine how the seven hours spent ‘draft[ing the]', 'appellate brief’ on November 1, 2012 was divided between the two', 'issues.”', 'The trial justice also lamented that there was only vague mention of correspondences with clients, appellate strategy, oral-argument preparation, and brief drafting in the billing records. The submission included fees for “countless phone conversations regarding the ‘status of [the] appeal’ with each individual board member” that the trial justice found to “provide little insight to the [c]ourt as to whether such phone calls were necessary or simply duplicative.”', '- 10 - Further, “there was no attempt to abate billing entries that encompassed both fee-eligible and non-fee-eligible work.” In the face of these glaring deficiencies, the fee request should have been denied, and this Court should so hold.', 'Additionally, the trial justice found that the fee request included work done on the declaratory-judgment appeal—which is forbidden—and he rejected counsel’s affidavit testimony that the requested fees did not include matters that were exclusively related to the declaratory- judgment action.', 'In my opinion, these damning findings should have ended this unfortunate episode, and the request for fees should have been denied. And this Court should so hold. The trial justice, however, proceeded to attempt to “separate the wheat from the chaff in calculating a reasonable award.” Rather than carefully sifting through these unpalatable ingredients, he simply performed a mathematical exercise and culled out 70 percent of the request. 8 The trial justice failed to set forth his reasoning for awarding 30 percent of the request in the face of what the trial justice acknowledged was inadequate documentation, a failure to justify the number of hours sought, inconsistencies, and improper billing entries. In my opinion, this is an abuse of discretion and an unjust result. The trial justice, on the basis of the request and the affidavit of counsel, should have concluded, as do I, that this request shocks the conscience of the Court to such a degree that fees should be denied. See Schiff, 684 A.2d at 1136.', 'Finally, I pause to note that this is not the only decision this term by this Court concerning an award of award attorney’s fees. In Tri-Town Construction Co. v. Commerce Park 8', 'The trial justice first reduced the fee by 75 percent “to account for the relative apportionment between the reasonable time necessary to prepare the anti-SLAPP and declaratory[-]judgment matters” and then “increase[d] the already-reduced fee award by [five percent] to reach a lodestar of $8[,]924.60”—resulting in an award of 30 percent of the amount most recently requested.', '- 11 - Associates 12, LLC, No. 2015-22-A, No. 2015-146-A, slip op. at 18-19 (R.I., filed June 22, 2016), this Court reiterated the mandatory nature of our holding in Colonial Plumbing—that affidavits or testimony of expert witnesses “must be from counsel who is a member of the Rhode Island Bar and who is not representing the parties to the action in which fees are sought.” Tri- Town Construction Co., slip op. at 18. Although this precise challenge was not made in the case before us, the record before this Court, in my opinion, is replete with such shockingly egregious deficiencies that the award constitutes an abuse of discretion. In Tri-Town Construction Co., we unequivocally rejected the use of “affidavits and documents provided to the court by interested parties.” Id. at 19. We also held that, “[a]lthough the standard of review of an order awarding attorney’s fees is [an] abuse of discretion, we are of the opinion that this discretion can only be exercised after competent evidence from independent counsel has been admitted.” Id. at 18-19 (emphasis added). In the case before us, we are doing just that—declaring that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion based on “the record he was presented with and the protracted nature of this case.” This is error. This error is compounded by our further justification that, “in the future, we will require more meticulous recordkeeping by attorneys seeking an award of fees— our tolerance today is limited to the circumstances of this case.” I am not on board.', 'The Denial of Access to the Courts', 'My second concern in this case echoes that of my original dissent: that admittedly false letters sent to the Coastal Resources Management Council by counsel for the defendants and by an individual board member, declaring that Sisto did not own the property upon which he sought to expand his unit, were not “directed at petition or free speech,” a required finding to trigger the anti-SLAPP protections of the statute. G.L. 1956 § 9-33-2(a). Although the plaintiff had every right to appeal from the original finding that his complaint violated the anti-SLAPP statute and', '- 12 - certainly presented this Court with a justiciable controversy, he did so at the risk of an additional adverse attorney’s fee award—that is more than the original attorney’s fee. This is unjust. The result today is emblematic of the very harm I alluded to in my dissenting opinion in Sisto I, 68 A.3d at 618, 620: the denial of access to our courts. It is the responsibility of this Court to guard against infringement of the rights of citizens to turn to the judiciary for resolution of their disputes. This is the essence of petitioning activity that ought to be paramount in this case.

Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). On April 19, 2011, before this Court’s decision in Sisto, 68 A.3d at 603, plaintiffs filed the instant action seeking injunctive relief to bring a halt to the expansion of Unit 18 onto a limited common element—specifically, the yard surrounding Unit 18 on which a foundation had been built by Unit 18’s previous owners.', 'The plaintiffs’ complaint alleged breach of the GIS SAR, violation of restrictive covenants, common law trespass, and violation of Rhode Island’s Condominium Act, G.L. 1956', '-3- chapter 36.1 of title 34 (the Act). A bench trial was held on May 12, 17, 27, and 31, June 14, and September 22, 2011. We relate below the salient aspects of what transpired at that trial.', 'A', 'The Trial Testimony', '1. The Testimony of Bennie Sisto', 'As the trial justice’s decision in the instant case reflects, Bennie Sisto is the father of trustee Stefania Mardo, and he entered this case as “an additional trustee” prior to the Superior Court’s decision.', 'Mr. Sisto testified at trial, during which testimony he acknowledged that Unit 18 was being expanded by the addition of exterior walls. However, he further stated that the “original expansion of Harbor Houses Number 18 was obviously back when [the previous owners] had ownership of the property back in 2000, 2001;” he added that his construction was only on the “existing foundation.” Mr. Sisto conceded that his expansion of Unit 18 did expand it past its “1988 footprint,” but he reiterated that the expansion was confined to the existing foundation, which was on the property when he purchased it.', 'It was Mr. Sisto’s testimony that, at the time he purchased Unit 18, the foundation on which he was building was then being used as a “patio and a deck.” However, it was his further testimony that the foundation was not intended to be a patio or a deck but, rather, had been part of a “proposed building expansion” by the previous owners. He added that “a previous Court ordered that th[e] foundation be put into the ground” but the parties then “agreed not to complete construction until the Court case ended.” Referring to his affidavit and an attached judgment of the Superior Court (entered as an exhibit at trial), Mr. Sisto also testified that it was his belief', '-4- that the expansion of Unit 18 had been later “expressly authorized” by the Superior Court judgment attached to his affidavit.', 'The Superior Court judgment attached to Mr. Sisto’s affidavit is dated December 14, 2009 and reflects a decision by a Superior Court justice to the effect that the defendants in that action (which did not include America or Capella) were enjoined from interfering with the right of the previous owners of Unit 18 to proceed with “renovations;” the judgment allowed the “renovations” as laid out in plans issued and submitted to the Harbor Houses Condominium Board in May of 2001.', 'It is also worth noting that trial exhibit 8 was a decision of the GIS Board, dated February 1, 2011, which stated that there was no objection by any of the unit owners to the “plans for Harbor Houses # 18;” there was no assertion that the “proposed improvements, alterations or changes would significantly diminish the water view of such residence units as viewed from the glass doors/windows/balconies of such residence units.” Despite the fact that the decision of the GIS Board was dated after the Trust bought the property, that decision is addressed to the previous owners. It was Mr. Sisto’s testimony on cross- examination that the plans he used for the expansion of Unit 18 were actually those that were commissioned by the previous owners, and he added that his expansion was smaller than the expansion intended by the previous owners.', 'Mr. Sisto’s affidavit also stated that “ten (10) of the nineteen (19) Harbor Houses unit owners have expanded over the years, including most recently in 2008,” and he cited specifically to the expansion of Harbor Houses Unit 10 to support the contention that the Trust was within its rights in expanding Unit 18. However, Mr. Sisto did concede at trial that the area he was expanding on was “owned in undivided percentage interest” by the 154 unit owners at GIS and that he did not have the unanimous approval of all 154 unit owners to expand his condominium.', '-5-', 'It was further Mr. Sisto’s testimony that, prior to his commencing the expansion of Unit 18, Natalie Volpe, the President of the GIS Board, communicated with him by email regarding his expansion. Her email was entered as an exhibit at trial. The email cited as authority the Newport County Superior Court rulings which this Court eventually reviewed in Sisto, 68 A.3d at 603. (The appeal was still pending before this Court at the time when Ms. Volpe sent the email.) The email contained the following pertinent language:', '“ * * * [I]f a portion of the limited common element is to', 'be permanently occupied, thereby necessitating a reallocation, than', '[sic] the unanimous consent of 154 unit owners must be present in', 'order to amend the declaration. Additionally, in accordance with', 'basic property law, it is prohibited to permanently occupy a limited', 'common element to the absolute exclusion of the other 154', 'property owners without their consent.', '“ * * * A recent ruling in Newport * * * has resulted in an', 'order for the construction of an addition to an existing house be', 'taken down. The precedent has been established. Please do not take', 'further action on [Unit] 18 * * * at this time as GIS will enforce', 'the [GIS SAR and the Act].”', 'Mr. Sisto testified that he understood that email to be the personal opinion of Ms. Volpe, not the opinion of the GIS Board, since “[t]hey did not vote on [it].”', '2. The Remaining Pertinent Testimony at Trial', 'Sandra Conca testified at trial that she was the President of America’s Board. It was her further testimony that she did not consent to the expansion of Unit 18, and she expressed her belief that a building could not be constructed on Unit 18’s yard since it was a limited common element; she added that such expansions would decrease the overall ownership percentage of the common elements of each unit owner. She further stated that at least one owner of a different Harbor Houses condominium had been allowed to expand in the past.', '-6-', 'Edmond McKeown testified that he owned an America condominium and that he did not consent to the expansion of Harbor Houses Unit 18 onto a limited common element; he added that the expansion of Unit 18 greatly increased the size of that unit.', 'B', 'The Superior Court Decision', 'In her August 22, 2012 decision, the trial justice began by noting that plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction had been “advanced to a trial on the merits.” The trial justice then proceeded to make findings of fact and credibility determinations. She found Mr. Sisto to be a “very genial, respectful and forbearing gentlem[a]n [who] provided the [c]ourt with considerable information concerning * * * the construction history of unit 18.”', 'She noted that he acknowledged that the unanimous consent of 154 unit owners had not been obtained, but she also noted that he had testified that he was not expanding Unit 18 beyond the existing foundation, which had been installed by the previous owners in connection with a planned expansion. The trial justice also noted that Mr. Sisto testified that the expansion consisted of placing exterior walls “‘where there were no walls before’” and that he acknowledged that the expansion was altering the boundaries of his unit.', 'The trial justice proceeded to find that defendants were acting in violation of § 34-36.1- 2.17(d) and § 34-36-7(b) of the Act, which statutory provisions require unanimous consent of all unit owners with respect to an amendment of the GIS SAR allowing for expansion by changing of the boundaries of any unit or the allocated interests of a unit; she added that the GIS SAR provided that it was subject to the Act and that, therefore, the provisions of the GIS SAR must be interpreted to conform with the requirements of the Act. Accordingly, she found that defendants had violated the GIS SAR as well as the above-cited statutory provisions.', '-7-', 'At that juncture, the trial justice proceeded to state: “If the [c]ourt was permitted to view this controversy through a purely equitable lens, a different outcome could be considered.” She noted that the expansion of Unit 18 did not result in any view obstruction for any of the America or Capella condominiums. She added that nine other Harbor Houses condominiums had been expanded “without objection or challenge from America or Capella.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) She then granted plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief precluding further expansion of Unit 18 but declined to grant plaintiffs’ request that the court issue a mandatory injunction ordering the Trust to remove all construction on Unit 18 that expanded it beyond its “‘pre- expansion footprint.’” She further declined to award plaintiffs attorneys’ fees or court costs.', 'On February 25, 2014, a final judgment was entered. That judgment held: (1) that the expansion provisions of § 2.3 of the GIS SAR violated the Act and could not be enforced; (2) that defendants had breached §§ 2.3(a)(i)(A) & (M) and § 11.1(b) of the GIS SAR; (3) that no judgment need enter on Count Three of plaintiffs’ complaint, which alleged a violation of restrictive covenants, since the trial justice deemed that issue to be moot; and (4) that defendants had committed a common law trespass. The judgment expressly denied plaintiffs’ request for attorneys’ fees and costs. Timely appeals were filed.', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'The plaintiffs make three allegations of error on appeal: (1) that, even though the trial justice properly found a continuing trespass, she erred when she “failed to issue a mandatory permanent injunction” requiring the removal of the trespass; (2) that the trial justice erred in declaring Count Three of plaintiffs’ complaint moot; and (3) that the trial justice “committed an', '-8- error of law by failing to recognize the contractual basis for awarding attorneys [sic] fees as provided by * * * the GIS SAR.”', 'In its cross-appeal, the Trust contends: (1) that the trial justice erred “as a matter of law in ruling that the Trust breached the GIS SAR;” and (2) that the trial justice committed a further error of law when she ruled that the Trust committed a trespass.', 'III', 'Analysis', 'We must begin our analysis by noting that much of the testimony and the trial justice’s decision in the instant case are devoted to the issue of whether or not expansion of a GIS condominium onto a limited common element required the approval of all 154 unit owners. At that time, the parties and the trial justice did not have the benefit of our decision in Sisto, 68 A.3d at 603. In Sisto, 68 A.3d at 614, we definitively held that the Act requires the consent of all 154 unit owners before any unit could expand its boundaries. As such, the parties (with the exception of Harbor Houses—see footnote 2, supra) do not raise that issue on appeal. Accordingly, it is established that the Trust’s expansion of Unit 18 violated the Act.', 'A', 'The GIS SAR', '1. Standard of Review', 'In reviewing a condominium declaration, “we find it appropriate to apply the laws of contract construction.” Sisto, 68 A.3d at 611; see Town Houses at Bonnet Shores Condominium Association v. Langlois, 45 A.3d 577, 583 (R.I. 2012). As such, we conduct a de novo review. Sisto, 68 A.3d at 612; see Bliss Mine Road Condominium Association v. Nationwide Property and Casualty Insurance Co., 11 A.3d 1078, 1083 (R.I. 2010).', '-9-', 'We have often stated that, when we review a contract on appeal, the contract “must be viewed in its entirety, and the contract terms must be assigned their plain and ordinary meanings.”', 'Rivera v. Gagnon, 847 A.2d 280, 284 (R.I. 2004); see Bliss Mine Road Condominium Association, 11 A.3d at 1083. Consequently, “[i]f the contract terms are clear and unambiguous, judicial construction is at an end for the terms will be applied as written.” Rivera, 847 A.2d at 284 (citing W.P. Associates v. Forcier, Inc., 637 A.2d 353, 356 (R.I. 1994)). Moreover, “[t]he Court will refrain from engaging in mental gymnastics or from stretching the imagination to read ambiguity into a [contract] where none is present.” Bliss Mine Road Condominium Association, 11 A.3d at 1083 (internal quotation marks omitted). A contract is ambiguous only if it is “reasonably and clearly susceptible of more than one interpretation.” Rivera, 847 A.2d at 284 (internal quotation marks omitted).', '2. The Trust’s Cross-Appeal: Breach of Contract', 'The first question with which we are presented is whether or not, in addition to violating the Act, the expansion of Unit 18 also violated the GIS SAR. In its cross-appeal, the Trust raises the contention that the trial justice erred in finding that the Trust violated the GIS SAR. It contends that, due to the fact that the expansion provisions in § 2.3 of the GIS SAR were held by the trial justice to be violative of the Act, those provisions are “unenforceable and cannot form the basis of a breach of contract.” It further argues that § 11.1(b) of the GIS SAR is not applicable to the instant case.', 'In her final judgment in this case the trial justice found that §§ 2.3(a)(i)(A) & (M) and § 11.1(b) of the GIS SAR had been breached. Even assuming arguendo that the Trust is correct that § 2.3 of the GIS SAR could not be the basis for a finding of breach of contract due to the fact that that section was found to be unenforceable by the trial justice, there are alternative', '- 10 - grounds on which this Court can conclude that the trial justice properly held that the GIS SAR was breached—namely, § 11.1(b). Section 11.1(b) of the GIS SAR adopts the language of § 34- 36.1-2.17(d) of the Act and provides as follows:', '“Consistent with subsection 34-36.1-2.17(d) of the Act,', 'except to the extent expressly permitted or required by the Act, no', 'amendment may * * * change the boundaries of any Unit * * * in', 'the absence of unanimous consent of the Unit Owners.” It would not be possible for this Court to rule that the language of § 11.1(b) was ambiguous without engaging in the “mental gymnastics” and “stretching [of] the imagination” which we have consistently refused to do when confronted with clear contractual language. Bliss Mine Road Condominium Association, 11 A.3d at 1083 (internal quotation marks omitted). We declared in Sisto, 68 A.3d at 612-14, that the Act required unanimous consent of all 154 unit owners before a change in the boundaries of any unit could be made, and § 11.1(b) of the GIS SAR clearly and unambiguously echoes that requirement; it incorporates the language of the Act itself and requires unanimous consent to amend a condominium declaration to change the boundaries of a unit. See Rivera, 847 A.2d at 284. Mr. Sisto admitted in his testimony at trial that he did not have the unanimous consent of all 154 unit owners to change the boundaries of Unit 18. Accordingly, it necessarily follows that the expansion of Unit 18 violated the clear and unambiguous language of § 11.1(b) of the GIS SAR.', 'The Trust contends that it could not have breached § 11.1(b) of the GIS SAR because that section applies to amendments to the GIS SAR, whereas the Trust did not seek an amendment of the GIS SAR. However, this argument is without merit. The Act specifically states that “[t]he percentage of the undivided interest of each unit owner in the common areas and facilities * * * shall not be altered without the consent of all of the unit owners expressed in an amended declaration duly recorded.” Section 34-36-7(b) (emphasis added). Section 34-36.1-', '- 11 - 2.17(d) then requires, as we recognized in Sisto, 68 A.3d at 613-14, that an amendment to change the boundaries of a unit be the result of “unanimous consent of [all the other] unit owners.” The amendment language in § 34-36.1-2.17(d) is clearly reflective of the requirement of an amendment laid out in § 34-36-7(b), and it is undisputed that both statutory sections are applicable to the instant case.', 'Importantly, § 11.1(b) of the GIS SAR contains the same amendment language as § 34-36.1-2.17(d). Therefore, the fact that the Trust did not seek an amendment does not change the fact that the Act requires the Trust to seek such an amendment before expanding the boundaries of the unit and that the GIS SAR incorporates that requirement in § 11.1(b). In our judgment, § 11.1(b) is clearly applicable to the instant case.', 'Accordingly, for the just-discussed reasons, we conclude that the trial justice did not err in finding that the Trust breached the GIS SAR.', '3. The Plaintiffs’ Appeal: Count Three in Plaintiffs’ Complaint', 'The plaintiffs posit on appeal that the trial justice “committed an error of law in declaring Count Three of the plaintiff’s [sic] complaint moot because the trespass * * * continues[] to violate the restrictive covenants of the GIS SAR.” They aver that the violation of the restrictive covenants would require removal of the trespass.', 'In Count Two of plaintiffs’ complaint, they allege that “[b]y expanding Harbor Houses Unit No 18 onto limited common elements and changing the boundaries of Harbor Houses Unit No. 18, without obtaining the required amendment,” the Trust was in breach of the GIS SAR. Similarly, in Count Three of their complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that “[b]y expanding Harbor Houses Unit No. 18 onto limited common elements and by changing the boundaries of Harbor Houses Unit No. 18 without obtaining the required amendment,” the Trust violated the restrictive covenants that “run with the land.” The complaint requests relief based on those two counts as', '- 12 - well as a count alleging common law trespass; specifically, it requests an injunction prohibiting the construction of the proposed expansion on Unit 18 and an injunction requiring the removal of “any and all construction or improvements that encroach upon limited common elements and/or change the boundaries of Harbor Houses No. 18 * * *.”', 'Thus, in plaintiffs’ complaint, the same relief is sought based on the same set of facts in both Counts Two and Three. The trial justice, having found that there was a breach of contract in this case and a common law trespass, awarded what she considered to be the appropriate damages based on the relief sought in the complaint. Once she made a decision on the breach of contract claim and awarded the appropriate damages, we can perceive no error in the trial justice’s declining to contend with the restrictive covenants claim since it was not necessary for her to do so. See generally Grady v. Narragansett Electric Co., 962 A.2d 34, 42 n.4 (R.I. 2009) (stating that it is this Court’s “usual policy of not opining with respect to issues about which [it] need not opine”).', '4. The Plaintiffs’ Appeal: Attorneys’ Fees and Costs', 'The plaintiffs aver that the trial justice committed an error of law when she failed to award them attorneys’ fees and costs.', 'The Trust counters by claiming that, because the expansion provisions in § 2.3 of the GIS SAR were found to be unenforceable, breach of those sections may not form the basis of an award of attorneys’ fees and costs under the GIS SAR.', 'We have repeatedly stated that, in conducting a review of a trial justice’s award of attorneys’ fees, “[t]he issue of whether there exists a basis for awarding attorneys’ fees generally is legal in nature, and therefore our review of such a ruling is de novo.” Dauray v. Mee, 109 A.3d 832, 845 (R.I. 2015) (emphasis in original) (quoting Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island v. Najarian, 911 A.2d 706, 709 (R.I. 2006)); see also Danforth v. More, 129 A.3d 63, 72', '- 13 - (R.I. 2016). Accordingly, we have further stated that “[o]nly if it is determined that there is such a [legal] basis, then this Court will review a motion justice’s actual award of attorneys’ fees for an abuse of discretion.” Dauray, 109 A.3d at 845 (quoting Najarian, 911 A.2d at 709); see also Danforth, 129 A.3d at 72.', 'This Court has long adhered to the “American rule” that “requires each litigant to pay its own attorney’s fees absent statutory authority or contractual liability.” Moore v. Ballard, 914 A.2d 487, 489 (R.I. 2007); see Najarian, 911 A.2d at 710; see also Insurance Company of North America v. Kayser-Roth Corp., 770 A.2d 403, 419 (R.I. 2001). Consequently, we begin our analysis by looking to the relevant provision in the GIS SAR to determine whether there is a basis for plaintiffs’ claim for attorneys’ fees and costs. Section 11.3 states in pertinent part as follows:', '“Violation of any of the terms of the [GIS SAR] * * * shall', 'be grounds for relief which will include, but not be limited to, any', 'actions for money damages, injunctive relief, foreclosure of the', 'lien pursuant to the Act, or any combination thereof, each such', 'remedy to be cumulative and not exclusive. Any such violator shall', 'be liable for all court costs and attorney’s fees incurred in', 'enforcing the rights pursuant to the preceding sentence and failure', 'or forbearance by any person in addressing any violation thereof', 'shall not be deemed a waiver of such violation or the right to do so', 'at a later time.” (Emphasis added.) On the basis of our reading of § 11.3 and our review of the entirety of the GIS SAR, we have come to the ineluctable conclusion that § 11.3 does provide a basis for an award of attorneys’ fees and costs in the instant case where plaintiffs were enforcing rights provided for in the GIS SAR. In our opinion, the language of § 11.3 is susceptible to only one meaning, and we must apply that plain and ordinary meaning. See Rivera, 847 A.2d at 284; see also Bliss Mine Road Condominium Association, 11 A.3d at 1083. The present action seeking injunctive relief was brought by plaintiffs to enforce their rights pursuant to § 11.1(b) (which incorporates by', '- 14 - reference § 34-36.1-2.17(d) of the Act), in addition to § 2.3. Due to the fact that the rights being enforced are provided for in the GIS SAR, § 11.3 is controlling in this case.', 'We are not convinced by the Trust’s argument that attorneys’ fees and costs should not be awarded in the instant case because the expansion provisions in § 2.3 of the GIS SAR were found to be unenforceable by the trial justice and that, therefore, any violation of those provisions cannot be the basis for an award of attorneys’ fees. 3 We have already concluded that, regardless of whether or not the Trust breached § 2.3 of the GIS SAR, it did breach § 11.1(b), which can also be a basis for the award of attorneys’ fees and costs. Consequently, the clear terms of § 11.3 provide a basis for an award of attorneys’ fees and costs to plaintiffs in this case.', 'Having determined that a valid basis for an award of attorneys’ fees and costs exists, we now review the actual award under an abuse of discretion framework. See Dauray, 109 A.3d at 845. While a trial justice enjoys considerable discretion in determining the value of an award of attorneys’ fees, such discretion is not unbridled and does not allow for a direct contravention of a mandatory award of fees contained in the GIS SAR. Here, the word “shall” in § 11.3 of the GIS SAR dictates that an award of attorneys’ fees and costs is mandatory following a breach of the agreement. Indeed, if we were to allow the trial justice to award no fees, the mandatory award of fees in the GIS SAR would completely lack force. See Rodrigues v. DePasquale Building and Realty Co., 926 A.2d 616, 624 (R.I. 2007) (stating that “[u]nder established contract law principles, when there is an unambiguous contract and no proof of duress or the like [(i.e., proof 3', 'The Trust makes several additional arguments to support its contention that attorneys’ fees and costs should not have been awarded in this case. It posits that § 11.3 allows for such fees and costs only if the action being brought is to enforce the terms of the GIS SAR, not the requirements of the Act, and it cites to a number of cases that it considers to be supportive of that argument. It also contends that it did not breach the GIS SAR. However, we have already concluded that the Trust breached the GIS SAR; and, therefore, the present action was brought to enforce the terms of the GIS SAR, not merely the terms of the Act. Consequently, the terms of § 11.3 are applicable to the instant case.', '- 15 - that the contract involved was a contract of adhesion)], the terms of the contract are to be applied as written”) (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'Given our conclusion that a valid basis for an award of attorneys’ fees exists, and that an award of no fees in this context would constitute an abuse of the trial justice’s discretion, we remand for the trial justice’s valuation of the attorneys’ fees and costs to be awarded.', 'Accordingly, we hold that the trial justice did not err in determining that the Trust had breached the GIS SAR or in declining to opine on the restrictive covenants count in plaintiffs’ complaint.', 'However, we do find error with respect to the trial justice’s failure to award attorneys’ fees and costs to plaintiffs based on the terms of the GIS SAR.', 'B', 'Trespass', '1.

The Trust’s Cross-Appeal: Common Law Trespass', 'The Trust contends that the trial justice erred as a matter of law in finding that the expansion of Unit 18 constituted a common law trespass because the “area over which the expansion was made is property that the Trust owns [as a tenant in common] and had the exclusive right to use” and “the Trust had the consent of GIS and Harbor Houses.”', 'The trial justice stated that the following finding of hers was dispositive of plaintiffs’ trespass claim: “Expansion of a unit onto a common area causes ‘a de facto alteration of the percentage of the undivided interest which each owner has in the common areas * * *.’” (quoting Strauss v. Oyster River Condominium Trust, No. 114843, 1992 WL 12153337, at *23 (Mass. Land Ct. Oct. 27, 1992)). We have conducted a detailed review of the parties’ arguments and the authority cited in support of those arguments.

They further point out that the trial justice did not cite to any exceptional circumstances when reaching her decision. Moreover, they contend that the Trust had notice and a warning that its expansion violated the Act in the form of the then-existing Superior Court judgments (which we eventually reviewed in Sisto, 68 A.3d at 603), and the email to Mr. Sisto from Ms. Volpe; therefore, according to plaintiffs, no exceptional', '- 17 - circumstances or balancing of the equities should be considered in the instant case.

Morelli, 102 R.I. 333, 338, 230 A.2d 860, 863 (1967)), referenced our “general rule” that “[a] continuing trespass wrongfully interferes with the legal rights of the owner, and in the usual case those rights cannot be adequately protected except by an injunction which will eliminate the trespass.” Indeed, in our opinion in Santilli, we stated that:', '“[T]he owner of land is entitled to a mandatory injunction to', 'require the removal of a structure that has been unlawfully placed', 'upon his land, and the fact that such owner has suffered little or no', 'damage because of the offending structure, or that it was erected in', 'good faith, or that the cost of its removal would be greatly', 'disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the plaintiff from its', 'removal, is not a bar to the granting of [injunctive] relief.', 'However, the existence of such circumstances may in exceptional', 'cases move the court to withhold the [injunctive] relief', 'contemplated by the general rule.” Santilli, 102 R.I. at 338, 230', 'A.2d at 863; see Renaissance Development Corp. v. Universal', 'Properties Group, Inc., 821 A.2d 233, 238 (R.I. 2003). Such exceptional circumstances would exist “where the substantial rights of the landowner may be properly safeguarded without recourse to an injunction which in such cases would operate oppressively and inequitably.” Santilli, 102 R.I. at 338, 230 A.2d at 863 (internal quotation marks omitted); see Adams v. Toro, 508 A.2d 399, 401 n.1 (R.I. 1986). A court may “withhold injunctive relief after balancing the equities or, put another way, considering the relative hardships to the parties.” Rose Nulman Park Foundation ex rel. Nulman, 93 A.3d at 30. More specifically, we have held that exceptional circumstances “include, but are not limited to, acquiescence, laches, or a de minimis trespass.” Id. at 29.', 'That being said, this Court has maintained that “where the encroachment was intentional, in that [the] defendant proceeded despite notice or warning, or where he [or she] failed to take', '- 18 - proper precautions to ascertain the boundary” we will not “balance the equities” or consider the “relative convenience or hardship [to each party] involved.” Renaissance Development Corp., 821 A.2d at 238 (internal quotation marks omitted). It is important to reiterate, as well, that “this Court has emphasized [the fact that] ‘[t]he issuance and measure of injunctive relief rest in the sound discretion of the trial justice.’” Rose Nulman Park Foundation ex rel. Nulman, 93 A.3d at 30 (quoting Cullen, 15 A.3d at 981). It is with that standard of review in mind that we turn to plaintiffs’ contentions on appeal.', 'We begin by acknowledging that Mr. Sisto received an email from Ms. Volpe requesting that he not take any further action on the expansion of Unit 18 due to the decisions of the Superior Court, which were then pending on appeal in this Court and would eventually be reviewed in our opinion in Sisto, 68 A.3d at 603. However, although it is a very close question, in our view the notice provided by Ms. Volpe’s email is not of such moment as to cause us to conclude that a balancing of the equities by the trial justice would have been an abuse of discretion.4 See Renaissance Development Corp., 821 A.2d at 238. Ms. Volpe’s email, as Mr. Sisto pointed out in his testimony, merely reflected her own opinion; it did not result from a vote of the GIS Board. Moreover, the Superior Court decisions at issue were still pending on appeal to this Court; so, the issue of whether or not unanimous approval of the other condominium owners was required for expansion had not been definitively decided by this Court at the time of Ms. Volpe’s email. Indeed, our opinion in Sisto, 68 A.3d at 603, was not issued until after the 4', 'We note that the trial justice did not make a specific finding with respect to whether or not there were exceptional circumstances in this case which warranted her failure to issue a mandatory injunction requiring the removal of the expanded portion of Unit 18. She simply stated her conclusion that she would not be issuing such an injunction. However, we “may exercise [our] prerogative to affirm a determination of a trial justice on grounds different from those enunciated in his or her decision.” Lerner v. Ursillo, 765 A.2d 1212, 1216 (R.I. 2001); see also Ogden v. Rath, 755 A.2d 795, 798 (R.I. 2000) (per curiam).', '- 19 - trial justice issued her decision in this case (but before a final judgment reflecting that decision was entered). Accordingly, Mr. Sisto, and through him the Trust, had no completely certain knowledge, at the time Unit 18 was being expanded, that they had to do any more than comply with the terms of the GIS SAR as they purportedly understood them at that time. Contrary to plaintiffs’ contention, it is our opinion that a balancing of equities is appropriate in this case and that this case presents the kind of exceptional and virtually unique circumstances that can justify deviation, in the exercise of sound discretion, from our general rule regarding the remedy for a continuing trespass. See Rose Nulman Park Foundation ex rel. Nulman, 93 A.3d at 30; Santilli, 102 R.I. at 338, 230 A.2d at 863.', 'In addition to the just-referenced facts, of great importance is the further fact that, when the Trust purchased Unit 18, that Unit already had a foundation for expansion, which foundation had been installed by the previous owners. Moreover, the Superior Court had specifically ordered that those owners be permitted to proceed with their construction, and the GIS Board had blessed the expansion by stating that no resident objected to it and that there were no issues as to the expansion affecting the water views of any of the residences. In fact, Mr. Sisto testified that the Trust’s expansion of Unit 18 was based on the plans commissioned by the previous owners; in addition, the Trust’s expansion was smaller than the expansion intended by the previous owners. Furthermore, other Harbor Houses units have been expanded in the past. It is therefore understandable that the Trust, upon purchasing Unit 18, reasonably believed that it was able to expand on the existing foundation that had been installed by the previous owners; it acted in good faith.', 'Ordering the removal of the now-completed expansion of Unit 18 would be enormously oppressive, both logistically and financially. By contrast, allowing the expansion to remain in place is of little to no consequence to plaintiffs. The expansion is on land designated', '- 20 - for the exclusive use of Unit 18, and there is no allegation that the expansion is affecting the water views of any resident or is otherwise a material inconvenience for the other residents. Additionally, plaintiffs had initially sought a preliminary injunction in this case to prevent the expansion, but they failed to litigate vigorously in pursuit of such an injunction; rather, they allowed their motion for a preliminary injunction to be advanced to a trial on the merits. The result was that no decision was issued by the Superior Court until over a year after the complaint was filed, during which time construction on the expansion of Unit 18 was ongoing.', 'For all of the above-stated reasons, we are convinced that it would be oppressive and inequitable to require the removal of the expanded portion of Unit 18 in the instant case. See Santilli, 102 R.I. at 338, 230 A.2d at 863. Accordingly, it is our conclusion that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion in issuing an injunction preventing any further expansion of Unit 18 while not issuing an injunction requiring the removal of the expanded portion of Unit 18.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'In conclusion, on the plaintiffs’ appeal we hold that: (1) the trial justice did not abuse her discretion in failing to issue a mandatory injunction requiring the removal of the expansion of Unit 18; (2) the trial justice did not err in failing to rule on Count Three of the plaintiffs’ complaint; and (3) the trial justice did err in failing to award attorneys’ fees and costs to the plaintiffs based on the terms of the GIS SAR. With regard to the Trust’s cross-appeal, it is our holding that: (1) there was no error committed by the trial justice in determining that the Trust breached the GIS SAR; and (2) the trial justice also did not err in determining that the Trust had committed a trespass.', '- 21 -', 'Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court in part, and we vacate that judgment in part. We remand the record to that tribunal for proceedings consistent with this opinion.', 'Justice Flaherty, concurring. I concur completely with the well written and articulate opinion of the majority in this case but take the liberty to focus on one issue in the appeal, the decision of the trial justice to decline to award counsel fees.', 'It is my opinion that a trial justice has no authority to disregard the clear and unambiguous language used by the parties to an agreement and refuse to award counsel fees when the parties themselves have assented that they will be awarded in the event of a breach. In my view, this fits squarely with the American rule.5', 'There is substantial law throughout the United States that supports this position. See, e.g., McDowell Mountain Ranch Community Association, Inc. v. Simons, 165 P.3d 667, 670 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2007) (“the court lacks discretion to refuse to award fees under [a] contractual provision”); Lashkajani v. Lashkajani, 911 So.2d 1154, 1158 (Fla. 2005) (“Provisions in ordinary contracts awarding attorney’s fees and costs to the prevailing party are generally enforced. * * * Trial courts do not have the discretion to decline to enforce such provisions, even if the challenging party brings a meritorious claim in good faith.”); Yim K. Cheung v. Wing Ki Wu, 919 A.2d 619, 624-25 (Me. 2007) (“As a general rule, courts must enforce contract provisions that require the payment of attorney fees, so long as they are reasonable.”); DiMarzio 5', 'In his dissent, the Chief Justice reasons that Sophie F. Bronowiski Mulligan Irrevocable Trust v. Bridges, 44 A.3d 116 (R.I. 2012), supports a conclusion that counsel fees are within the discretion of the trial justice. I respectfully disagree; the reason for the remand in that case was because “the clear language of the lease agreement provided contractual authorization for the award of attorneys’ fees, and that the trial justice abused her discretion in failing to do so.” Id. at 122.', '- 22 - v. Crazy Mountain Construction, Inc., 243 P.3d 718, 724 (Mont. 2010) (“While [the defendant] is correct that the district court is bound by the contract between [the defendant] and [the plaintiff] which entitles the prevailing party to attorney’s fees, * * * that does not mean [the defendant] is entitled to all attorney’s fees.

Mugford, 642 A.2d 688, 695-96 (Vt. 1994) (“We have authorized the trial court to consider a wide range of factors in making this determination * * * and accorded it ‘a large measure of discretion’ in determining reasonableness. * * * We do not believe, however, the court’s discretion is broad enough to allow it to deny any recovery of attorney’s fees when plaintiffs prevail. * * * Failure to award at least some fees would deny [the] plaintiffs the benefit of the contract freely entered into by the Mugfords.”).', 'Because the parties have a right to the benefit of their bargain, I concur with the majority’s opinion that the trial justice’s discretion did not permit her to decline to award counsel fees in any amount.', 'Chief Justice Suttell, concurring in part and dissenting in part, with whom Justice Goldberg joins. I concur with the majority opinion in all respects except for its discussion of attorneys’ fees and costs in subpart III, A.4.', 'Although I agree with the majority that a contractual basis exists for such an award in this case, I do not believe it to be mandatory; rather it is a matter that is reserved to the sound discretion of the trial justice.', 'Clearly § 11.3 of the Goat Island South Condominium Second Amended and Restated Declaration of Condominiums (GIS SAR) supplies the contractual predicate for an award of attorneys’ fees. Except in those rare situations where the Legislature has provided that “the court', '- 23 - shall award * * * reasonable attorney[s’] fees,” see, e.g., Alves v. Hometown Newspapers, Inc., 857 A.2d 743, 757 (R.I. 2004) (quoting G.L. 1956 § 9-33-2(d)), our jurisprudence has entrusted the determination of whether to award attorneys’ fees in appropriate cases to the sound discretion of a trial justice. Women’s Development Corp. v. City of Central Falls, 764 A.2d 151, 162 (R.I. 2001) (“Given a proper contractual, statutory, or other legal basis to do so, the award of attorney[s’] fees rests within the sound discretion of the trial justice.”). Our opinion in Sophie F. Bronowski Mulligan Irrevocable Trust v. Bridges, 44 A.3d 116 (R.I. 2012), is illustrative. In that case, we held that the trial justice abused her discretion by failing to award attorneys’ fees where the clear language of a lease agreement provided that the tenant would pay reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs should a court render a judgment in the landlord’s favor in a legal action to recover for damages to the property. Id. at 122. We remanded the case to the Superior Court in part for a hearing on the issue of the attorneys’ fees incurred by the landlord in its effort to recover damages from the tenant for the repairs required to the property. Id. Nevertheless, we maintained our adherence “to the ‘American rule’ that litigants are generally responsible for their own attorneys’ fees and costs,” but that “attorneys’ fees may be appropriately awarded, at the discretion of the trial justice, given proper contractual or statutory authorization.” Id. (quoting Napier v. Epoch Corp., 971 A.2d 594, 598 n.4 (R.I. 2009) (emphasis added)). This Court has recently reaffirmed that our review of a trial justice’s decision regarding attorneys’ fees has two distinct prongs: “If it is determined that there is an adequate legal basis for such an award [which requires a de novo determination], then we review a trial justice’s decision awarding or denying attorneys’ fees for an abuse of discretion.” Danforth v. More, 129 A.3d 63, 72 (R.I. 2016). In my opinion, our case law dictates that, when a contractual basis for the award of attorneys’ fees', '- 24 - exists, the question of whether or not to award any amount of attorneys’ fees in light of the facts and circumstances of an individual case remains squarely within the discretion of a trial justice.', 'The case under review illuminates the wisdom of this policy. All the reasons articulated by the trial justice to support her decision to deny plaintiffs’ requested relief that defendants be ordered “to remove any and all construction that extends Unit No. 18 beyond its pre-expansion footprint” also support her decision to deny plaintiffs an award of attorneys’ fees and court costs. The trial justice referenced the testimony of Bennie Sisto, “an additional trustee” of defendant Constellation Trust, who acknowledged that he had expanded the unit by constructing walls on an existing foundation. At the time, the GIS SAR provided that alterations to any building of the Harbor Houses Condominium Association, Inc. (Harbor Houses) required the prior approval of only the Harbor Houses executive board, not all 154 unit owners of Goat Island South. GIS SAR § 2.3(a)(i). Moreover, the Harbor Houses declaration in effect at the time permitted “a unit owner to expand the footprint of his or her unit onto his or her yard, so long as that expansion [did] not encroach onto the yard of the neighboring unit.” Sisto v. America Condominium Association, Inc., 68 A.3d 603, 612-13 (R.I. 2013).6 The trial justice referred to Mr. Sisto’s “sincerely held beliefs of good faith compliance with the Condominium Act and the [GIS SAR].”', 'In addition, the trial justice found that defendant’s expansion project had been endorsed by Harbor Houses, and that it did not result in any view obstruction for any other unit owner at Goat Island South. Further, she noted that nine other units at Harbor Houses had been expanded 6', 'It was not until June 26, 2013, nearly one year after the trial justice’s decision, that this Court issued its opinion declaring that G.L. 1956 § 34-36.1-2.17(d) required the unanimous approval of all unit owners of Goat Island South for the expansion of defendant’s unit, not just the Harbor Houses executive board. Sisto v. America Condominium Association, Inc., 68 A.3d 603, 614 (R.I. 2013).', '- 25 - without objection. As the majority points out, it is “understandable that the [Constellation] Trust, upon purchasing Unit 18, reasonably believed that it was able to expand on the existing foundation that had been installed by the previous owners; it acted in good faith.”', 'Under the “exceptional and virtually unique circumstances” of this case, I believe that the trial justice’s decision to deny attorneys’ fees is fully sustainable. I acknowledge that the trial justice did not specify whether she denied an award because she did not believe it was warranted or because she did not believe that she had the authority to make an award. In her decision she said that the court “declines to award the [p]laintiff’s court costs and attorney[s’] fees.” Her use of the verb “declines” certainly suggests that she recognized that there was a basis for awarding fees and costs, but that she was nevertheless refusing to award them.', 'In any event, this case will now be remanded for a determination of attorneys’ fees and costs. The majority leaves unanswered, however, the question of whether the trial justice must award the plaintiffs the full amount of their reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs or whether a lesser amount might suffice. Because I believe that any award of attorneys’ fees and costs in this case is properly entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial justice, I respectfully dissent from that portion of the majority opinion.', 'Justice Goldberg, concurring in part and dissenting in part. I respectfully dissent from that portion of the majority’s decision that reverses the denial of the plaintiffs’ request for an award of attorneys’ fees. I begin by noting the fact that there are now four justices writing on this one case, which in itself is a statement about the merits of this case. Although I join the Chief Justice’s well-written opinion, in which he concurs in part and dissents in part, I nonetheless write separately. First, I agree with the Chief Justice that the discretion to award', '- 26 - attorneys’ fees should remain with our experienced and well-respected trial justices. Second, in the absence of briefing and argument, I am not convinced that parties to a contract may saddle the Superior Court with mandatory jurisdiction dictating the award of attorneys’ fees. Cf. Sidell v. Sidell, 18 A.3d 499, 508 (R.I. 2011) (holding that parties cannot confer subject matter jurisdiction on a court when jurisdiction is otherwise lacking). Furthermore and critically, G.L. 1956 § 9-1-45 provides for an award of attorneys’ fees in contract actions7 and thus can be read as in derogation of the common law American rule. Under our jurisprudence, the award of attorneys’ fees in contract actions rests within the discretion of the trial justice, and, in passing on a request for an award of attorneys’ fees, this Court has heretofore deferred to that discretion.', 'Next, I note that this Court has ignored its own observation about the “exceptional and virtually unique circumstances” of this case and contradicted its own rationale for affirming other aspects of the trial justice’s decision. Section 11.3 of the Goat Island South Condominium Second Amended and Restated Declaration of Condominium (GIS SAR)—the governing document for this toxic, litigious community that by now has become an all-too-familiar appellation in the courts—provides, in relevant part, that:', '“Violation of any of the terms of the [GIS SAR] * * * shall', 'be grounds for relief which will include, but not be limited to, any', 'actions for * * * injunctive relief * * *. Any such violator shall be', 'liable for all court costs and attorney[s’] fees incurred in enforcing 7', 'General Laws 1956 § 9-1-45 provides, in its entirety:', '“The court may award a reasonable attorney[s’] fee to the prevailing party', 'in any civil action arising from a breach of contract in which the court:', '“(1) Finds that there was a complete absence of a justiciable issue of', 'either law or fact raised by the losing party; or', '“(2) Renders a default judgment against the losing party.” (Emphases', 'added.)', '- 27 -', 'the rights pursuant to the preceding sentence * * *.” (Emphasis', 'added.) Of critical importance, defendant commenced construction of the challenged addition at a time when the law was not yet settled as to whether the approval from the owners of all 154 units was required—or, in other words, whether proceeding in the absence of such approval constituted a violation of the GIS SAR.', 'Indeed, this Court issued its opinion in Sisto v. America Condominium Association, Inc., 68 A.3d 603, 617 (R.I. 2013) (Sisto I), in June 2013, more than two years after construction of the extension to Unit 18 commenced.', 'Moreover, before that opinion was issued, several guideposts suggesting that defendant was acting in conformity with the GIS SAR were in place. As the majority readily notes, the expansion of Unit 18’s original footprint was sanctioned by a Superior Court consent order, to which defendant’s predecessors-in-interest were parties. With respect to the 2011 expansion, the Goat Island South Executive Board issued an advisory opinion one month before construction began assuring that the plans submitted by defendant’s predecessors-in-interest were in accordance with § 2.3 of the GIS SAR. Uncontroverted testimony from Bennie Sisto indicated that defendant’s expansion of Unit 18 was based on the approved plans and that the actual extension was slightly smaller than that initially intended by defendant’s predecessors-in- interest. Significantly, nine other units in Harbor Houses Condominium had been permitted to expand in the same manner without objection from America Condominium Association. Further, plaintiffs allowed their request for preliminary injunctive relief to proceed to a drawn- out trial while construction on Unit 18 remained ongoing.', 'These factors are of vital significance because, at the time of the construction, the parties did not have the benefit of this Court’s interpretation of G.L. 1956 § 34-36.1-2.17(d), as set forth in Sisto I, 68 A.3d at 614. While the construction began in 2011, the basis of the determination', '- 28 - that defendant had violated the GIS SAR by not obtaining unanimous approval from the owners of the other 153 units did not ripen until 2013. Requiring the payment of attorneys’ fees under such circumstances leads to a patently unjust result.', 'The majority cites many of the above-referenced factors to support its conclusion that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion in declining to issue an injunction requiring the removal of the expanded section of Unit 18. I respectfully submit that overruling this seasoned and experienced trial justice on the issue of attorneys’ fees on the one hand and affirming her decision to deny injunctive relief on the other gives rise to an inconsistent and perplexing outcome that is neither required nor warranted.', 'For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent from the majority’s decision reversing the trial justice’s denial of the plaintiffs’ request for an award of attorneys’ fees and concur as to all other issues.', '- 29 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S', 'OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'America Condominium Association, Inc. et al. v.

10,Anthony Lipscomb : v. : State of Rhode Island. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The applicant, Anthony Lipscomb, appeals from the denial of his application for postconviction relief. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided.', 'After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'The applicant first initiated his postconviction-relief proceedings in 2009, when he filed an “omnibus pro-se motion.” The applicant’s motion was neither sworn nor verified as required by G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-3; therefore the Superior Court issued an order staying the postconviction- relief proceedings until applicant filed a complaint in the proper form. On July 20, 2012, applicant filed an amended application for postconviction relief—sworn and verified—asserting that his convictions in four separate drug-offense cases were the result of ineffective assistance', '-1- of counsel in violation of the state and federal constitutions because he had pled nolo contendere in each case rather than either pursuing a motion to suppress physical evidence or going to trial.', 'A justice of the Superior Court held a hearing on the postconviction-relief application in February 2013. The three attorneys who had represented applicant in the four cases at issue each testified. The applicant could not testify in person because he was incarcerated in a federal prison located out of state, but he had been deposed in January 2013 by telephone and this deposition testimony was admitted as an exhibit to the postconviction-relief proceedings. During the closing argument, applicant’s counsel withdrew one of the four cases included in his postconviction-relief application because, in applicant’s deposition testimony, he had discussed a series of facts that were not consistent with that case. The travel of the three remaining cases as well as the testimony from applicant and the attorney who represented him in each case are summarized below.', 'A', '2000 Conviction (Case No. P2/00-1178A)', 'On March 1, 2000, applicant was arrested after police responded to a call that a passenger in a white Mercury Sable with registration plate IU-72 had been seen holding a shotgun. Just a few days before, the police had received a report that a gun had been fired into a vehicle from a white Mercury Sable; the complainant had claimed that this vehicle belonged to applicant. When applicant was strip-searched at the police station after his arrest, a bag of marijuana and some small bags of cocaine fell from between his legs. The applicant was charged with one count of possession of cocaine and one count of possession of marijuana. On October 2, 2000, applicant pled nolo contendere to possession of cocaine and marijuana and was sentenced to two years, suspended, with probation.', '-2-', 'In his application for postconviction relief, applicant claimed that he had been denied his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel and alleged that he had pled nolo contendere without being advised that a motion to suppress the items seized from his person could have been viable had the issue been raised. At the hearing, attorney Scott Lutes, who represented applicant in this case, testified that his review of the postconviction-relief application “vaguely” refreshed his recollection regarding his representation of applicant, but that he “represent[ed] probably 200 people a year, [which was] a lot of cases to distinguish from.” Mr. Lutes, however, “recall[ed] [applicant] because [he] [had] represented him several times.” Mr. Lutes testified that he “always” considered potential grounds for alleging unconstitutional search and seizure and whether to file a motion to suppress, and that he would “go over a case with a client and discuss the legal issues, the pros and cons of pursuing this avenue or that avenue, and ultimately the client ma[de] the decision [about] what they want[ed] to do.” While Mr. Lutes did not specifically recall either this case or having had such a conversation with applicant, he did recall that “we had a conversation with the clerk’s office when he was charged, and I showed him it was only charged as a simple possession charge, and he was happy with that because he didn’t feel he had the same potential going to jail [sic] for that.” Mr. Lutes testified that his “vague recollection * * * was that [applicant’s] primary focus was on * * * wrapping everything up for a concurrent sentence and [applicant] was satisfied that it wasn’t a possession with intent charge * * * and didn’t want to pursue the issues and go[] to trial.” According to Mr. Lutes, he “never made a client plead to something. Even if they’re hesitant, [he would] continue it * * *, and [he] [did not] recall that being an issue in this case at all.”', 'During his deposition, applicant testified that, while he had not asked Mr. Lutes any questions about the legality of the search, “now that [he had] a little understanding in regards to', '-3- the law * * *,” he would have “definitely” proceeded with a motion to suppress if Mr. Lutes had told him that there were grounds for such a motion.', 'The applicant also testified that his communication with Mr. Lutes during the case occurred “during court proceedings” and that he had not “really sat down with him and discussed the case in length in its totality at all, * * * to * * * review [his] options.” The applicant also testified that he could not recall any specific conversations with Mr. Lutes regarding his case or whether Mr. Lutes spoke with him about the case, “but [he was] leaning more toward” Mr. Lutes not having spoken with him regarding the defense strategy.', 'B', '2002 Conviction (Case No. P2/01-1539A)', 'On April 13, 2001, applicant was pulled over for speeding on interstate 95. The applicant produced his driver’s license and a bill of sale for the car that was dated that day. According to the police narrative attached to the criminal information filed in this case, while the state trooper was checking applicant’s driver’s license, he recalled that he had stopped the same individual the week before in the same vehicle and that applicant had also handed him a bill of sale for that same vehicle that had reflected that day’s date. After the state trooper ran a license check, he discovered that applicant had been previously arrested on drug charges. The trooper asked applicant whether he had bought the vehicle that day; applicant replied in the affirmative. The trooper also asked whether applicant had ever been arrested, and applicant answered in the negative. The applicant exited the vehicle upon request; after additional questioning, the state trooper searched him. The state trooper found marijuana in the pocket of applicant’s underwear.', 'In May 2001, applicant was charged with possession of marijuana, subsequent offense. On April 23, 2002, applicant pled nolo contendere to that charge and was referred to the drug', '-4- court treatment program. The applicant did not successfully complete the drug court treatment program, and was ultimately sentenced on January 29, 2003, to two years incarceration, with four months to serve and twenty months suspended, with probation.', 'In his postconviction-relief application, applicant claimed that, if his attorney, Matthew Smith, had advised him that he could have filed a motion to suppress the evidence seized from him during the traffic stop, he would not have pled nolo contendere. At the hearing, Mr. Smith testified that he did not have an independent memory of applicant’s case, but that reading the police report in the case had refreshed his recollection of the facts. Mr. Smith had entered his appearance for applicant on three separate cases at the same time: two probation violations and the new drug charge. Mr. Smith stated that he discussed proposed resolutions of applicant’s cases with either the drug court personnel or a representative from the Attorney General’s office and that these discussions factored into his strategy in representing applicant. The applicant faced the possibility of serving up to two years on each probation violation as well as on the new charge, but Mr. Smith secured applicant’s participation in the then-fledgling drug court treatment program. Mr. Smith testified that he believed that the drug court program was the best option for applicant because it could help him with his addiction as well as serve as a mechanism to potentially have both the new case dismissed and the probation violation petitions withdrawn by the Attorney General’s office. Mr. Smith also testified that it was his standard practice to discuss any legal issues he identified when he read a police report as well as “issues such as a motion to suppress a statement or suppress a search and seizure with [his] client.” Mr. Smith was “certain * * * that [he] would have discussed the * * * issue and other issues of all aspects of that case with [applicant].”', '-5-', 'In his deposition testimony, applicant stated that Mr. Smith had not told him that a motion to suppress might have kept the drugs seized during the traffic stop out of evidence. The applicant also asserted that he would have proceeded with the motion to suppress had it been brought to his attention but also that he could not recall whether he had told Mr. Smith at the time that he thought something was wrong with the search. According to applicant, he “could have” mentioned it “because it did seem like there was something wrong with it; but * * * looking at the * * * intrusions of just being pulled over, searched * * * [he] [thought] [he] was pretty much focused on that more as a profiling type of thing * * *.”', 'C', '2003 Conviction (Case No. P2/02-2748B)', 'According to a police narrative attached to the criminal information in this case, an arrest warrant was sought for applicant in September 2002 after an investigation into narcotics trafficking at two apartments yielded evidence to support drug charges against him.', 'The applicant was charged with conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to deliver (count 2), possession of marijuana with intent to deliver (count 3), and possession of cocaine with intent to deliver (count 4). On October 20, 2003, the state dismissed counts 3 and 4 pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure in exchange for applicant’s nolo contendere plea on count 2, which had been amended to simple possession of marijuana. On the Rule 48(a) dismissal stipulation, the state noted that it was unable to disclose the identity of the confidential informant involved in the case and that the scope of the search warrant obtained had been exceeded during its execution; the marijuana and scale seized had been found in an area that was not within the scope of the search warrant. The applicant was sentenced to a one-year', '-6- term of supervised probation, to run concurrently with the term of probation imposed after the April 23, 2002 plea.', 'In applicant’s postconviction-relief application, he claimed constitutionally deficient performance by his attorney, Richard Corley, in this case because the state would not disclose the identity of the confidential informant used to secure the search warrant that had been executed prior to applicant’s arrest, and applicant alleged that his attorney both knew that the state did not have any witnesses to connect him to the drugs seized and misled applicant to believe that the state did have such witnesses. At the hearing, Mr. Corley testified that he did not have an independent recollection of representing applicant, but that he had reviewed the case file and the information package prior to the hearing. Mr. Corley testified that he had attempted to discover the identity of the confidential informant involved in the case by filing a motion to compel the state’s disclosure of the informant’s identity. Mr. Corley also testified that, “after having reviewed the evidence, that the evidence tying [applicant] in to the charges for which he was facing was minimal, and [he] believe[d] in such a situation [his] comments with [applicant] would have been about the lack of evidence concerning inculpatory evidence against him.” Mr. Corley also testified that the disposition in the case was “the best disposition that [he] could have received, other than a not guilty verdict, based upon [applicant’s] previous record * * *.” Mr. Corley stated that he conveyed “all offers that [were] made from the prosecution, whether [he] [thought] they [were] in [his] client’s best interest or not to take them,” and that “[he] may have advised somebody that [he thought] it’s in their best interest to enter a plea rather than go to trial, but [he told] the client that it is always their choice.”', 'During his deposition, applicant testified that, many years after his conviction in this case, he had written to the Superior Court and requested copies of the documents in his case file.', '-7- Upon review of the documents that he received as a result of this request, applicant concluded that the state never had a confidential informant. The applicant testified that, at the time of his plea, he had believed that there was a confidential informant involved in the case, but after reviewing the court documents he thought that Mr. Corley had known there was not an informant involved and had not told him. Had applicant known, he asserts, he would have gone to trial. The applicant also testified, however, that Mr. Corley had discussed the facts of the case with him and had filed motions, including a motion to suppress, a motion to dismiss, and a motion for bail review. According to applicant, Mr. Corley “did go a little further than the previous * * * attorneys; and we just did what he suggested at the time.”', 'With respect to all three of his nolo contendere pleas, applicant testified that, based on the information he had at the time of the pleas, he knew what he was doing when he pled, “but, in accordance to what I’m telling you today, we know that I did not know what I was doing.”', 'D', 'Hearing Justice’s Decision', 'On June 20, 2013, the hearing justice issued a written decision denying applicant’s postconviction-relief application in its entirety. The hearing justice stated that, in order to prevail, applicant had to prove that attorneys Lutes and Smith had not advised him of the benefits of challenging the seizure of drugs from his person and, with respect to the third case, applicant had to prove that Mr. Corley had not informed applicant that the confidential informant had not existed or that he had misled him about the confidential informant’s existence. Ultimately, the hearing justice concluded that applicant had failed to prove that any of his attorneys’ performances were constitutionally deficient in any way because none of these experienced attorneys committed any “professional errors” in their representation of applicant. The hearing', '-8- justice also found the attorneys’ testimony credible, whereas applicant’s testimony was not credible. The hearing justice noted that applicant initially decided to file for postconviction relief on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel after he learned that the federal government had sought to enhance his term of federal incarceration based on the state court convictions, and the hearing justice factored this finding into his credibility analysis. 1', 'With respect to attorney Lutes’ representation, the hearing justice specifically noted that Mr. Lutes had testified that he had a habit of discussing the strength of cases with his clients and that applicant could not explain why he had not met with Mr. Lutes between court dates to discuss the case strategy despite the fact that he had been released on bail during the six months between his arraignment and his plea. The hearing justice also found that the facts summarized in the police narrative attached to the criminal information in this case supported a finding that applicant had been lawfully arrested and that “an experienced attorney * * * could objectively conclude a court would find the search to be a legal search incident to an arrest and deny a motion to suppress.”', 'With respect to attorney Smith’s representation, the hearing justice found that the main issue was whether Mr. Smith had discussed the viability of a motion to suppress with applicant. The hearing justice noted that Mr. Smith was “certain” that he had discussed the issue with 1', 'In October 2005, applicant was found guilty in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island of possession of at least five grams of cocaine with intent to distribute, “possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime,” and possession of a firearm as a felon. United States v. Lipscomb, 539 F.3d 32, 35 (1st Cir. 2008). The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed his conviction in August 2008. Id. at 43. The applicant is currently serving fifteen years in a federal prison; this sentence reflects two ten-year concurrent sentences on the first and third counts, and a five-year sentence on the second count, to run consecutively to the sentences imposed for the first and third counts. According to applicant, the ten-year sentence on the first count was determined in part by considering his criminal history in the state court.', '-9- applicant and that he found Mr. Smith’s testimony to be credible, whereas applicant testified incredibly that Mr. Smith had not discussed at all the possibility of filing a motion to suppress.', 'With respect to attorney Corley’s representation, the hearing justice noted that applicant had three prior possession-of-marijuana convictions at the time he was charged in this case, and “that this matter was resolved by amendment to simple possession of marijuana in and of itself should qualify as a minor miracle and does bear favorably on the effectiveness of [Mr. Corley] * * *.” With respect to applicant’s allegation that Mr. Corley had misled him regarding the existence of the state’s informant, the hearing justice concluded that the allegation did not have merit because applicant had not pointed to a specific misrepresentation by Mr. Corley. The hearing justice concluded that the only basis for applicant’s supposition that the informant had not existed was that the Rule 48(a) dismissal stipulation noted “unable to disclose CI” and that this inability to disclose the informant’s identity was not the same as the state admitting that the informant had not existed.', 'The hearing justice also briefly discussed whether applicant had established that he was prejudiced by his attorneys’ alleged deficient performances, concluding that “[e]ven if the court accepted all of [applicant’s] testimony [that he would have proceeded to trial if he had known what he claimed his attorneys did not tell him] as totally credible, this testimony standing alone d[id] not demonstrate a reasonable probability that his motion(s) to suppress would have been successful.” The hearing justice entered final judgment on July 11, 2013, from which applicant is now appealing. 2 2', 'Because the final judgment denying applicant’s postconviction-relief application entered in 2013, applicant’s appeal from this judgment is properly before us on direct appeal. The 2015 amendment to G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-9, requiring an aggrieved party to seek review by filing a petition for writ of certiorari with this Court, became effective on June 19, 2015—long after applicant filed his notice of appeal.

With respect to Mr. Lutes, applicant contends that the hearing justice overlooked and misconceived “critical evidence” because he asserts that Mr. Lutes provided “inconsistent', '- 11 - testimony” about whether he had discussed the possibility of a motion to suppress with applicant; Mr. Lutes first testified that he could not recall and then testified to a “vague recollection” that applicant had not wanted to pursue a motion to suppress. With respect to Mr. Smith, applicant contends that the hearing justice erred by concluding that applicant’s testimony corroborated Mr. Smith’s testimony that they had discussed a motion to suppress because applicant clearly alleged in his postconviction-relief application that he had not been made aware that a motion to suppress could have been filed. Instead, applicant asserts that Mr. Smith’s testimony was inconsistent in the same way as Mr. Lutes’ testimony; Mr. Smith initially testified to a lack of memory about applicant’s case and then testified that there had been a discussion regarding a motion to suppress. With respect to Mr. Corley, applicant contends that the hearing justice erred by interpreting the language on the Rule 48(a) dismissal stipulation that the state was “unable to disclose” the confidential informant’s identity as not meaning that the state conceded that the informant had not existed. The applicant contends that he pled nolo contendere without knowing that the informant ostensibly involved in the case would not be testifying against him because Mr. Corley had not advised him about this information on the Rule 48(a) dismissal stipulation. The applicant also suggests that this case should be remanded to provide him with the opportunity to present additional evidence regarding the prejudice he experienced as a result of his attorneys’ deficient performances.', 'The state argues that this Court should affirm the denial of applicant’s postconviction- relief claims because applicant has not demonstrated that the hearing justice erred in finding the three attorneys credible and applicant’s testimony not credible. The state contends that the hearing justice neither overlooked nor misconceived any of the testimony at the hearing. Without credible evidence to support applicant’s claims that attorneys Lutes and Smith had not', '- 12 - discussed the possibility of a motion to suppress with him and that attorney Corley had not informed him that the confidential informant was not available or had not existed, the state contends that applicant failed to establish that his attorneys’ representations were constitutionally deficient.', 'Rhode Island’s postconviction remedy is set forth in G.L. 1956 chapter 9.1 of title 10. Because “[a]ll rules and statutes applicable in civil proceedings” apply to postconviction-relief proceedings, § 10-9.1-7, “[a]n applicant * * * for postconviction relief bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that such relief is warranted.” Jolly, 59 A.3d at 138 (quoting Anderson, 45 A.3d at 601). “In evaluating an application for postconviction relief based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, ‘[t]his Court adheres to the standard set forth by the United States Supreme Court in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984).’” Bell, 71 A.3d at 460 (quoting Chapdelaine, 32 A.3d at 941). We have previously noted that “applicants seeking postconviction relief due to ineffective assistance of counsel are ‘saddled with a heavy burden, in that there exists a strong presumption [recognized by this Court] that an attorney’s performance falls within the range of reasonable professional assistance and sound strategy * * *.’” Id. at 461 (quoting Rice v. State, 38 A.3d 9, 17 (R.I. 2012)).', 'To prevail on a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, “the [applicant] must satisfy the two prongs of the Strickland test: ‘[f]irst, the applicant must demonstrate that counsel’s performance was deficient, to the point that the errors were so serious that trial counsel did not function at the level guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.’” Bell, 71 A.3d at 460 (quoting Chapdelaine, 32 A.3d at 941). “This prong can be satisfied only by a showing that counsel’s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.” Id.

(quoting Chapdelaine, 32 A.3d at 941-42).', 'After carefully reviewing the record, we agree with the hearing justice that applicant received effective assistance of counsel from all three attorneys. Each attorney testified that his standard practice was to consider any suppression issues whenever he represented a criminal defendant. Each attorney also testified that he did not have an independent recollection of applicant’s case, but that a review of the criminal information package for the pertinent case had jogged some details in his memory. For example, Mr. Lutes recalled applicant’s expression of relief upon learning that he had not been charged with a more serious crime and that applicant had seemed focused on securing concurrent sentences for the two charges. Mr. Smith recalled that the drug court treatment program had the potential to yield the best outcome for applicant because applicant would benefit from the substance-abuse treatment and, if applicant had successfully completed the program, then his two pending probation violation proceedings would have been withdrawn and the current drug charge would have been dismissed. Mr. Corley recalled that, given applicant’s record at the time that he represented him, the nolo contendere plea to the amended charge of simple possession of marijuana was a favorable disposition', '- 14 - considering the conspiracy count and possession-with-intent-to-deliver counts that had been initially charged.', 'For his part, applicant testified that attorneys Lutes and Smith had not discussed with him the possibility of a motion to suppress, but he also said that he could not recall the specific conversations that he had had with these attorneys prior to his nolo contendere pleas. With respect to attorney Lutes, applicant testified that, in hindsight, he would have pursued a motion to suppress if he had been advised that it was possible to challenge the search that yielded the bags of marijuana and cocaine and that, although he could not recall any specific conversation, he was “leaning more toward” not having had any conversations with Mr. Lutes regarding the defense strategy in the case. With respect to attorney Smith, applicant stated that, when the case was pending, he had not considered any potential problems with the search because he believed that his traffic stop was the result of profiling. With respect to attorney Corley, applicant asserted that his postconviction review of the case file revealed that Mr. Corley had known that a confidential informant never existed and misled him about the informant’s existence, but applicant did not provide a specific basis for these allegations or any evidence to support these allegations.', 'Confronted with contradicting versions of each attorney’s actions and discussions—or lack thereof—with applicant, the hearing justice determined that each attorney’s testimony was more credible than applicant’s testimony. After examining the testimony at the postconviction- relief hearings, we discern no basis for concluding that the hearing justice was clearly wrong in these credibility determinations. See Guerrero, 47 A.3d at 299; Rice, 38 A.3d at 17 n.11. In addition, it is our opinion that applicant failed to prove that any of the three attorneys committed any professional errors in their respective representations of applicant.', 'When, as here,', '- 15 - approximately ten years have passed since the attorneys represented applicant and the attorneys have represented numerous defendants since applicant’s respective cases, we cannot fault the attorneys’ limited independent recollections of their specific representation of applicant. The few details that each attorney recalled, their testimony regarding their standard practices, and the favorable dispositions that each attorney secured for applicant indicate that their representations fell well “within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases * * *.” See Rodrigues, 985 A.2d at 315 (quoting Moniz, 933 A.2d at 697).', 'Because we agree with the hearing justice’s conclusion that applicant failed to meet the first prong of the Strickland analysis, we need not examine the second prong. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 697. Nevertheless, we have previously noted that, when a conviction follows from a negotiated plea, in order to “demonstrate prejudice emanating from the attorney’s deficient performance such as to amount to a deprivation of the applicant’s right to a fair trial,” Bell, 71 A.3d at 460 (quoting Chapdelaine, 32 A.3d at 941), the applicant “must show that he would have insisted on going to trial and that the outcome of that trial would have been different.” Neufville v. State, 13 A.3d 607, 614 (R.I. 2011). This burden is almost insurmountable when, as in the case at bar, the attorney negotiated a shorter sentence than the sentence applicant could have received if he had gone to trial. See id.', 'Here, it is apparent that applicant received three favorable dispositions.', 'In 2000, applicant was sentenced to two years, suspended, and his attorney recalled that applicant had been relieved that the state had not charged him with intent to deliver the marijuana and cocaine seized from his person and that he received concurrent sentences. In 2002, after failing to complete the drug court treatment program that would have resulted in the withdrawal and dismissal of the charges against him, applicant was ultimately sentenced to two years', '- 16 - incarceration with four months to serve. He had originally faced two years incarceration on each of the probation violation allegations as well as on the new drug charge. In 2003 applicant was sentenced to a one-year term of supervised probation after his initial charges included two counts of possession with intent to deliver and one count of conspiracy to possess with the intent to deliver a controlled substance. The applicant would be unable, therefore, to establish the second prong of the Strickland analysis even if he had overcome the obstacle of the first, and we decline his invitation to remand for further evidence regarding prejudice.', 'We also note that this Court has frequently been called upon to review postconviction- relief decisions that stemmed from a criminal defendant’s attempt to vacate state court convictions that subsequently led to sentencing enhancements in another court. See, e.g., Armenakes v. State, 821 A.2d 239, 241 n.1 (R.I. 2003). Here, the applicant testified that his state court convictions were used as a basis for an enhancement in his federal-conviction sentencing, and the hearing justice concluded that this enhancement served as the impetus for the applicant to challenge the three state convictions at issue in this appeal. Hindsight has clearly revealed the far-reaching collateral consequences of his nolo contendere pleas. In our opinion, however, the applicant received three favorable dispositions considering the initial charges in each case, which clearly demonstrates the effective assistance provided by his attorneys.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we hold that the applicant has not demonstrated that he received ineffective assistance of counsel from either attorney Lutes, attorney Smith, or attorney Corley.

11,": v. : East Pacific, LLC et al. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. This case arises from an incident involving a frozen water pipe and its diluvial aftermath, which caused extensive property damage to several Newport waterfront luxury condominium units. The plaintiff, Newstone Development, LLC (Newstone), owned several units in the condominium complex at the time of the incident. Newstone now appeals from a Superior Court judgment in favor of the defendants, East Pacific, LLC (East Pacific), Michael Rabinowitz, Diane Rabinowitz (the Rabinowitzes), and the contractors, engineers, and architects who were involved in building the condominium (construction defendants). 1 The sole issue before this Court is whether the plaintiff can recover loss-of-use damages during the time that the condominium units were under repair. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'The construction defendants include the following: Stonestreet Construction, LLC, Newport Collaborative Architects, Inc., Bergmeyer Associates, Inc., Odeh Engineers, Inc., Allied Consulting Engineering Services, Inc., Fire Suppression Systems Group, Sun Fire Protection & Engineering, Inc., Cinco Plumbing & Heating, Inc., Baystate Drywall Co., Inc., and Johnson Insulation Company, Inc.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'The essential facts in this case are not in dispute and are as follows. Newstone owned several condominium units at The Residences at Brown and Howard Wharf Condominiums in Newport (The Residences). East Pacific, an entity formed by the Rabinowitzes for the sole purpose of purchasing their condominium unit, owned unit 205 at The Residences. For a period of time prior to December 19, 2009, the Rabinowitzes had turned off the heat in unit 205. On December 19, 2009, water in a pipe passing through their unit froze, causing the pipe to rupture. The ensuing flood caused extensive damage to The Residences, including to common areas and to units within the building. Units 203, 204, and 206, all of which were owned by Newstone (the Newstone units), sustained a total of $1,600,000 in property damage. At the time of the incident, the Newstone units were unoccupied, and were listed and being marketed for sale. Newstone’s insurance provider has since paid for all the necessary repairs to the Newstone units and the units have been sold at full market value.', 'On May 9, 2011, Newstone filed a four-count complaint against the Rabinowitzes and East Pacific.', 'The complaint alleged counts of negligence (count 1), trespass (count 2), diminution of value of plaintiff’s property (count 3), and strict liability (count 4).', 'In its complaint, Newstone alleged that the “condominiums [at The Residences] were extensively damaged as a result of the flooding and water damage caused by * * * [d]efendants.” On August 8, 2012, Newstone filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint, which the hearing justice granted. The amended complaint omitted counts 2 and 4, and alleged that Newstone suffered damages as a result of “not being able to use, occupy, rent or lease the Newstone', '-2- [u]nits.” The complaint was amended again on February 20, 2013. The second amended complaint added construction defendants as additional defendants to the suit. 2', 'On January 24, 2014, East Pacific and the Rabinowitzes filed a motion for summary judgment, to which plaintiff objected. A hearing was held on April 7, 2014. At the summary judgment hearing, plaintiff acknowledged that the Newstone units had sold and had not lost value; consequently, plaintiff informed the court that it would no longer be pressing its claim for diminution of property value. As to its negligence count, plaintiff sought to recover damages for the loss of use of the units as measured by the fair rental value for the period of time that the Newstone units were under repair.', 'The plaintiff argued before the hearing justice that its damages during this period amounted to “loss of use [of the Newstone units,] [l]oss of the ability to rent the [Newstone units] or use the[m] * * * as its own * * *.” The hearing justice granted East Pacific and the Rabinowitzes’ motion for summary judgment. 3', 'The plaintiff subsequently filed a motion to reconsider. During the May 5, 2014, hearing on the motion to reconsider, the hearing justice explained that he had granted East Pacific and the Rabinowitzes’ motion for summary judgment because “it was pretty much conceded that at the time of the loss that [the Newstone units] were not being offered for rentals.” The plaintiff argued for the first time during the hearing on the motion to reconsider that, irrespective of whether it had actually suffered a loss of use, it was entitled to recover for a “prospective loss of use.” The hearing justice disagreed and denied plaintiff’s motion. 2', 'On March 14, 2013, East Pacific and the Rabinowitzes filed a third party complaint against several construction defendants. 3', 'During the summary judgment hearing, counsel representing one of the construction defendants requested that the hearing justice apply his grant of summary judgment to all construction defendants, because their separately filed motions would mirror the one before the court. The hearing justice declined to decide any motion that was not properly before him.', '-3-', 'Following the denial of plaintiff’s motion to reconsider, construction defendants filed their respective motions for summary judgment. 4 A hearing on their motions was held on June 23, 2014. At the hearing, plaintiff raised the same argument that it had made during the motion to reconsider, i.e., that it was entitled to recover loss-of-use damages even in the absence of actual economic loss. The hearing justice granted construction defendants’ motions for summary judgment reasoning that “awarding * * * [p]laintiff damages for loss of use,” where there was no actual loss of rent, “would result in * * * [p]laintiff profiting from this incident, something which the law should discourage.” Final judgment entered for all defendants and plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“This Court will review the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo, ‘employing the same standards and rules used by the hearing justice.’” Daniels v.

(quoting Great American E & S Insurance Co., 45 A.3d at 574). Furthermore, “the nonmoving party bears the burden of proving by competent evidence the existence of a disputed issue of material fact and cannot rest upon mere allegations or denials in the pleadings, mere conclusions or mere legal opinions.” Id.

Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986)).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, plaintiff acknowledges the absence of actual economic loss, but “maintain[s] that it [is] nonetheless entitled to damages from [defendants] for their tortious invasion and deprivation of its right to use its units during the repair period.” The plaintiff argues that §§ 929 and 931 of the Restatement (Second) Torts (1979) (the Restatement) provide for damages for the loss of use of the property—measured by the property’s fair rental value during the repair period—where real estate is tortiously damaged, “even where the owner in fact suffers no harm by the deprivation.” (Emphasis omitted.) The plaintiff contends that, “in property loss cases, proof of actual economic loss is not an essential element for recovery of loss[-]of[-]use damages,” and, consequently, that the decision of the Superior Court should be reversed.', 'In response, defendants argue that plaintiff has failed to present any evidence to support a finding that plaintiff actually lost the use of the Newstone units, “let alone that it sustained any injury related to the alleged loss of use.” The defendants argue that, even if plaintiff had presented evidence that it lost use of the Newstone units, plaintiff nonetheless waived any argument that §§ 929 and 931 of the Restatement do not require proof of actual damages to', '-5- recover for loss of use because plaintiff presented this argument for the first time during the hearing on the motion to reconsider.', 'Additionally, defendants maintain that, even if the argument were properly before this Court, “[o]nce [plaintiff] concede[d] that it [had] not sustain[ed] any economic loss * * *, [its] claim failed as a matter of law.” Contrary to plaintiff’s contentions, defendants insist that an actual injury must be proven to recover any consequential damages related to the loss of use of the Newstone units.', '“It is well settled that to prevail on a claim of negligence a plaintiff must establish a legally cognizable duty owed by a defendant to a plaintiff, a breach of that duty, proximate causation between the conduct and the resulting injury, and [an] actual loss or damage.” Nationwide Property & Casualty Insurance Co. v. D.F. Pepper Construction, Inc., 59 A.3d 106, 110 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Habershaw v. Michaels Stores, Inc., 42 A.3d 1273, 1276 (R.I. 2012)). Generally, when the damage to property is temporary, the cost of repair is the proper measure of damages. Banville v. Brennan, 84 A.3d 424, 432 (R.I. 2014). However, in certain circumstances involving an encroachment upon land, damages “may include the difference in value of the land before and after the harm as well as damages for the loss of use of the land.” Id. at 433 (citing Restatement (Second) Torts § 929 (1979)). Section 929(1)(b) of the Restatement provides that, for an invasion of land “not amounting to a total destruction of [its] value,” the landowner may recover damages for “the loss of use of the land.” Moreover, an occupant of real property may recover damages for harm to the occupant’s enjoyment of his or her property in the event that he or she can prove “some interference with or deprivation of a possessory interest in the property in question as a condition precedent to obtaining damages for any resulting inconvenience, discomfort, or annoyance * * *.” Hawkins v. Scituate Oil Co., 723 A.2d 771, 772, 773 (R.I. 1999).', '-6-', 'Here, it is uncontested that there are no material facts in dispute, rendering this case ripe for summary disposition. As to plaintiff’s negligence count, plaintiff has failed to set forth competent evidence that it suffered an “actual loss or damage,” and we decline to depart from this venerable predicate of our law of negligence in the circumstances of this case. See Nationwide Property & Casualty Insurance Co., 59 A.3d at 110. Rather, we find plaintiff’s assertion that it can recover loss-of-use damages—despite the fact that it conceded that it suffered no actual economic loss—to be misplaced. The principal Rhode Island cases upon which plaintiff relies are readily distinguishable.', 'In Hawkins, 723 A.2d at 772, this Court allowed homeowners to recover damages for inconvenience, discomfort, or annoyance when their home was flooded with home heating oil. Unlike the case at bar, Hawkins involved “a physical interference with or a loss of a possessory interest in real property.” Id. at 773. There, the tortfeasor’s wrongdoing interfered with the plaintiffs’ rightful occupancy of the property. Id. Here, it is conceded that plaintiff held the condominium units solely for sale. Moreover, in Banville, 84 A.3d at 433, relying in large measure upon § 929 of the Restatement, we affirmed an award of damages for diminution in value for, at least in part, loss of use of the plaintiff’s real estate. The trial justice had found that the plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her property had been adversely impacted by the defendant’s behavior, which included the construction of a building encroaching on the plaintiff’s land. Banville, 84 A.3d at 433. In upholding the award of damages for the loss of the plaintiff’s use and enjoyment of her property, we specifically noted “the defendants’ willful encroachment, in the face of ample notice that there was a significant problem with [a] survey, and the real and lasting harm to the plaintiff’s property as a result of the defendant’s behavior.” Id. In this case, there is no allegation, let alone evidence presented, of any willful encroachment on the part of', '-7- defendants or of any “real and lasting harm” to the Newstone units. To the contrary, it is undisputed that the Newstone units were fully restored at no cost to plaintiff and were sold at fair market value.', 'Additionally, plaintiff’s reliance on §§ 929 and 931 of the Restatement to support its argument is also unavailing. Section 931 provides that:', '“If one is entitled to a judgment for the detention of, or for', 'preventing the use of, land or chattels, the damages include', 'compensation for (a) the value of the use during the period of', 'detention or prevention or the value of the use of or the amount', 'paid for a substitute, and (b) harm to the subject matter or other', 'harm of which the detention is the legal cause.” Restatement', '(Second) Torts § 931 at 551-52. Importantly, illustration 1 to comment b. of § 931 offers the following scenario: “A takes possession of and detains for six months B’s land, which has a rental value for the period of $1000. B is entitled to receive this amount as damages although he never had used and would not have used the land during the period.” The plaintiff’s insistence that the Restatement supports its position disregards the fact that, in the illustration provided, “A [took] possession of and detain[ed] * * * [the] land.” See id. § 931 cmt. b, illus. 1 at 552. Here, the alleged negligent acts relate to the pipes freezing and bursting; plaintiff did not allege that defendants wrongfully took possession of the Newstone units.', 'Similarly, the case law from other jurisdictions cited by plaintiff is inapplicable to the facts in this case. For example, several cases involve a cause of action for replevin where the plaintiffs were allowed to recover loss-of-use damages for the time their chattel was wrongfully detained, without having to prove any intention of actually using the chattel during that period. See, e.g., Ben Lomond, Inc. v. Campbell, 691 P.2d 1042, 1044, 1045, 1046 (Alaska 1984) (loss- of-use damages awarded to an owner of a generator after the defendant wrongfully took', '-8- possession of the generator, in the absence of evidence that the owner would have used the generator during the period of detention); see also Nichols v. Martin, 589 P.2d 451, 453 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1978) (the plaintiff recovered damages for loss of use of an aircraft equal to value of leasing the aircraft during the period of wrongful detention irrespective of what the plaintiff actually expended to replace her loss of use of the aircraft). While damages for loss of use of a chattel may be proper in a replevin action, again, plaintiff does not allege that defendants wrongfully possessed the Newstone units. See Rule 64 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure; see also Gem Plumbing & Heating Co. v. Rossi, 867 A.2d 796, 806 n.14 (R.I. 2005) (replevin is an “action for the repossession of personal property wrongfully taken or detained by the defendant”) (quoting Black’s Law Dictionary 1325 (8th ed. 1999)).', 'The plaintiff’s reliance on cases involving allegations of wrongful occupation is similarly flawed. See, e.g., Don v. Trojan Construction Co., 178 Cal. App. 2d 135, 136, 137-38 (Cal. Dist. Ct. App. 1960) (the defendant who stored dirt on property owned by the plaintiff without consent was responsible for the fair rental value of the property for the entire period of the wrongful occupation despite the plaintiff’s not otherwise intending to rent the property); see also Robert v. Scarlata, 899 A.2d 666, 669 (Conn. App. Ct. 2006).', 'Notably, torts such as trespass are intentional and do not require a plaintiff to have sustained an actual loss—instead, the invasion of one’s property alone gives rise to the cause of action. See Bennett v. Napolitano, 746 A.2d 138, 141 (R.I. 2000) (“A trespasser is ‘[o]ne who intentionally and without consent or privilege enters another’s property.’”) (quoting Ferreira v. Strack, 652 A.2d 965, 969 (R.I. 1995)).', 'It is our opinion that plaintiff was indeed required to allege and put forth competent evidence that it in fact suffered an actual injury when faced with a summary judgment motion. See Nationwide Property & Casualty Insurance Co., 59 A.3d at 110. Instead, however, plaintiff', '-9- conceded that the Newstone units were being marketed for sale at the time of the incident and that the units had not lost value when they were ultimately sold. Additionally, plaintiff presented no evidence that, but for the damage caused by the burst pipe, it would have rented the Newstone units during the time they were being repaired. To the contrary, plaintiff acknowledged that the Newstone units were not being offered as rentals at the time that they were damaged.', 'Under these circumstances—where the plaintiff did not allege encroachment, wrongful possession, wrongful detention, or trespass, and where the plaintiff conceded that it did not incur any economic loss—our law does not permit recovery for loss of use. To allow recovery in this case would grant the plaintiff a windfall by placing it in a better position than it was in prior to the alleged negligent act, something this Court declines to do. See Morabit v. Hoag, 80 A.3d 1, 18 (R.I. 2013) (“The overall goal is to place the injured landowner as near as possible to his or her pre-injury position, not to grant the landowner a windfall.”). Consequently, the plaintiff’s concessions that it had not incurred any economic loss as a result of the defendants’ negligent conduct, coupled with its failure to raise any claims that would allow recovery despite an absence of an economic loss, renders summary judgment in the defendants’ favor appropriate. 5', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. The record shall be returned to the Superior Court. 5', 'The defendants’ assertion that plaintiff’s loss-of-use argument is waived because it raised such claim for the first time in its motion to reconsider has not been entertained by this Court, because any waiver would relate to claims solely against East Pacific and the Rabinowitzes, not construction defendants.

12,"Kathryn Manning et al. : v. : Peter J. Bellafiore, M.D., et al. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. This case originated as a negligence and wrongful death action brought by Kathryn Manning (Mrs. Manning or plaintiff), individually and as administratrix of the estate of Michael Manning (Manning) and on behalf of her four minor children, against Peter J. Bellafiore, M.D. (Dr. Bellafiore or defendant), but has since evolved into extensive litigation regarding sanctions. 1 The trial justice sanctioned both Dr. Bellafiore and the law firm that represented him at trial, White & Kelly, P.C. (WCK), 2 for their failure to make pretrial disclosures. The latter parties each appealed from the order awarding sanctions and the matters were consolidated by this Court. The overriding issue to be decided in both appeals is whether the trial justice properly imposed sanctions. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'Although the original complaint also included Donald M. McNiece, M.D., and South County Hospital as defendants, neither is party to this appeal. 2', 'White & Kelly, P.C. was formerly known as White, Carlin & Kelly, P.C. or White & Galamaga, P.C, and will be referred to herein, collectively with Attorney William F. White, as WCK.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'A', 'Overview', 'This Court is familiar with the facts in this case as set forth in Manning v. Bellafiore, 991 A.2d 399 (R.I. 2010) (Manning I). To briefly summarize, on March 4, 1998, Manning was taken to the emergency care unit at South County Hospital (SCH) after he lost consciousness and fell at his home. Manning was admitted to SCH and, over the course of four days, Dr. Bellafiore was the treating neurologist responsible for Manning’s care. During this time, Dr. Bellafiore also consulted with Donald M. McNiece, M.D. (Dr. McNiece), Manning’s primary-care physician. Doctor Bellafiore established a differential diagnosis 3 for Manning of complex migraine, aneurysm, tumor, and stroke, and he recommended that Manning undergo a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) to determine whether Manning was suffering a stroke and, if so, to locate the blockage of blood flow to his brain. 4', 'On the first day he was admitted to SCH (March 4 or day 1), Manning attempted to undergo an MRI/MRA on two occasions. The first attempt was unsuccessful, however, because he had a claustrophobic reaction. Doctor Bellafiore prescribed the antianxiety medication Ativan and the antinausea medication Compazine for Manning, but a second attempt to undergo the MRI/MRA was also unsuccessful. The next day (March 5 or day 2), Dr. Bellafiore contacted the MRI Network of Rhode Island to set up an “open architecture MRI” for Manning in the hope of mitigating Manning’s claustrophobia. The MRI Network of Rhode Island directed Dr. Bellafiore 3', 'Differential diagnosis is a list of considered causes of a given symptom or symptoms. 4', 'Doctor Bellafiore also prescribed aspirin as an antiplatelet medication.', '-2- to the open MRI machine at Rhode Island Hospital (RIH). However, Dr. Bellafiore learned that the open MRI machine at RIH was under repair and would not be available.', 'On March 6 (day 3), a computerized tomography (CT) scan, conducted and ordered by Dr. Bellafiore after Manning complained of a headache, revealed that Manning had indeed suffered a stroke on March 4. Doctor Bellafiore again attempted to schedule an open MRI at RIH; however, he was informed that the machine was still down for repair but that it would possibly be fixed by the end of the day. On March 7 (day 4), Dr. Bellafiore spoke with a radiology fellow at RIH, who opined that an open MRI machine would not give as good an image as a closed one. At that juncture, the decision was made for Manning to try the closed MRI machine under general anesthesia on March 9, the next day the MRI machine would be available at SCH. 5 Tragically, however, Manning suffered a second stroke on March 7. He was airlifted to Massachusetts General Hospital, where a blood clot led to steadied loss of brain function. Manning’s life support was withdrawn on March 9 and he passed away.', 'On January 6, 2000, plaintiff filed a negligence and wrongful death suit against Drs. Bellafiore and McNiece, as well as against SCH.', 'As the case progressed, an important component of plaintiff’s malpractice claim against Dr. Bellafiore was his failure to conduct the MRI during the first three days of Manning’s hospitalization and his failure to present Manning with alternatives to obtaining the MRI in light of Manning’s claustrophobia. One of plaintiff’s main contentions was that Manning’s death could have been avoided if defendants had administered or obtained an MRI test immediately after Manning’s admission to the hospital, either at SCH or by transferring him to a different facility. 5', 'SCH was a participant in the Rhode Island Medical Resonance Imaging Network, which provided hospitals without in-house MRI/MRA machines the use of its portable MRI/MRA machine on certain scheduled days.', '-3-', 'B', 'Discovery', 'The parties engaged in discovery from the commencement of the action in January 2000 to January 2004, when the case went to trial. During discovery, there was a great deal of evidence and testimony relating to Dr. Bellafiore’s treatment of Manning. Specifically, the evidence presented focused on Dr. Bellafiore’s attempts to have Manning undergo an MRI and discussions regarding sedation to assist him in undergoing the procedure.', 'In plaintiff’s interrogatories, plaintiff asked Dr. Bellafiore to “state to the best of [his] recollection any and all conversations [he] had with any person concerning the care and/or treatment of * * * Manning from March 4, 1998 to date * * *.” The plaintiff asked Dr. Bellafiore to provide information regarding “the person with whom [he] had each conversation,” “the time and date of each conversation,” and “the content of each conversation.” (Interrogatory No. 18.) Doctor Bellafiore raised several objections but ultimately directed plaintiff to his answer to interrogatory No. 7 and attested that “[he] spoke with [Manning] and [Mrs. Manning] during [Manning’s] admission regarding his treatment,” without specifying the content of those conversations. The answer to interrogatory No. 7 also did not specify any conversation Dr. Bellafiore had with Manning, instead, it provided a brief overview of Manning’s hospital stay. It does not appear from the record that plaintiff sought to compel more responsive answers to interrogatories No. 7 or 18. However, following Dr. Bellafiore’s deposition, plaintiff filed a motion to compel Dr. Bellafiore to file a more responsive answer to plaintiff’s interrogatory No. 16, which asked for all facts relating to defendant’s assumption of the risk defense. In Dr. Bellafiore’s supplemental answer, he averred that in', '“the event that plaintiff asserts that an MRI would have changed', '* * * Manning’s outcome in this case, * * * Manning refused to be', 'sedated to undergo a ‘closed’ MRI, when the ‘open’ MRI at [RIH]', '-4-', 'was inoperable, despite being repeatedly informed that he might', 'have a life threatening condition, which might be detectable by', 'MRI.” 6', 'During his deposition, Dr. Bellafiore was questioned regarding the sequence of events, including his conversations with Manning regarding the MRI and sedation. When asked what he gives to patients experiencing claustrophobia to make them capable of completing an MRI, Dr. Bellafiore replied, “I use Ativan.” He further explained that the amount of Ativan is “dependant [sic] on [the patients’] size, their weight but also the effect that the medication has on them.” The questioning then proceeded to the situation where sedation equipment was brought into the MRI suite; Dr. Bellafiore testified that he was aware of that possibility, and discussed his experiences. When asked if there was “any reason why * * * Manning couldn’t have been sedated with the assistance of anesthesiology on March 4th in order to accomplish the MRI,” Dr. Bellafiore answered yes, “[b]ecause it’s a dangerous procedure to give someone general anesthesia or anesthetic who is having a potential stroke.”', 'Doctor Bellafiore testified that he had not called the anesthesia department to ask what kind of sedation could be performed on Manning “because it’s dangerous or it would put him at risk,” which Dr. Bellafiore did not wish to do “unless [they] couldn’t get the study in the open [MRI] machine.” He was asked what options there were for sedation in a closed machine at RIH, to which he responded that he had assumed they were the same as at SCH: “There are a variety of things you can do including Ativan or other benzodiazepines, there are antipsychotics that they may use, the general things an anesthesiologist would do.” At this point, Dr. Bellafiore explained that sedation posed a risk to Manning because “it [could] alter blood pressure, 6', 'Doctor Bellafiore had, in his original answers to interrogatories in January 2001, indicated that he would supplement his answer to interrogatory No. 16 “as discovery progresse[d].” Although it is unclear whether the trial justice ever issued an order compelling a more responsive answer to that interrogatory, Dr. Bellafiore did file a supplemental answer to interrogatory No. 16.', '-5- respiratory function, it also [could] affect the neurologic exam making it difficult to assess the patient for integral changes.', 'It [could] cause them to aspirate, it [could] have technical/mechanical difficulties, all the risks that you [would] have with general anesthesia.”', 'Doctor Bellafiore testified that on day 1 he told the Mannings “that it would be difficult to treat [Manning] unless [they] had [the MRI and MRA] done.” He recalled that he asked Manning on day 2 whether Manning would undergo an MRI if he had more sedation. When asked what he told Manning about sedation, Dr. Bellafiore testified that “[he] said [they] could try giving [Manning] more Ativan to make him a little sleepier to see if [Manning] could tolerate the test,” however, he testified that Manning “said there was no way that he wanted to try that. He just couldn’t do it he said. Those were his words. He just [could not] do it. And he apologized. He felt bad about it but he said he didn’t want to try.” When asked if it was Dr. Bellafiore’s “testimony that [Manning] refused to attempt this test after [he] told [Manning] that he had a life[-]threatening condition * * *,” Dr. Bellafiore stated “[a]bsolutely.”', 'Doctor Bellafiore also testified that he spoke to Dr. McNiece “[e]ssentially [about] * * * Manning * * * refusing the MRI * * * even with more sedation in the closed machine.” When asked if Manning “had undergone sedation [short of general anesthesia] in order to accomplish an MRI, * * * what[] [was] the likelihood that his blood pressure and respiration would become so compromised that it would be life[-]threatening,” Dr. Bellafiore replied that he did not know a percentage number, “but [he] would say that the chances are great enough that you would want to attempt the open MRI first.” He testified that he told Manning in the evening of day 2 that “[they] would try for the open MRI machine the next day.”', 'Doctor Bellafiore further testified that, after examining Manning in the morning of day 3, he told Manning “that it look[ed] like [he was] having symptoms of a stroke and that [they]', '-6- really need[ed] to perform th[e] MRI.” Because the open MRI machine at RIH was still not operational that day, “[Dr. Bellafiore] asked [Manning] if he would consider going into the closed unit with more sedation and [Manning] said no.” Doctor Bellafiore conceded that he did not document this conversation or Manning’s refusal to undergo the closed MRI.', 'Doctor Bellafiore testified that on the following day, day 4, he spoke to a radiology fellow at RIH again in an attempt to learn the status of the open MRI machine. At that time it became apparent to Dr. Bellafiore that it was unclear when and if the open MRI machine would be working. After Dr. Bellafiore testified that the fellow stated that he did not believe the image in the open MRI would be as good as the closed MRI and that he suggested trying the closed MRI under general anesthesia, the following colloquy occurred during the deposition:', '“Q. Well, didn’t you tell him that the closed machine with general', 'anesthesia posed a risk of death to your client, your patient?', '“A. We talked about it.', '“Q. Well, what did he say about that risk of death from sedation or', 'anesthesia?', '“A. Well, I don’t remember what he said, but it really didn’t matter', 'what he said. The open MRI wasn’t available.', '“Q. So how does that change the fact that sedation or anesthesia', 'pose[d] a risk of death to your patient? How does that change it?', '“A. It doesn’t change the fact, but if there’s no alternative which at', 'this point there wasn’t --', '“Q. Uh-huh.', '“A. -- then we had no choice but to try the regular MRI with some', 'anesthesia.', '“Q. So if I understand you correctly, as of March 7th you were', 'prepared to try the closed machine and put * * * Manning under', 'some kind of sedation or anesthesia in order to get a picture, right?', '“A. Correct.', '“Q. Well, why, Doctor, why were you prepared to take that risk on', 'the 7th when you weren’t prepared to have * * * -- to take that risk', 'with * * * Manning on the 5th or the 6th?', '“* * *', '“A. Because on the 5th and the 6th the expectation was that the open', 'MRI, which was the safer test, was going to be available. That’s', 'the information that was conveyed to us.”', '-7- Doctor Bellafiore testified that the decision was made to perform the MRI under general anesthesia at SCH on March 9, the next day the machine would be available at the hospital.', 'C', 'Trial', 'On January 5, 2004, after a lengthy discovery period, the case proceeded to trial. On the fifteenth day of trial, Dr. Bellafiore testified that on days 2 and 3 of Manning’s hospitalization, he offered Manning “conscious sedation” to assist him in undergoing a closed MRI but that Manning apologetically refused. Specifically, Dr. Bellafiore testified that, when his patients experience claustrophobia, “[Ativan] [i]s the first thing that [he] tr[ies].” He further explained that:', '“Well, what I’m telling you is that I did offer him Ativan. And', 'then I also talked to him about IV sedation * * * with the help of', 'an anesthesiologist.', '“* * *', '“I told him about conscious sedation. * * * I’ve had a number of', 'patients who had seizures who are developmentally delayed * * *', '[a]nd with those patients sometimes you need to get an MRI. And', 'a good way of doing it, because they’re so uncooperative, is to give', 'them this IV Versed, which is that sedative.', '“So I told him about those patients that I had experience with', 'and told him it was something that we could certainly arrange for', 'or try to do.', '“* * *', '“I remember [what Manning told me], because I was struck by it.', 'He told me, ‘I’m sorry, Doc.’ I remember it when people call me', 'Doc. It just makes me feel like a doctor. ‘I know you need me to', 'do this test to figure out what to do, but I just can’t do it.’ This', 'was on the morning of the 5th after I told him all the things that', 'could possibly be wrong. And I told him about conscious sedation.', 'I told him about Ativan. I told him the open MRI may not give us', 'the answer we need. I basically held -- and told him he could have', 'a stroke, he could have a tumor. I was holding a neurological gun', 'to his head. That’s when he told me, ‘I’m sorry, Doc, if you need', 'me to do this, I just can’t do it.’ I was struck because I never had a', 'patient apologize to me about that before. And frankly, I felt a', 'little guilty because here’s a guy who’s sick, who’s probably', '-8-', 'scared to death, and I’m making him feel so guilty he’s', 'apologizing to me.', '“At that point I told him, you know, ‘Okay. We can try for the', 'open MRI, see what we can get, and we’ll go from there.’ And I', 'didn’t document any of that.” Doctor Bellafiore explained that what he “mean[t] by sedation [was] Ativan or IV Versed, and that’s what [he] would refer to as conscious sedation.” He also testified that conscious sedation was a “reasonable option” for Manning and that he had discussed it with Manning on the morning of day 2.', 'Over a week later, plaintiff filed a motion for entry of default judgment against Dr. Bellafiore or in the alternative to strike his defense or testimony for inconsistencies between his discovery disclosures and trial testimony regarding sedation. Doctor Bellafiore objected to both remedies. The trial justice pointed out that Dr. Bellafiore had not yet completed testifying, and reserved his decision “until probably after the verdict.” The trial justice stated that:', '“Sometimes the greatest penalty for a witness who has been', 'inconsistent or misleading is that the jury won’t believe him or her.', 'Here the witness is still testifying so the [c]ourt declines to step in', 'at this point and will reserve and see what happens. Counsel may', 'submit additional responses for final instructions or for other', 'relief.” After the conclusion of all testimony, plaintiff set forth a renewed motion for entry of default judgment against Dr. Bellafiore. The trial justice denied the motion “without prejudice” but also “treat[ed] it as a motion for judgment as a matter of law” and reserved his decision until after a verdict was reached. The next day, the jury returned a verdict in favor of all three defendants.', 'D', 'Posttrial Sanction Proceedings', 'The plaintiff subsequently filed a motion for a new trial. The defendant filed a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law. The trial justice granted plaintiff’s motion for a new', '-9- trial as to Dr. Bellafiore on the grounds that the verdict was not supported by the evidence. This Court affirmed the trial justice’s grant of a new trial on the basis that the trial justice had not overlooked or misconceived material evidence when deciding that the verdict was against the fair preponderance of the evidence. Manning I, 991 A.2d at 410-11.', 'Following this Court’s decision, plaintiff filed a renewed motion for sanctions against Dr. Bellafiore and his attorneys for their failure to disclose during discovery that he had spoken to Manning on days 2 and 3 of his hospitalization regarding the possibility of using conscious sedation to undergo the MRI. The defendant again objected to the motion. After further briefing and hearings, the trial justice issued an order finding that “an order imposing sanctions upon Dr. Bellafiore or his attorney(s) [was] appropriate” based upon “the actions described in the [c]ourt’s [d]ecision of November, 2005.” The court also noted that plaintiff had reserved her right to seek additional sanctions for “other conduct.” Finding that the type and extent of the sanction to be imposed had not “yet been established,” the court reserved on the issue pending further hearing and discovery.', 'Shortly thereafter, the negligence and wrongful death case against Dr. Bellafiore settled. However, the parties’ dismissal stipulation explicitly preserved “the claims being made by * * * plaintiff[] for sanctions against Dr. Bellafiore, William F. White [(White)] or [WCK].” Extensive hearings were held throughout 2011 and 2012 concerning essentially the differences between Dr. Bellafiore’s pretrial disclosures and his trial testimony to determine the degree of the sanction to be imposed and upon whom it should be imposed. The trial justice heard testimony by Dr. Bellafiore and the two partners at WCK who represented Dr. Bellafiore at trial—White and Joshua Carlin. Attorney Richard Boren also testified for plaintiff as to the', '- 10 - reasonableness of the amount of plaintiff’s sanction request. The parties also submitted post- hearing written memoranda.', 'During the sanction proceedings, new evidence became available regarding a letter Dr. Bellafiore, with the assistance of counsel, drafted and submitted to the Rhode Island Board of Medical Licensure (board letter). In this board letter, Dr. Bellafiore described in detail his treatment of Manning. The board letter outlined that Manning refused to undergo a closed MRI on day 2 of his hospitalization, even with “maximum sedation.” White had the board letter in his files and when tasked with providing answers to plaintiff’s interrogatories, Dr. Bellafiore referred counsel to the board letter.', 'E', 'Superior Court Decision', 'In a lengthy decision, the trial justice granted plaintiff’s motion to sanction both Dr. Bellafiore and WCK under Rule 11 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure and awarded plaintiff $152,998.57—holding Dr. Bellafiore individually responsible for eighty percent and WCK for the remaining twenty percent. In his decision, the trial justice first analyzed whether the imposition of a sanction was appropriate, and then considered whom to sanction, how to apportion the sanction, and what monetary amount to sanction.', 'As to the first inquiry concerning the appropriateness of a sanction in this case, the trial justice observed that Dr. Bellafiore’s trial testimony was “drastically different” from what was present in the medical records. The trial justice also found that the following information was never provided prior to trial:', '“[(1)] The term ‘conscious sedation,’ which Dr. Bellafiore seems', 'to use throughout his trial testimony, had not been used before[;]', '“[(2)] Talking to * * * Manning about bringing in an', 'anesthesiologist had never been described[;]', '“[(3)] The drug, Versed, was never identified earlier[;]', '- 11 -', '“[(4)] Conversations with * * * Manning about sedations on March', '5 or March 6 were not mentioned by Dr. Bellafiore earlier[;]', '“[(5)] Even more surprising was Dr. Bellafiore’s new revelation', 'that * * * Manning apologized (‘I’m sorry, Doc.’).” The trial justice explained that the “entire defense changed and different facts were thrown into the mix of an already complex trial” as a result of this testimony. Accordingly, he concluded that a sanction was indeed appropriate.', 'In deciding whom to sanction, the trial justice found that “Dr. Bellafiore’s trial testimony was far more telling than his discovery responses.” He concluded that “[e]ither [Dr. Bellafiore] was hiding the complete answers, or he opted to modify his version of the truth far into the trial.” He explained that, if the conversation that Dr. Bellafiore testified to at trial had in fact occurred, “Dr. Bellafiore had a clear obligation to disclose that in his discovery answers.” He found that Dr. Bellafiore’s testimony at the sanction hearing “bore limited credibility,” sought to “cast blame on everyone but himself,” and was “very self-serving.” The trial justice concluded, however, that “Dr. Bellafiore’s testimony did not lead the [trial] [c]ourt to surmise that counsel masterminded the entire shell game” and that Dr. Bellafiore “b[ore] significant responsibility for the sanctionable conduct.”', 'The trial justice further explained that “[t]here was no showing that [White] knew that Dr. Bellafiore had such a detailed recollection of the specific events of the key conversation * * *.” However, the trial justice highlighted that White had the board letter, which included Manning’s refusal to undergo the MRI even with “maximum sedation,” and despite Dr. Bellafiore having pointed White to the board letter to properly answer the interrogatories, White “failed to include the reference to maximum sedation in Dr. Bellafiore’s interrogatory answers.” The trial justice opined that “Dr. Bellafiore and his counsel should have recognized that the issue of sedation, and whether * * * Manning gave informed consent, were very much in issue. They', '- 12 - had a duty to disclose facts, when asked. * * * Counsel knew, or should have known, of this clear obligation.” Ultimately, the trial justice concluded that White “was obligated but failed to determine the issues with * * * Manning’s anesthesia and * * * Manning’s concerns about the anesthesia,” and “[w]hile th[e] [c]ourt [wa]s clearly convinced that Dr. Bellafiore b[ore] the lion’s share of responsibility for the failure to respond, counsel ha[d] some responsibility as well.”', 'In deciding how to apportion the sanction between Dr. Bellafiore and White, the trial justice reasoned that Dr. Bellafiore was “primarily culpable,” since “[h]e responded to his attorneys’ questions, drafted interrogatory answers, signed answers under oath, responded to deposition questions under oath, verified the transcripts for their accuracy, and uncorked the surprise testimony deep into the marathon trial.” Consequently, he held Dr. Bellafiore eighty percent responsible and WCK twenty percent responsible. The trial justice disagreed with Dr. Bellafiore’s argument that the costs incurred by plaintiff should have been reduced by one-third because there were two other defendants in the matter.', 'He explained that “it was the sanctionable conduct rooted in Dr. Bellafiore’s defense which caused the need for the second trial—and created the chaos of the first trial.” The trial justice did not consider the proposed deduction to be appropriate in view of the fact that the motion for a new trial was granted solely in plaintiff’s case against Dr. Bellafiore.', 'Finally, in deciding what monetary amount would be appropriate as a sanction, the trial justice highlighted that so much of plaintiff’s attorneys’ efforts, “including the trial itself and some of the preparation costs, were for naught.” The trial justice explained that ordering the new trial did nothing to make plaintiff whole, but instead “simply burden[ed] [plaintiff] with more expenses and labor.” The trial justice then conducted an analysis to determine the amount of', '- 13 - attorneys’ fees that it would be reasonable to assess as a sanction and the proper method of calculating those fees in light of plaintiff’s contingency-fee arrangement with her attorneys. The plaintiff’s attorneys had not kept contemporaneous time records because they did not bill on an hourly basis; therefore, they were required to retroactively calculate their time and expenses. Ultimately, the trial justice assessed $38,398.53 for “expenses * * * incurred by [plaintiff] and rendered unnecessary as a result of the sanctionable conduct.” With respect to attorneys’ fees, the trial justice allowed 23 hours for pretrial work “which were rendered useless or redundant as a result of the sanctionable conduct”; 325.5 hours for trial work and 25 hours for the sanction proceedings, for a total of 382 hours at a rate of $300 per hour. 7 Accordingly, the trial justice imposed a sanction totaling $152,998.57. Judgment was entered for plaintiff in that amount, and both Dr. Bellafiore and WCK filed timely notices of appeal.

Consequently, this Court will review the trial justice’s imposition of the sanction based on its inherent powers. See Najarian, 911 A.2d at 711.', 'B', 'Findings of Sanctionable Conduct', '1. Doctor Bellafiore', 'On appeal, Dr. Bellafiore argues that the hearing justice abused his discretion by allocating primary responsibility for the sanctionable conduct to him, and he contends that the judgment must be reversed for several reasons. First, Dr. Bellafiore argues that the alleged “surprise” testimony at trial was contained in his board letter, which he wrote years before trial and provided to WCK as a source of facts to be referenced in the answers to plaintiff’s interrogatories. Second, he argues that the trial justice’s conclusion that he never described any refusal of treatment prior to the trial is contradicted by the record evidence. Third, he claims that the trial justice unfairly held the pretrial memorandum against him, a document he did not see until after WCK filed it with the court. Fourth, he maintains that the trial justice improperly', '- 17 - sanctioned him for his medical note-keeping practices despite that issue not being before the court. Lastly, he argues that the trial justice’s allocation of eighty percent of the sanction to him contradicts the record evidence and lacks principled rationale.', 'In response to Dr. Bellafiore’s arguments, plaintiff argues that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in imposing a sanction upon Dr. Bellafiore. She argues that the trial justice was in the “best position to fully understand and appreciate the significance of the misconduct, the disruption caused to the legal process, and the need to correct this injustice by deterring repetition and remedying the harm caused.” The plaintiff further contends that Dr. Bellafiore’s “deliberate and calculated decision to withhold statements he then claimed were made by [Manning] robbed * * * plaintiff and her children of their day in court.” The plaintiff insists that it is “impossible to corroborate either version of Dr. Bellafiore’s testimony, because his contemporaneous medical records are so lacking in detail” and because neither Dr. NcNiece nor plaintiff’s testimony demonstrated that Dr. Bellafiore had the conversation with Manning about sedation and that Manning refused. The plaintiff highlights that “Dr. Bellafiore was in the best position to know if his written answers contained complete and accurate accounts of the medical events surrounding the care of * * * Manning” and that, consequently, he cannot simply assign the blame to his counsel.', 'After a thorough review of the extensive trial record before this Court, including motions, discovery material, exhibits, and transcripts of both the underlying trial and sanction proceedings, it is this Court’s opinion that the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive material evidence in determining that a sanction was appropriate against Dr. Bellafiore. It is important to note at the outset, however, that of the five assertions made by Dr. Bellafiore at trial that the trial justice characterized as “brand new” in his written decision, two of those', '- 18 - assertions—testimony regarding “[c]onversations with * * * Manning about sedations on March 5 or March 6” and testimony that “Manning apologized”—can be found in the deposition transcripts that are part of the record before this Court. 9 Nevertheless, at least three assertions were made in Dr. Bellafiore’s trial testimony that had not been made during discovery, including the use of the term “conscious sedation,” the discussion of the drug Versed as a possible anesthetic to allow Manning to undergo the closed MRI, and bringing in an anesthesiologist during days 2 and 3 of Manning’s hospitalization.', 'The record before this Court is clear that, at a minimum, Dr. Bellafiore failed to answer questions posed in plaintiff’s interrogatories and at his deposition completely and that he added significant new details in his testimony at trial. When asked in plaintiff’s interrogatories to provide information regarding “the person with whom [he] had each conversation, * * * the time and date of each conversation, * * * [and] the content of each conversation,” Dr. Bellafiore attested that “[he] spoke with [Manning] and [Mrs. Manning] during [Manning’s] admission regarding his treatment,” without specifying the content of those conversations. When asked at deposition what he prescribed to patients in the past who needed to undergo an MRI but were having a claustrophobic reaction, he testified that “[he] use[d] Ativan.” He also agreed that, “as of March 7th [or day 4]” but not on days 2 or 3, he was prepared to take the risk of trying the closed MRI machine and putting Manning under some kind of sedation or anesthesia in order to get a picture, “[b]ecause on [days 2 and 3] the expectation was that the open MRI, which was the safer test, was going to be available.” Doctor Bellafiore, therefore, indicated that he did not 9', 'Although not set forth in answers to plaintiff’s interrogatories, at deposition Dr. Bellafiore testified that he discussed sedation with Manning on both March 5 and 6 and that, on both occasions, Manning declined to undergo an MRI, even with “more sedation.” Additionally, Dr. Bellafiore testified at deposition that “[Manning] said he was sorry. He just didn’t think he could do [the MRI].”', '- 19 - consider anesthesia or sedation with the assistance of an anesthesiologist as a desirable treatment for Manning prior to day 4 because it would pose too much of a risk in light of the expectation that the open MRI unit would be operational in the near future. He also did not describe any IV or Versed sedation with the help of an anesthesiologist as a possible medication for Manning. Nonetheless, and surprisingly, at trial he testified about offering more Ativan as well as IV sedation or “conscious sedation” with the help of an anesthesiologist on days 2 and 3.', 'It is evident from the record before this Court that this unexpected testimony came as a bombshell in the middle of the trial. 10 We agree with the trial justice that to reveal or even suggest, so late in the case, that Manning was informed of risks and refused to undergo the MRI even with “conscious sedation,” was “simply astonishing.”', 'Therefore, the trial justice’s conclusion that Dr. Bellafiore “[e]ither * * * hid[] the complete answers, or he opted to modify his version of the truth far into the trial,” is supported by the record and is not otherwise clearly wrong.', 'Furthermore, although the trial justice did not use the terms “bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons” to describe Dr. Bellafiore’s actions, the specific finding that “[e]ither Dr. Bellafiore willfully refused to answer direct questions on the specific issues during 10', 'The trial justice wrote in his decision: “[T]his unexpected, undisclosed testimony significantly altered the focus of the trial and justified the granting of a new trial. * * * The impact of these new revelations was tremendous. To say that Manning’s counsel were blindsided would be an understatement.” He further noted that, “[e]ven though the trial was eight years ago, he distinctly recalled the look of astonishment on [p]laintiff’s counsel immediately after Dr. Bellafiore’s colloquy.” The trial justice characterized “the failure to disclose such essential information [as] shocking.” The clear thrust of Dr. Bellafiore’s testimony during discovery was that on days 2 and 3 he had discussed the possibility of increasing the dosage of Ativan and that he had rejected any anesthesiologist-assisted sedation as too dangerous. Clearly, the options that Dr. Bellafiore had offered to Manning to facilitate the MRI were critical to plaintiff’s case. Any conversations concerning the levels of sedation discussed should have been fully disclosed during discovery.', '- 20 - discovery and after court orders, or he provided false testimony,” are sufficient to supply these meanings. See Harlan v. Lewis, 982 F.2d 1255, 1260 (8th Cir. 1993) (“[a]lthough the district judge did not use the words ‘oppressive, vexatious, or bad faith’ to describe [counsel’s] action * * * the specific findings of impermissible and unethical conduct are sufficient to supply these meanings”); see also Baker Industries, Inc. v. Cerberus Limited, 764 F.2d 204, 209 (3d Cir. 1985) (declining to remand “for an explicit finding of bad faith when it is clearly evident from the district court’s expressions and from the record as a whole, that the district court found, albeit implicitly, * * * conduct to be in bad faith”). The trial justice’s findings that Dr. Bellafiore was “motivated by improper purposes and lacking in good faith,” “knew his sworn answers were indirect, evasive, significantly incomplete, and had little concern for the result,” also supports an inference of a bad-faith finding. Because “[l]ittle is to be gained from requiring semantic improvement when the meaning of the [trial justice] is clear,” Harlan, 982 F.2d at 1260, this Court holds that a finding that Dr. Bellafiore acted in bad faith can be inferred by the trial justice’s decision and that such decision did not overlook or misconceive material evidence, and is not otherwise clearly wrong. Consequently, it is our opinion that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in finding that Dr. Bellafiore engaged in sanctionable conduct.', '2. Attorney White and WCK', 'WCK argues that the trial justice committed reversible error and abused his discretion when he sanctioned counsel for the disjunction between Dr. Bellafiore’s pretrial disclosures and his testimony at trial. WCK argues that the trial justice’s twenty percent apportionment of responsibility to WCK for the surprise testimony was not predicated on any finding of willful misconduct by counsel. WCK contests that the trial justice made counsel the guarantor of complete and truthful answers from Dr. Bellafiore. WCK insists that, because Dr. Bellafiore', '- 21 - conceded that he never discussed offering anesthesia-assisted conscious sedation with WCK, it “should not be penalized for the failure to disclose a conversation that [Dr. Bellafiore] had kept to himself until trial and that may never have taken place at all.”', 'In response, plaintiff argues that White became aware when he read the board letter as to the central issue regarding the MRI and sedation, but failed to disclose this critical information when he drafted the answers to the interrogatories. Because this information would constitute a “complete defense”—that Manning refused treatment—plaintiff argues that the trial justice properly found that the obligation to disclose this defense rested with both defendant and his counsel, White.', 'After a careful review of the record before this Court and the trial justice’s decision, it is our opinion that, unlike the findings of fact related to Dr. Bellafiore’s conduct, the trial justice made no findings of fact regarding White’s conduct that would support an inference that White acted in “bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons.” See Najarian, 911 A.2d at 711 n.5. To the contrary, the trial justice concluded that Dr. Bellafiore’s testimony at the sanction hearing “did not lead the [trial] [c]ourt to surmise that counsel masterminded the entire shell game,” and that “[t]here was no showing that [White] knew that Dr. Bellafiore had such a detailed recollection of the specific events of the key conversation * * *.” Although the trial justice found that White “failed to include the reference to maximum sedation in Dr. Bellafiore’s interrogatory answers” despite having the board letter in hand, that “Dr. Bellafiore and his counsel * * * had a duty to disclose facts, when asked,” and that “[c]ounsel knew, or should have', '- 22 - known, of this clear obligation,” this does not support an inference of bad faith, rather it sounds in negligence. 11', 'Consequently, this Court vacates the judgment against WCK because the trial justice did not make a finding, nor can one be inferred, that the attorneys at WCK acted in “bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons” as necessary when relying on the court’s inherent powers to impose a sanction. 12', 'C', 'Monetary Sanction Imposed', 'Because we hold that Dr. Bellafiore alone engaged in sanctionable conduct, he is necessarily accountable for one-hundred percent of the sanction. 13', 'However, this Court is troubled by the total amount imposed—$152,998.57. Although we afford a trial justice wide latitude to fashion an appropriate remedy for sanctionable conduct, Carrasco, 918 A.2d at 217, we are of the opinion that in this case the trial justice based his calculations on an erroneous assessment of the evidence. See In re Briggs, 62 A.3d 1090, 1098-99 (R.I. 2013). 11', 'We shall note, however, that had there been a finding that WCK acted in bad faith because White and/or Carlin knew that Dr. Bellafiore was providing false testimony, then the attorneys would be in violation of Article V, Rule 3.3 of the Supreme Court Rules of Professional Conduct. See Rule 3.3(a)(3) (“A lawyer shall not knowingly * * * offer evidence that the lawyer knows to be false.”); See Rule 3.3(a)(3) Editor’s Comments 8 (“The prohibition against offering false evidence only applies if the lawyer knows that the evidence is false. A lawyer’s reasonable belief that evidence is false does not preclude its presentation to the trier of fact.”). 12', 'We are concerned, however, with counsel’s obligations of candor to the court in light of his client’s testimony. White testified at the sanction hearing that, after he heard Dr. Bellafiore’s startling new testimony, he said to co-counsel, “where the f did this come from.” Yet armed with the knowledge that his client’s testimony was significantly at odds with his revelations during discovery, White neither advised the trial justice nor moved to withdraw. The trial justice, however, did not address this thorny intersection of counsel’s duty to his client and his duty to the court, and neither shall we. 13', 'As previously noted, the trial justice originally apportioned eighty percent of the sanction to Dr. Bellafiore, and twenty percent to WCK.', '- 23 -', 'We disagree with the trial justice’s contention that much of the time, effort, money and dedication to the first trial was “for naught” due to Dr. Bellafiore’s sanctionable conduct. This characterization of the first trial disregards the fact that plaintiff tried several claims against two other defendants—Dr. McNiece and SCH. 14 Although the trial justice attempted to exclude portions of the trial that were related exclusively to the claims against these defendants when calculating the amount of fees he would impose, the ultimate sanction he imposed even exceeded plaintiff’s requested amount by over $30,000. 15', 'Additionally, although Dr. Bellafiore’s surprise testimony came on February 2, 2004, the trial continued for several more days before plaintiff filed her motion for entry of default judgment against Dr. Bellafiore or in the alternative to exclude Dr. Bellafiore’s testimony. At that time, the trial justice reserved ruling on the motion, reasoning that “sometimes the greatest penalty for a witness who has been inconsistent or misleading is that the jury won’t believe him or her.” Notably, after the jury rendered its verdict in favor of Dr. Bellafiore and the trial justice granted plaintiff’s motion for a new trial, he did so in part based upon his determination that Dr. Bellafiore’s testimony “best support[ed] the proposition that he failed to meet the standard of care.” Clearly, the differences in Dr. Bellafiore’s pretrial disclosures and trial testimony were not the exclusive reason the trial justice granted plaintiff’s motion for a new trial. 14', 'The trial justice held that “[t]he Mannings’ case against Dr. McNeice [sic] and [SCH] was submitted without incident” and because plaintiff did not claim any residual effect on her case against these defendants, the court declined to “infer any fallout.” 15', 'In plaintiff’s amended costs and fees in support of renewed motion for sanctions, she sought a sum of $121,353.41 to be imposed as a sanction. Moreover, although the trial justice recognized in his decision that plaintiff had suggested that the sanction compensate “only one of their attorneys at trial,” he nevertheless allowed plaintiff compensation for one attorney at one- hundred percent and a second attorney at fifty percent. In addition, the trial justice acknowledged that, although plaintiff “further suggest[ed] that the bill be reduced by one-half as there were two other [d]efendants at trial,” the trial justice declined to do so. Ultimately, plaintiff sought to be compensated for 99 hours of trial work, but the trial justice included 325.5 trial hours in calculating the sanction.', '- 24 -', 'It is our opinion, therefore, that Dr. Bellafiore should not have to bear so much of the costs associated with the first trial. This is especially true where the case did not result in a second trial and the parties reached a settlement. Although the parties’ settlement explicitly preserved the issue of sanctions, the fact that plaintiff did not incur the additional costs of a second trial is relevant to determining what amount Dr. Bellafiore should be sanctioned. While Rule 11 is not strictly applicable here, the purpose behind its sanctions—“to deter repetition of the harm, and to remedy the harm caused”—can nevertheless guide our review of the sanction imposed in this case. Lett, 798 A.2d at 368. The harm caused to plaintiff was reduced when plaintiff reached a settlement agreement with Dr. Bellafiore and did not have to try the case again. Thus, to “remedy the harm” does not require us to ignore this fact. Additionally, a jury verdict in defendant’s favor was vacated and a new trial was ordered. Undoubtedly, this alone would likely deter any party from failing to make proper pretrial disclosures or from altering their testimony at trial. Doctor Bellafiore too was back to square one.', 'We are therefore satisfied that the trial justice’s imposition of such a hefty sanction is unsustainable. Accordingly, this Court vacates the order sanctioning Dr. Bellafiore and WCK in the amount of $152,998.57 and directs the Superior Court to enter an order sanctioning Dr. Bellafiore in the amount of $38,398.53. This sum represents the trial expenses awarded by the trial justice; it does not include, however, the attorneys’ fees awarded by the trial justice. 16 The plaintiff’s claims against Dr. McNiece and SCH were fully and finally, albeit unsuccessfully, litigated in that trial. Additionally, this Court specifically excludes the 25 hours (or 33.5 hours)17 of attorneys’ fees associated with the sanction hearing that were imposed. As noted, the sanction 16', 'The trial justice specifically excluded expenses that were incurred in support of plaintiff’s claims against Dr. McNiece and SCH, as well as the costs of preparing exhibits that were “reusable.” 17', 'See footnote No. 7.', '- 25 - imposed on Dr. Bellafiore must be a consequence of instances where the trial justice found he “acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons.” Najarian, 911 A.2d at 711 n.5 (quoting Chambers, 501 U.S. at 45-46). Although the trial justice made such findings as it related to the differences in Dr. Bellafiore’s pretrial disclosures and trial testimony—the trial justice did not make a bad-faith finding as it related to Dr. Bellafiore’s conduct during the sanction proceedings. In our opinion, to include in Dr. Bellafiore’s monetary sanction the amount of attorneys’ fees incurred by the plaintiff to press the issue of the sanction would be inappropriate. In essence, the court would be sanctioning Dr. Bellafiore for defending against a motion to impose a sanction on him, rather than for any sanctionable conduct. Consequently, we direct the Superior Court to enter an order sanctioning Dr. Bellafiore in the amount of $38,398.53.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm in part and vacate in part the judgment of the Superior Court. The record shall be returned to the Superior Court.', 'Justice Indeglia did not participate.', 'Justice Robinson, concurring in part and dissenting in part.

However, I take issue with the majority’s approach whereby it overturns the sanction against the law firm while simultaneously upholding the sanction against Dr.', '- 26 - most vigorously dissent from the Court’s ruling that any monetary sanction (regardless of the amount) was appropriately levied against Doctor Peter J.

It is my very definite view that neither Dr. Bellafiore nor his attorneys engaged in any sanctionable conduct in this case.', 'I am well aware of the stresses and strains that are inherent in all litigation, and I am equally aware of how the occurrence of unanticipated testimony or other unexpected evidence can necessitate major adjustments in trial strategy and tactics in mid-stream; and I am not a naif who refuses to believe that sharp practices sometimes take place during discovery or in the courtroom, but this is no such case. After carefully scrutinizing the record, I simply do not see therein conduct of a sanctionable nature on the part of Dr. Bellafiore; I fail to see in the record the presence of anything more than “the fog of war” that so often envelops litigation—especially in the midst of a high-stakes jury trial.', 'I', 'I acknowledge that this Court must abide by an abuse of discretion standard of review in the instant case and must determine whether or not the sanction at issue was imposed based on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence. Pleasant Management, LLC v. Carrasco, 918 A.2d 213, 217 (R.I. 2007). However, what the majority fails to take into consideration in conducting its review is the fact that the discretion of which we speak “is not exercised by merely granting or denying a party’s request;” rather, “[t]he term ‘discretion’ imports action taken in the light of reason as applied to all the facts and with a view to the rights of all the parties to the action while having regard for what is right and equitable under the circumstances and the law.” Hartman v. Carter, 121 R.I. 1, 5, 393 A.2d 1102, 1105 (1978); see also Dauray v. Mee, 109 A.3d 832, 846 (R.I. 2015); State v. Lead Industries Association, Inc., 69 A.3d 1304, 1312 (R.I. 2013). Bellafiore. In my judgment, if it was appropriate to sanction Dr. Bellafiore, then his counsel should have been sanctioned as well.', '- 27 -', 'I am profoundly disturbed by the fact that, of the five alleged inconsistencies between Dr. Bellafiore’s discovery disclosures and his trial testimony on which the trial justice’s sanction decision is based, two are clearly in error. My concern is deepened by the fact that it is readily apparent from a reading of the deposition testimony and answers to interrogatories at issue that the trial justice was simply not correct with respect to those two bases—i.e., whether or not Dr. Bellafiore stated during discovery that Mr. Manning apologized and whether or not conversations with Mr. Manning about sedation on March 5 or March 6 had been referenced by Dr. Bellafiore during discovery. 2', 'Moreover, a detailed reading of the deposition testimony shows that a third basis relied upon by the trial justice as a predicate for the sanction, while not incorrect, is not in fact as clear an inconsistency as the trial justice implies. The trial justice stated that “[t]he drug, Versed, was never identified earlier.” He is correct that Dr. Bellafiore never used the word “Versed” at his deposition or in his answers to interrogatories. However, the following colloquy took place at Dr. Bellafiore’s deposition:', '“Q.', 'Do you know now what options they have for sedation at', 'the closed machine [at Rhode Island Hospital]?', '“A.', 'I would assume it’s the same options that we have at our', 'hospital.', '“Q.', 'What are those options?', '“A.', 'There are a variety of things you can do including Ativan', 'or other benzodiazepines * * *.” (Emphasis added.) 2', 'The majority opinion candidly acknowledges the flawed nature of the trial justice’s decision. Regrettably, however, the majority opinion makes such acknowledgment only briefly and then moves on without giving meaningful consideration to just how greatly fact-finding errors of the magnitude present in the instant case call into doubt the dependability of the entirety of the trial justice’s decision, including his ultimate conclusion.', '- 28 - In what is a marked characteristic of the deposition, no follow-up question was asked relative to Dr. Bellafiore’s reference to “other benzodiazepines.” A brief look at the Physicians’ Desk Reference shows that Versed is a benzodiazepine. 3 Therefore, although Dr. Bellafiore did not use the word “Versed,” he clearly stated at his deposition that, in addition to Ativan, drugs which fall into the class of benzodiazepines, as Versed does, could be used to sedate a patient for a closed MRI.', 'In addition to the errors committed by the trial justice concerning what he deemed to be multiple bases for imposing sanctions, his decision contains other errors.', 'As the majority recognizes, there are numerous computational errors in the trial justice’s calculation of the amount to be awarded as a sanction, as well as inconsistencies between what was “award[ed]” and what was ultimately included in the sanctions amount. And there is more; in addition to these factual errors, the trial justice plainly applied the wrong rule. The text of Rule 11 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure and our decision in D’Amario v. State, 686 A.2d 82, 85 (R.I. 1996), are very clear: Rule 11 is not applicable to an alleged failure to provide complete answers to interrogatories and deposition questions.', 'Moreover, my review of the record has uncovered the following additional errors. The trial justice stated in his written decision that plaintiffs’ counsel “sought prompt relief” after Dr. Bellafiore’s purported “surprise testimony” at trial; however, in reality it took plaintiffs’ counsel over a week to move for entry of default. The trial justice also stated in his decision that “Dr. Bellafiore’s interrogatory answers describe no refusal of treatment,” whereas the supplemental answer to Interrogatory No. 16 stated: 3', 'See Midazolam Hydrochloride Injection, The Physicians’ Desk Reference, http://www.pdr.net/drug-summary/Midazolam-Hydrochloride-Injection-midazolam- hydrochloride-985 (last visited June 3, 2016) (Versed and Midazolam are the same medication; they simply have different brand names).', '- 29 -', '“Defendant asserts that Mr. Manning refused to be sedated to', 'undergo a ‘closed’ MRI, when the ‘open’ MRI at Rhode Island', 'Hospital was inoperable, despite being repeatedly informed that he', 'might have a life threatening condition, which might be detectable', 'by MRI.” Additionally, the trial justice stated in his decision that “there is no reference [in Dr. Bellafiore’s interrogatory answers] to conversations with Mr. Manning or Mrs. Manning,” whereas the answer to Interrogatory No. 18 stated: “I spoke with the patient and his wife during his admission regarding his treatment.” In like manner, the trial justice’s decision contained the following statement: “To reveal or even suggest, so late in the case [(i.e., at trial)], that Mr. Manning was informed of risks and refused treatment, was simply astonishing.” Not only was that information contained in the above-quoted supplemental answer to Interrogatory No. 16, it was also contained in Dr. Bellafiore’s deposition testimony; when Dr. Bellafiore was asked at deposition if it was his testimony that Mr. Manning “refused to attempt [the closed MRI] after [he] told [Mr. Manning] that he had a life threatening condition * * *,” Dr. Bellafiore responded: “Absolutely.”', 'The numerous material errors contained in the trial justice’s written decision addressing the issue of sanctions certainly do not reflect that he exercised his discretion “in the light of reason as applied to all the facts;” it is my opinion that he could not have done so when he was under such a misapprehension with respect to what the facts actually were in the case before him. Hartman, 121 R.I. at 5, 393 A.2d at 1105. When a judge is considering the imposition of any sanction and perhaps especially one of the magnitude of the one at issue in this case—which I note is a very high sanction—he or she should be punctilious about conducting an accurate and meticulous review of the facts and applying with care the correct principles of law. I am unable to say that the trial justice acted in that manner in this case; and, therefore, it is my opinion that', '- 30 - the trial justice in this case abused his discretion when he imposed sanctions on Dr. Bellafiore based to a substantial extent on a clearly erroneous assessment of the facts. See Pleasant Management, LLC, 918 A.2d at 217. The majority’s decision to the contrary is, quite frankly, astonishing to me.', 'II', 'My conclusion that the trial justice abused his discretion in the instant case is further buttressed by the fact that, after a thorough review of Dr. Bellafiore’s deposition, his entire trial testimony, the answers to interrogatories, and the supplemental answer to interrogatories, I am left with the inescapable conclusion that the trial justice’s decision that sanctions were appropriate was not a reasonable determination based on the circumstances present in this case.', 'The majority correctly reviews the trial justice’s decision based on his inherent power to sanction. Such a sanction allows a trial justice to exercise that inherent power “to fashion an appropriate remedy that would serve the ends of justice.” Vincent v. Musone, 574 A.2d 1234, 1235 (R.I. 1990). As the majority recognizes, the trial court may properly exercise its inherent power to impose a sanction on a party only upon a finding that the party (in this case, Dr. Bellafiore) “acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons.” Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.S. 32, 45-46 (1991) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island v. Najarian, 911 A.2d 706, 711 n.5 (R.I. 2006). After a thorough and painstaking review of the record in its entirety, I am genuinely mystified as to how the majority could come to the determination that somehow Dr. Bellafiore’s conduct met that standard.', 'I begin by considering the standard itself. As I noted in my recent dissent in Long v. Dell, Inc., 93 A.3d 988, 1007 n.1 (R.I. 2014), “this Court has on numerous occasions, in past', '- 31 - opinions, relied on dictionary definitions to provide the plain meaning of certain words.” 4 As such, in the instant case I deem it necessary to look to the dictionary definitions of bad faith, vexatious, wanton, and oppressive.', 'Bad faith has been defined as “[d]ishonesty of belief, purpose, or motive,” Black’s Law Dictionary 166 (10th ed. 2014), and as “[t]he malicious intention to be dishonest or to violate the law, as in negotiations over a contract.” The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 133 (5th ed. 2011). Vexatious has been defined as “without reasonable or probable cause or excuse; harassing; annoying,” and vexation has been defined as “[t]he damage that results from trickery or malice.” Black’s Law Dictionary at 1796. In addition, wanton means “[u]nreasonably or maliciously risking harm while being utterly indifferent to the consequences,” id. at 1815, and “[m]arked by unprovoked, gratuitous maliciousness; capricious and unjust[.]” The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language at 1951. Oppressive is defined as “exercising power arbitrarily and often unjustly; tyrannical” and “[d]ifficult to cope with; causing hardship or depressed spirits.” Id. at 1237. These definitions show that a sanction based on the court’s inherent power should be a reaction to conduct that could be characterized as malicious, dishonest, harassing, or unjust.', 'To determine whether Dr. Bellafiore’s conduct in this case rose to that very high standard, I look to what transpired during the discovery process. Although unquestionably Dr. Bellafiore’s answers to Interrogatories No. 7 and 18 were terse and incomplete (although they were not inaccurate), it is in my view highly significant that no motion to compel more 4', 'See, e.g., Olamuyiwa v. Zebra Atlantek, Inc., 45 A.3d 527, 535 (R.I. 2012) (“It is well established that [w]hen * * * a statute does not define a word, courts will often apply a common meaning as provided by a recognized dictionary.”) (internal quotation marks omitted); Drs. Pass and Bertherman, Inc. v. Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island, 31 A.3d 1263, 1269 (R.I. 2011) (“This meaning is consistent with the common sense, dictionary definition of ‘public’ with respect to expenditures.”); In re Proposed Town of New Shoreham Project, 25 A.3d 482, 513 (R.I. 2011) (“When, as is the case here, a statute does not define a word, courts will often apply a common meaning as provided by a recognized dictionary.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).', '- 32 - responsive answers was filed with respect to those answers. Nor were Requests for Admission employed for the purpose of “pinning down” crucial facts. Moreover, no motion to compel a more responsive answer was filed after Dr. Bellafiore provided his supplemental answer to Interrogatory No. 16 which, crucially, stated: “Defendant asserts that Mr. Manning refused to be sedated to undergo a ‘closed’ MRI, when the ‘open’ MRI at Rhode Island Hospital was inoperable * * *.” I take no joy in serving as a Monday morning quarterback with respect to the conduct of litigation. Nevertheless, where very significant sanctions are at issue, as they are in the instant case, I feel obliged to state that this case would probably not be before us if plaintiffs’ counsel had been more meticulous in the course of the discovery process.', 'When I turn to Dr. Bellafiore’s deposition, the lack of meticulousness on the part of plaintiffs’ counsel is even more readily apparent. The plaintiffs’ counsel, in posing questions at the deposition, repeatedly used simply the word “sedation” or “anesthesia” without specifying what level of sedation the question was referencing. For example, Dr. Bellafiore was asked for “any reason why [Mr.] Manning couldn’t have been sedated with the assistance of anesthesiology,” and he was asked “[H]ow does that change the fact that sedation or anesthesia pose[d] a risk of death to your patient?” In addition, references were made to “more sedation,” “some kind of sedation or anesthesia,” and “some anesthesia.” Those questions and references are simply a few examples of a multitude of instances where the term sedation was used but not defined by plaintiffs’ counsel at deposition. At one point in the deposition, Dr. Bellafiore was asked a question regarding “mild sedation,” to which he responded: “Well, what’s the definition of mild sedation?” No attempt was made by plaintiffs’ counsel to define mild sedation before moving on to another topic. That seems to have been the trend at Dr. Bellafiore’s deposition: when he would reply to a question in a somewhat general manner, there was a frequent', '- 33 - noteworthy failure to follow-up or ask more specific questions.', 'The deposition afforded plaintiffs’ counsel the opportunity to probe beneath the surface in order to make Dr. Bellafiore’s position specific and clear, but counsel failed to avail herself of that opportunity.', 'The distinctions between giving a sedative, conscious sedation, and general anesthesia, which were so extensively examined at trial, are noticeably absent from the deposition questions. That fact is especially curious in view of the fact that Dr. Bellafiore’s answer to plaintiffs’ complaint contained an affirmative defense of assumption of the risk as well as an explicit statement that Dr. Bellafiore was asserting “all applicable defenses relating to comparative negligence and contributory negligence;” those statements should have put plaintiffs and their counsel on notice that how much sedation was offered, when it was offered, and when it was refused by Mr. Manning would be of paramount importance in this case. Nonetheless, plaintiffs’ counsel opted, for whatever reason, not to depart from generalities with respect to levels of sedation, and she made no attempt to clarify what each party’s understanding of those general terms were.', 'The confusion over the specifics of sedation and anesthesia was readily apparent at trial. On the second day of questioning, Dr. Bellafiore responded as follows to a question posed by plaintiffs’ counsel: “Now, you need to define anesthesia, conscious sedation for me, because I’m not sure what we are talking about.” Moreover, after finally and at length arriving at a definition of conscious sedation and delineating three levels or types of sedation, an exchange such as the following still took place:', '“Q.', 'And we can agree that sedation short of general anesthesia', 'is conscious sedation?', '“A.', 'No, I can’t agree to that because I don’t know what you', 'mean by that. I mean, I asked you to define the terms. And', 'when you say ‘short of general anesthesia,’ I don’t know if', '- 34 -', 'that’s conscious sedation. I don’t know if that’s -- I don’t', 'know what that is.” Additionally, during Dr. Bellafiore’s trial testimony, when plaintiffs’ counsel was questioning him with respect to his lack of testimony about conscious sedation at his deposition, defense counsel was required to raise the following very significant objection: “I object, your Honor * * * [The plaintiffs’ counsel] spent 45 minutes trying to define and write on the chart [the various levels of sedation] versus what was done at deposition. There was no definition done [at deposition]. There was no distinction between the three at deposition.”', 'Despite the nature of the deposition questions, plaintiffs’ counsel implied at trial that Dr. Bellafiore had been untruthful in not providing more specific, detailed answers to the deposition questions and in not clarifying what he meant by sedation. Those implications are rampant in the examination of Dr. Bellafiore at trial, and he repeatedly had to explain that he “tried to answer the questions as clear as [plaintiffs’ counsel] asked [him]. [He] tried to answer exactly the question [he] was asked.” In addition to the implications by plaintiffs’ counsel, the trial justice stated in his decision that Dr. Bellafiore should have recognized that informed consent was “very much in issue” and should have disclosed related facts “when asked” during discovery. However, it is absolutely crucial to note that, contrary to the trial justice’s assertion, Dr. Bellafiore did answer the questions that were put to him; it is not, nor has it ever been in our system, the responsibility of a deponent to provide information that he or she is not asked for at a deposition. The fact that the questions asked at the deposition did not provide the information which plaintiffs would have found useful at trial is the fault of the questioner, not the deponent; certainly the deponent should not be penalized for the failure of the questioner to have asked more searching questions at the deposition.', 'In seeming disregard of these record-based considerations, the majority opinion still holds that Dr. Bellafiore’s actions somehow satisfy the', '- 35 - very high standard applicable to sanctions levied under the inherent power of the court. But such a holding is puzzling after one conducts a full review of the record and thereby comes to realize the depth of confusion which existed in this case with respect to how to define and delineate levels of sedation.', 'The trial justice pointed out, as one of his five bases for sanctioning Dr. Bellafiore, that Dr. Bellafiore did not use the term “conscious sedation” during discovery. What the trial justice did not address, however, is the fact that neither did counsel for plaintiffs. Moreover, it is not only Dr. Bellafiore who began using the term “conscious sedation” at trial; the same is true for plaintiffs’ counsel. I note additionally that any prejudice purportedly suffered by plaintiffs in this case was surely mitigated by the extensive examination of Dr. Bellafiore at trial regarding every supposed inconsistency with his deposition testimony. We expressly acknowledged in our opinion in Manning v. Bellafiore, M.D., 991 A.2d 399, 404 (R.I. 2010), that the plaintiffs, at trial, “vigorously disputed Dr. Bellafiore’s contention that he had frequently offered Mr. Manning conscious sedation as a means of completing the MRI/MRA examination and repeatedly pointed out that, in both his answers to interrogatories and his deposition testimony, Dr. Bellafiore had failed to mention offering this option.” Therefore, whatever inconsistency there may have been was already before the jury, whose members were free to assess how those inconsistencies might affect Dr. Bellafiore’s credibility. See State v. Richardson, 47 A.3d 305, 314 (R.I. 2012) (“It is axiomatic that [t]he determination of the truthfulness or credibility of a witness lies within the exclusive province of the jury.”) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, it is telling that, despite the assertion by the majority that Dr. Bellafiore’s testimony at trial was some sort of “bombshell,” it took plaintiffs’ counsel over a week to move for entry of default.', '- 36 -', 'In conclusion, when one looks at the entirety of the deposition testimony, Dr. Bellafiore’s trial testimony, and his answers to interrogatories, rather than myopically looking at only the purported inconsistencies perceived by the trial justice, it is obvious that Dr. Bellafiore was not acting with malice, unjustly, in a harassing manner, or dishonestly; Dr. Bellafiore did not lie during the discovery process, and there is no evidence of an intent to evade, contrary to the trial justice’s rather hyperbolic characterizations. 5 In addition, my careful perusal of the portions of Dr. Bellafiore’s deposition testimony that are quoted in the majority opinion and my reading of the remainder of his deposition testimony, have completely failed to convince me that there was any evasiveness or “hidden ball” behavior on the part of the deponent. Doctor Bellafiore’s deposition answers and his answers to interrogatories are arguably lacking in optimal specificity, but it is clear to me that any inconsistencies which resulted were at best the product of negligence. I have been unable to perceive any evidence in the record tending to show that Dr. Bellafiore’s actions could be characterized as having been taken in bad faith, wantonly, vexatiously, or for oppressive reasons. During the course of the adversarial interaction that is the essence of the litigation process, it is not uncommon for there to be answers which lack specificity or for there to be some degree of inconsistency between deposition and trial testimony; that is not in and of itself a valid basis for sanctions. I simply cannot in good conscience concur in the majority’s opinion to the contrary. 5', 'In his written decision concerning sanctions, the trial justice used words like “shocking,” “jaw-dropping,” and “surprise testimony.” He further stated that Dr. Bellafiore “opted to modify his version of the truth” and that plaintiffs’ counsel was “blindsided” by Dr. Bellafiore’s trial testimony.', '- 37 -', 'III', 'Furthermore, my decision to dissent in this case is also driven by the fact that the majority fails to address the ample precedent indicating that a court’s inherent power to sanction must be exercised in very limited circumstances and with great restraint. The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has stated that, “even when inherent powers legitimately can be invoked, they must be exercised with restraint and circumspection, both ‘because [they] are shielded from direct democratic controls,’” United States v. Horn, 29 F.3d 754, 760 (1st Cir. 1994) (Selya, J.) (quoting Roadway Express, Inc. v. Piper, 447 U.S. 752, 764 (1980)), and “[b]ecause of their very potency[.]” Id. (quoting Chambers, 501 U.S. at 44). The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has echoed the First Circuit in stating that “‘[b]ecause of their very potency’ * * * the federal courts must be careful to exercise their inherent powers ‘with restraint and discretion.’” Fellheimer, Eichen & Braverman, P.C. v.

I can conceive of no interpretation of the record that would result in the conclusion that such circumstances are present in the instant case, nor does the majority attempt to show that such circumstances are present. With all due respect for the trial justice, I am unable to say that he acted in this case on the basis of a careful analysis and discrete findings given that the sanctions decision contains numerous material errors. See 61A Am. Jur. 2d Pleadings § 605 at 615. I fail to understand how the trial justice could have concluded that he was acting within his discretion and with the required restraint when he imposed such a massive fine on a layperson—an individual who, by definition, does not have the same familiarity with the legal system and the rules of discovery as an attorney. The trial justice appears not to have given sufficient weight to the fact that human memory is a notoriously fallible instrument. Doctor Bellafiore’s testimony, both at deposition and at trial, was based on his memory of the events surrounding Mr. Manning’s treatment. At the time of the deposition, it had been over three years since those events occurred; and, by the time of trial, it had been approximately seven years since their occurrence. In my judgment, it is not reasonable for the trial justice and the majority to expect a layperson’s memory of events to be exactly the same three years and seven years after the events in question.', '- 39 -', 'In my opinion, if any inconsistencies were present, they were more than adequately dealt with by the granting of plaintiffs’ motion for a new trial.', 'The trial justice should have recognized that he had thereby employed the least amount of power needed for the end he deemed to be appropriate and that no further action was required to preserve the authority of the court. See Natural Gas Pipeline Co., 86 F.3d at 467; 61A Am. Jur. 2d Pleadings § 605 at 615. The granting of plaintiffs’ motion for a new trial led to an eventual settlement between plaintiffs and Dr. Bellafiore, and it certainly constituted sanction enough in this case, even if (contrary to my unwavering belief) a sanction was called for.', 'Litigation is no day at the beach; it is a grueling activity, accompanied by many twists and turns. The lengthy trial in this case surely had its share of such twists and turns. But I am adamant in my conviction that nothing improper occurred during the discovery phase of this case or during the trial. There was simply no basis for the sanction that was imposed. Poorly conducted discovery on behalf of the plaintiffs resulted in confusion mid-trial. I simply do not comprehend why Dr. Bellafiore is being sanctioned for that chain of events. I have set forth with care the reasons why I believe that there should have been no sanction whatsoever. And it is my further belief that, even granting for the sake of argument that the majority is correct in perceiving sanctionable conduct, the sanction, in the amount determined by the majority, is unreasonable in the extreme. I feel very strongly that justice has not been served in this case. Accordingly, while I concur in the majority’s opinion with respect to vacating the sanction imposed against White & Kelly, P.C., I am unable to find strong enough terms to express my conviction that the majority errs gravely in upholding any sanction against Dr. Bellafiore.

In the summer of 2006, at a time when the Whittemores’ children were young teenagers, the couple began looking for a property to purchase in the Watch Hill section of Westerly because their children had enjoyed past summers with their friends there. They viewed at least fifteen properties between 2006 and 2008, hoping to find a property that would not require renovation, because they believed they had only a few summers remaining before their children went to college.

The lot, which was about 100 yards from the beach, was slightly over an acre in size and the two-story house had six bedrooms, six bathrooms, and ocean views from the second floor. The $7.85 million asking price was much higher than the Whittemores had anticipated paying, but they made an offer of $7.1 million because the property was superior to other properties and fit their needs. Mr. Whittemore believed they were offering an amount in excess of the fair market value, but he felt that it was worth the extra expense because, at that time, housing prices had been increasing for many years, and he planned to keep the property in the family. 3 The sellers accepted the Whittemores’ offer and they entered into a purchase and sale agreement for the property in June 2008.', 'By the fall of 2008, the financial climate had changed radically. The Whittemores initially had planned to finance most of the sale price by liquidating some investment accounts; however, in September 2008, the liquid assets available to the Whittemores, like so many others, had dropped dramatically. As a result, to finance the sale by the agreed closing date, the Whittemores came to a financing arrangement with the sellers, whereby $4 million was financed by the sellers and they paid the remaining $3 million.', 'Shortly thereafter, however, the Whittemores paid off the personal loan obtained from the sellers by securing a loan from 3', 'Furthermore, the Whittemores believed that it was worthwhile to offer a price that they believed would prevent the sellers from offering the house to a larger group of buyers because the house had yet to be listed on the Multi-State Listing Service.', '-3- Washington Trust Company. To approve the loan, Washington Trust obtained two appraisals, valuing the property at $6.9 million and $6.5 million.', 'In 2009, the Town of Westerly Tax Assessor, Charles Vacca, conducted a statutorily mandated townwide revaluation; 4 he reassessed the Whittemores’ property at $5,976,600 on December 31, 2009 (the effective date), an assessment substantially higher than the assessed value of $5,260,900 that the property had when it was purchased by the Whittemores. The Whittemores objected to that assessment and, after an informal meeting with the tax assessor in the spring of 2010, the town agreed to lower the assessment slightly to $5,905,000.', 'The Whittemores, still dissatisfied with the assessment, hired Stephen McAndrew, a licensed real estate appraiser who had experience in tax appeals. McAndrew filed an “Annual Return” with the tax assessor on behalf of the Whittemores on October 26, 2010, and he filed a formal appeal with the tax assessor the following day. After Vacca denied the appeal, the Whittemores appealed his decision to the board of assessment review. The Whittemores also appealed the 2010 and 2011 assessments, which remained the same amount as the 2009 assessment. Each year, plaintiffs filed an “Annual Return,” but after the March 15 yearly deadline, set forth in G.L. 1956 § 44-5-15. The board denied each appeal, and the Whittemores filed separate petitions in the Superior Court to reduce the tax assessment for each of the three years at issue. 4', 'General Laws 1956 § 44-5-11.6(a) required that “beginning on December 31, 2000, the assessors in the several towns and cities shall conduct an update as defined in this section or shall assess all valuations and apportion the levy of all taxes legally ordered under the rules and regulations * * *; provided, that the update or valuation is performed in accordance with the following schedules: * * *.” Westerly was scheduled to conduct an “Update” of the assessments in 2003 and 2006 and a “Revaluation” in 2009. Id. at § 44-5-11.6(a)(2)(i). More detailed explanations of assessment updates and revaluations are related by the expert testimony, infra.', '-4-', 'In April 2013, a three-day trial began in the Superior Court on the three consolidated tax- appeal petitions. The trial justice acknowledged that the petition for appeal from the 2011 tax assessment had been so recently filed that the town had not had the opportunity to answer the petition; as a result, the parties agreed to address the issue of the town’s affirmative defense— that the Whittemores had failed to timely file an “Annual Return”—in posttrial briefing. In the prosecution of their case, plaintiffs offered three witnesses: Mr. Whittemore, McAndrew, and Vacca.', 'The defendant called Vacca, Stephen Ferreira, the District Manager of Vision Government Solutions, a company specializing in mass appraisals, and David Thompson, the new town tax assessor.', 'Stephen McAndrew’s Testimony', 'McAndrew testified that he conducted a retrospective appraisal of the property around the end of 2010, to determine its value as of December 31, 2009. In his appraisal, he described the Watch Hill neighborhood as characterized by mini-estates, with many properties being over an acre “with supporting improvements best-termed mansions.”', 'McAndrew described the prevailing market conditions as, “[t]he subject neighborhood is reflecting both stabilization and declining values. * * * Values exceeding [$1,500,000] are felt to continue to decline. Viewing into the foreseeable future, decline in the area is estimated on an annual basis to be 6%.” At trial, McAndrew said that hindsight clarified market trends, but that his conclusion was ultimately the same as in 2010, explaining that values reached a peak in 2005, remained stable until the beginning of 2008, and then showed an “absolutely definable loss in value in the marketplace,” which McAndrew projected to be on an annual basis of about 6 percent, until around 2012, when values began to stabilize.', 'He also testified that, in Watch Hill, the lower-value properties stabilized earlier, but the upper-level property values had not yet done so.', '-5-', 'McAndrew testified that the most accurate method of measuring value is by using the “comparable sales approach,” which he employed in his appraisal of the subject property. Because of the scarcity of sales in the area resulting from the prevailing market conditions, he said that he was required to look beyond Watch Hill to find comparable sales that represented similar locational characteristics, physical attributes, and value. He used three “comparables” in his appraisal, one located in Jamestown, one in Newport, and one in the nearby Shelter Harbor neighborhood of Westerly. He said he believed that all of the properties were in very desirable locations, either near or on the water, and that their sale dates were close to the target appraisal date of December 31, 2009. After making adjustments to the sale values for different locations and amenities, McAndrew determined that the adjusted values of the properties ranged from $4.6 million to $5.1 million, and he concluded that the direct sales method indicated an estimated fair market value of $4.9 million for the subject property.', 'McAndrew also discussed several properties in the Watch Hill neighborhood that he decided not to use as comparables. The property at 7 Manatuck Avenue was assessed in 2009 at $6,498,200, following a sale of that property on April 18, 2008, for $6 million. He said he chose not to use that property as a comparable for the same reason that he would never use the Whittemores’ purchase price as a comparable for other properties; because it was an aggressive price that could not be justified in the market. He explained that he had previously appraised 7 Manatuck Avenue in June 2007, before it was sold, for $4.4 million. Furthermore, the house at 7 Manatuck Avenue was completely rebuilt in September 2009 at a cost of $1.2 million, which, McAndrew testified, created a great deal of speculation about how much value was added by the improvements and reduced its usefulness as a comparable sale.', '-6-', 'There were also three neighboring properties that had not been sold in the relevant time frame, and so McAndrew did not consider them as comparable sales. These properties were: (1) 15 Ocean View Highway, located just two houses away from 5 Manatuck Avenue; (2) 17 Ocean View Highway, immediately adjacent to plaintiffs’ property and the property from which 5 Manatuck Avenue was subdivided in 2002; and (3) 8 Manatuck Avenue, located across the street. He noted that the assessment in each of those properties had been reduced in 2009 from its 2006 assessed values. 5 McAndrew believed the reductions resulted both from a reflection of the market downturn and because no improvements were made to the premises during that time. When asked how a review of those three properties affected his opinion of the value of 5 Manatuck Avenue, McAndrew testified, “[it] would tell you, as it’s the charge of the assessor to be equitable, that using these neighboring properties, if the trend is down, then * * * the Whittemores’ assessment * * * likely should have come down.” McAndrew further testified that the increase in the assessed value in 2009 was solely attributed to the sale price because it was not attributed to any improvements after the purchase and was, therefore, “actually unprecedented anywhere.”', 'Stephen Ferreira’s Testimony', 'Stephen Ferreira testified for defendant as an expert in mass appraisals and about his direct involvement in the 2009 townwide appraisal. Ferreira explained that the result of a mass appraisal was primarily derived from sales analysis; however, many other factors go into the ultimate assessment. Mass appraisals, he said, are unique because the process is designed to determine market value of all the property in a town using a consistent, standardized method in 5', '15 Ocean View Highway was assessed in 2006 at $6,398,000 and reassessed in 2009 at $5,893,000. 17 Ocean View Highway was reduced in value between 2006 and 2009, from $5,336,200 to $4,920,900. 8 Manatuck Avenue was a large oceanfront lot with unobstructed views of the ocean and was assessed in 2006 at $8,774,500 and reduced in 2009 to $8,253,700.', '-7- an effort to establish equity across the tax base. 6 Ferreira said that he had been involved in townwide appraisals in many municipalities throughout southern Rhode Island and that he believed the Watch Hill neighborhood to be a premier location in the state.', 'Ferreira explained that the value of each property is designated by employing several factors, including the size and character of the lot, the level of development and landscaping, the views, etc. 7 The property received an adjustment of 9.99 for the character of the neighborhood because “[t]his is one of the highest neighborhoods in the Westerly program, and so that’s giving a weight of essentially ten times the base price.” The building value was similarly calculated, using several factors such as the character of its exterior walls, the type of house, number of rooms, number of stories, age, condition, and other amenities. 8', 'The process included a computer analysis of all the sales in Westerly to create a model of property values. Ferreira explained, “[t]he model is derived from the sales, and it’s done in a modeling format to ensure that whatever tables are set up can be applied across the [b]oard to the non-sale properties in a consistent way.” After statistical analyses are run on the sales, the model can identify “outliers,” either sales where someone got a very good deal or where someone paid more than it was objectively worth. Ferreira testified that outliers were not uncommon in high- 6', 'Thompson, the current tax assessor, similarly testified that the goal of mass appraisals and fee appraisals is the same, but that the town had the additional obligation to be equitable across the tax base in mass appraisals. Fee appraisals are individual appraisals conducted on behalf of a particular party such as a bank or an estate. 7', 'The subject property was specifically designated as a single-family property, with the size of the lot calculated as 44,001 units, and a particular unit price of $3.05 for the size of the lot, which Ferreira explained was the same unit price assigned to every property of that size anywhere in town. The property also received a value of 3.00 for the “C Factor,” for condition, based on the property’s views and other amenities. In comparison, the oceanfront property across the street, 8 Manatuck Avenue, received a 4.50 for the C Factor because of its superior ocean views with no possibility of obstruction. 8', 'Ferreira said that the values assigned for several factors would be multiplied together to reach a land value for 5 Manatuck Avenue of $4.8 million and a total building value of $1,082,100.', '-8- end markets because “people will buy homes and completely gut them and redo them to fit their own tastes because they have the finances and ability to do that.”', 'He confirmed that the sale of 5 Manatuck Avenue for $7.1 million was such an outlier. However, the market in 2009 was difficult to model, he said, because another characteristic of high-end markets was that when the market crashes, as it did in 2008, properties are not put up for sale at the same rate as properties that are in lower value ranges. He said that there were fewer sales in the higher price ranges because people “had the ability to hold onto properties for extended periods of time” and wait until the market recovered. To make up for the insufficient sales data, the assessors had to look at other years, such as sales that occurred in 2008.', 'Ferreira agreed with McAndrew’s assessment that the 2008 market experienced a 6 percent decline, saying, “I think that’s a reasonable number in terms of what was going on in that time period.”', 'Yet, he did not apply a 6 percent reduction to everything “because each community is complex, it has different aspects. * * * They’re all very different areas, and each one is changing differently based on the market.”', 'Charles Vacca’s Testimony', 'Vacca testified that he was responsible for fixing assessments on all of the properties in Westerly and that the town had been required to conduct “revaluations” of all properties every three years since approximately 1998. The applicable statute required full revaluations in 2000 and 2009, involving the inspection and measurement of every property, and statistical updates in 2003 and 2006. 9 9', 'Vacca testified that full revaluations differ from statistical revaluations in that he would physically visit each property, measure and characterize the physical appearance, and try to go into as many properties as possible. Statistical revaluations relied nearly entirely on modeling sales and a mathematical approach to valuation.', '-9-', 'Vacca testified that a sale is the best indication of property value and that he gives significant weight to sales data in doing assessments. Because the town does revaluations so frequently, Vacca’s office tracked sales continuously, receiving each new deed to update the office records on ownership and sales values. He testified about the importance of obtaining information about sales:', '“It’s incumbent upon an assessor’s office to be aware of what', 'transpired basically in every sale if you can possibly do that, and', 'that’s what we do. * * * [W]hen you get certain sales as we’ve', 'talked about as being maybe outliers, we take a step further to find', 'out, you know, what happened in this sale that we might be', 'missing.” Vacca agreed with McAndrew and Ferreira that a particular problem arises with sales values in the high-end market because some people were willing to spend an exorbitant amount of money to get the exact house they desire. He said that, when a sale is for a vastly greater amount than sales of neighboring properties, it would be unjust to raise neighboring assessments in response to that sale. Vacca testified that, when he met with Mr. Whittemore in April 2010, he was aware that the $7.1 million sales price was extremely high and that an assessment reflecting that sales price would be unfair, but he did not recall investigating the reasons behind the high sale price. He said that his office “recognize[d] that there was activity on Manatuck that we felt as though that the values could be substantiated.” He recalled making a slight reduction to the building portion of the assessment after meeting with Mr. Whitemore, but could not remember why he made that adjustment.', 'Vacca did not agree with McAndrew’s approach of using properties that were beyond the Watch Hill area. He said that this was problematic because those properties could not be reliably used to determine value; he said that he never had looked outside of the Westerly area to assess properties in town. To compensate for the paucity of sales in the area around the time of the', '- 10 - 2009 revaluation, Vacca said that he “looked at overall trends that took place, and we obviously looked at the two sales that we had on Manatuck, and we adjusted them.” Vacca acknowledged that the sale of 7 Manatuck Avenue was an outlier, based on the fact that it sold for $6 million, substantially more than the $4.9 million assessment, and then the purchasers spent well over $1 million to rebuild the house. When asked why he gave the property at 8 Manatuck Avenue a lower assessment in 2009 than in 2006, Vacca responded that,', '“at that point in time I had no waterfront oceanfront sales in the', 'town. * * * [I]n this business, you absolutely need sales to justify', 'your assessment. * * * You still have to defend what you do in', 'value, and we did reduce that; I did not have the sales to defend an', '$8.8 million sale.” Vacca then conceded that for each of the properties for which the town lacked comparable sales, his office reduced the assessment from 2006 by about 6 percent, based on a “general decline in the market.”', 'When asked about the two appraisals obtained by Washington Trust, Vacca said that he did not see them until after the Whittemores initiated their appeals, but that he believed those appraisals supported his assessment. Each appraisal used comparable sales from late 2007 to early 2008, but, on cross-examination, Vacca acknowledged that it was not apparent whether the appraisers made any adjustments for the market downturn by October 2008, when the Washington Trust appraisals were conducted. Vacca noted that several of the sales used in the bank appraisals were problematic. 2 Overlook Drive in Westerly was used as a comparable in both appraisals. Vacca said, “[K]nowing what I know about 2 Overlook and the sale and the circumstances of the sale, I would never have used those in any appraisal.” Vacca acknowledged that the use of that property as a comparable skewed the fair market value estimates of both appraisals upward.', '- 11 -', 'David Thompson’s Testimony', 'Finally, Thompson, the new assessor, testified as an expert in real estate appraisals. He testified that, although appraisers endeavored to obtain comparable properties with the closest sale date to the date of the appraisal, he considered the date of the sale to be less important than the location of the property. Therefore, he said, he would not have made use of the comparables used by McAndrew in appraising 5 Manatuck Avenue. He said that he did not believe there had been a downturn in the economy in early 2008, and that Mr. Whittemore’s own testimony demonstrated that there was a competitive market for high-end homes at the time that he purchased the subject property. However, he conceded that there was a real decline in the market in the fall of 2008 that continued into 2009.', 'The Trial Justice’s Decision', 'The trial justice issued a written decision in December 2013, granting judgment in favor of plaintiffs in all three appeals. In a comprehensive decision, the trial justice discussed the evidence presented in significant detail and noted “that each of the witnesses before the [c]ourt appeared to be credible, prepared, and well-spoken.” In analyzing the evidence, however, the trial justice found Vacca’s opinion as to the value of plaintiffs’ property to be “arbitrary and erroneous.”', 'She concluded that plaintiffs had sustained their burden of proving that their property was overvalued by the tax assessor.', 'Based on the evidence submitted at trial, the trial justice found that the 2008 collapse of financial markets “stifled the national and state housing markets in general and the upscale Watch Hill market in particular.” There was evidence of the decline in market values in the Watch Hill neighborhood from lowered assessments on the three homes in the immediate vicinity of the subject property. She noted that plaintiffs’ assessment actually increased by 12.2', '- 12 - percent, “[i]n stark contrast” to those neighboring properties that, at the same time, had assessments decrease by an average of 7.1 percent.', 'Nevertheless, in determining plaintiffs’ damages, the trial justice rejected the valuation offered by plaintiffs’ expert of $4.9 million because she found “McAndrew’s use of comparables outside Watch Hill [to be] questionable.” She found that several of the expert witnesses, including McAndrew, testified to the unique amenities and luxuries found in Watch Hill, and that those amenities were not adequately accounted for by his choice of comparable sales. Even though she did not accept McAndrew’s methodology, the trial justice nonetheless determined that both McAndrew and Vacca had testified credibly that the real estate market sustained a general annual decline of 6 percent. She found that “the appropriate measure of damages for this outlier is a 6% decrease from the previous assessed value.” She further noted that his conclusion was “buttressed by the average rate of decline in assessments of nearby, albeit relatively superior, properties * * *.” Therefore, the trial justice determined that the property should have been assessed at $4,945,246 on December 31, 2009, and that that value should have been carried over to the next two assessments for 2010 and 2011. 10', 'With respect to plaintiffs’ failure to timely file an account, the trial justice observed that it was undisputed that plaintiffs failed to comply with this requirement on a timely basis for any of the three tax years at issue. However, she declined to dismiss any of their petitions. For the 2009 assessment, she found that plaintiffs were not obligated to file an account because the assessed value had increased since the prior year’s assessment. She found that the tax assessor waived his objection to the appeal of the 2010 assessment because he failed to raise the untimely 10', 'She arrived at this value through the following computation: $5,260,900 – 315,654 (.06 x 5,260,900) = $4,945,246.

Finally, she determined that the tax assessor was estopped from raising that affirmative defense as to either the 2010 or 2011 petitions, because the forms provided to taxpayers claiming appeals did not conform to the statutory requirements contained in § 44-5-26(b). Specifically, the trial justice determined that the forms used by the Westerly tax assessor did not inform taxpayers of the necessity of filing a timely account and, thus, “lured the Whittemores into a false sense of security and, as a result, they failed to meet the March 15th deadline.”', 'The defendant timely appealed each of the three cases.', '2', 'Issues on Appeal', 'The defendant raises four charges of error that may be grouped for our purposes under two main issues on appeal.

Vacca was asked, “So [plaintiffs’ counsel] talked to you a little about outliers and such, and you recognized, I think, as we stated prior, that 5 Manatuck Avenue, the purchase of that property was an outlier?” To which, he responded, “Yeah.” He similarly acknowledged that the 7 Manatuck Avenue sale was an outlier because the purchasers paid 22 percent over the previously assessed value when they acquired the property before expending over $1.4 million to rebuild the existing house after the sale.', 'Most importantly, Vacca testified that he would not consider a sale price that he believed to be an outlier when assessing a neighboring property, but did not agree that it would be inappropriate to use that same outlier sale price when he assessed the property that had been sold at an excessive price.', 'Thus, Vacca’s testimony may fairly be characterized as somewhat contradictory on this issue. Vacca attempted to explain his approach to sales in the high-end market in this way:', '“Certainly in high-end real estate there’s an awful lot of emotion, I', 'have learned that over the years. * * * If somebody goes down to', '- 19 -', 'an end of a road and buys one house for $1.8 million when I don’t', 'have an assessment on that street for 550, and this is a real story,', 'there’s no reason for me to look at that one sale and include that as', 'a determining factor to say * * * that I should now raise', 'everybody’s assessment unless I know what happened in that sale.', '* * * [Y]ou’re basically doing an injustice to everybody else on the', 'street. So you have to look at a sale, you have to get a feel for', 'where value is, and you have to approach it that way.” Despite that explication, however, Vacca did use the outlier sales values for 5 Manatuck Avenue and 7 Manatuck Avenue to justify raising the assessments on each of those properties. But he said that he did not have any comparative sales that would justify the prior assessments at 8 Manatuck Avenue, 15 Ocean View Highway, or 17 Ocean View Highway. He also insisted that location was the most important factor, and that 7 Manatuck Avenue and 5 Manatuck Avenue were adjacent to each of those three properties.', 'We conclude that the trial justice was well within her discretion when she found that the sales of 7 Manatuck Avenue and 5 Manatuck Avenue were outliers and in concluding that Vacca acted arbitrarily in assessing the Whittemores’ property at $5.9 million. It is clear to us that Vacca considered both outlier sale prices when he arrived at the challenged assessment, even though he acknowledged that he did not use those sale prices to assess neighboring properties. Such a procedure was plainly arbitrary, particularly in the context of the mass appraisal revaluation that Ferreira testified was designed as a “standardized method to try to establish equity across the tax base.” The natural consequence of that arbitrary methodology was to skew the assessment upwards.', 'We hold that the trial justice was not clearly wrong when she determined that the resulting assessment was above the fair market value of the subject property.', 'Next, defendant assigns error to what he believes was the trial justice’s finding that “all appraisals made on all properties prior to 2009 were unworthy of belief.” The defendant gleans this blanket characterization from the trial justice’s decision, wherein she wrote,', '- 20 -', '“The [c]ourt infers from this testimony that prior to the Great', 'Recession, appraisers lacked objectivity in completing an appraisal', 'for a financial institution because they were provided the ‘target', 'number,’ i.e., the sale price. For these reasons, this [c]ourt entirely', 'disregards the usefulness of either of the October 2008 appraisals', 'requested by Washington Trust, as Vacca should have done as', 'well.” The plaintiffs argue that defendant’s objection relates to the weight of the evidence relied upon by the trial justice and not to any misconceived or erroneous reliance on evidence in the record. We agree. It is clear to us that defendant overlooks the trial justice’s other findings on the Washington Trust appraisals. The trial justice made the following findings:', '“The [Washington Trust] appraisals * * * relied on 7 Manatuck, as', 'well as two other Watch Hill properties that sold * * * well before', 'the market collapse in the fall of 2008. * * * One of the appraisals', 'also relied upon a pending sale that ultimately sold for a drastically', 'reduced sum than what was reported in the appraisal. * * * Vacca', 'acknowledged the inaccuracy of these appraisals, noting that to the', 'extent he relied on these appraisals, ‘they were skewed upwards.’” Based on our review of the record, we conclude that, even disregarding the trial justice’s conclusion on the objectivity of appraisals commissioned by banking institutions, there was more than sufficient evidence to support the trial justice’s rejection of the utility of those two appraisals in assessing the subject property’s value. During an extensive cross-examination, defense counsel walked Vacca through the comparable sales, asking Vacca whether the appraisers hired by the bank made important adjustments for factors such as superior views or the timing of those sales. Vacca admitted that those adjustments were not made. After he testified to each of the comparables used, when Vacca was asked directly what he believed to be the best comparable sales for 5 Manatuck Avenue, the only property he could identify was the sale of the neighboring property at 7 Manatuck Avenue.', 'Vacca’s own rejection of the', '- 21 - comparable sales used in the two Washington Trust appraisals is persuasive evidence that those appraisals were unreliable.', 'Finally, we disagree with defendant’s claim that the trial justice misconceived the evidence when she found that “the real estate market sustained a general, annual decline of 6%.” McAndrew and Ferreira testified that there had been a general decline in real estate values by approximately 6 percent; and, contrary to defendant’s assertion, both specifically testified that they believed the Watch Hill neighborhood experienced that same decline. Indeed, McAndrew testified that the decline in real estate values affected the high-end market the hardest, and that that market was the slowest to stabilize. Even if that evidence had been contradicted by other testimony, there can be no serious dispute that the trial justice is entitled to pick and choose between the testimonies of experts. Thus, she acted well within her discretion when she credited the testimony of Ferreira and McAndrew about the effect that the Great Recession had on market values in the Watch Hill neighborhood.', 'Indeed, that evidence was not contradicted.', 'Importantly, the following exchange occurred between plaintiffs’ counsel and Vacca:', '“Q: Now, when we’re talking about the assessments for', '15 Ocean View and 17 Ocean View, which also dropped in their', 'assessment during that period of time, correct me if I’m wrong, but', 'I may be getting this wrong, there was at least a paucity of sales to', 'justify carrying over the ’06 assessments over to ’09, is that a fair', 'statement?', '“A:', 'When dealing with individual properties, unless we', 'had something to really substantiate where value was, then we', 'reduced the assessment, yes.', '“Q:', 'And you reduced the assessment based upon the', 'general decline in the market, is that correct?', '“A:', 'We viewed it as a general decline, or what we', 'interpret to be a general decline.', '- 22 -', '“Q:', 'Around 6 or 7 percent?', '“A:', 'Yes, made it about 6 percent.” Thus, Vacca confirmed his belief not only that there had been a general decline in market values, but that the Watch Hill neighborhood in particular had been affected by a decline of 6 percent.', 'Therefore, we conclude that the trial justice did not misconceive the evidence presented at trial and that she acted well within her discretion to conclude that plaintiffs met their burden of proving that the tax assessor assessed the property at a value above the fair market value, overcoming the presumption that the tax assessor performed his duty properly.', 'The Trial Justice’s Methodology', 'The final issue on fair market value, therefore, is whether the evidence supported the trial justice’s determination of value. The defendant argues that the trial justice erred as a matter of law because she fashioned her own methodology—what defendant dubs “the general market trend approach”—that he claims was neither supported by the testimony of the town’s experts nor has ever been approved by this Court. Effectively, defendant argues that the only method the experts testified about during this trial was the comparable sales method; therefore, the trial justice was obligated to apply it. The plaintiffs argue that, once the trial justice determines that the tax assessor erred in his assessment, she was free to independently determine the value of the subject property, using any methodology that was supported by sufficient evidence on the record.', '“This court has held on numerous occasions that comparable sales should be used in the valuation of real estate in the event that such comparable sales are available.” Ajootian v. Hazard, 488 A.2d 413, 416 (R.I. 1985) (citing J.W.A. Realty, Inc. v. City of Cranston, 121 R.I. 374, 399 A.2d 479 (1979); Golden Gate Corp. v.

(quoting Corrado, 117 R.I. at 657, 370 A.2d at 231).', 'Each of the experts in this case testified about the paucity of useful comparable sales during the relevant time period. Further, McAndrew, Ferreira, and Vacca each testified to the unique challenges of trying to use comparative sales in the high-end estate-style housing market during an economic downturn, because those owners tended to have the financial means to hold on to property until the market improved. Furthermore, McAndrew and Vacca testified that, even when sales data was available, those sales in the high-end market tended to be less reliable in calculating fair market value because the purchasers could be driven by emotion, the prices could be the product of paying higher than market value for the perfect house, or even investing substantial money to build an entirely new house after the sale. Finally, McAndrew testified that the dramatic collapse of the housing market between 2008 and 2012 made the timing of a sale substantially more relevant to the usefulness of comparable sales.', '- 24 -', 'Relying on the evidence before her, the trial justice rejected the comparable sales data considered by each of the experts and concluded that it was an error for Vacca to use the comparable sales approach in assessing plaintiffs’ property. Vacca’s own testimony indicates that he did not believe there were any reliable comparable sales for supporting the assessments at 8 Manatuck Avenue, 15 Ocean View Highway, and 17 Ocean View Highway, and that the only sale he considered comparable for the subject property was that of 7 Manatuck Avenue. Therefore, as this Court previously concluded in a similar case, “[w]e are of the opinion that the trial justice properly deviated from the comparable sales approach because the evidence before the court, as presented by both parties, was found to be unreliable and was, therefore, ‘no longer probative.’” Sweet, 844 A.2d at 99 (quoting Corrado, 117 R.I. at 657, 370 A.2d at 231).', 'Here, unlike in Ferland Corp., 626 A.2d at 218, the trial justice benefitted from ample evidence that justified her decision to apply a 6 percent reduction to the 2008 assessment value. Each of the experts testified that a 6 percent general downturn in the market began in late 2008, and that evidence was believed to be specifically applicable to the Watch Hill neighborhood. The trial justice’s decision, then, to conclude that the property should have been assessed at $4,945,246 on December 31, 2009, was an appropriate application of reducing the 2008 assessment of $5,260,900 by 6 percent.', 'Finally, we do not agree that the trial justice simply applied an across-the-board reduction method.', 'Rather, the trial justice concluded that “Vacca’s justification in assessing nearby properties at lower amounts based on the paucity of sales should have been applied to 5 Manatuck.” When she decided that the appropriate measure of damages was to apply a 6 percent reduction to the 2006 assessment value, the trial justice was effectively applying the very method that Vacca had used himself to assess the neighboring Watch Hill properties—that the', '- 25 - comparable sales were unreliable and, therefore, “no longer probative,” Sweet, 844 A.2d at 99 (quoting Corrado, 117 R.I. at 657, 370 A.2d at 231). Thus, it was appropriate to reduce the property’s previous assessment in accordance with a market trend specific to that neighborhood. We conclude that the trial justice’s methodology was, therefore, sufficiently supported by the record, and we shall not disturb it.', 'B', 'Statutory Appeals Forms', 'Next, defendant challenges the trial justice’s refusal to dismiss plaintiffs’ petition challenging their 2011 assessment, based on plaintiffs’ failure to timely file an account, because she found that the forms provided by the town to taxpayers did not conform to statutory requirements set forth in § 44-5-26(b). 12 The defendant argues that the trial justice based her decision on one set of forms, but that she overlooked other forms, which did contain the required statutory language and, therefore, plaintiffs were cloaked with actual knowledge of the statutory requirements. The plaintiffs counter that the Legislature has mandated that all of the language in question be included on one appeal form, rather than spread throughout different forms, so taxpayers will not be surprised to discover that they have no right of access to the courts.', 'Section 44-5-26 provides that “[a]ny person aggrieved on any ground whatsoever by any assessment of taxes * * * may * * * file an appeal in the local office of tax assessment,” the local tax board of review, and ultimately, the Superior Court. The right to appeal to the Superior Court is limited, however, by §§ 44-5-15 and 44-5-16. Section 44-5-15 requires that the tax assessor must publish notices informing the public that every person liable to taxation is required 12', 'The defendant agrees that the petitions challenging the 2009 and 2010 assessments should not have been dismissed, and so only challenges the trial justice’s decision not to dismiss the petition concerning the 2011 assessment.', '- 26 - to file with the assessors “a true and exact account of all the ratable estate owned or possessed by that person or body * * *.” The provision further prescribes the following:', '“If any person * * * liable to taxation files with the assessors, on or', 'before January 31 next following the date of assessment, a written', 'notice of that person’s * * * intention to bring in an account, the', 'person * * * may bring in to the assessors the account at any time', 'between March 1 and March 15 next following the date of', 'assessment. * * * In case any person * * * fails to file any', 'intention, that person * * * is deemed to have waived that person’s', 'or that body’s right to file the account.” Id.

Although most prior cases addressing mandatory versus directory statutory language interpret time limitations, rather than content of notices, we have held on multiple occasions that apparently mandatory language is not necessarily mandatory where the language is directed at public officers or where the legislature does not provide a sanction for the failure to meet that requirement, so long as substantial rights of the parties are not prejudiced.

Mouradjian testified that the pond was typically not filled “until such time as we were able to fully staff the * * * swim area and invite the public to swim at the pond * * *.” Mouradjian stated that he thought the decision to fill the pond was untimely “[b]ecause the things normally done to prepare the pond to be open to the public had not been done * * *.” He testified that he had spoken to Sullivan and recommended that the pond be drained or left empty until DEM “beg[a]n to acquire the resources necessary.”', 'The DEM Chief of the Rhode Island Division of Parks and Recreation, Robert Paquette, and the Deputy Chief, John Faltus, also testified at trial. Paquette confirmed that Mouradjian 2', 'Sullivan had explained that, in February 2008, World War II Veterans Memorial Park had been “slated for closure” in the budget presented to the Legislature that year. However, at the end of June, after local officials expressed concern, he made the decision as the Director of DEM to fill the pond.', '-3- was hesitant to open the pond and that Mouradjian told him that “we should really look into this.” However, Paquette testified that “[Sullivan] was ordering [him] to open up the facility.” Paquette also testified that he had never been told that “there was ever a problem with shallow water [along the wall of the pond].” Faltus testified that he was never “officially informed” that people were diving at the pond, but he had “heard hearsay that there’s possible diving activity after hours.” Faltus stated that generally they did not “allow diving at any [state] swimming areas.” However, he also admitted that “[p]eople [were] allowed to possibly do some shallow entry dives,” explaining that whether diving was allowed “[d]epends on how you define ‘dive.’”', 'William Mitchell Jr., the Regional Park Manager for DEM in 2008, testified that there was no “system that was in place to warn people of the depth of the water.” However, he stated that “if a patron * * * ask[ed] an employee * * * they would advise them as to the depth of the water, [and] if they asked about diving, [they] would tell them the rules and regulations * * *.” Mitchell agreed that Roy’s injury was “[g]enerally” the type of thing that he could foresee and he was concerned that it was the kind of injury that would happen when he was told to fill the pond before lifeguards had been hired.', 'Peter Lambert, a DEM caretaker supervisor who was employed at World War II Veterans Memorial Park from 1990 to 2008, testified at trial extensively about the physical characteristics and operation of the park and pond. He explained that, as the caretaker supervisor, he was the “acting park manager,” testifying that he “handled pretty much everything that had to do with the park itself: scheduling the staff, supervising the lifeguards, interviewing park rangers, interviewing seasonal people, assigning various work to people.” Essentially he either directly worked on or helped supervise everything that needed to be done at the park.', '-4-', 'Lambert described the park as “16 acres * * * in the center of * * * Woonsocket [with] a man made [sic] pond, * * * two tennis courts, a playground area, horseshoe pits, * * * [an] Olympic pool area, * * * and the beach area * * *.” Lambert described the water depth near the wall where the Olympic pool met the beach area as being “pretty consistent over the years.” He testified that, when the pond was drained, he would try to “smooth the bottom” of it. Lambert explained that the pond “wouldn’t be perfectly level like a pool,” but testified that he “would try to eliminate any erosion, any heels, any high spots.” He testified that he was unable to do “any preparatory work to the bottom” of the pond in 2008 because he had been “informed that the park was closing and the beach wouldn’t be opened that year, and [his] job was being eliminated.” However, Lambert also explained that he did not rake the pond every year because “there were years when there was very little shifting on the bottom.” Subsequently, Lambert testified about the diving policies at the pond. He stated that diving had “never [been] allowed.” However, he admitted to seeing “people periodically dive * * * off of [the] wall on the pool area, [but] not during hours that [the pond was] in operation.”', 'B', 'The Events of July 10, 2008', 'Kenneth Henderson, a seasonal laborer for DEM who worked as a groundskeeper at the park in 2008, testified at trial that he was working on July 10, 2008. Henderson stated that he saw “about half a dozen” people swimming in the pond that day but did not tell them that swimming was prohibited because, in his words, “[he] had no authority.”', 'Laura Oliver and Carol Gear had also been at the park on July 10, 2008, and testified at trial. Oliver testified that on July 10 there were no lifeguards, lifeguard chairs, or buoy lines in the pond, and the fountain was off. Oliver said that she allowed her children to go swimming', '-5- despite the “no swimming” signs “because there [had been] a write-up in the paper, and nobody told [them] different[ly].” She added that there were often “no swimming” signs in place, even when lifeguards were present and watching the swimmers. However, Oliver testified that a DEM employee, who she later learned was a groundskeeper, had told her children not to jump in the water. Oliver explained that she saw people jumping and “do[ing] all kinds of stuff” off the diving platform on July 10. However, she knew from experience that diving was not allowed in the pond because in previous years if someone dove into the water, then “lifeguards would be on top of it. If they kept doing it, [the lifeguards] would tell them they had to leave.” She added that she never saw anyone get hurt while diving prior to July 10. Oliver described Roy’s dive as “a belly flop kind of dive; not a complete dive.”', 'Gear testified that she had been to the pond to swim “[t]hree times” before July 10, 2008, and had seen people dive, but had never seen anyone injured from diving before Roy suffered his injury.', 'Gear described Roy’s actions that she witnessed on July 10, stating: “He threw something on the ground, and [ran], like you run when you bowl, and then he just dove in.” She labeled Roy’s dive as a “[r]egular kind of dive.” She clarified that she would call it “a shallow dive.” She explained that “[i]t was more like he * * * just * * * put his head down and kind of went in. It wasn’t like a real dive like on a diving board.”', 'Hope Braybon, who accompanied Roy to the pond on July 10, also testified to the events of the day. Braybon stated that she watched Roy “jog” from the car in the parking lot and “d[i]ve in.” She testified that, as Roy was diving, she “was telling him not to dive over there * * * because it was shallow water.”', 'Roy was unable to testify at trial but his deposition was read into the record. Roy was six feet tall and twenty-nine years old at the time of the incident. Roy testified that on July 10 he', '-6- had dropped Braybon, her daughter, and his children at the park and “they * * * walked towards the beach.” He recalled seeing “20 to 30 people, small children, adults, adolescent children in the middle of the pond” swimming, which indicated to him that the park was open. He testified that he “never saw a sign that said ‘[n]o [s]wimming.’” Roy further testified that, when he arrived at the park, he “walked over towards the corner [of the pond], * * * [a]nd * * * wasn’t going to jump in,” but, he described the day as “hot, * * * very hot. So, [he] figured * * * [he would] jump in.” He stated that he looked at the water and “[i]t looked deep enough.” He described the water as “murky” and said that he “definitely couldn’t see the bottom.” He explained that “if the water was too shallow, [he would] be able to see it.” Before jumping in, Roy returned to his car to put his things away and then he “walked down to the end[,] * * * dove in the water[,] and [he] broke [his] neck.” Roy described his dive as a “shallow dive, just like a normal, flat dive,” meaning, “the only parts that [he] would want to hit the water would be the * * * tops of [his] hand and [his] belly.” Roy testified that around July 2007 he dove in the same spot, and “[n]othing was ever said to [him].” Roy admitted that he knew there was soil erosion in the pond, and, consequently, that soil had been added to the pond in the past. Roy stated that “the way that [he] check[ed] the depth of the water * * * was probably irresponsible * * *.”', 'C', 'The Jury Verdict and Posttrial Motions', 'After the close of evidence, both parties filed motions for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, and the trial justice denied both motions. Subsequently, the jury was charged on May 25, 2011. During the course of deliberations, the jury exchanged over fifty notes with the trial justice. On the morning of the third day of deliberations, the trial justice addressed the jury and asked the jurors to keep', '-7- deliberating because she was “really confident that the eight [jurors were] going to be able to * * * reach a decision that is fair and just for everyone.”', 'On the fourth day of deliberations, the jury asked the court to “clarify if [six] jurors are for one party and [two] jurors are for another[,] [d]o the questions have to be answered in favor of the way the six jurors feel and the [other two jurors would] not be able to express their own feelings[?]” The trial justice responded that she was “not exactly sure what [they] [were] asking but the jury’s verdict must be unanimous with all [eight] [jurors] agreeing.” Later that day, the trial justice held a chambers conference at which she suggested to counsel that, in light of the jury’s note, the jury might be split six to two.', 'During the fifth day of deliberations, the jury asked the trial justice to reinstruct them that they needed to follow the instructions of law and not their emotions.', 'After a series of conferences with juror No. 109 and the jury foreperson, individually, the trial justice excused juror No. 109. At approximately 3:50 p.m. that day, the jury sent a note to the trial justice that it could not come to a unanimous agreement. Approximately ten minutes later the trial justice responded: “Is there anything we can do to assist you?” The jury responded that “nothing else will make a difference” and indicated a six-to-one split. Thereafter, the trial justice released the jurors for the day and asked counsel to think of options and to determine from their respective clients whether they would accept a split verdict.', 'The following day—day six of deliberations—both parties agreed to accept a six-to-one split decision if the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict. The parties expressed that they “understood at the time that the jury would be sent to deliberate” and that if the jury “inform[ed] the [c]ourt that it could not reach a unanimous verdict, [the trial justice] would then disclose [to the jury] that the parties [had] agreed to accept a [six] to [one] split decision * * *.”', '-8- Subsequently, the jury exchanged additional notes with the trial justice and returned for additional instructions on the Recreational Use Statute and the issue of liability, included as questions 1 and 2 on the verdict form. Thereafter, the jury indicated that it had reached a verdict.', 'The jury reached a unanimous verdict and found that the state had not “willfully or maliciously failed to guard or warn against a dangerous condition, use, structure or activity at the pond * * *” and therefore was not liable under question 1. However, the jury found that the state was liable under question 2 for “willfully or maliciously fail[ing] to guard against a non-obvious, latent dangerous condition, knowing that there existed a strong likelihood that a user of the swimming pond would suffer serious injury or death[.]” The jury rejected the assumption-of-the- risk defense and found that both parties were negligent and assigned a 50/50 split with “zero” damages. The trial justice then called counsel to sidebar where plaintiffs argued that the jurors were not following the instructions because they found in favor of them but awarded no damages; the state disagreed. The trial justice instructed the jury that they were required to award damages. At that time, the state moved for a mistrial “based on the inconsistencies of the answers to the questions on the verdict sheet”; plaintiffs objected, and the trial justice denied the motion. The jury then sent a note explaining that they had “reached a unanimous verdict [because] no money was awarded.” They explained that if they had to award damages, “part of [the] jury [would] have one answer [and] part [would] have another. In other words, [they would] have to begin again.” The trial justice clarified with the jury that they were “referring to the [six-to-one] split/vote” and then released the jury for the day.', 'After the jury was sent home, the trial justice held a chambers conference with counsel. The parties discussed four potential options to consider: (1) a mistrial; (2) accept a six-to-one verdict; (3) accept half of the verdict; or (4) allow the verdict to stand. On the seventh day of', '-9- deliberations, plaintiffs made a motion for additur or, in the alternative, for a new trial on the issue of damages. The trial justice denied plaintiffs’ motion and offered the parties a choice of accepting a split verdict or a mistrial. Both parties agreed to accept a six-to-one split verdict. The trial justice notified the jury that the parties would accept a six-to-one verdict. The jury returned the verdict and answered “no” to questions 1 and 2—finding no liability on behalf of the state, and judgment entered.', 'Following the jury verdict, both parties made renewed motions for judgment as a matter of law. In support of its motion, the state argued that plaintiffs failed to establish the state’s liability under the Recreational Use Statute and that, as a matter of law, Roy’s conduct was so “highly dangerous” that “no duty was owed to him.” The plaintiffs argued that the state’s witnesses admitted sufficient facts at trial to establish the state’s liability as a matter of law under the Recreational Use Statute. Additionally, plaintiffs moved for a new trial on damages, or, in the alternative, a new trial on all the issues. The trial justice issued a written decision on March 26, 2013, denying both parties’ motions for judgment as a matter of law, and granting plaintiffs’ motion for a new trial on all the issues. The state timely appealed this decision, and plaintiffs filed a cross-appeal.', 'II', 'Parties’ Arguments on Appeal', 'On appeal, the state argues that the trial justice erred in refusing to apply the decisions in Banks v. Bowen’s Landing Corp., 522 A.2d 1222 (R.I. 1987) and Bucki v. Hawkins, 914 A.2d 491 (R.I. 2007), which, the state contends, “stand for the proposition that the [s]tate owed no duty to Roy to protect him from an open and obvious natural condition * * *.” The state maintains that, “under the proper application of the Recreational Use Statute, the evidence fails', '- 10 - to establish that the state willfully and/or maliciously failed to warn against a dangerous condition.” The state also argues that “Roy assumed the risk of injury by diving into murky water without first checking its depth” and that plaintiffs failed to prove the element of causation. Furthermore, the state contends that it is shielded from liability under the theory of discretionary immunity. The state also asserts that “the trial justice misconstrued material evidence and committed significant errors of law in granting plaintiffs’ motion for a new trial.” However, the state adds, if the matter is remanded for a new trial, “the statutory cap on damages should apply.”', 'In response, plaintiffs argue that the trial justice properly granted their motion for a new trial. The plaintiffs aver that they proved liability under the Recreational Use Statute and that the “open and obvious danger” rule articulated in Bucki, 914 A.2d at 496, is inapplicable here due to distinguishable facts. The plaintiffs maintain that Roy could not have “assumed the risk” under these facts as a matter of law and that plaintiffs proved proximate causation. Furthermore, plaintiffs contend that the trial justice and two motion justices properly applied the law and limited the state’s defenses with respect to governmental immunity and the damages cap. On cross-appeal, plaintiffs argue that the trial justice incorrectly denied their motions for additur, a new trial on the issue of damages only, and judgment as a matter of law. Additionally, plaintiffs argue that a new trial was warranted based on other legal errors made by the trial justice and that the second jury verdict was “the result of bias, prejudice, or passion.”', 'Because we conclude that the state owed no duty to Roy, we shall address only the state’s renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law.', '- 11 -', 'III', 'Judgment as a Matter of Law', 'A', 'Standard of Review', '“In reviewing a trial justice’s decision on a motion for judgment as a matter of law, this Court is bound to follow the same rules and legal standards as govern the trial justice.” Hough v.

Alessi, 890 A.2d 463, 467 (R.I. 2006)). “The trial justice, and consequently this Court, must examine ‘the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, without weighing the evidence or evaluating the credibility of witnesses, and draw[] from the record all reasonable inferences that support the position of the nonmoving party.’” Id. (quoting Perry, 890 A.2d at 467). Thus, a trial justice should enter judgment as a matter of law “when the evidence permits only one legitimate conclusion in regard to the outcome.” Id. (quoting Long v. Atlantic PBS, Inc., 681 A.2d 249, 252 (R.I. 1996)).', 'B', 'Discussion', 'The Rhode Island Recreational Use Statute, G.L. 1956 chapter 6 of title 32, limits the liability of landowners, declaring that one', '“who either directly or indirectly invites or permits without charge', 'any person to use that property for recreational purposes does not', 'thereby:', '“(1) Extend any assurance that the premises are safe for any', 'purpose;', '“(2) Confer upon that person the legal status of an invitee or', 'licensee to whom a duty of care is owed; nor', '- 12 -', '“(3) Assume responsibility for or incur liability for any injury', 'to any person or property caused by an act of omission of that', 'person.” Section 32-6-3. The purpose of this statute “is to encourage owners of land to make land and water areas available to the public for recreational purposes by limiting their liability to persons entering thereon for those purposes.” Section 32-6-1. In order to achieve this, “the [Recreational Use Statute] modifies the common law by treating users of public and private recreational properties as trespassers, thus greatly reducing the duty of care that owners owe to recreational users.” Symonds v. City of Pawtucket, 126 A.3d 421, 424 (R.I. 2015). As we have noted, “it is clear from the unambiguous language of the 1996 amendment [to the Recreational Use Statute] that the [L]egislature intended to include the state and municipalities among owners entitled to immunity under the statute.” Id. (quoting Pereira v. Fitzgerald, 21 A.3d 369, 373 (R.I. 2011)). 3', 'Although the Recreational Use Statute limits liability, this limitation is not absolute.

This Court specifically noted that this was “not * * * a case in which a visitor came too close to the edge of a cliff and fell off, as tragic as that would be.” Id. at 1049. Rather, “the events leading to [the plaintiff’s] tragic injury were caused by latent defects in the structure of the Cliff Walk that [were] not obvious to the occasional visitor.” Id. This Court explained that “the record before [it was] replete with evidence demonstrating that * * * the city knew that the forces of natural erosion were taking a toll on the Cliff Walk.” Id. at 1050. Thus, this Court concluded that “because of the multiple incidents of death and grievous injury * * * the city [could] not successfully defend [the plaintiff’s] claim based on an assertion that it had no specific knowledge of [the plaintiff] or any peril confronting him.” Id. at 1051. Consequently, this Court held that “the immunity provided by the [Recreational Use Statute] [was] not available to defendant City of Newport, in the context of the Cliff Walk” because a “fact-finder reasonably could find that * * * the city voluntarily and intentionally failed to guard against the dangerous condition,', '- 14 - knowing that there existed a strong likelihood that a visitor to the Cliff Walk would suffer serious injury or death.” Id. at 1052, 1053.', 'The plaintiffs argue that this case is comparable to Berman because the “record is replete with evidence of DEM’s admitted knowledge of numerous unique dangerous conditions, including shallow water in areas where users had been known to dive from the park’s structures, and the historic presence of the sandbar in the same (normally deeper) area.” The plaintiffs maintain that the “shallow water and dangers of diving at this particular facility were not obvious to users * * * yet were in fact known to DEM.”', 'In the case at bar, although the state admitted knowledge of the unique features of the pond, Roy also admitted that he was aware of the danger of making a dive into shallow water and that “the way that [he] check[ed] the depth of the water * * * was probably irresponsible * * *.” He confirmed that he knew the soil in the pond was eroding and, consequently, that soil was added to the pond. We would note that, examining the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs as we must, the actions of the defendants are a far cry from the egregious conduct attributed to the City of Newport in Berman. There, we held that “[i]t is because of the multiple incidents of death and grievous injury that we conclude that the city may not successfully defend this claim based on an assertion that it had no specific knowledge of [the plaintiff] or any peril confronting him.” Berman, 991 A.2d at 1051. Here, there is only one indication in the record of a relatively minor injury reported several days before Roy’s catastrophic injuries. Therefore, we are of the opinion that, under these circumstances, this case is distinguishable from Berman.', 'There is no evidence to support a finding that the state “willful[ly] or malicious[ly] fail[ed] to guard or warn against a dangerous condition, use,', '- 15 - structure, or activity after discovering [a] user’s peril * * *.” See § 32-6-5(a)(1). Thus, the state’s motion for judgment as a matter of law should have been granted.', 'Moreover, even if the Recreational Use Statute did not apply, this Court has held that the danger of diving in and of itself is an “open and obvious” danger, Bucki, 914 A.2d at 496, one of “common knowledge,” Banks, 522 A.2d at 1225, such that a landowner does not owe a duty of care to warn individuals who enter the premises. In Banks, 522 A.2d at 1224, the plaintiff filed a negligence claim for injuries he suffered after diving off a railing on the defendant’s property into the Newport Harbor. This Court held that the defendants had not owed any duty of care to the plaintiff in that case in part because “requiring citizens to place warnings against[—]and barriers preventing persons from[—]diving into shallow water would provide little disincentive to individuals * * *. As a practical matter, the danger of diving into shallow water is one of common knowledge, and one [the plaintiff] admit[ted] he was aware of.” Id. at 1225. Similarly, in Bucki, 914 A.2d at 493, the plaintiff filed a negligence claim for injuries he sustained after diving into a lake while he was a guest at one defendant’s waterfront property. This Court concluded that the plaintiff’s harm was foreseeable but again held that the defendants did not have a duty to warn of the dangers of diving. Id. at 496-97. This Court stated that:', '“It is only reasonable for a diver, who cannot ascertain the water’s', 'depth by looking, to further inspect the area before diving into dark', 'water. The danger of diving into shallow water was open and', 'obvious to a twenty-four-year-old man, regardless of whether a', 'sign was erected alerting him to the danger.” Id. at 496. Thus, this Court held that “as a matter of law, [the] plaintiff must be held to have had knowledge and an appreciation of this risk [because][,] [u]ltimately, it was [the] plaintiff’s own behavior that caused his injuries.” Id.', '- 16 -', 'We also note that other courts have reached similar conclusions. For example, the Maryland Court of Appeals commented that:', '“Bodies of water like the stream involved in this case have', 'historically and consistently been afforded distinctive treatment in', 'the law relating to landowners’ liability. The necessity, or at least', 'desirability, of maintaining such bodies of water, coupled with', 'known inherent dangers and the difficulty of effectively protecting', 'against those dangers, have led courts across the country to', 'pronounce water an ‘open and obvious danger,’ for which no', 'warning or special precaution is ordinarily needed.” Casper v.', 'Charles F. Smith & Son, Inc., 560 A.2d 1130, 1134-35 (Md. 1989). In a case affirming the grant of summary judgment in favor of the Chicago Park District against swimmers who were injured when they dove into Lake Michigan from concrete seawalls, Bucheleres v. Chicago Park District, 665 N.E.2d 826, 827, 828, 839 (Ill. 1996), the Illinois Supreme Court pronounced:', '“In cases involving obvious and common conditions, such as fire,', 'height, and bodies of water, the law generally assumes that persons', 'who encounter these conditions will take care to avoid any danger', 'inherent in such condition.

The Illinois Supreme Court further reasoned that “bodies of water are ordinarily considered to be open and obvious conditions and thereby carry their own warning of possible danger.” Id. at 835. This is clearly the position adopted by this Court in Bucki, 914 A.2d at 497, where this Court stated that “[w]e are of the opinion that in this case [the] defendant did not owe [the] plaintiff a duty of care, but, rather, that [the] plaintiff voluntarily exposed himself to the perils of an open and obvious danger.” Because it is our considered opinion that the state bore no liability for Roy’s injuries—either because diving is an open and obvious danger or because it was protected', '- 17 - under the Recreational Use Statute—we conclude that the trial justice erroneously denied its motion for judgment as a matter of law.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court and remand the case with instructions to enter judgment in favor of the state.

15,: v. : City of East Providence et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. This Court granted a petition for writ of certiorari filed by the City of East Providence and the East Providence Zoning Board of Review (zoning board) (collectively, the city) seeking review of a judgment of the Superior Court. The zoning board had affirmed a notice of violation issued by the East Providence zoning officer finding several violations of a use variance that had been granted in 1998 to the owner and operator of a facility known as Pond View Recycling (Pond View). Kenlin Properties, LLC (Kenlin) and TLA-Providence, LLC (TLA), as the owner and operator of Pond View, appealed to the Superior Court from the zoning board’s decision upholding the notice of violation. 1 A trial justice of the Superior Court reversed the zoning board, concluding that the zoning board’s decision was clearly erroneous and made upon unlawful procedure. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we quash the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'At the time the appeal from the zoning board’s decision was filed in the Superior Court, Kenlin was the owner of the property and TLA was the operator of the business. However, TLA entered into receivership in March 2012.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'The property at issue in this appeal is located at One Dexter Road in East Providence (the property) and at present is owned by Kenlin. At the time of the notice of violation, the property was operated as a construction and demolition (C&D) debris processing facility known as Pond View.', 'When the application for a use variance was originally filed in January 1998, Pond View was registered with the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) as a processing facility. The then owner and the proposed lessee of the property applied to the zoning board for a use variance to operate Pond View as a facility for “primarily the recycling of natural and processed wood materials into mulch products.” The application described the property as covering 15.614 acres containing three buildings: a 67,578-square-foot brick and block industrial warehouse, a 24,583-square-foot metal warehouse, and a 24,990-square-foot metal warehouse. The list of “proposed construction and uses” requested permission to “allow incidental metal separation as an accessory use.” The application sought a variance under which “[l]imited metal reclamation [would be] permitted, if it [was] carried on in an enclosed building,” and other special conditions “which would permit immediate [outside] operation of the wood recycling operation” for eighteen months, at which time “an enclosure designed specifically for the C&D and wood processing or recycling machine” would have been built.', 'Prior to voting on the application, members of the zoning board questioned Kenneth Foley, the proposed lessee of the property, regarding the storage of product, an enclosure for the grinder, and a sound-absorbing berm. Foley responded that there would be an open-ended building that “looks like a greenhouse,” and an earth berm to absorb the sound, plus a tree buffer', '-2- zone at the property line. The zoning board unanimously granted the application but imposed four conditions on the use variance: (1) limiting the grinding of materials to 150 tons per day; (2) restricting the grinding hours from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. daily Monday through Friday and 8 a.m. to noon on Saturday; (3) constructing a berm before grinding operations commence; and (4) completing the grinder enclosure within eighteen months.', 'In February 2003, DEM granted Pond View a license, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 23-18.9- 8(a)(1), 2 to increase the processing capacity to 500 3 tons per day. In 2005, the city sought both a declaratory judgment declaring that Pond View was violating its use variance by receiving more than 150 tons per day of C&D debris and an injunction precluding Pond View from operating its facility. A justice of the Superior Court issued a declaratory ruling holding that: the original use variance remained “valid and intact,” that the “principal regulatory authority” was the state, that “only those zoning regulations that [did] not inhibit the state regulatory scheme [could] be utilized,” and that the city was not prohibited from pursuing “any putative violation of a local zoning ordinance” through normal administrative procedures.', 'Subsequently, on May 27, 2011 the city zoning officer issued a notice of violation to Pond View alleging violations of the use variance granted in 1998. The zoning officer reviewed Pond View’s 1998 variance application and site plan, the transcripts from the 1998 hearings, and the 2011 DEM-approved site plan. After reviewing the documents, the zoning officer found that it was “abundantly clear that the approved ‘open storage’ area was constrained to the pad illustrated on the site plan submitted in conjunction with the ‘[a]pproved [v]ariance,’” and that 2', 'General Laws 1956 § 23-18.9-8(a)(1) states in pertinent part that “[n]o person shall operate any solid waste management facility or construction and demolition (C&D) debris processing facility or expand an existing facility unless a license is obtained from the director except as authorized by § 23-18.9-8.” 3', 'On May 2, 2011, DEM granted Pond View a 1,500-tons-per-day license.', '-3- “[t]he present/proposed operation [had] well exceeded the ‘approved’ pad-site.” The zoning officer further found that it was “abundantly clear that the ‘[a]pproved [v]ariance’ was limited to 150-tons, and not simply the grinding of 150-tons [because] ‘Pond [V]iew’ repeatedly testified as to the exact quantity * * *.” After further review of the hearing transcripts, the zoning officer also found that it was “abundantly clear that wood products would be the predominant material handled, and for which a variance [had been] granted.” However, the zoning officer found, wood products comprised less than half of the incoming C&D materials at Pond View. Additionally, the zoning officer stated that “Pond View has continuously argued that there is a unique distinction between the hours of operation and hours allocated to the ‘grinding’ component of the operation. However, no such distinction was offered during testimony.” The zoning officer also found that there was no longer an “earthen berm with natural vegetation atop,” which had been “a specified condition of approval [of the variance].” The zoning officer further noted that Pond View testified to having “one grinder” on the property but, in its 2011 DEM submission, it added a second machine, which the zoning officer concluded was “outside the scope of the ‘[a]pproved [v]ariance.’”', 'The zoning officer ultimately cited Pond View for: exceeding the approved open storage area; expanding beyond the 150-ton limit approved in the 1998 use variance; accepting products other than wood; operating beyond the permitted hours of operation; failing to maintain an earthen berm; and adding additional equipment to the site. In or about June 2011, Kenlin and TLA appealed the notice of violation to the zoning board.', 'The zoning board held hearings in the fall of 2011 and issued a unanimous decision on October 19, 2011, denying Kenlin and TLA’s appeal.

The trial justice noted that the zoning officer and zoning board “relied on sources outside the [variance] to construe the conditions to include items not approved in 1998.” Specifically, the trial justice determined that the variance “[did] not impose: site plan restrictions[,] open storage restrictions[,] limits on daily tonnage receipt or processing[,] limits on the types of materials that may be accepted or processed[,] limits on the [f]acility’s hours of operation[,] a requirement for an earthen berm with trees atop[,] or a limit to one machine on the [p]roperty.” The trial justice held that the zoning officer and zoning board “were without authority to revisit the prior[] [zoning] [b]oard’s work to create a violation.” The trial justice concluded that “conditions must be clearly expressed to be effective,” thus, the zoning board “erred in upholding the [notice of violation] and in finding violations with respect to the scope of the use, materials, and the [s]ite [p]lan.”', 'On the issue of collateral estoppel, the trial justice was “satisfied that the requirements for collateral estoppel [were] met” in this case because, identical to the 2006 declaratory judgment action, the city was again a party, Kenlin and TLA were in privity with Pond View, “the tonnage and material receipt issues [were] ‘identical’ * * *[,] and the prior proceeding resulted in a final judgment.”', 'Thus, the trial justice held that “[t]he 2006 [d]eclaratory [j]udgment bar[red] re[-]litigation of the grinding and concrete processing issues.” Ultimately, the trial justice held that Kenlin and TLA’s “substantial rights were prejudiced because the [d]ecision of the [z]oning [b]oard, affirming the [z]oning [o]fficer’s [n]otice of [v]iolation, was clearly facility since 2008, held a license from DEM, and had been leasing the premises from Kenlin. Thus, the trial justice determined that TLA was an aggrieved party as defined by the Zoning Enabling Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 24 of title 45.', '-6- erroneous and made upon unlawful procedure.” Thus, the trial justice granted Kenlin and TLA’s appeal, and final judgment entered on September 6, 2013.', 'Subsequently, the city filed a petition for writ of certiorari with this Court, seeking review of the Superior Court’s decision. We granted the city’s petition and issued a writ on May 5, 2014. Before us, the city argues that the trial justice erred by: (1) “substituting her judgment for that of the * * * zoning officer and zoning board in determining the scope of the [1998 use variance]; (2) “holding that the [c]ity could not consider the application, site map, and testimony at the 1998 public hearing[s] in determining the scope of the use that was granted to Pond View in the 1998 [use] variance; (3) by analyzing the conditions of the 1998 use variance instead of the scope of the 1998 use variance; and (4) “in applying collateral estoppel to preclude the zoning officer from raising the ‘tonnage’ and ‘concrete’ issues regarding Pond View’s use of the facility.”', 'II', 'Collateral Estoppel', 'A threshold issue in this case is whether the zoning officer and zoning board were precluded by the doctrine of collateral estoppel from raising the “tonnage” and “concrete” issues when considering whether Pond View violated the use variance.', 'A', 'Standard of Review', '“The determination of whether collateral estoppel should be applied presents a question of law[.]” Casco Indemnity Co. v.

Therefore, the first two requirements of', '-8- collateral estoppel are met. See Foster-Glocester Regional School Committee, 854 A.2d at 1014. The hearing justice in the earlier litigation, however, did not purport to resolve the tonnage issue, nor did he ever address the processing of materials other than wood products. 5', 'A careful review of the hearing justice’s 2006 bench decision reveals the limited nature of the court’s ruling. He began by noting that Pond View operates a “solid waste management facility in East Providence * * * where their [principal] activity seems to be the processing of wood for recycling and redistribution * * *.” This is clearly consistent with the scope of the original use variance as determined by the zoning officer and zoning board of review. The hearing justice then quoted from the transcript of the 1998 zoning board hearing at which the use variance was granted and indicated that a difference of opinion had arisen over time as to whether the 150-tons-per-day limit applied to receiving materials or to the grinding operations only. The hearing justice did not resolve this issue definitively, stating at first that “it seems as though there is not an adequate basis for [the city’s] conclusion” that the limit applied to both grinding and receipt, rather, “the focus for the variance was on the grinding.”', 'The hearing justice then set forth the respective positions of the parties. The city, as plaintiff, was seeking to enjoin further operation of the facility as well as a declaration that “the facility is currently being operated without any appropriate license from the [c]ity”—whereas, the position of the defendant, Pond View, was that it had not given up its use permit, and could continue to operate.', 'The hearing justice was careful to “limit the role of the [c]ourt * * * in terms of some global declaration about the rights and duties of the parties.” He found that the state, through DEM and the Solid Waste Management Corporation, was the principal regulatory authority, but 5', 'We shall refer to the Superior Court justice who decided the city’s complaint requesting declaratory relief as the hearing justice.', '-9- that “[did] not in any way oust the [c]ity from doing pretty much what it wishes to with its zoning ordinances.” He concluded that Pond View had not forfeited its use variance.', 'In referencing a license issued in 2003 by DEM to Pond View permitting it to process 500 tons per day, the hearing justice said: “I do not believe this [c]ourt is in a position to give any sort of go[-] ahead or declare, yes, they can start processing 500 tons next week * * *.” He reiterated that local zoning laws apply but that they may not be “employed to shut a facility down that is otherwise conforming to the strictures imposed by the [s]tate on these kinds of facilities.” He ultimately held that “only those zoning regulations that do not inhibit the state regulating scheme may be utilized.”', 'It is our opinion that neither the declaratory judgment itself nor the hearing justice’s decision resolved the issues of how much tonnage Pond View was permitted to process per day and the types of materials it was permitted to process. The hearing justice specifically stated that he would not declare how many tons it could start processing, and it is clear from his decision that he considered Pond View to be a wood-processing facility.', 'Moreover, the judgment provides that the city is “not prohibited from pursuing, through normal administrative procedures, any putative violation of a local zoning ordinance,” subject to the original variance. It is clear from the record that the hearing justice chose not to address the specific arguments on the tonnage or materials that Pond View was permitted to process at its facility.

In no case should the scope of a use variance ever exceed the relief originally requested by the property owner in his or her original application and testimony before the zoning board. See 83 Am. Jur. 2d Zoning and Planning § 812 (explaining that a variance should be strictly construed to limit relief to a minimum). To hold otherwise would allow a prohibited use to expand through an inartfully worded motion by a member of a zoning board or simply through the passage of time. We conclude, therefore, that the determination of the scope of a use variance is a question', '- 18 - of fact entrusted in the first instance to the local zoning officer and then to the zoning board, subject to appellate review by the Superior Court.', 'In this case, the original application for a use variance clearly indicated that the proposed use was “primarily the recycling of natural and processed wood materials into mulch products” and “incidental metal separation as an accessory use.” The applicants also requested special conditions that would allow them “to commence outside processing and recycling of wood, including processing of [C&D] material, immediately and do so for eighteen months after which [Pond View] would have built an enclosure * * * for the C&D and wood processing or recycling machine.”', 'Here, a review of the record reveals what appears to be a good-faith effort (we have no reason to assume otherwise) by the applicants in 1998 to address the concerns of the members of the zoning board as well as of several abutters. The applicants’ counsel, after reciting a litany of material that would not be processed at the facility, clearly emphasized that “what we’re processing is wood. The product from this processing will render wood chips. * * * This is an environmentally-friendly operation * * *.” Foley, testifying on behalf of Pond View, indicated that it had a permit from DEM to process and grind 150 tons of wood products every day.', 'Foley explained how the facility would operate. A machine would grind the wood, then a magnet would extract metal objects such as nails and door handles. These materials would be placed in a barrel and transported to a metal recycling facility. The C&D product would be received by truck, weighed to ensure that it did not exceed 150 tons per day, spot-checked, and dumped onto a pad.

He further stated that unprocessed material “will always be stored in the containers inside the building.” The processed materials, the clean wood chips, would be stored on the concrete pad up to a maximum of 100 tons. At one point, the following exchange occurred between Foley and a member of the zoning board:', '“[zoning board member]: Now, you’re only going to grind wood,', 'correct?', '“Foley: That’s correct.

16,"Tri-Town Construction Company, Inc. : v. : Commerce Park Associates 12, LLC et al. : Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty, and Robinson, JJ. OPINION Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The defendants, Commerce Park Associates 12, LLC (CPA) and Nicholas E. Cambio, appeal to this Court, arguing that the judgment of the Superior Court in favor of the plaintiff, Tri-Town Construction Company, Inc., was infected with four errors. The defendants argue that the trial justice erred when he granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff’s claims for (1) breach of a promissory note and (2) breach of a guaranty of the note. CPA also challenges (3) the trial justice’s dismissal of its counterclaim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure for payments made to the plaintiff and for various expenses it incurred. Finally, the defendants contend that the trial justice erred by (4) granting the plaintiff’s motion for attorney’s fees. Addressing these issues in order, we affirm in part and vacate in part the judgments of the Superior Court. -1- Facts and Travel The Underlying Transactions In 2004, CPA and Cambio agreed to purchase property in West Greenwich from Tri- Town in hopes of developing a 140-unit “over 55” residential condominium. The parties entered into a purchase and sale agreement pursuant to which Tri-Town conveyed the unimproved wooded lot located on the New London Turnpike to CPA, and Cambio signed a promissory note (the note), “individually, as guarantor,” for $4,500,000. 1 In August 2006, the transactions closed. CPA paid $136,000 and executed the promissory note that is at the heart of this dispute. 2 The note obligated CPA to pay the principal sum of $4,363,000 plus 7 percent annual interest to Tri-Town. Under the note, principal-only payments of $6,000 per month were to be paid until January 2007, at which time interest began to accrue in the amount of $25,316.67 per month. Despite that accrual, however, the note called for interest-only payments of $10,000 per month until the “first Homebuyer closing.” At that time, and at each closing thereafter, the payment due to Tri-Town included accrued interest and a portion of the principal. 3 However, there was no deadline set forth in the note specifying when the first “[h]omebuyer closing” was to occur. The note, which was set to mature on July 31, 2016, was secured by a mortgage on the property. The note defined default as one or more of eight events, including the “[n]onpayment of any installment of principal and/or interest due under this Note when it shall become due and payable * * *.” A late fee of 5 percent was also assessed on any overdue payment made after ten days. The defendants agreed to remain primarily liable on the “Note and Security Instrument 1 CPA also made a $10,000 deposit when the purchase and sale agreement was executed. 2 A promissory note is “[a]n unconditional written promise, signed by the maker, to pay absolutely and in any event a certain sum of money either to, or to the order of, the bearer or designated person.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1226 (10th ed. 2014). 3 An illustration of the payment schedule was attached as “Exhibit A” to the note. -2- * * * unaffected by * * * any other matter * * *.” Of particular significance to this appeal, the note provided that defendants would “pay the reasonable legal and other fees and expenses of [Tri-Town] * * * reasonably incurred connected with or incidental to * * * the collection or enforcement of an Event of Default * * *.” Finally, imbedded in the last two pages of the note, directly above the signature line, was the following language: “Whomever signs this Note, each person is fully and personally obligated to keep all of the promises made in this Note, including the promise to pay the full amount owed. Any person who is a guarantor, surety or endorser of this Note is also obligated to do these things. Any person who takes over these obligations, including the obligations of a guarantor, surety or endorser of this Note, is also obligated to keep all of the promises made in this Note. HOLDER may enforce its rights under this Note against each person individually or against all of us together. This means that any one of us may be required to pay all of the amounts owed under this Note.” Cambio signed that provision twice: once as CPA’s manager, and once individually as guarantor. The Default, the Bankruptcy Proceedings, and the Foreclosure For two years after the closing and the execution of the documents, CPA satisfied all its obligations and also invested a significant sum of money into developing the property. Those expenditures included engineering fees, legal expenses to obtain needed zoning and regulatory relief, and expenses related to developing the land for the project. According to CPA, in the midst of its efforts, the national economy collapsed and the “Great Recession” ensued. This, CPA maintained, created an environment wherein it could no longer obtain financing, because “[t]he era of easy money ended.” By September 2008, CPA had ceased making payments under the note. In early 2012, Tri-Town initiated foreclosure proceedings. After Tri-Town issued a notice to CPA of the impending foreclosure, CPA filed a petition for Bankruptcy in the United -3- States Bankruptcy Court under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Undeterred, Tri-Town sought and secured relief from the automatic stay that accompanied the bankruptcy filing. Eventually, the Bankruptcy Court dismissed the case and in April 2013, Tri-Town purchased the property at a public auction for $2,250,000. The Superior Court Proceedings In an effort to capture the difference between the $6,161,894.95 CPA owed to it and the $2,250,000 that it had paid at the auction, Tri-Town filed a two-count complaint against CPA and Cambio, seeking to secure the $3,911,894.95 deficiency. Count 1 of the complaint alleged a breach of the note against both defendants, and count 2 alleged a breach of guaranty against Cambio. In response, defendants raised several affirmative defenses, including frustration of purpose. The defendants also filed separate counterclaims: Cambio sought a declaratory judgment that the language in the note was legally insufficient to establish a binding guarantee and CPA counterclaimed for deposits, for interest paid, and for the value of the investments that it had made to the property. In due time, Tri-Town moved for summary judgment on both counts in its complaint. Regarding count 1, it argued that there was no dispute that the note was valid and binding, that the note itself defined nonpayment of any installment, that defendants had stopped making payments in accordance with the terms of the note, and that Tri-Town had provided notice of default to each defendant. With respect to count 2, Tri-Town argued that there was no dispute that Cambio had executed the note as a guarantor and that the note was legally sufficient to create a binding obligation on his part. Tri-Town also moved to dismiss CPA’s counterclaim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), and to strike both defendants’ affirmative defense of frustration of purpose and Cambio’s counterclaim pursuant to Rule 12(f). -4- The defendants objected to plaintiff’s motions. They maintained that summary judgment was inappropriate because questions of material fact existed to support their defenses; the “entire purpose” of the sale, they said, was “[t]he development of the site from a less than valuable thirty acres zoned commercial * * * to a residential site of 140 units for an ‘over 55’ age restricted condominium * * * wherein both Tri-Town and CPA 12 would profit.” Tri-Town’s foreclosure was the “last straw,” they argued, and a tacit admission by Tri-Town that the purpose of the entire transaction was frustrated. The defendants pointed to the fact that plaintiff had received twice the market value for the property and that the repayment schedule under the note hinged, in part, on homebuyer closings as evidence that plaintiff had a continuing relationship to the enterprise. Cambio also disputed the allegation that he was obligated as a guarantor. In addition to his objection to Tri-Town’s motion for summary judgment, Cambio filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on his counterclaim for a declaratory judgment. In that cross-motion, Cambio argued that he was under no duty to guarantee the note because the instrument failed to establish a legally binding secondary obligation. In support of his argument, he pointed to the fact that there was no separate writing, that there were no separate terms establishing a guaranty agreement or an obligation in the note, and that there was no recitation of consideration in the note. Tri-Town filed a reply to defendants’ objection to its motion for summary judgment that also included an objection to Cambio’s cross-motion for summary judgment. Tri-Town reiterated its position that there were no disputed material facts and that, if summary judgment was granted in its favor, Cambio’s cross-motion was moot and his counterclaim should be dismissed. Tri-Town also argued that the frustration of purpose defense did not apply because -5- CPA and Cambio’s promise to pay money under the note in no way hinged on the nonoccurrence of a recession and, therefore, frustration of purpose did not apply. There were a series of hearings conducted to dispose of the issues raised in the motions and cross-motions. At the first hearing, the trial justice heard arguments on Tri-Town’s motion for summary judgment, defendants’ objection thereto, and Cambio’s cross-motion for summary judgment. The defendants pressed their argument that the note was part of a “larger transaction” between the parties to develop the property as evidenced by the payment schedule, and that no one anticipated that construction financing would become unavailable when the sale was negotiated. At the hearing on Tri-Town’s motion for summary judgment, counsel for defendants argued: “there’s sufficient material facts that would trigger such a – a jury could find from the facts as I’m outlining them that there was, because of the doctrine of frustration of purpose, they could find just as I’m proposing that there was no – that the parties – essentially because of the impossibility due to – I don’t want to go as far as say impossibility – impracticability in the frustration of the purpose of the overall transaction, could find that there was essentially a nullification, which is essentially what it is, of the contract. They got their property back, and, you know, everybody can go home.” Although they stopped short of categorizing Tri-Town as a co-venturer, defendants maintained that, with the facts as they were, a jury could find in their favor under the doctrine of frustration of purpose. The trial justice rejected this argument without articulating a reason. With respect to his counterclaim, Cambio argued that there were three deficiencies in the note that rendered his guaranty unenforceable: the note did not set out the identity of the guarantor or what was to be guaranteed; the guaranty was not in a separate writing; and the note failed to recite any consideration. The trial justice rejected each of these arguments. He found that the consideration that ran to CPA was sufficient to bind Cambio because he was CPA’s -6- manager. He also rejected the contention that, to be effective, a guaranty must be set out in a separate writing. The trial justice granted Tri-Town’s motion for summary judgment and denied Cambio’s cross-motion. An order entered for $3,911,894.95, plus postjudgment interest at the contractual rate of 7 percent per year entered from the date Tri-Town filed its complaint. The matter of attorney’s fees and Tri-Town’s motion to dismiss CPA’s counterclaim were continued. The parties returned for argument on the remaining motions as well as on Tri-Town’s request for an entry of final judgment. CPA admitted that its counterclaim was based on the same theory as its affirmative defense; that the purpose of the contract had been “vitiated.” Despite the trial justice’s ruling on the issue in the earlier hearing, CPA nonetheless argued that it was entitled to the return of its money. Again, without articulating his reasoning, the trial justice granted Tri-Town’s motion to dismiss CPA’s counterclaim. After that, the trial justice granted defendants’ request for a continuance to review the motions regarding Tri-Town’s request for attorney’s fees. The parties appeared one last time on the pending motion. Although defendants conceded that the note provided for attorney’s fees, they challenged plaintiff’s request principally on two grounds. First, defendants contended that the fees were neither reasonable nor necessary. And second, they contended, plaintiff’s affidavit, submitted by its own attorneys, was insufficient, because an affidavit from another attorney indicating the necessity and reasonableness of the fees was required before the court could award plaintiff attorney’s fees. The plaintiff responded that it was prepared to have the hearing continued so that it could call an outside attorney to give expert testimony on the reasonableness of its fees. However, the trial justice found that to be unnecessary. He observed that the note clearly provided for attorney’s -7- fees and, after reviewing the affidavits and itemized bills, that the fees were reasonable and well documented. The trial justice awarded plaintiff $43,227.25 in attorney’s fees. Analysis A Breach of Promissory Note and Breach of Guaranty 1 Standard of Review We review a hearing justice’s grant of summary judgment de novo. See Sullo v. Greenberg, 68 A.3d 404, 406 (R.I. 2013). “Examining the case from the vantage point of the trial justice who passed on the motion for summary judgment, ‘[w]e view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and if we conclude that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law[,] we will affirm the judgment.’” Id. at 406-07 (quoting Sacco v. Cranston School Department, 53 A.3d 147, 150 (R.I. 2012). Summary judgment is “an extreme remedy, * * * [and] to avoid summary judgment the burden is on the nonmoving party to produce competent evidence that ‘prove[s] the existence of a disputed issue of material fact[.]’” Id. at 407 (quoting Mutual Development Corp. v. Ward Fisher & Co., 47 A.3d 319, 323 (R.I. 2012)). 2 Breach of Promissory Note On appeal, defendants argue that the hearing justice erred when he granted plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment on the claim of breach of promissory note because there were genuine issues of material fact about whether the purpose for which the parties contracted was frustrated when the national economy collapsed. We do not agree. -8- CPA’s sole argument in defense of its failure to pay the note is based on the legal doctrine of frustration of purpose. The main thrust behind that doctrine is to excuse a party from performing under a contract on the occurrence of an intervening or supervening condition that substantially frustrates the main purpose for which the parties entered into the contract in the first place. For the doctrine to apply, the parties, in making the contract, must have been operating under a basic assumption that the intervening or supervening event would not take place. See Restatement (Second) Contracts 2d § 265 (1981). To succeed on a theory of frustration based upon the occurrence of a supervening event, a party must show that: “(1) the contract is partially executory, (2) a supervening event occurred after the contract was made, (3) the nonoccurrence of the event was a basic assumption on which the contract was made, (4) the occurrence frustrated the parties’ principal purpose for the contract, (5) the frustration was substantial.” Iannuccillo v. Material Sand & Stone Corp., 713 A.2d 1234, 1238 (R.I. 1998). The defendants say that the “only purpose” underlying the transaction between the parties was the transformation of “the site from a less valuable highway/commercial zoned 30 acres without public water or sewer into * * * a 140 unit, age restricted condominium * * *.” To support this proposition, they cite to what they describe as the “atypical” payment terms of this particular commercial promissory note. First, defendants argue that the fact that the repayment schedule required interest-only payments until the “first [h]omebuyer closing” was conducted demonstrated Tri-Town’s continuing interest in the transaction. This, they say, is an indication of the parties’ assumption that CPA would be able to obtain the necessary zoning approvals and construction financing, and build the infrastructure and individual units. When that all happened, “[t]he parties would then begin to reap the benefit of their bargain.” Second, defendants argue that the lack of a deadline in the note as to when the first closing needed to occur—and, -9- therefore, plaintiff’s willingness to receive interest-only payment for an indefinite amount of time—demonstrated plaintiff’s ongoing participation in the project. The plaintiff counters that, rather than representing any kind of joint venture, the purpose of the “transaction was a simple sale of land,” the note evidenced the amount due and agreed payment schedule, and the guaranty secured payment. It is our opinion that frustration of purpose is inapplicable here and that, even if it were, the purpose of the contract was not so frustrated by the economic decline that occurred after the parties entered into the contract. As comment a. to § 265 of the Restatement explains: “First, the purpose that is frustrated must have been a principal purpose of that party in making the contract. It is not enough that he had in mind some specific object without which he would not have made the contract. The object must be so completely the basis of the contract that, as both parties understand, without it the transaction would make little sense. Second, the frustration must be substantial. It is not enough that the transaction has become less profitable for the affected party or even that he will sustain a loss. The frustration must be so severe that it is not fairly to be regarded as within the risks that he assumed under the contract. Third, the non-occurrence of the frustrating event must have been a basic assumption on which the contract was made.” Id. at 335. As comment a. of § 265 makes clear, for the doctrine of frustration of purpose to apply, both parties to the contract must share in the assumption that the particular purpose would not be frustrated. That means that if Tri-Town did not share defendants’ assumption that the condominium would be developed, frustration of purpose does not apply. As it turns out, there is nothing in the record to support defendants’ claim that Tri-Town entered into the sales contract on the basis that defendants would successfully turn the property into an age-restricted condominium. The fact that Tri-Town was willing to receive interest-only payments until the “first [h]omebuyer closing” or that it retained a security interest in the property does nothing to - 10 - establish that the parties were somehow co-venturers in the development of the property. Rather, this shows Tri-Town’s means of ensuring payment for the land it sold to defendants. Indeed, even if Tri-Town had shared in the assumption that the condominium would be successful, defendants’ frustration was not “substantial” as required by § 265, comment a. at 335 of the Restatement. A party’s obligation under a contract “will not be set aside merely because the performance under the contract becomes more difficult or expensive than originally anticipated.” Iannuccillo, 713 A.2d at 1239. “The ultimate inquiry * * * for the purposes of accepting or rejecting a defense of [frustration of purpose] is whether the intervening changes in circumstances were so unforeseeable that the risk of increased difficulty or expense should not be properly borne by [the nonperforming party].” Grady v. Grady, 504 A.2d 444, 447 (R.I. 1986). In turn, that risk of increased difficulty or expense must be so severe that “the purpose underlying the contract must be totally and unforeseeably destroyed.” City of Warwick v. Boeng Corp., 472 A.2d 1214, 1219 (R.I. 1984) (purpose of contract not frustrated by elimination of statutory requirement that municipal approval be sought before property could be sold). Here, the difficulty in obtaining the requisite financing certainly made the prospect of building an age- restricted condominium more expensive, but it made doing so far from impossible. Moreover, the record reveals that defendants are sophisticated parties with substantial knowledge and experience in real estate development and all the risks that it entails. Because the frustration of purpose doctrine fails to excuse defendants’ nonpayment under the promissory note, we affirm the Superior Court and uphold summary judgment for Tri-Town. - 11 - 3 Breach of Guaranty Cambio next argues that the guaranty that he signed is not enforceable because (1) it was not contained in a separate writing; (2) there were no specific terms for the guaranty; (3) the guarantor’s identity is not provided; and (4) there is no recitation of consideration. Cambio has espoused that “[g]uaranty and surety agreements should be separate and independent contracts.” That may be true, but he has not pointed us to any authority that supports his proposition that they must be contained in separate writings. Indeed, several jurisdictions and treatises support the enforceability of guaranties contained within the same contract or obligation. See, e.g., Tripps Restaurants of North Carolina, Inc. v. Showtime Enterprises, Inc., 595 S.E.2d 765, 767 (N.C. Ct. App. 2004) (“[B]oth contracts (between creditor and primary obligor and between creditor and guaranty) may be contained in the same instrument.”); Robey v. Walton Lumber Co., 135 P.2d 95, 102 (Wash. 1943) (“The fact that both [the contract and guaranty] are written on the same paper or instrument does not affect the independence or separateness of the one from the other.”); 38 Am.Jur.2d Guaranty § 34 at 984 (2010) (“The primary contract and the guaranty may be contained in the same document.”). In short, the fact that the guaranty was not in a separate writing apart from the note does not make defendant Cambio’s promise to guaranty payment unenforceable. Next, Cambio argues that the guaranty is unenforceable because it is not contained in a separate, “special writing” and does not adequately state the obligation being undertaken or identify the guarantor. For support, he cites the Statue of Frauds, G.L. 1956 § 9-1-4(4)(7), which says “[n]o action shall be brought: * * * [w]hereby to charge any person upon his or her special promise to answer for the debt, default, or miscarriage of another person * * * unless the promise - 12 - or agreement upon which the action shall be brought * * * shall be in writing, and signed by the party to be charged therewith * * *.” He argues that the use of the term “special promise” mandates that a writing be specific about the terms of a promise to act as a guarantor and that it be separately and specifically stated. We do not agree. The guaranty language contained in the note unambiguously provides that any person who is the guarantor is obligated to keep all the promises made in the instrument. It is our opinion that the language is clear and unambiguous. Cambio personally guaranteed the amount due under the note and was aware that as a guarantor he “may be required to pay all of the amounts owed under this [n]ote.” He has not directed us to any authority, persuasive or otherwise, that convinces us that a separate writing for all guaranty contracts is required. Hand in hand with Cambio’s argument that the guaranty lacks specificity is his argument that the guaranty fails to specifically identify him as guarantor because he was not mentioned in the line that said “[a]ny person who takes over these obligations, including the obligations of a guarantor, surety or endorser of this Note, is also obliged to keep all of the promises made in this Note.” This argument is facially without merit. Directly below this language was the line providing for the signature of the “Guarantor,” which Cambio admits he signed. Suffice it to say this adequately identifies Cambio as the guarantor. Cambio’s last salvo into the unenforceability of the guaranty is his argument that the guaranty contract does not recite the necessary consideration to him for assuming the secondary obligation. We have said that “consideration consists either in some right, interest, or benefit accruing to one party and some forbearance, detriment, or responsibility given, suffered, or undertaken by the other.” Hayes v. Plantations Steel Co., 438 A.2d 1091, 1094 (R.I. 1982); see also Miller v. Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Co., 111 A.3d 332, 341 (R.I. 2015) - 13 - (“Consideration is simply ‘[s]omething (such as an act, a forbearance, or a return promise) bargained for and received by a promisor from a promisee; that which motivates a person to do something.’” (quoting Black’s Law Dictionary 370 (10th ed. 2014))). Although a valid guaranty must be supported by consideration, there is no requirement that the guarantor receive a direct benefit. Indeed, this Court has held that “[w]hen a corporate officer agrees to be liable for a debt of the corporation, it is not necessary for consideration to move to the officer personally. It is enough if the corporation receives the consideration.” Katz v. Prete, 459 A.2d 81, 86 (R.I. 1983). Tri-Town’s promise to grant a loan to CPA in exchange for Cambio’s promise to guaranty repayment in the event CPA was unable to repay it was sufficient consideration. Although some guarantees are supported by separate consideration that flows directly to the guarantor, a guarantor who is also a corporate officer need not receive a separate benefit. See Katz, 459 A.2d at 86; see also Restatement (Third) Suretyship & Guaranty § 9(2)(a) at 34-35 (1996) (“A secondary obligation does not fail for lack of consideration if * * * the underlying obligation is supported by consideration and the later creation of the secondary obligation was part of the exchange for which the obligee bargained[.]”). There is nothing in the record or in our case law that supports Cambio’s argument that the guaranty is unenforceable because it fails to recite adequate consideration. For these reasons, we affirm the Superior Court’s grant of summary judgment for Tri-Town on their breach of guaranty claim. - 14 - B The Dismissal of CPA’s Counterclaim 1 Standard of Review When we review the grant of a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), we apply the same standard as the hearing justice. Woonsocket School Committee v. Chafee, 89 A.3d 778, 787 (R.I. 2014). That is, we confine ourselves to the four corners of the complaint, assume that the allegations set forth are true, and resolve any doubts in favor of the complaining party. Narragansett Electric Co. v. Minardi, 21 A.3d 274, 278 (R.I. 2011). A motion to dismiss may be granted only when it is established beyond a reasonable doubt that a party would not be entitled to relief from the defendant under any set of conceivable facts that could be proven in support of its claim. Ho-Rath v. Rhode Island Hospital, 115 A.3d 938, 942 (R.I. 2015). 2 Analysis In its counterclaim, CPA sought the return of the payments that it made to Tri-Town, including the deposit and interest it had paid and for the value of investments made to the property, under what it believed was the “frustrated contract.” Before the hearing justice and this Court, CPA admitted that its counterclaim was based on the same theory as its affirmative defense: frustration of purpose. Accepting its allegations as true, as we must, it is nevertheless our opinion that CPA cannot escape the fact that frustration of purpose—an affirmative defense against a breach of contract claim—is not a theory of liability in an affirmative cause of action. For that reason, there is no set of facts that would entitle CPA to relief. We need not dwell on - 15 - this question any further; the hearing justice correctly granted Tri-Town’s motion to dismiss CPA’s counterclaim. C Awarding of Attorney’s Fees 1 Standard of Review This Court has “staunch[ly] adhere[d] to the ‘American rule’ that requires each litigant to pay its own attorney’s fees absent statutory authority or contractual liability.” Shine v. Moreau, 119 A.3d 1, 8 (R.I. 2015) (quoting Moore v. Ballard, 914 A.2d 487, 489 (R.I. 2007)). However, if there is a contractual basis for awarding attorney’s fees, “then this Court will review a motion justice’s actual award of attorney’s fees for an abuse of discretion.” Dauray v. Mee, 109 A.3d 832, 845 (R.I. 2015) (quoting Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island v. Najarian, 911 A.2d 706, 709 (R.I. 2006)). 2 Analysis The defendants contend that the hearing justice abused his discretion by awarding attorney’s fees to plaintiff because the fees were neither reasonable nor necessary. They further argue that the affidavits submitted by Tri-Town, by its own attorneys, were insufficient because an affidavit from another attorney indicating the necessity and reasonableness of the fees was required before the court could award the fees. The defendants aver that the hearing justice erred when he awarded Tri-Town legal fees for its unsuccessful motion for prejudgment attachment as well as for several discovery requests that they argue failed to comport with discovery rules. Regarding the motion for prejudgment - 16 - attachment, defendants argue that, because a different hearing justice denied the motion, it was meritless, and, therefore, Tri-Town should not be awarded fees for prosecuting its motion. However, the fact that a motion has been denied, standing alone, is not enough to invalidate an award of legal fees. For instance, in Pearson v. Pearson, 11 A.3d 103, 105-08 (R.I. 2011), we considered a settlement agreement between former spouses that provided for reasonable attorney’s fees when one of the spouses filed for bankruptcy and the other incurred legal fees as a result. The agreement said that “[e]ither party may seek to have the bankrupt party meet and pay all costs, including reasonable attorney’s fees incurred by the non-bankrupt party in pursuing his or her rights * * *.” Id. at 105-06 (emphasis omitted). The former wife sought to hold her ex-husband in contempt after he refused to indemnify her, as required by a court order, for claims made against her by a creditor on a joint line of credit. Id. at 106-07. Although the trial justice found that the contempt motion was premature because the creditor had not yet obtained a judgment against her, the hearing justice nonetheless awarded the ex-wife attorney’s fees for bringing the motion. Pearson, 11 A.3d at 109-10. On appeal, the defendant argued that, because he was the prevailing party on the motion, the trial justice should not have granted attorney’s fees to his ex-wife. Id. at 108. We held that, because the settlement agreement did not require the party seeking the fees to be successful on the merits, the hearing justice did not abuse his discretion in awarding legal fees. Id. at 108-10. Likewise, nowhere in the note at issue here is it required that Tri-Town must prevail in its claim against defendants before it is entitled to receive attorney fees from them. The note says that the “MAKER will pay the reasonable legal and other fees and expenses of PAYEE or any HOLDER reasonably incurred connected with or incidental to (i) the negotiation, closing and administration of the loan evidenced by this Note incidental to the - 17 - collection or enforcement of an Event of Default, and (ii) the enforcement of any of the obligations of MAKER or rights of the HOLDER under this Note * * * by litigation or otherwise * * *.” The only stipulation that the note places on Tri-Town receiving attorney’s fees is that they be “reasonably incurred.” Without more, we cannot say that Tri-Town’s attempt at protecting its rights under the contract by seeking prejudgment attachment was “meritless.” 4 However, we agree with defendants that the affidavits of Tri-Town’s trial attorney do not suffice to prove the necessity and reasonableness of legal fees. In Colonial Plumbing & Heating Supply Co. v. Contemporary Construction Co., 464 A.2d 741, 744 (R.I. 1983), we held that “affidavits or expert testimony establishing the criteria on which a fee award is based should be required.” Moreover, we said that “[i]t is well settled that attorneys ‘are competent to testify as experts in determining what is a reasonable charge for legal services rendered.’” Id. (quoting Cottrell Employees Credit Union v. Pavelski, 106 R.I. 29, 35, 255 A.2d 162, 165 (1969)). What we did not say, however, was who should be providing the affidavits or expert testimony. We take this opportunity to embrace a consistent procedure on the award of attorney’s fees and hold that the affidavits or testimony, as required by Colonial Plumbing & Heating Co., must be from counsel who is a member of the Rhode Island Bar and who is not representing the parties to the action in which fees are sought. In the proceedings below, the trial justice declined Tri-Town’s offer to present expert testimony from outside counsel to establish the reasonableness and necessity of its fees. We believe this was error and that the better practice would have been to consider that testimony. Although the standard of review of an order awarding attorney’s fees is abuse of discretion, we 4 We note that our review of this award is hampered by the fact that defendants did not provide a transcript of the hearing where a different justice of the Superior Court denied Tri-Town’s motion for prejudgment attachment. - 18 - are of the opinion that this discretion can only be exercised after competent evidence from independent counsel has been admitted. The fees in this case may very well be reasonable; however, we do not accept that affidavits and documents provided to the court by interested parties should be the basis for awarding them. For instance, in Florida, “where a party seeks to have the opposing party in a lawsuit pay for attorney’s fees incurred in that same action, the general rule * * * is that independent expert testimony is required.” Sea World of Florida, Inc. v. Ace American Insurance Companies, Inc., 28 So.3d 158, 160 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2010) (citing Crittenden Orange Blossom Fruit v. Stone, 514 So.2d 351, 352-53 (Fla. 1987)). Likewise, the Vermont Supreme Court has observed that “the record is often best served on the issue of reasonableness by the receipt of expert testimony from independent counsel.” Bruntaeger v. Zeller, 515 A.2d 123, 128 (Vt. 1986) (quoting Parker, Lamb & Ankuda, P.C. v. Krupinsky, 503 A.2d 531, 534 (Vt. 1985)). Therefore, we vacate the award of attorney’s fees and remand this case to the Superior Court for it to consider the testimony or affidavit of an independent attorney regarding the reasonableness and necessity of Tri-Town’s fees. Conclusion For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm in part and vacate in part the judgment of the Superior Court. We affirm the Superior Court’s decision to grant summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff on claims of the breach of promissory note and breach of guaranty, as well as its dismissal of CPA’s counterclaim. We reverse the decision to award Tri-Town attorney’s fees without considering the testimony or affidavit of independent counsel. The papers in this case are remanded to the Superior Court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.

Commerce Park Associates 12, LLC et al. CASE NO: No. 2015-22-Appeal. No. 2015-146-Appeal. (KC 13-639) COURT: Supreme Court DATE OPINION FILED: June 22, 2016 JUSTICES: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty, Robinson, JJ. WRITTEN BY: Associate Justice Francis X. Flaherty SOURCE OF APPEAL: Kent County Superior Court JUDGE FROM LOWER COURT: Associate Justice Bennett R. Gallo ATTORNEYS ON APPEAL: For Plaintiff: Ryan J. Lutrario, Esq. Vincent A. Indeglia, Esq.",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The defendants, Commerce Park Associates 12, LLC (CPA) and Nicholas E. Cambio, appeal to this Court, arguing that the judgment of the Superior Court in favor of the plaintiff, Tri-Town Construction Company, Inc., was infected with four errors. The defendants argue that the trial justice erred when he granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff’s claims for (1) breach of a promissory note and (2) breach of a guaranty of the note. CPA also challenges (3) the trial justice’s dismissal of its counterclaim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure for payments made to the plaintiff and for various expenses it incurred. Finally, the defendants contend that the trial justice erred by (4) granting the plaintiff’s motion for attorney’s fees. Addressing these issues in order, we affirm in part and vacate in part the judgments of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'Facts and Travel', 'The Underlying Transactions', 'In 2004, CPA and Cambio agreed to purchase property in West Greenwich from Tri- Town in hopes of developing a 140-unit “over 55” residential condominium. The parties entered into a purchase and sale agreement pursuant to which Tri-Town conveyed the unimproved wooded lot located on the New London Turnpike to CPA, and Cambio signed a promissory note (the note), “individually, as guarantor,” for $4,500,000. 1', 'In August 2006, the transactions closed. CPA paid $136,000 and executed the promissory note that is at the heart of this dispute. 2 The note obligated CPA to pay the principal sum of $4,363,000 plus 7 percent annual interest to Tri-Town. Under the note, principal-only payments of $6,000 per month were to be paid until January 2007, at which time interest began to accrue in the amount of $25,316.67 per month. Despite that accrual, however, the note called for interest-only payments of $10,000 per month until the “first Homebuyer closing.” At that time, and at each closing thereafter, the payment due to Tri-Town included accrued interest and a portion of the principal. 3 However, there was no deadline set forth in the note specifying when the first “[h]omebuyer closing” was to occur. The note, which was set to mature on July 31, 2016, was secured by a mortgage on the property.', 'The note defined default as one or more of eight events, including the “[n]onpayment of any installment of principal and/or interest due under this Note when it shall become due and payable * * *.” A late fee of 5 percent was also assessed on any overdue payment made after ten days. The defendants agreed to remain primarily liable on the “Note and Security Instrument 1', 'CPA also made a $10,000 deposit when the purchase and sale agreement was executed. 2', 'A promissory note is “[a]n unconditional written promise, signed by the maker, to pay absolutely and in any event a certain sum of money either to, or to the order of, the bearer or designated person.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1226 (10th ed. 2014). 3', 'An illustration of the payment schedule was attached as “Exhibit A” to the note.', '-2- * * * unaffected by * * * any other matter * * *.” Of particular significance to this appeal, the note provided that defendants would “pay the reasonable legal and other fees and expenses of [Tri-Town] * * * reasonably incurred connected with or incidental to * * * the collection or enforcement of an Event of Default * * *.” Finally, imbedded in the last two pages of the note, directly above the signature line, was the following language:', '“Whomever signs this Note, each person is fully and', 'personally obligated to keep all of the promises made in this Note,', 'including the promise to pay the full amount owed. Any person', 'who is a guarantor, surety or endorser of this Note is also obligated', 'to do these things. Any person who takes over these obligations,', 'including the obligations of a guarantor, surety or endorser of this', 'Note, is also obligated to keep all of the promises made in this', 'Note. HOLDER may enforce its rights under this Note against', 'each person individually or against all of us together. This means', 'that any one of us may be required to pay all of the amounts owed', 'under this Note.” Cambio signed that provision twice: once as CPA’s manager, and once individually as guarantor.', 'The Default, the Bankruptcy Proceedings, and the Foreclosure', 'For two years after the closing and the execution of the documents, CPA satisfied all its obligations and also invested a significant sum of money into developing the property. Those expenditures included engineering fees, legal expenses to obtain needed zoning and regulatory relief, and expenses related to developing the land for the project. According to CPA, in the midst of its efforts, the national economy collapsed and the “Great Recession” ensued. This, CPA maintained, created an environment wherein it could no longer obtain financing, because “[t]he era of easy money ended.” By September 2008, CPA had ceased making payments under the note.', 'In early 2012, Tri-Town initiated foreclosure proceedings. After Tri-Town issued a notice to CPA of the impending foreclosure, CPA filed a petition for Bankruptcy in the United', '-3- States Bankruptcy Court under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Undeterred, Tri-Town sought and secured relief from the automatic stay that accompanied the bankruptcy filing.', 'Eventually, the Bankruptcy Court dismissed the case and in April 2013, Tri-Town purchased the property at a public auction for $2,250,000.', 'The Superior Court Proceedings', 'In an effort to capture the difference between the $6,161,894.95 CPA owed to it and the $2,250,000 that it had paid at the auction, Tri-Town filed a two-count complaint against CPA and Cambio, seeking to secure the $3,911,894.95 deficiency. Count 1 of the complaint alleged a breach of the note against both defendants, and count 2 alleged a breach of guaranty against Cambio. In response, defendants raised several affirmative defenses, including frustration of purpose.', 'The defendants also filed separate counterclaims:', 'Cambio sought a declaratory judgment that the language in the note was legally insufficient to establish a binding guarantee and CPA counterclaimed for deposits, for interest paid, and for the value of the investments that it had made to the property.', 'In due time, Tri-Town moved for summary judgment on both counts in its complaint. Regarding count 1, it argued that there was no dispute that the note was valid and binding, that the note itself defined nonpayment of any installment, that defendants had stopped making payments in accordance with the terms of the note, and that Tri-Town had provided notice of default to each defendant. With respect to count 2, Tri-Town argued that there was no dispute that Cambio had executed the note as a guarantor and that the note was legally sufficient to create a binding obligation on his part. Tri-Town also moved to dismiss CPA’s counterclaim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), and to strike both defendants’ affirmative defense of frustration of purpose and Cambio’s counterclaim pursuant to Rule 12(f).', '-4-', 'The defendants objected to plaintiff’s motions. They maintained that summary judgment was inappropriate because questions of material fact existed to support their defenses; the “entire purpose” of the sale, they said, was “[t]he development of the site from a less than valuable thirty acres zoned commercial * * * to a residential site of 140 units for an ‘over 55’ age restricted condominium * * * wherein both Tri-Town and CPA 12 would profit.” Tri-Town’s foreclosure was the “last straw,” they argued, and a tacit admission by Tri-Town that the purpose of the entire transaction was frustrated. The defendants pointed to the fact that plaintiff had received twice the market value for the property and that the repayment schedule under the note hinged, in part, on homebuyer closings as evidence that plaintiff had a continuing relationship to the enterprise. Cambio also disputed the allegation that he was obligated as a guarantor.', 'In addition to his objection to Tri-Town’s motion for summary judgment, Cambio filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on his counterclaim for a declaratory judgment. In that cross-motion, Cambio argued that he was under no duty to guarantee the note because the instrument failed to establish a legally binding secondary obligation. In support of his argument, he pointed to the fact that there was no separate writing, that there were no separate terms establishing a guaranty agreement or an obligation in the note, and that there was no recitation of consideration in the note.', 'Tri-Town filed a reply to defendants’ objection to its motion for summary judgment that also included an objection to Cambio’s cross-motion for summary judgment.', 'Tri-Town reiterated its position that there were no disputed material facts and that, if summary judgment was granted in its favor, Cambio’s cross-motion was moot and his counterclaim should be dismissed. Tri-Town also argued that the frustration of purpose defense did not apply because', '-5- CPA and Cambio’s promise to pay money under the note in no way hinged on the nonoccurrence of a recession and, therefore, frustration of purpose did not apply.', 'There were a series of hearings conducted to dispose of the issues raised in the motions and cross-motions. At the first hearing, the trial justice heard arguments on Tri-Town’s motion for summary judgment, defendants’ objection thereto, and Cambio’s cross-motion for summary judgment. The defendants pressed their argument that the note was part of a “larger transaction” between the parties to develop the property as evidenced by the payment schedule, and that no one anticipated that construction financing would become unavailable when the sale was negotiated. At the hearing on Tri-Town’s motion for summary judgment, counsel for defendants argued:', '“there’s sufficient material facts that would trigger such a – a jury', 'could find from the facts as I’m outlining them that there was,', 'because of the doctrine of frustration of purpose, they could find', 'just as I’m proposing that there was no – that the parties –', 'essentially because of the impossibility due to – I don’t want to go', 'as far as say impossibility – impracticability in the frustration of', 'the purpose of the overall transaction, could find that there was', 'essentially a nullification, which is essentially what it is, of the', 'contract. They got their property back, and, you know, everybody', 'can go home.” Although they stopped short of categorizing Tri-Town as a co-venturer, defendants maintained that, with the facts as they were, a jury could find in their favor under the doctrine of frustration of purpose. The trial justice rejected this argument without articulating a reason.', 'With respect to his counterclaim, Cambio argued that there were three deficiencies in the note that rendered his guaranty unenforceable: the note did not set out the identity of the guarantor or what was to be guaranteed; the guaranty was not in a separate writing; and the note failed to recite any consideration. The trial justice rejected each of these arguments. He found that the consideration that ran to CPA was sufficient to bind Cambio because he was CPA’s', '-6- manager. He also rejected the contention that, to be effective, a guaranty must be set out in a separate writing. The trial justice granted Tri-Town’s motion for summary judgment and denied Cambio’s cross-motion. An order entered for $3,911,894.95, plus postjudgment interest at the contractual rate of 7 percent per year entered from the date Tri-Town filed its complaint. The matter of attorney’s fees and Tri-Town’s motion to dismiss CPA’s counterclaim were continued.', 'The parties returned for argument on the remaining motions as well as on Tri-Town’s request for an entry of final judgment. CPA admitted that its counterclaim was based on the same theory as its affirmative defense; that the purpose of the contract had been “vitiated.” Despite the trial justice’s ruling on the issue in the earlier hearing, CPA nonetheless argued that it was entitled to the return of its money. Again, without articulating his reasoning, the trial justice granted Tri-Town’s motion to dismiss CPA’s counterclaim. After that, the trial justice granted defendants’ request for a continuance to review the motions regarding Tri-Town’s request for attorney’s fees.', 'The parties appeared one last time on the pending motion.', 'Although defendants conceded that the note provided for attorney’s fees, they challenged plaintiff’s request principally on two grounds. First, defendants contended that the fees were neither reasonable nor necessary. And second, they contended, plaintiff’s affidavit, submitted by its own attorneys, was insufficient, because an affidavit from another attorney indicating the necessity and reasonableness of the fees was required before the court could award plaintiff attorney’s fees. The plaintiff responded that it was prepared to have the hearing continued so that it could call an outside attorney to give expert testimony on the reasonableness of its fees. However, the trial justice found that to be unnecessary. He observed that the note clearly provided for attorney’s', '-7- fees and, after reviewing the affidavits and itemized bills, that the fees were reasonable and well documented. The trial justice awarded plaintiff $43,227.25 in attorney’s fees.', 'Analysis', 'A', 'Breach of Promissory Note and Breach of Guaranty', '1', 'Standard of Review', 'We review a hearing justice’s grant of summary judgment de novo. See Sullo v. Greenberg, 68 A.3d 404, 406 (R.I. 2013).', '“Examining the case from the vantage point of the trial justice who passed on the motion for summary judgment, ‘[w]e view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and if we conclude that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law[,] we will affirm the judgment.’” Id. at 406-07 (quoting Sacco v. Cranston School Department, 53 A.3d 147, 150 (R.I. 2012). Summary judgment is “an extreme remedy, * * * [and] to avoid summary judgment the burden is on the nonmoving party to produce competent evidence that ‘prove[s] the existence of a disputed issue of material fact[.]’” Id. at 407 (quoting Mutual Development Corp. v. Ward Fisher & Co., 47 A.3d 319, 323 (R.I. 2012)).', '2', 'Breach of Promissory Note', 'On appeal, defendants argue that the hearing justice erred when he granted plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment on the claim of breach of promissory note because there were genuine issues of material fact about whether the purpose for which the parties contracted was frustrated when the national economy collapsed. We do not agree.', '-8-', 'CPA’s sole argument in defense of its failure to pay the note is based on the legal doctrine of frustration of purpose. The main thrust behind that doctrine is to excuse a party from performing under a contract on the occurrence of an intervening or supervening condition that substantially frustrates the main purpose for which the parties entered into the contract in the first place. For the doctrine to apply, the parties, in making the contract, must have been operating under a basic assumption that the intervening or supervening event would not take place. See Restatement (Second) Contracts 2d § 265 (1981). To succeed on a theory of frustration based upon the occurrence of a supervening event, a party must show that: “(1) the contract is partially executory, (2) a supervening event occurred after the contract was made, (3) the nonoccurrence of the event was a basic assumption on which the contract was made, (4) the occurrence frustrated the parties’ principal purpose for the contract, (5) the frustration was substantial.” Iannuccillo v. Material Sand & Stone Corp., 713 A.2d 1234, 1238 (R.I. 1998).', 'The defendants say that the “only purpose” underlying the transaction between the parties was the transformation of “the site from a less valuable highway/commercial zoned 30 acres without public water or sewer into * * * a 140 unit, age restricted condominium * * *.” To support this proposition, they cite to what they describe as the “atypical” payment terms of this particular commercial promissory note. First, defendants argue that the fact that the repayment schedule required interest-only payments until the “first [h]omebuyer closing” was conducted demonstrated Tri-Town’s continuing interest in the transaction. This, they say, is an indication of the parties’ assumption that CPA would be able to obtain the necessary zoning approvals and construction financing, and build the infrastructure and individual units. When that all happened, “[t]he parties would then begin to reap the benefit of their bargain.” Second, defendants argue that the lack of a deadline in the note as to when the first closing needed to occur—and,', '-9- therefore, plaintiff’s willingness to receive interest-only payment for an indefinite amount of time—demonstrated plaintiff’s ongoing participation in the project. The plaintiff counters that, rather than representing any kind of joint venture, the purpose of the “transaction was a simple sale of land,” the note evidenced the amount due and agreed payment schedule, and the guaranty secured payment.', 'It is our opinion that frustration of purpose is inapplicable here and that, even if it were, the purpose of the contract was not so frustrated by the economic decline that occurred after the parties entered into the contract. As comment a. to § 265 of the Restatement explains:', '“First, the purpose that is frustrated must have been a principal', 'purpose of that party in making the contract. It is not enough that', 'he had in mind some specific object without which he would not', 'have made the contract. The object must be so completely the', 'basis of the contract that, as both parties understand, without it the', 'transaction would make little sense. Second, the frustration must', 'be substantial. It is not enough that the transaction has become', 'less profitable for the affected party or even that he will sustain a', 'loss. The frustration must be so severe that it is not fairly to be', 'regarded as within the risks that he assumed under the contract.', 'Third, the non-occurrence of the frustrating event must have been a', 'basic assumption on which the contract was made.” Id. at 335. As comment a. of § 265 makes clear, for the doctrine of frustration of purpose to apply, both parties to the contract must share in the assumption that the particular purpose would not be frustrated.', 'That means that if Tri-Town did not share defendants’ assumption that the condominium would be developed, frustration of purpose does not apply. As it turns out, there is nothing in the record to support defendants’ claim that Tri-Town entered into the sales contract on the basis that defendants would successfully turn the property into an age-restricted condominium. The fact that Tri-Town was willing to receive interest-only payments until the “first [h]omebuyer closing” or that it retained a security interest in the property does nothing to', '- 10 - establish that the parties were somehow co-venturers in the development of the property. Rather, this shows Tri-Town’s means of ensuring payment for the land it sold to defendants.', 'Indeed, even if Tri-Town had shared in the assumption that the condominium would be successful, defendants’ frustration was not “substantial” as required by § 265, comment a. at 335 of the Restatement. A party’s obligation under a contract “will not be set aside merely because the performance under the contract becomes more difficult or expensive than originally anticipated.” Iannuccillo, 713 A.2d at 1239. “The ultimate inquiry * * * for the purposes of accepting or rejecting a defense of [frustration of purpose] is whether the intervening changes in circumstances were so unforeseeable that the risk of increased difficulty or expense should not be properly borne by [the nonperforming party].” Grady v. Grady, 504 A.2d 444, 447 (R.I. 1986). In turn, that risk of increased difficulty or expense must be so severe that “the purpose underlying the contract must be totally and unforeseeably destroyed.” City of Warwick v. Boeng Corp., 472 A.2d 1214, 1219 (R.I. 1984) (purpose of contract not frustrated by elimination of statutory requirement that municipal approval be sought before property could be sold). Here, the difficulty in obtaining the requisite financing certainly made the prospect of building an age- restricted condominium more expensive, but it made doing so far from impossible. Moreover, the record reveals that defendants are sophisticated parties with substantial knowledge and experience in real estate development and all the risks that it entails. Because the frustration of purpose doctrine fails to excuse defendants’ nonpayment under the promissory note, we affirm the Superior Court and uphold summary judgment for Tri-Town.', '- 11 -', '3', 'Breach of Guaranty', 'Cambio next argues that the guaranty that he signed is not enforceable because (1) it was not contained in a separate writing; (2) there were no specific terms for the guaranty; (3) the guarantor’s identity is not provided; and (4) there is no recitation of consideration.', 'Cambio has espoused that “[g]uaranty and surety agreements should be separate and independent contracts.” That may be true, but he has not pointed us to any authority that supports his proposition that they must be contained in separate writings.', 'Indeed, several jurisdictions and treatises support the enforceability of guaranties contained within the same contract or obligation.', 'See, e.g., Tripps Restaurants of North Carolina, Inc. v. Showtime Enterprises, Inc., 595 S.E.2d 765, 767 (N.C. Ct. App. 2004) (“[B]oth contracts (between creditor and primary obligor and between creditor and guaranty) may be contained in the same instrument.”); Robey v. Walton Lumber Co., 135 P.2d 95, 102 (Wash. 1943) (“The fact that both [the contract and guaranty] are written on the same paper or instrument does not affect the independence or separateness of the one from the other.”); 38 Am.Jur.2d Guaranty § 34 at 984 (2010) (“The primary contract and the guaranty may be contained in the same document.”). In short, the fact that the guaranty was not in a separate writing apart from the note does not make defendant Cambio’s promise to guaranty payment unenforceable.', 'Next, Cambio argues that the guaranty is unenforceable because it is not contained in a separate, “special writing” and does not adequately state the obligation being undertaken or identify the guarantor. For support, he cites the Statue of Frauds, G.L. 1956 § 9-1-4(4)(7), which says “[n]o action shall be brought: * * * [w]hereby to charge any person upon his or her special promise to answer for the debt, default, or miscarriage of another person * * * unless the promise', '- 12 - or agreement upon which the action shall be brought * * * shall be in writing, and signed by the party to be charged therewith * * *.” He argues that the use of the term “special promise” mandates that a writing be specific about the terms of a promise to act as a guarantor and that it be separately and specifically stated. We do not agree. The guaranty language contained in the note unambiguously provides that any person who is the guarantor is obligated to keep all the promises made in the instrument. It is our opinion that the language is clear and unambiguous. Cambio personally guaranteed the amount due under the note and was aware that as a guarantor he “may be required to pay all of the amounts owed under this [n]ote.” He has not directed us to any authority, persuasive or otherwise, that convinces us that a separate writing for all guaranty contracts is required.', 'Hand in hand with Cambio’s argument that the guaranty lacks specificity is his argument that the guaranty fails to specifically identify him as guarantor because he was not mentioned in the line that said “[a]ny person who takes over these obligations, including the obligations of a guarantor, surety or endorser of this Note, is also obliged to keep all of the promises made in this Note.” This argument is facially without merit. Directly below this language was the line providing for the signature of the “Guarantor,” which Cambio admits he signed. Suffice it to say this adequately identifies Cambio as the guarantor.', 'Cambio’s last salvo into the unenforceability of the guaranty is his argument that the guaranty contract does not recite the necessary consideration to him for assuming the secondary obligation. We have said that “consideration consists either in some right, interest, or benefit accruing to one party and some forbearance, detriment, or responsibility given, suffered, or undertaken by the other.” Hayes v. Plantations Steel Co., 438 A.2d 1091, 1094 (R.I. 1982); see also Miller v. Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Co., 111 A.3d 332, 341 (R.I. 2015)', '- 13 - (“Consideration is simply ‘[s]omething (such as an act, a forbearance, or a return promise) bargained for and received by a promisor from a promisee; that which motivates a person to do something.’” (quoting Black’s Law Dictionary 370 (10th ed. 2014))). Although a valid guaranty must be supported by consideration, there is no requirement that the guarantor receive a direct benefit. Indeed, this Court has held that “[w]hen a corporate officer agrees to be liable for a debt of the corporation, it is not necessary for consideration to move to the officer personally. It is enough if the corporation receives the consideration.” Katz v.

Although some guarantees are supported by separate consideration that flows directly to the guarantor, a guarantor who is also a corporate officer need not receive a separate benefit. See Katz, 459 A.2d at 86; see also Restatement (Third) Suretyship & Guaranty § 9(2)(a) at 34-35 (1996) (“A secondary obligation does not fail for lack of consideration if * * * the underlying obligation is supported by consideration and the later creation of the secondary obligation was part of the exchange for which the obligee bargained[.]”). There is nothing in the record or in our case law that supports Cambio’s argument that the guaranty is unenforceable because it fails to recite adequate consideration.

Accepting its allegations as true, as we must, it is nevertheless our opinion that CPA cannot escape the fact that frustration of purpose—an affirmative defense against a breach of contract claim—is not a theory of liability in an affirmative cause of action. For that reason, there is no set of facts that would entitle CPA to relief. We need not dwell on', '- 15 - this question any further; the hearing justice correctly granted Tri-Town’s motion to dismiss CPA’s counterclaim.', 'C', 'Awarding of Attorney’s Fees', '1', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court has “staunch[ly] adhere[d] to the ‘American rule’ that requires each litigant to pay its own attorney’s fees absent statutory authority or contractual liability.” Shine v.

Mee, 109 A.3d 832, 845 (R.I. 2015) (quoting Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island v. Najarian, 911 A.2d 706, 709 (R.I. 2006)).', '2', 'Analysis', 'The defendants contend that the hearing justice abused his discretion by awarding attorney’s fees to plaintiff because the fees were neither reasonable nor necessary. They further argue that the affidavits submitted by Tri-Town, by its own attorneys, were insufficient because an affidavit from another attorney indicating the necessity and reasonableness of the fees was required before the court could award the fees.', 'The defendants aver that the hearing justice erred when he awarded Tri-Town legal fees for its unsuccessful motion for prejudgment attachment as well as for several discovery requests that they argue failed to comport with discovery rules. Regarding the motion for prejudgment', '- 16 - attachment, defendants argue that, because a different hearing justice denied the motion, it was meritless, and, therefore, Tri-Town should not be awarded fees for prosecuting its motion. However, the fact that a motion has been denied, standing alone, is not enough to invalidate an award of legal fees. For instance, in Pearson v. Pearson, 11 A.3d 103, 105-08 (R.I. 2011), we considered a settlement agreement between former spouses that provided for reasonable attorney’s fees when one of the spouses filed for bankruptcy and the other incurred legal fees as a result. The agreement said that “[e]ither party may seek to have the bankrupt party meet and pay all costs, including reasonable attorney’s fees incurred by the non-bankrupt party in pursuing his or her rights * * *.” Id. at 105-06 (emphasis omitted). The former wife sought to hold her ex-husband in contempt after he refused to indemnify her, as required by a court order, for claims made against her by a creditor on a joint line of credit. Id. at 106-07.', 'Although the trial justice found that the contempt motion was premature because the creditor had not yet obtained a judgment against her, the hearing justice nonetheless awarded the ex-wife attorney’s fees for bringing the motion. Pearson, 11 A.3d at 109-10. On appeal, the defendant argued that, because he was the prevailing party on the motion, the trial justice should not have granted attorney’s fees to his ex-wife. Id. at 108. We held that, because the settlement agreement did not require the party seeking the fees to be successful on the merits, the hearing justice did not abuse his discretion in awarding legal fees. Id. at 108-10.', 'Likewise, nowhere in the note at issue here is it required that Tri-Town must prevail in its claim against defendants before it is entitled to receive attorney fees from them. The note says that the', '“MAKER will pay the reasonable legal and other fees and', 'expenses of PAYEE or any HOLDER reasonably incurred', 'connected with or incidental to (i) the negotiation, closing and', 'administration of the loan evidenced by this Note incidental to the', '- 17 -', 'collection or enforcement of an Event of Default, and (ii) the', 'enforcement of any of the obligations of MAKER or rights of the', 'HOLDER under this Note * * * by litigation or otherwise * * *.” The only stipulation that the note places on Tri-Town receiving attorney’s fees is that they be “reasonably incurred.” Without more, we cannot say that Tri-Town’s attempt at protecting its rights under the contract by seeking prejudgment attachment was “meritless.” 4', 'However, we agree with defendants that the affidavits of Tri-Town’s trial attorney do not suffice to prove the necessity and reasonableness of legal fees. In Colonial Plumbing & Heating Supply Co. v. Contemporary Construction Co., 464 A.2d 741, 744 (R.I. 1983), we held that “affidavits or expert testimony establishing the criteria on which a fee award is based should be required.” Moreover, we said that “[i]t is well settled that attorneys ‘are competent to testify as experts in determining what is a reasonable charge for legal services rendered.’” Id. (quoting Cottrell Employees Credit Union v. Pavelski, 106 R.I. 29, 35, 255 A.2d 162, 165 (1969)). What we did not say, however, was who should be providing the affidavits or expert testimony. We take this opportunity to embrace a consistent procedure on the award of attorney’s fees and hold that the affidavits or testimony, as required by Colonial Plumbing & Heating Co., must be from counsel who is a member of the Rhode Island Bar and who is not representing the parties to the action in which fees are sought.', 'In the proceedings below, the trial justice declined Tri-Town’s offer to present expert testimony from outside counsel to establish the reasonableness and necessity of its fees. We believe this was error and that the better practice would have been to consider that testimony. Although the standard of review of an order awarding attorney’s fees is abuse of discretion, we 4', 'We note that our review of this award is hampered by the fact that defendants did not provide a transcript of the hearing where a different justice of the Superior Court denied Tri-Town’s motion for prejudgment attachment.', '- 18 - are of the opinion that this discretion can only be exercised after competent evidence from independent counsel has been admitted. The fees in this case may very well be reasonable; however, we do not accept that affidavits and documents provided to the court by interested parties should be the basis for awarding them. For instance, in Florida, “where a party seeks to have the opposing party in a lawsuit pay for attorney’s fees incurred in that same action, the general rule * * * is that independent expert testimony is required.” Sea World of Florida, Inc. v. Ace American Insurance Companies, Inc., 28 So.3d 158, 160 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2010) (citing Crittenden Orange Blossom Fruit v. Stone, 514 So.2d 351, 352-53 (Fla. 1987)). Likewise, the Vermont Supreme Court has observed that “the record is often best served on the issue of reasonableness by the receipt of expert testimony from independent counsel.” Bruntaeger v. Zeller, 515 A.2d 123, 128 (Vt. 1986) (quoting Parker, Lamb & Ankuda, P.C. v. Krupinsky, 503 A.2d 531, 534 (Vt. 1985)).

Hyde and Jeffrey Thomas, brought suit against the Roman Catholic Bishop of Providence, seeking damages arising from their alleged sexual abuse at the hands of Father Brendan Smyth more than four decades ago. The Superior Court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant.', 'The plaintiffs appealed, arguing that the trial justice erred when she decided that the statute of limitations barred their claims because, they argue, their inability to recall the abuse tolled the statute of limitations until such time as they became aware of their claims against the institutional, nonperpetrator defendant. Moreover, the plaintiffs argue that the trial justice erred when she denied their request to seek discovery on the alternate tolling theory that the defendant', '-1- fraudulently concealed their causes of action from them. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'The plaintiffs filed complaints in Providence County Superior Court against the Roman Catholic Bishop of Providence (defendant), alleging that Father Brendan Smyth sexually abused them on numerous occasions, beginning in 1967 until approximately 1970.', 'The plaintiffs alleged that the acts of abuse visited upon them all occurred while Smyth was under defendant’s supervision. At the time of the alleged abuse, Smyth was a visiting priest, counselor, and teacher at Our Lady of Mercy School and Church in East Greenwich. In these positions, Father Smyth had unsupervised interactions with young parishioners and schoolchildren; it was during those encounters that he allegedly took advantage of and sexually abused several children. After he left Rhode Island, Father Smyth returned to his native Ireland, where he was later convicted of serial child molestation. Around 1997, Smyth died in prison.', 'According to Hyde, Smyth began abusing her in 1967, when she was six years old and a student at Our Lady of Mercy School. Hyde maintained that Smyth sexually abused her in a classroom, in the schoolyard, in church, in her home, and in the woods outside her house.', 'Hyde was not the only victim of Smyth’s claimed sexual abuse to come forward. Thomas alleged in his complaint that, soon after Smyth began to abuse Hyde, he also raped and molested him in the church’s rectory and in Hyde’s backyard.', 'In their respective complaints, plaintiffs claim that defendant and his predecessors knew that Smyth was a pedophile by the late 1940s, but that they nonetheless continued to allow him to serve as a priest under their supervision. They maintain that defendant not only knew of Smyth’s pedophilia, but also that Smyth’s level of sexual abuse caused him to be sent away for', '-2- treatment before he was eventually allowed to return to Our Lady of Mercy. Relying on their claim that defendant knew Smyth was a pedophile, plaintiffs filed their complaints, in which they alleged numerous counts of negligence, negligent supervision, vicarious liability, fraud, intentional nondisclosure, and intentional failure to supervise. The plaintiffs also asserted that each of them had repressed recollection of the crimes perpetrated against them and that they did not recover their memories of the abuse until within three years of the filing of the lawsuit.', 'In response, defendant filed motions to dismiss the complaints. First, defendant argued that, because the statute extending the time for childhood victims of sexual abuse who suffered from repressed memory applied only in the case of perpetrator defendants, the action was time- barred. Second, he argued that plaintiffs had failed to allege sufficient facts that would support tolling of the statute under the “unsound mind” provision found at G.L. 1956 § 9-1-19. The plaintiffs opposed the motions to dismiss, arguing that repressed memory, in and of itself, was a possible tolling mechanism under the “unsound mind” provision of § 9-1-19, that an evidentiary hearing on repressed memory, pursuant to this Court’s decision in Kelly v. Marcantonio, 678 A.2d 873 (R.I. 1996), was in order, and that plaintiffs’ fraud claims were timely because plaintiffs could not have discovered defendant’s fraudulent conduct until they remembered the underlying abuse.', 'At the hearing on the motions to dismiss, defendant argued that this Court has never held that repressed and subsequently recovered memories, standing alone, without any other indicia, could constitute an unsound mind. The defendant also argued that § 9-1-51 did not apply to nonperpetrator defendants and that there was no requirement for an evidentiary hearing in this case. 1 Much of defendant’s argument focused on his position that, for the “unsound mind” 1', 'General Law 1956 § 9-1-51(a) provides: Limitation on actions based on sexual abuse or exploitation of a child, “[a]ll claims or causes of action based on intentional conduct brought by', '-3- tolling provision of § 9-1-19 to apply, plaintiffs were required to show some inability to manage their day-to-day affairs, and that, with respect to these particular plaintiffs, Hyde and Thomas had experienced successful careers as a lawyer and as a businessman, respectively.', 'The trial justice denied defendant’s motion, without prejudice, pending an evidentiary hearing to “receive scientific and other data to assess whether repressed recollection ha[d] been established * * *.” The trial justice agreed that Kelly had definitively held that suits against nonperpetrator defendants could not be tolled under § 9-1-51. However, the hearing justice also said that it was her opinion that this Court had yet to hold definitively that a trial court “cannot permit repressed memory to toll the [s]tatute of [l]imitations unless the [c]ourt also finds that the [p]laintiff was unable to conduct his or her day-to-day activities.” The trial justice directed that an evidentiary hearing be held to determine if plaintiffs could demonstrate having repressed memories that would qualify as “unsound mind” under § 9-1-19. The motion to dismiss having been denied, defendant subsequently filed answers to the complaints.', 'More than a year later, defendant filed a motion for entry of a scheduling order, attaching a proposed schedule. 2 The plaintiffs’ counsel objected to the proposed order, not on the grounds that it was inadequate for discovery on plaintiffs’ repressed-memory claims, but because plaintiffs’ counsel asserted the right to conduct discovery on an intentional concealment tolling theory pursuant to § 9-1-20. 3 This, defendant argued, would frustrate the intent of the court’s any person for recovery of damages for injury suffered as a result of childhood sexual abuse shall be commenced within seven (7) years of the act alleged to have caused the injury or condition, or seven (7) years of the time the victim discovered or reasonably should have discovered that the injury or condition was caused by the act, whichever period expires later.” 2', 'The defendant noted that before filing its motion, plaintiffs’ counsel had agreed to the order that it had prepared. However, soon after this agreement was reached, plaintiffs’ counsel was allowed to withdraw and new counsel entered for plaintiffs. 3', 'General Law 1956 § 9-1-20 provides: Time of accrual of concealed cause of action, “[i]f any person, liable to an action by another, shall fraudulently, by actual misrepresentation, conceal from him or her the existence of the cause of action, the cause of action shall be deemed to', '-4- order as to an evidentiary hearing, which was limited to the question of whether repressed memory could constitute “unsound mind” so as to toll the statute of limitations under § 9-1-19. The defendant also argued that plaintiffs had not alleged sufficient facts to support such a theory, and, further, that they had waived the right to present a fraudulent concealment tolling argument.', 'The plaintiffs responded with a scheduling order of their own; theirs included a provision for discovery based on fraudulent concealment. They argued that they intended to introduce evidence of defendant’s fraudulent concealment at the evidentiary hearing on the repressed- memory issue, claiming that, because they had pled fraud and intentional nondisclosure in their complaints, they should be allowed to conduct discovery on those issues. At the hearing on the motions, the hearing justice remarked that “not once did the plaintiff mention fraudulent concealment” during the earlier hearing on defendant’s motion to dismiss, and that, “if there was a legal issue or a factual issue that would have provided a defense to the [s]tatute of [l]imitations claim, it was incumbent on plaintiff to raise it at that time, and the plaintiff did not.” She determined that, although she would not allow full discovery on this issue, plaintiffs could, in the alternative, file a motion to reargue the motion to dismiss and raise the issue of fraudulent concealment that way. She further directed that each plaintiff file an affidavit on the fraudulent concealment issue and that she might thereafter permit discovery.', 'The plaintiffs acted on the hearing justice’s suggestion and moved to reargue their opposition to defendant’s motions to dismiss—this time including their fraudulent concealment claim. The defendant filed an objection and a hearing was held. In deciding the motion, the trial justice began by observing that, to demonstrate fraudulent concealment for the purpose of tolling the statute of limitations, a “plaintiff must show * * * that the defendant made an actual accrue against the person so liable at the time when the person entitled to sue thereon shall first discover its existence.”', '-5- misrepresentation of fact,” and “that in making such misrepresentation, the defendant fraudulently concealed the existence of plaintiffs’ causes of action.” The defendant argued that plaintiffs had actual knowledge of the facts they contended were the foundation of their causes of action, but that fraudulent concealment “requires an action by a defendant to a plaintiff that conceals the cause of action itself,” i.e., a type of “affirmative misrepresentation of fact related to their injury.” The defendant asserted that plaintiffs’ “[a]ctual knowledge negates fraudulent concealment.” The plaintiffs responded that there could not be actual knowledge by a minor child who repressed the memory of the injury before reaching the age of majority. The plaintiffs argued that, among other things, a former bishop of Providence had “state[d] under the penalty of perjury that his job was to * * * conceal the information of abuse * * * [and] sanctify the priests * * * [and] return them to minister,” and that this constituted “an actual admission by defendants of fraudulent concealment immediately post-abuse.”', 'The trial justice said that the Supreme Court “ha[d] been very, very strict about fraudulent concealment as it relate[d] to cases such as this.” Regarding plaintiff Hyde, defendant argued that she would have to show that defendant “misled her into believing that the assault did not occur, [and] that Brendon [sic] Smyth did not commit the assault or that she did not suffer any injuries as a result of the assault.” The hearing justice said that none of Hyde’s allegations had constituted fraudulent concealment. 4', 'When asked by the trial justice what actual misrepresentation defendant made to plaintiff, plaintiff Hyde indicated that, with additional discovery, perhaps such a fact might be uncovered. She also suggested that if evidence were to be produced that would show that her mother went to defendant and reported plaintiff’s abuse by Smyth, and if defendant told her mother that her 4', 'The defendant also argued that it was well known worldwide that Smyth was committing sexual abuses and that he had been convicted on such charges, some of which were even reported in The Providence Journal.', '-6- suspicions were unfounded or if he threatened to excommunicate her, those facts would support their theory. The trial justice did not agree; she ruled that she would not allow plaintiffs to combine the claims of fraudulent concealment and repressed recollection so as to extend the statute of limitations, and that “[t]here came a point in time where the fact that Father Jerry [sic], Brenda[n] Smyth, was a pedophile, [and] had abused children in Rhode Island, became disclosed,” and “that fact was no longer concealed.”', 'At a later continuation of the hearing, defendant argued that documents that plaintiff Hyde had produced, including her own journal entries from 2005, indicated that she “was actively investigating a cause of action against Brendon [sic] Smyth as early as June of 2005.” With respect to Thomas, defendant argued that “Mr. Thomas never allege[d] any misrepresentation by anyone at any time on any matter.”', 'The trial justice found that there was no evidence of actual misrepresentations made by defendant to plaintiffs regarding their civil claims that could have tolled the applicable statute of limitations. Specifically, she said, “[t]here [wa]sn’t an iota of evidence * * * that between the ages of [eighteen] and [twenty-one] there were any misrepresentations made to Ms. Hyde, [or] to Mr. Thomas.” She further found that any misrepresentations defendant may have made to plaintiff Hyde’s mother were only applicable to plaintiff’s mother until plaintiff reached the age of eighteen, because her mother’s ability to bring a lawsuit on her behalf came to an end at that time.', 'She further concluded that plaintiffs had “attempted to circumvent the well-established case law, that [§] 9-1-51 does not apply to non-perpetrator [d]efendants by drafting an argument under [§] 9-1-20.” At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial justice denied plaintiffs’ motion for limited discovery as to fraudulent concealment. In so doing, she said that she could “conceive of', '-7- no set of facts that [p]laintiffs could develop through discovery that would permit them to defeat the motion to dismiss based upon the Doctrine of Fraudulent Concealment.”', 'The Parties Stipulate as to the Need for an Evidentiary Hearing', 'During the course of these hearings, the trial justice discussed her understanding of Rhode Island law on repressed recollections:', '“THE COURT: * * * It is quite clear that the Rhode Island', 'Supreme Court provided guidance on a definition of unsound', 'mind. The whole issue before this [c]ourt, at this moment, is', 'whether our Court in Kelly v. Marcantonio and in Roe v.

For the purposes of that motion only, the stipulation also set forth thirteen agreed factual statements, including that Smyth sexually abused plaintiffs, that they experienced repressed recollections of the abuse until 2005, and that plaintiffs had been able to manage their day-to-day affairs. When the parties appeared before the trial justice, defendant argued that, assuming that (1) the abuse of plaintiffs occurred as set forth in their complaints, and (2) their memories of the abuse were repressed and later recovered, plaintiffs’ claims were nonetheless barred by the statute of limitations, which it asserted had expired in 1985, three years after plaintiffs reached the age of majority. Thus, according to defendant, the only remaining issue was whether repressed memory itself qualified as “unsound mind” for purposes of § 9-1-19.', 'The defendant contended that the General Assembly specifically enacted § 9-1-51 to allow those with repressed recollection to bring suit but excluded nonperpetrator defendants from that tolling provision. The defendant further argued that this Court had addressed the issue of what constituted “unsound mind” in Roe v. Gelineau, 794 A.2d 476 (R.I. 2002), and described it as when a “person has an inability to manage their day-to-day affairs or their day-to-day activities.” The defendant asserted that the facts stipulated to by the parties left no question that plaintiffs “were able to handle their day-to-day affairs from the time that they reached the age of majority in 1982 until the time that they recovered their memories.”', 'The plaintiffs conceded that they were able to pursue their day-to-day affairs and agreed that “[t]hat’s off the table.”', 'The trial justice concurred, finding that “[n]either of these [p]laintiffs ha[d] suffered periods of time as adults where they were unable to manage their own affairs” and that “[t]hey [we]re both impressive and productive individuals.” She concluded that', '-9- it was “quite clear that [these plaintiffs] do not meet the definition of unsound mind stated in [§] 9-1-19.”', 'In a bench decision, the trial justice explained that this Court already had grappled with the issue of the tolling of the statute of limitations based on repressed memory in cases such as these, and that this Court had “determined that the cause of action accrues at the time of the offense, not when the [p]laintiff becomes aware through a recovered memory that it occurred.” She next delineated the two means by which a plaintiff might toll the statute of limitations. The trial justice addressed § 9-1-51(a), which provides that', '“[a]ll claims or causes of action based on intentional conduct', 'brought by any person for recovery of damages for injuries', 'suffered as a result of childhood sexual abuse shall be commenced', 'within (7) seven years of the act alleged to have caused the injury', 'or condition, or (7) seven years of the time the victim discovered', 'or reasonably should have discovered that the injury or condition', 'was caused by the act, whichever period expires later.” The trial justice observed that the General Assembly had not chosen to include nonperpetrator defendants within the purview of § 9-1-51, noting that “any claim against Smyth, if he was still alive, would fall within [§] 9-1-51, but any claim against the named [d]efendant[s] would not.” The trial justice also commented that the General Assembly had had ample opportunity to amend § 9-1-51 to include nonperpetrator defendants within its ambit since the Supreme Court’s decision in Kelly, but had not done so.', 'The trial justice then turned to the unsound-mind provision contained in § 9-1-19, the only other tolling avenue available to plaintiffs. After stating that it was “quite clear” that plaintiffs did not meet the definition of unsound mind as set forth in Roe because they were able to manage their day-to-day affairs, the trial justice granted defendant’s motion for summary judgment. Judgment entered in favor of defendant, and plaintiffs timely appealed.', '- 10 -', 'Standards of Review', 'This Court reviews a trial justice’s decision to grant summary judgment de novo.

However, the running of the statute of limitations may be stopped or “tolled” by several legal disabilities that are enumerated in § 9-1-19.

Toselli, 819 A.2d 202, 205 (R.I. 2003) (quoting Supreme Bakery, Inc. v. Bagley, 742 A.2d 1202, 1204 (R.I. 2000)).', 'The main purpose of the discovery rule is “to protect individuals suffering from latent or undiscoverable injuries who then seek legal redress after the statute of limitations has expired for', '- 12 - a particular claim.” Sharkey v. Prescott, 19 A.3d 62, 66 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Canavan v. Lovett, Schefrin and Harnett, 862 A.2d 778, 783 (R.I. 2004)). Over the years, this Court has applied the discovery rule to a limited class of cases, including medical malpractice cases, Wilkinson v. Harrington, 104 R.I. 224, 243 A.2d 745 (1968), products liability for damage to personal property, Romano v. Westinghouse Electric Co., 114 R.I. 451, 336 A.2d 555 (1975), damage to real property, Lee v. Morin, 469 A.2d 358 (R.I. 1983), and in products liability actions against drug manufacturers, Anthony v. Abbott Laboratories, 490 A.2d 43 (R.I. 1985).', 'In one case, we were asked to determine whether the discovery rule should apply in cases of repressed recollection in childhood sexual abuse cases against perpetrator defendants. In Doe v. LaBrosse, 588 A.2d 605, 607 (R.I. 1991) (LaBrosse I), we granted certiorari after the defendant’s motion for summary judgment in a civil sexual assault lawsuit was denied. The plaintiffs, the adult daughters of the defendant, had sued their father well after the three-year statute of limitations period expired. Id. at 606. However, the plaintiffs claimed that the discovery rule was available to them based on their repressed memories of the childhood sexual abuse. Id. Without answering that question, we remanded the case to the Superior Court for an evidentiary hearing so that the trial justice could “determine the date the plaintiffs discovered, or with all due diligence should reasonably have discovered, the causal connection between the defendant’s alleged acts and the plaintiffs’ alleged injuries.” Id. at 607. Only then would we “determine the propriety of applying the discovery rule to toll the statute of limitations in this case.” Id. In the meantime, however, the General Assembly enacted § 9-1-51, statutorily creating a discovery rule for actions against perpetrator defendants in childhood sexual abuse cases. Doe v. LaBrosse, 625 A.2d 222, 222 (R.I. 1993) (LaBrosse II). As a result, we remanded the cases to the Superior Court for a second time for the trial justice to apply the newly enacted', '- 13 - statute. Id.', 'We have also addressed the issue of repressed recollection in the criminal context. In State v. Quattrocchi, 681 A.2d 879, 879-80 (R.I. 1996), the perpetrator defendant was convicted of two counts of first-degree sexual assault. The victim alleged that she did not recall the past abuse until years later, when she was admitted to a hospital for mental-health treatment. Id. In discussing the “flashbacks” about which she testified, we noted that, “[p]erhaps no area of the law has been more productive of controversy than that of the reliability and admissibility of testimony, expert and otherwise, relating to repressed recollection.” Id. at 881. After observing that repressed recollection could arise in “circumstances when recollections have been repressed for many years and then released in the course of psychological treatment or psychiatric therapy,” id. we nonetheless declined to “resolve the controversy concerning the reliability and admissibility of repressed recollections as well as the expert testimony that may corroborate and support the basis for such repression and the reliability of the flashbacks or recovered recollections when they are offered at trial.” Id. at 883.', 'As to the discovery rule’s application to nonperpetrator defendants, that question remained unanswered until our decision in Kelly. In several certified questions from the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island and the Superior Court, we were asked to determine whether § 9-1-51 allowed the tolling of suits against nonperpetrator defendants and whether repressed recollection qualified as a disability under the “unsound mind” provision of § 9-1-19 that would toll the limitations period against nonperpetrator defendants. Kelly, 678 A.2d at 879. After answering the first question in the negative, we declined to take a categorical approach to the second, and instead vested a trial justice with discretion to determine the validity of repressed-recollections claims. Id. We held that a plaintiff claiming to have a repressed', '- 14 - recollection must show, in the first instance, that the alleged facts establish a demonstrable repressed recollection. Id.', 'If the plaintiff is able to make that threshold showing, then a procedural mechanism is triggered whereby the trial justice would be required to conduct an evidentiary hearing to reach one of four outcomes. Kelly, 678 A.2d at 879. First, the trial justice might decide that, based upon the facts of the specific case, repressed recollection is a scientifically and validly accepted theory that qualifies as a disability under § 9-1-19. Kelly, 678 A.2d at 880. Second, the trial justice might conclude that, although repressed recollection is a scientifically and validly accepted theory, it in and of itself does not qualify as a valid tolling mechanism under § 9-1-19. Kelly, 678 A.2d at 880. Third, the trial justice could determine that repressed recollection is not a scientifically and validly accepted theory and, that, therefore, the tolling provision in § 9-1-19 would not apply. Kelly, 678 A.2d at 880. Finally, the trial justice could find that, even though repressed recollection is a scientifically and validly accepted theory, a plaintiff failed to establish the existence of repressed recollection that would have tolled the statute of limitations. Id. No matter which option the trial justice chose, we ultimately held that it would be “the trial justice who, in the first instance, must determine * * * whether repressed recollection is included within the tolling condition of ‘unsound mind’ in a particular case.” Id. at 879.', 'Absent from that analysis, however, was exactly what the General Assembly meant when it employed the term “unsound mind.” We answered that question in Roe. There, the plaintiff alleged that he suffered sexual abuse at the hands of several abusers while residing in a church- run orphanage. Roe, 794 A.2d at 479-80. In a complaint filed against the nonperpetrator defendant, the plaintiff alleged that the three-year statute of limitations on his personal injury claims had been tolled for several reasons, including the “unsound mind” disability under', '- 15 - § 9-1-19.', 'The plaintiff founded that claim on his inability to remember certain events surrounding the abuse. Roe, 794 A.2d at 480. To support his repressed-recollection claims, the plaintiff submitted an affidavit from a psychologist, in which it was averred that the plaintiff had “briefly mentioned [the] abuse * * * but ‘it was never something he was able to focus on or process in therapy’ because ‘it was too difficult for him to deal with.’” Id. at 483. The record also revealed that the plaintiff had mentioned the abuse to “at least four people on at least five occasions when he was between the ages of thirteen and twenty-two.” Id. at 484. The Superior Court dismissed the complaint without holding an evidentiary hearing because it found that the plaintiff’s allegations did not overcome the threshold showing of repressed recollection under the first step of Kelly. Id.', 'We affirmed the judgment, holding that the plaintiff was unable to establish that he suffered from “the type of repressed recollection discussed in Kelly and Quattrocchi.” Roe, 794 A.2d at 484. Specifically, we rejected the plaintiff’s contention that “his inability to recall or to deal with his abuse and his concomitant inability to file suit for these specific claims [were] conditions that should be included within the ambit of the term unsound mind * * *.” Id. at 482. Because the plaintiff’s allegations were limited to “memory lapses and the inability to deal with his abuse in therapy,” we held that he “did not trigger Kelly’s procedural mechanism, requiring an evidentiary hearing on whether his alleged repressed recollection constituted an unsound mind for tolling purposes.” Id. at 484.', 'The plaintiff in Roe alternatively argued that he was of unsound mind for reasons other than repressed recollection, asserting that he suffered from substance abuse, psychiatric disorders, and a below average intelligence. Roe, 794 A.2d at 487-88.', 'We determined that, although we had not defined “unsound mind” for the purposes of § 9-1-19, it became necessary', '- 16 - to do so in that case “to determine whether plaintiff was of unsound mind for reasons other than repressed recollection.” Roe, 794 A.2d at 484.', 'After reviewing the historical context of the term, we held that, for the purposes of § 9-1-19, “unsound mind” meant “the inability to manage one’s day-to-day affairs.” Roe, 794 A.2d at 486. We explained that we chose that definition based on our belief “that defining unsoundness of mind in terms of the concrete, objective standard of inability to manage one’s day-to-day affairs complies with the statutory intent of the term and is consistent with our holdings in numerous cases.” Id. at 487. After defining “unsound mind,” we went on to apply that definition to the plaintiff’s condition and determined that, despite his low intelligence, memory problems, hospitalizations, and psychiatric issues, his condition did not rise to the level of unsound mind that would toll the running of the three-year statute of limitations contained in § 9-1-14(b). Roe, 794 A.2d at 487-88. However, after our opinion in Roe, there remained an ambiguity about whether this Court meant for that definition to apply to repressed recollection.', '2', 'Application to Plaintiffs’ Claims', 'For the purposes of summary judgment, the parties stipulated that, among other things, plaintiffs were sexually abused by Smyth, plaintiffs suffered repressed recollection of that abuse until 2005, and that plaintiffs were able to manage their day-to-day affairs. Based upon those agreed-to-facts, the trial justice found that plaintiffs did not meet the definition of “unsound mind” as we had defined it in Roe and she granted summary judgment in favor of defendant. On appeal, plaintiffs maintain that repressed recollection is a separate and disctinct type of unsound mind disability that, apart from the inability to manage their day-to-day activities, entitles them to toll the three-year statute of limitations for their claims against defendant.', '- 17 -', 'Because of the ambiguity that remained after our decision in Roe, our earlier cases do not answer the precise question that we must address in this case. Although we left open the possibility in Kelly that repressed recollection of past sexual abuse by nonperpetrator defendants, standing alone, could qualify as an unsound mind disability under § 9-1-19, we did not go as far as to conclude that it does. Indeed, in Roe we acknowledged that Kelly left open that “the inability to bring a particular claim may be included in the purview of the term ‘unsound mind’ for purposes of the tolling statute in one particular context, namely, that of repressed recollection.” Roe, 794 A.2d at 482.', 'Without question, repressed recollections have engendered much debate and controversy, and have required legislatures to make, and courts to consider, difficult policy decisions. See Kelly, 687 A.2d at 879; Quattrocchi, 681 A.2d at 881. Inherent in this debate is the concern over prejudicial delay to defendants because of a plaintiff’s repressed recollections. Statutes of limitations “are designed to promote justice by preventing surprises through the revival of claims that have been allowed to slumber until evidence has been lost, memories have faded, and witnesses have disappeared.” Ryan v. Roman Catholic Bishop of Providence, 941 A.2d 174, 181 (R.I. 2008) (quoting Order of Railroad Telegraphers v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., 321 U.S. 342, 348-49 (1944)).', 'We appreciate the sage logic of the late Chief Justice Joseph R. Weisberger that “the right to be free of stale claims in time comes to prevail over the right to prosecute them.”', 'Anthony, 490 A.2d at 49 (Weisberger, J. dissenting). And indeed, the allegations giving rise to plaintiffs’ complaints are nearly a half-century old. Counterbalancing the purpose behind statutes of limitations, however, is the state’s interest in providing a remedy for rights claimed by its citizenry. See, e.g., R.I. Const. art. 1, sec. 5. Statutes of limitations, then, are “the product of a balancing of the individual person’s right to seek redress for past', '- 18 - grievances against the need of society and the judicial system for finality—for a closing of the books.” Ryan, 941 A.2d at 181.', 'In enacting § 9-1-51, the General Assembly expressly acknowledged the validity of repressed recollection and devised a specific mechanism allowing victims to bring suit long after the statute-of-limitations period has expired. It is significant that the General Assembly enacted § 9-1-51 soon after we “specifically hesitated to judicially integrate a discovery rule into those cases.” Kelly, 678 A.2d at 878. The plaintiffs essentially now ask us to judicially engraft a discovery rule onto § 9-1-19, something we have explicitly declined to do in the past because it would undermine the General Assembly’s deliberate decision to expand the statute of limitations as to perpetrator defendants, but not nonperpetrator defendants.', 'In Kelly, 678 A.2d at 878, we deferred to the General Assembly’s judgment and refused to adopt a judicially created discovery rule that is broader than what the legislature intended. In holding that § 9-1-51 applies only to perpetrator defendants, we said that:', '“We perceive no persuasive policy considerations that the', 'General Assembly failed to consider when enacting § 9-1-51 that', 'would support judicial application of a discovery rule to claims', 'made against nonperpetrator-defendants. * * * The General', 'Assembly when it enacted § 9-1-51 * * * is presumed to have', 'known that it limited the discovery rule provided therein to only', 'those claims of alleged sexual abuse made against the actual', 'perpetrators of the abuse.” Kelly, 678 A.2d at 878, 878-79. We embrace that reasoning today. When it enacted § 9-1-51, the General Assembly addressed a complex and controversial area of tort liability, and it limited the application of repressed recollection via the discovery rule to the actual abusers, because “it is the perpetrator of the abuse who is responsible for instilling the psychological defense mechanism leading to repression,” and that causal connection was what justified enacting “a delayed discovery statute of limitations directed specifically at the perpetrator of the sexual abuse.” Kelly, 678 A.2d at', '- 19 - 878 (quoting Debbie Reynolds Professional Rehearsal Studios v. Superior Court, 30 Cal. Rptr.2d 514, 520 (Cal. Ct. App. 1994)). After a thorough analysis, we are confident that the General Assembly weighed the competing policies and respective interests of plaintiffs and defendants alike when it enacted § 9-1-51.', 'We acknowledge plaintiffs’ argument that an incongruity occurs when the requirement that a plaintiff be unable to conduct his day-to-day affairs is combined with an inability to recollect past abuse. In other words, a plaintiff would be hard-pressed to establish that he or she suffered repressed recollection while simultaneously suffering from a disability that rendered him unable to manage his day-to-day affairs. Indeed, the phenomenon of losing conscious awareness of abuse becomes irrelevant because the inability to manage one’s day-to-day affairs would toll the statute of limitations irrespective of a plaintiff’s loss of memory. However, to the extent that Kelly left open the option that repressed recollection, standing alone, could toll the statute of limitations with respect to nonperpetrator defendants, we now foreclose it and hold that, under § 9-1-19, repressed recollection, in and of itself, is not a viable tolling mechanism against nonperpetrator defendants in childhood sexual abuse cases. In our opinion, reading § 9- 1-19 and § 9-1-51 together makes it clear that § 9-1-51 sets forth the exclusive means by which the statute of limitations can be tolled based on the repressed recollection of childhood sexual abuse.', 'B', 'Fraudulent Concealment', 'The plaintiffs next contend that the trial justice wrongly denied them the opportunity to seek discovery on their alternative tolling theory that defendant fraudulently concealed their causes of action. The fraudulent concealment provision found in § 9-1-20 says that:', '- 20 -', '“If any person, liable to an action by another, shall', 'fraudulently, by actual misrepresentation, conceal from him or her', 'the existence of the cause of action, the cause of action shall be', 'deemed to accrue against the person so liable at the time when the', 'person entitled to sue thereon shall first discover its existence.” In Ryan, this Court observed that “[i]n order to demonstrate that there has been fraudulent concealment on the part of a defendant, a plaintiff must show: (1) that the defendant made an actual misrepresentation of fact; and (2) that, in making such misrepresentation, the defendant fraudulently concealed the existence of [the] plaintiff’s causes of action.” Ryan, 941 A.2d at 182. Therefore, to find a safe harbor based on fraudulent-concealment tolling, plaintiffs “must demonstrate that the defendant made an ‘express representation or [engaged in] other affirmative conduct amounting in fact to such a representation which could reasonably deceive another and induce him [or her] to rely thereon to his [or her] disadvantage.’” Id. at 182-83.', 'The plaintiffs allege that defendant made an array of misrepresentations: that defendant knew of Smyth’s abuse and failed to disclose or report it; that the parish where he worked held him out to the community as in good standing; that plaintiff Hyde told her mother of the abuse and that, when either her mother or her grandmother attempted to complain, they were threatened with excommunication; that a prior Providence bishop had made a sworn statement in an unrelated case that he was tasked with protecting priests accused of abuse and returning them to the ministry; and finally that, when plaintiff Hyde recovered her memories in 2005 and confronted defendant, they attempted to deflect and conceal the fact of Smyth’s abuse.', 'However, none of these allegations, even if true, would toll the running of plaintiffs’ claims under § 9-1-20. First, regarding the failure to report or disclose Smyth’s abuse, this Court has held that “[m]ere silence or inaction on the part of the defendant does not constitute actual misrepresentation in this context.” Ryan, 941 A.2d at 182. Thus, it is not enough that defendant', '- 21 - failed to disclose the facts of plaintiffs’ injury to them. Furthermore, the fact that defendant may have known that Smyth had abused children does not indicate that that knowledge was specific as to these plaintiffs. Second, the fact that defendant may have threatened plaintiff Hyde’s family members with excommunication does nothing to establish that defendant misled the individual plaintiffs into believing that no cause of action existed. That is so because those threats had no effect on plaintiff Hyde or her family’s belief that the abuse occurred, that it was Smyth who was the perpetrator, or that there was no resulting injury from the abuse. Third, the allegation that defendant attempted to deflect or conceal the abuse when confronted by plaintiff Hyde after she recovered her memory of the abuse is also unavailing. Indeed, at that time, plaintiff Hyde was actively investigating Smyth as an abuser and, as evidenced by this suit, any denial on defendant’s part could not have misled her into thinking that the abuse did not occur. Finally, the fact that defendant may have held Smyth out to the community as being in good standing is likewise unavailing. Even to the extent that the record suggests that defendant made efforts to conceal the sexual abuse from the public, that is concealment of a kind quite separate and apart from the kind of misrepresentation to plaintiffs themselves that would be required to show fraudulent concealment in order to toll the statute of limitations.', 'In sum, we fail to see how any of the alleged conduct by the defendant could have misled these plaintiffs “into believing that the sexual assault did not occur.” Ryan, 941 A.2d at 183. For that reason, we are of the opinion that the trial justice did not err when she denied the plaintiffs’ request to seek discovery on their alternate tolling theory.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the grant of summary judgment.

18,State : v. : Gary Gaudreau.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court.', 'The defendant, Gary Gaudreau, appeals from a judgment of conviction entered after a jury found him guilty of first-degree arson in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-4-2. The trial justice sentenced the defendant to twenty-five years—with nine years to serve and sixteen years suspended, with probation—for setting fire to his place of business, Physique Gym, during a severe snowstorm in the middle of the night on March 2, 2009. This case came before the Supreme Court for argument on March 1, 2016. The defendant raises two issues on appeal: (1) he challenges the admission into evidence of a video recording of his custodial police interrogation; and (2) he challenges the denial of his motion for a new trial on the basis that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. After careful consideration of the defendant’s arguments and a thorough review of the record, we affirm the judgment of conviction.', '-1-', '1', 'Facts and Travel', 'The Fire and the Early Morning Investigation', 'During the early morning hours of March 2, 2009, in blizzard-like weather conditions, the Physique Gym on York Avenue in Pawtucket became engulfed in flames. 1 At around 3:40 a.m., the Pawtucket Fire Department received a call and responded to the fire. The first officer to arrive at the scene reported the fire to be “code red, fully involved,” meaning that it was “an actual active confirmed fire” and “more progressed than you would normally expect on a certain arrival time.” Battalion Chief Timothy Mercer said that the fire was fought during “[s]ome of the worst conditions [he’d] experienced,” with “single[-]digit cold, heavy snow and quite windy.” Mercer described the conflagration as “quite extensive,” that “[f]lames were already shooting out the windows, [and a] heavy smoke condition [was] reducing the visibility in the area quite substantially.”', 'At about that same time, at 3:50 a.m., the gym’s proprietor, Gary Gaudreau, called the police to report a breaking and entering at his home. Predictably, Mr. Gaudreau quickly became the primary target of police interest for what was already suspected to be an intentional arson.', 'Officer David Dolan reported to Gaudreau’s home to investigate the reported breaking and entering. Because of the hazardous conditions, it took him approximately thirty minutes to go the four miles from the police station to Gaudreau’s home. The officer said that he was “paying special attention” because he had been informed on his way to the investigation that Gaudreau’s business was ablaze. Upon arrival, Officer Dolan observed only one set of tire 1', 'As set forth in detail, infra, there were two jury trials. The first jury trial was held in November 2012 and ended in a mistrial when the jury could not reach a verdict. The second trial was presided over by a different trial justice in September 2013. The facts presented here are derived entirely from testimony and evidence presented at the second trial, unless otherwise specified.', '-2- marks on the snow-covered driveway and he did not see any footprints on the sidewalk, in the driveway, or in the front yard. However, when he walked up the driveway toward the detached garage, Officer Dolan did see one set of footprints leading from the garage to the back porch area.', 'When Officer Dolan reached the back door of the home, he noticed a broken Plexiglas window, with glass on the ground, both outside and inside the door. Gaudreau admitted the officer into the kitchen and living room. At that time, Gaudreau told him that he had left his house at approximately 1:30 a.m. and drove around for a couple of hours because he was unable to sleep. He said that he returned home at approximately 3:40 or 3:50 a.m. and called the police about the break-in. Gaudreau also told the officer that the only thing that was missing from his home was a “fanny pack” that had been on an ottoman in the living room. He said that the fanny pack contained his keys to the gym, his wallet, and an unloaded handgun. Dolan did not investigate the rest of the house, relying on Gaudreau’s statement that he had searched the house and had found no one present and no other broken windows. Gaudreau also showed the officer an alarm-type system in his living room, explaining that “[w]hen it registers a noise, such as glass break [sic], there is a delay and then an alarm sounds.” Gaudreau explained that he believed that whoever had broken in came through the rear window, became spooked by the alarm, and grabbed the fanny pack before leaving through the same window.', 'At Officer Dolan’s request, Gaudreau showed him the garage, where the officer inspected the interior and exterior of the car, finding nothing of interest except that, when he touched the hood of the car, it felt cold. Officer Dolan explained that Gaudreau was helpful, cooperative, and even talkative throughout his investigation, but that he appeared to be “walking very slowly and deliberately,” or “gingerly.” Officer Dolan said that he was at Gaudreau’s house for about ten', '-3- minutes, but Gaudreau did not mention that he was aware that his business was on fire until the end of the investigation. At that time, Gaudreau told the officer that he was going to drive over to the scene of the fire at his gym.', 'Meanwhile, the battle to fight the blaze continued; the fire had progressed to a “third alarm,” meaning that the battalion chief had twice called for additional apparatus and manpower from within Pawtucket, as well as “mutual aid” from other communities. David Curran, a fire investigator with the State Fire Marshal’s office, arrived and photographed the scene in those early morning hours.', 'Detective Scott Feeley of the Pawtucket Police Department, the lead detective on the case, spoke to firefighters at the scene and contacted the property owner, George Gardinar. Mr. Gardinar informed Det. Feeley that he leased the property to Gaudreau for use as a gym and that he had allowed his insurance policy on the building to lapse a few years earlier. Detective Feeley then contacted Gaudreau and asked to speak with him at the police station about the fire and the breaking and entering. Around 7 a.m., he and Det. Robert Matook informed Gaudreau of his Miranda rights and informed him that, although he was a suspect, the interview was voluntary; the interview was not recorded. 2 Gaudreau told the detectives that he left the gym the night before at approximately 9:30 p.m., stopped at a bank on his way home, and made a deposit. He said that he was at home for a few hours and then he went for a drive at about 1:30 a.m. because he could not sleep. He said that he drove into and around Seekonk, Massachusetts, before returning home around 4 a.m. Detective Feeley said that Gaudreau told him that someone had broken into his house while he was out driving and that whoever broke into his home had taken his fanny pack containing his gym keys, his wallet, a firearm, and cash.', 'After the 2', 'Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).', '-4- interview, Det. Feeley searched Gaudreau’s car, house and garage, but nothing was seized, and Gaudreau returned home.', 'However, when Det. Feeley returned to the station, he was notified that a witness had contacted law enforcement at the scene of the fire. Paul Richard, a snowplow driver, met Det. Feeley at the police station and told him that he had seen Gaudreau at the Physique Gym earlier that night when he was plowing snow. He gave the detectives a signed statement explaining that he was called into work at about 9 or 10 p.m. that night to plow in the area of the gym. He said that he saw Gaudreau, with his car backed up to an open door at Physique Gym with the trunk open, at approximately 1:45 a.m. Mr. Richard explained that he was familiar with Gaudreau and with his car because he was a member of Physique Gym. About 15 minutes later, Mr. Richard recalled seeing Gaudreau in his car at the intersection of Newport and Columbus Avenues; indeed, he recalled flashing his lights for Gaudreau to go through the intersection. Mr. Richard also identified Gaudreau from a photo array.', 'The Interrogation', 'Not surprisingly, after he was identified by Mr. Richard, Gaudreau was asked to return to the police station around noon. Gaudreau voluntarily returned, again waived his Miranda rights, and was interviewed again.', 'The second interview was videotaped.', 'At trial, the video interrogation was played for the jury during Det. Feeley’s testimony. The interrogation began with the detectives asking Gaudreau to once again explain his whereabouts during the preceding night and early morning. After Gaudreau essentially repeated the same story that he related to Officer Dolan and during his 7 a.m. interview at the police station, the detectives asked him directly, “You had nothing to do with starting this fire?” Gaudreau responded, “Nothing to do with starting this fire.”', '-5-', 'Detective Feeley then said, “Well, now that we have that taped, I want to read the statement we have –.” He then read from Mr. Richard’s sworn statement explaining that he had seen Gaudreau at the gym around 1:45 a.m. Detective Feeley said he “showed him eleven pictures and guess who he picked out as the guy who was coming out the door at 1:45 a.m.?” Gaudreau responded, “Not me.” Gaudreau also denied the detectives’ accusations that “the jig is up,” that it was Gaudreau who set the building on fire, that there was a witness who knew him, and that Gaudreau was lying. The detectives repeatedly told Gaudreau that he was lying, that he made false statements to the police, that he made up the “cockamamie” story about his house being broken into, and that they were sure they would find his fanny pack at the gym.', 'Gaudreau steadfastly refused to change his story, saying, “The guy might have seen me earlier, but he didn’t see me anywhere near that time.”', 'When he continued to deny any involvement in setting the fire, Det. Feeley finally said, “You’re being charged with second degree arson. This is your last chance to be remorseful and give us a reason.” But after they failed to wrest a confession out of Gaudreau, the detectives left the room.', 'Curran, the fire inspector, who was also at the Pawtucket police station to meet with detectives and Gaudreau, advised the police that, because the building had been occupied within the past six months, the appropriate charge would be first-degree arson. When the detectives returned to the interrogation room a few minutes later, they informed Gaudreau that he would be charged with first-degree arson, a capital offense. Detective Feeley said, “So, is there anything you want to say? Because this is the last time we’re ending the interview. We’re going to bring you downstairs.” Gaudreau said, “No,” and was placed under arrest.', '-6-', 'The Post-Arrest Investigation', 'After Gaudreau was arrested, the detectives brought him to the cellblock to process him and to seize his clothing, so that they could be tested for accelerants. When Gaudreau’s clothes were removed, the detectives observed large sores on his lower legs and slight injuries on his hands.', 'When asked what had happened to his legs, Gaudreau replied that it was a rash. Gaudreau was brought to the hospital to be treated for his obvious injuries; Det. Feeley was informed by medical personnel that the sores were second-degree burns.', 'Detective Feeley then obtained warrants to search Gaudreau’s home for a second time, the garage, and the gym. In addition, the detective sought assistance from Sgt. Michael Peters of the Massachusetts State Police, a certified accelerant detection canine handler, who was brought in the next day. Sergeant Peters worked with a dog trained to search a fire scene and alert to the presence of petroleum products, or “flammable liquids that are carbon-based, gasolines, kerosenes, diesel fuels.”', 'There were no alerts from Gaudreau’s car, residence, or the clothing that had been confiscated at the time of his arrest. However, the dog did alert to four areas at the scene of the fire. Upon excavating, or de-layering, two of the areas, burned paper towels and the melted remains of what appeared to be a thirty-gallon Rubbermaid-type barrel were discovered. Also, a strong odor consistent with gasoline, one cap from a gas can, and rubber mats covering the floor were found. The other two areas also were de-layered and washed down, and irregular and “very significant burn pattern[s]” were discovered, consistent with “flammable liquid being poured out of a container and then ignited.”', 'At each of the four alert sites, fire inspector Curran collected samples in certified evidence cans to send to the state crime lab. Outside the building, near an entryway, a fanny', '-7- pack and what appeared to be the remains of a coat were found on the ground. Investigators recovered a scarf and fanny pack wrapped inside a charred “puffy type” winter coat and a set of keys to the premises that was “still in the lock.” The fanny pack contained a loaded handgun and Gaudreau’s wallet, driver’s license, pistol permit, eyeglasses, a cigarette butt, and about $493. The jacket pockets contained a small can of lock deicer, business cards, and a lighter. Burned matter and charred debris in tissues in a bathroom wastebasket were also seized from Gaudreau’s home, even though the accelerant detection dog never alerted to anything in the house.', 'Curran later testified that it was his opinion that, to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, there were four separate areas of origin for the fire and the cause was an intentional act of fire setting. He opined that:', '“the gasoline had been introduced into the trash cans, and even the', 'gas cans were left behind within these trash cans. And at that', 'point, a piloted flame or a match or a cigarette lighter, more than', 'likely a match, * * * was brought into contact with the contents of', 'the trash cans and the gasoline.”', 'When he was cross-examined at trial, Det. Matook 3 admitted that, although he seized several items—a gas can, rag, and burned fabric found in the car; the tissues and burnt matter found in the bathroom; a cigarette butt found in the burned jacket—he had not submitted any of those seized items to the state crime lab for analysis for accelerants or for DNA testing. He also conceded that the police did not dust for fingerprints at Gaudreau’s house; they had not obtained financial documents from defendant’s house or contacted Citizens Bank about Gaudreau’s bank account; they never investigated whether he was current on his mortgage, nor had they sought to obtain security footage from gas stations that were located near Gaudreau’s home and business. 3', 'Detective Feeley retired shortly after the gym fire and Det. Matook replaced him as lead detective on the case.', '-8-', 'Kim Freeland, of the Rhode Island state crime laboratory, testified that several samples from the fire scene had tested positive for gasoline and other types of volatile components.

Pretrial motions were heard before a justice of the Superior Court on November 14 and 15, 2012. The trial justice severed the two counts for trial and proceeded on the arson charge to ensure that defendant was not prejudiced by the state’s allegations that he made a false claim to the police when he reported the breaking and entering at his home.', 'The defendant sought, in limine, to suppress the videotaped interrogation on the grounds that comments by the detectives on the tape were irrelevant and highly prejudicial, and constituted inadmissible testimony concerning witness credibility. During a lengthy argument about the video spanning two days, defendant requested that, if the tape was not suppressed entirely, then it should be redacted and the jury should be given a cautionary instruction about the detectives’ comments. The trial justice denied defendant’s motion to suppress, but ordered that two lines at the end of the tape—about the veracity of the snowplow driver—be redacted.

Ms. Kane-Taylor identified the puffy jacket and scarf that were found at the scene as belonging to defendant and said that he wore them on a daily basis. She also testified that, in the weeks leading up to the fire, it seemed to her that products that were sold at the gym, such as protein bars, drinks, water, and magazines, were not being replenished.', 'The defendant testified in his own defense. He said he had owned Physique Gym for twenty-three years and that there were about 400 members as of March 2009. He testified that revenue was generated from membership and from selling nutritional supplements and other products and that his bills were current and his accounts were balanced. He said that he burned his legs at home in the early morning hours of March 1, 2009, the night before the gym fire, when an oil lamp he was filling spilled and caught on fire. He said that he told the police the burns on his legs were a rash because “they were claiming that I set fire to my gym. I said[,] ‘Uh oh. If they see my legs, they’re going to think I burned myself setting fire to the gym.’ I just came up with the first thing off the top of my head was, oh, it’s a rash.”', 'The defendant reiterated much of the story that he had repeatedly told the police, with various deviations. He said that the night before the fire, he was at home until about 9:30 p.m., at which time he went to the bank to make a deposit.

He testified that he parked his car right in front of the gym and backed up to the door. He could not recall what time he left; however, he recalled that a snowplow driver waved him through the intersection at Columbus Avenue and Newport Avenue when he was on his way home. He said that he was home for a little while, but, because he was unable to sleep, he went out for a ride. This, he said, was a normal practice for him. He testified that he drove to the Seekonk-Attleboro area “[b]ecause the roads are better plowed in Massachusetts.” He claimed that he arrived back at home just before 3:50 a.m. and discovered the break-in at his home.', 'The defendant testified that he had his fanny pack with him when he went to the gym on the day of the fire, but he took it off when he got home, and he did not take it with him when he went on his late-night sojourn to Massachusetts. He testified that he left the fanny pack on a hassock in the living room. He said he discovered that the Plexiglas window in his back door was broken when he returned. He said he called the police immediately after noticing that the fanny pack was missing as soon as he entered the house. However, he also testified that he soon received a call notifying him about the fire at the gym. Finally, defendant said that he owned several winter coats, including the coat and scarf that had been found at the scene, but that he kept that coat and scarf at the gym and wore a black fabric coat on Sundays.', 'At the conclusion of the evidence, the jury returned a guilty verdict for first-degree arson.

He further argues that any possible relevance was substantially outweighed by its enormously prejudicial impact because the jury repeatedly heard the detectives call defendant a liar.', 'Second, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial because there was no evidence linking him to the fire and, in particular, no evidence of an accelerant on his clothing, in his house, or in his car.', '2', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Videotaped Interrogation', 'The defendant argues that the first trial justice abused his discretion when he denied his motion in limine to either suppress or redact the recorded police interrogation. He maintains that the videotaped interrogation had no probative value because it did not contain a confession and because the detectives’ repeated accusations that defendant was lying were the equivalent of credibility testimony, which is absolutely prohibited from a witness. The defendant further argues that the prejudicial impact of the police officers’ comments outweighed any minimal relevance that the tape might have had because they do not provide context, because defendant did not change his story during the course of the interview.', 'The state argues, as it did in the trial court, that defendant’s statements were relevant as an “adamant” and “false” denial, which is evidence of guilt.

Although we have not yet adopted a rule requiring that all police interrogations be audio or video recorded, several organizations within the state have either adopted such rules or have recommended that police departments adopt them. 6 Now, as more interrogations are being recorded, this Court is faced with new issues that are associated with those recordings. 6', 'See, e.g., Task Force to Investigate & Develop Policies & Procedures for Electronically Recording Custodial Interrogations, Final Report (Feb. 1, 2012), available at https://www.ribar.com/UserFiles/FINAL-REPORT-MERI-TF.pdf (recommending that every law enforcement agency adopt uniform written policies and procedures requiring the electronic recording of custodial interrogations in their entirety); Rhode Island Police Accreditation Commission, RIPAC, Accreditation Standards Manual, Ch. 8, § 8.10 at 44-46 (May 2013),', '- 15 -', 'Often, defendants move to suppress confessions that have not been recorded because “[b]oth the Rhode Island and the Federal Constitutions bar the use in a criminal trial of a defendant’s involuntary statements.” State v.

It is a frequent argument that a videotape is the best evidence of whether a defendant’s inculpatory statements have met that test.', 'However, when a defendant does not challenge the admission of his own statements as being involuntary, but, as is the case here, seeks to suppress the statements of the police, trial courts must engage in a very different type of analysis. In these situations, it is our opinion that the evidence should be viewed like any other evidence; other grounds may exist for the introduction of such evidence, in its entirety or in a redacted form, pursuant to the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. See Rule 402 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence (“All relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by the Constitution of the United States, by the constitution of Rhode Island, by act of congress, by the general laws of Rhode Island, by these rules, or by other rules applicable in the courts of this state. Evidence which is not relevant is not admissible.”).', 'Several states have addressed the particular issue of whether a recorded interrogation is admissible when the defendant neither confesses nor challenges his statements as involuntary, but rather attacks the admissibility of comments made by police that are contained in the recording. The law is quite unsettled on this point, and there is a clear split in authority between the jurisdictions that have addressed the issue, with no apparent majority.', 'Some courts have found the evidence to be inadmissible opinion testimony that should not be admitted indirectly in the form of a recording, and they have held that such statements available', 'at', 'http://ripolicechiefs.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/RIPAC_Accreditation_ Standards_Manual_First_Edition_May_2013.pdf (last visited April 13, 2016).', '- 16 - must be redacted. In other words, those jurisdictions have reasoned that if the police statements would not be admissible from the witness stand, they should not come in through the backdoor via a videotape. See State v. Elnicki, 105 P.3d 1222, 1224-25 (Kan. 2005); Commonwealth v. Kitchen, 730 A.2d 513, 521 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1999); State v. Demery, 30 P.3d 1278, 1285 (Wash. 2001); Sweet v. State, 234 P.3d 1193, 1198, 1199 (Wyo. 2010). Other courts have held that such statements from police during an interrogation should not automatically be excluded as opinion testimony, but, rather, must be analyzed under the existing rules of evidence. See People v. Musser, 835 N.W.2d 319, 329-30 (Mich. 2013) (finding that the probative value of the interrogator’s statements was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, under Rule 403, and error was not harmless).', 'In Elnicki, 105 P.3d at 1224-25, the Supreme Court of Kansas addressed a similar issue in a trial for rape and sodomy, the only difference being that the defendant, throughout the interrogation and in later statements, repeatedly changed his story about the events of the night in question. The defendant told the police several varying versions of the facts, from having never seen the victim that night, to being too drunk to remember, to her agreeing to have oral sex for $25, and more variations, all the while denying that he committed rape. Id. The court held that, under its rules, a trial court has no discretion to allow one witness to testify about another’s credibility, and so reviewed the admission of the tape de novo. Id. at 1226. The court then held that the trial court erred when it admitted the videotape, explaining the following:', '“A synthesis of the referenced case law leads us to', 'conclude that it was error for Detective Hazim’s comments', 'disputing Elnicki’s credibility to be presented to the jury. The jury', 'heard a law enforcement figure repeatedly tell Elnicki that he was', 'a liar; that Elnicki was ‘bullshitting’ him and ‘weaving a web of', 'lies.’ * * * A jury is clearly prohibited from hearing such', 'statements from the witness stand in Kansas and likewise should', 'be prohibited from hearing them in a videotape, even if the', '- 17 -', 'statements are recommended and effective police interrogation', 'tactics.

The absence of a', 'limiting instruction merely compounded the already serious', 'problem, misleading the jury into believing that Hazim’s negative', 'comments carried the weight of testimony.” Id. at 1229. Thus, even where the defendant’s story shifted throughout the course of the interview, that court found that the statements of the detective on credibility were absolutely prohibited. Id.', 'Similarly, an intermediate appellate court in Pennsylvania held that videotaped comments by the police accusing the defendant of lying “were akin to a prosecutor offering his or her opinion of the truth or falsity of the evidence presented by a criminal defendant, and such opinions are inadmissible at trial.” Kitchen, 730 A.2d at 521. The court held that each of the defendant’s own statements made during the interrogation—wherein she admitted her relationship with the victim and the co-defendant, and to her presence at the scene, among other things—were relevant to determination of her guilt as an accomplice to the murder, and, therefore, analyzed the many statements of the police under Rule 403 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence. Kitchen, 730 A.2d at 519-20. Ultimately, the court held that instances where police accused the defendant of lying, where the defendant did not respond to questioning, and where police stated that they had a strong case against the defendant had to be redacted. Id. at 521-23.', 'The Supreme Court of Wyoming analyzed whether the trial judge committed plain error in allowing the state to present improper vouching evidence of a deputy in a recorded video and in testimony from the stand that he met with the victim and that he believed she was being truthful in her accusation.

The court held that, although the', '- 18 - defendant had not objected to any of that evidence, the deputy’s statements “violated in a clear and obvious way th[at] [c]ourt’s long-standing rules prohibiting a witness to express opinions about the accused’s mendacity and guilt and about the alleged victim’s truthfulness and credibility * * *.” Id. at 1204-05.', 'A majority of the Supreme Court of Washington held, in Demery, 30 P.3d at 1285, that an officer’s accusations amounted to opinion evidence regarding the defendant’s veracity should not have been admitted, but that the trial court did not commit reversible error in admitting the officer’s accusations because of the wealth of evidence against the defendant. The four-justice minority, who opined that the evidence was admissible, rested their decision on the fact that the evidence was not “testimony” because it was neither given under oath nor from the witness stand, nor was it offered to prove the officer’s opinion. Id. at 1280-85.', 'On the other hand, courts have found that statements made by officers during the course of an interrogation were not admitted in error. The majority of those courts held that the comments by law enforcement were probative because they provided context for the defendants’ shifting stories during the course of the interrogations. See State v. Boggs, 185 P.3d 111, 121 (Ariz. 2008) (en banc) (holding that the defendant “cannot establish prejudice because he did, in fact, provide multiple stories about his involvement; the jury did not need [detective]’s comments to know that [the defendant] lied”); Lanham v. Commonwealth, 171 S.W.3d 14 (Ky. 2005); State v. Castaneda, 715 S.E.2d 290, 295, 296 (N.C. Ct. App. 2011) (the defendant’s explanation of what happened when he stabbed the victim repeatedly shifted throughout his post- arrest interview; therefore, the detective’s statements were probative to give context to the defendant’s changing story and not substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice).', '- 19 -', 'A small minority of states that have considered the issue have held that a police officer’s statements have probative value for providing context even where the defendant, as here, made no inculpatory statements and had not changed his story during the interrogation. See Dubria v. Smith, 224 F.3d 995, 1001-03 (9th Cir. 2000) (no violation to fundamental due process, even though California law would have required that the tapes be redacted, because not every trial error constitutes a failure to observe fundamental fairness and because trial judge gave two specific instructions that cured prejudice); State v. Willis, 75 A.3d 1068, 1078 (N.H. 2013) (finding that probative value was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice because the officer’s comments were in the form of questions rather than accusations, and provided context for the defendant’s responses).', 'In Lanham, 171 S.W.3d at 26, the Supreme Court of Kentucky reviewed the range of decisions that have addressed this issue, noting that “it is quite difficult to synthesize a majority rule, especially given that the evidentiary rules in these various states differ significantly.” The court declined to adopt a rule that such evidence should be per se excluded as opinion testimony, reasoning that “[a]lmost all of the courts that have considered the issue recognize that this form of questioning is a legitimate, effective interrogation tool.” Id. at 27. However, the court also “recognize[d] that the introduction of such comments, no doubt, entails the possibility that the jury will misunderstand and accord to those comments an impermissible weight during deliberation.” Id. While specifically disagreeing with the Supreme Court of Kansas that the comments must be redacted, the court held that the appropriate remedy was for the court to provide the jury “a limiting admonition” “to inform the jury that the officer’s comments or statements are ‘offered solely to provide context to the defendant’s relevant responses.’” Id. at 28 (quoting Demery, 30 P.3d at 1283) (emphasis added). The court remarked that most other', '- 20 - courts have endorsed such an admonition and that Rule 105 of the Kentucky Rules of Evidence specifically provides for it, so long as the defendant requests it. 7 Id.', 'With that somewhat disparate background in mind, we now turn to the issues in the case before us. The defendant proposes several grounds for his claim that the trial justice erred in denying his motion to suppress or redact those portions of the interrogation that feature the police challenging defendant’s veracity about what he said he was doing the night of the fire. First, he argues that the evidence is inadmissible credibility testimony. See State v. Miller, 679 A.2d 867, 872 (R.I. 1996) (“Determination of the truthfulness or the credibility of witnesses is the exclusive province of a jury. * * * If the opinion testimony has the same ‘substantive import’ as if it squarely addressed and bolstered another witness’s credibility, it is inadmissible.”). Second, defendant argues that the statements had no relevance, under Rule 401, because the detectives’ statements did not have any tendency to either prove or disprove that he committed the arson and, furthermore, their statements provided no context to defendant’s statements because he never made any inculpatory statements or even shifted his story. Finally, defendant maintains that the statements of the detectives should have been excluded under Rule 403 because they were highly prejudicial due to the fact that the jury heard the same detective, who was on the stand while the video was played, repeatedly yell at defendant, call him a liar, and declare that his story was made up. 7', 'See Lanham v. Commonwealth, 171 S.W.3d 14, 28 n.57 (Ky. 2005) (Rule 105 of the Kentucky Rules of Evidence says, “When evidence which is admissible as to one (1) party or for one (1) purpose but not admissible as to another party or for another purpose is admitted, the court, upon request, shall restrict the evidence to its proper scope and admonish the jury accordingly. In the absence of such a request, the admission of the evidence by the trial judge without limitation shall not be a ground for complaint on appeal, except under the palpable error rule.”). Kentucky’s Rule 105 is different from Rhode Island’s Rule 105 in that the Rhode Island Rule does not contain the second sentence on review under the palpable error rule. See Rule 105 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence.', '- 21 -', 'As an initial matter, we must point out that the first trial justice’s ruling to deny defendant’s motion in limine addressed only the relevance of defendant’s statements, even though defense counsel conceded that defendant was not challenging the admission of his own statements. 8 Although we can infer that the first trial justice was not persuaded by defendant’s argument that the detectives’ comments were per se inadmissible as credibility testimony, it also does not appear from the record that he articulated a ruling on either that argument or on the balancing test required by Rule 403. The trial justice’s decision to admit the videotape was based solely on its probative value because he reasoned that, in the context of the entire case, the jury could conclude that defendant made false statements to the police, relying on our decision in State v. Diaz, 654 A.2d 1195 (R.I. 1995). We have held that failing to rule on an issue that has properly been raised is an error. See State v. Pona, 948 A.2d 941, 953 (R.I. 2008) (“Superior Court erred when it did not attempt to strike a balance between the necessity of admission and the danger of unfair prejudice”); see also Power v. City of Providence, 582 A.2d 895, 900 (R.I. 1990) (in the civil context, “[t]he trial judge erred in failing to rule on the legal question of whether the settlement agreement is invalid on the basis that it contravenes the act”).', 'Nevertheless, to the extent that the comments from the officers may have prejudiced defendant, we conclude that the admission of such evidence—when viewed in light of the other overwhelming evidence against him—was harmless.

Ceppi, 91 A.3d 320, 331 (R.I. 2014). “In order to meet the harmless-error test, there must be proof 8', 'Defense Counsel: “Not everything is admissible.

Higham, 865 A.2d 1040, 1046 (R.I. 2004)).', 'Because the statements by the detectives in this case were made during the course of an interrogation, it goes without saying that they were not spoken by a witness under oath during trial and, therefore, did not constitute “testimony,” as that term has traditionally been defined.

Much of the interrogation resulted in either nonresponsive answers or repeated denials from defendant.', 'Indeed, the majority of the video and transcript, after the initial confrontation with the witness statement, are dominated by the comments of the two detectives, with defendant occasionally responding in the negative. 9 Because of the paucity of relevant or useful responses to be gleaned from defendant’s consistent explanation of events and assertion of innocence, those officers’ comments cannot be said to have had any contextual value.', 'On the other hand, those comments certainly are prejudicial to defendant. The fact that the jury viewed a videotape of the very detective sitting on the witness stand telling defendant that he was a liar compounded the danger that the jury might have been prejudiced against defendant.', 'It is our view that defendant’s videotaped statements to the police, including that he had driven around aimlessly during near blizzard conditions while his business was completely engulfed in flames, that he had neglected to take his keys, glasses, wallet, and driver’s license with him, and that his home was broken into while he was gone, were far more prejudicial to him than anything said by his interrogators.

But, to the extent that there was any error in admitting the videotaped interrogation, we conclude that it was harmless. Viewing the prejudice against the tapestry of the factual evidence and bearing in mind the conduct, tone, and length of this particular interrogation, we cannot conclude that the passions of the jury would have been “so inflame[d] * * * as to prevent their calm and dispassionate examination of the evidence.” Gomes, 764 A.2d at 136 (quoting Fernandes, 526 A.2d at 498).', 'Although we conclude that the videotaped interrogation admitted against this defendant was not so prejudicial as to require a new trial, we believe such evidence should be judiciously considered for its probative value when, as here, the defendant makes no inculpatory statements. We echo the observation of the Supreme Court of Kentucky that there is a real concern that these types of interrogations have the potential to lead to substantial prejudice, see Lanham, 171 S.W.3d at 28, and trial justices should be alert to the danger of potential abuse, such as the introduction of manufactured evidence that would not be admitted at trial. See Kitchen, 730 A.2d at 521 n.5 (“if the Commonwealth had no witnesses to produce in the instant case, then any comments to Appellee, on the videotapes, relating to witnesses would have to be redacted; the deception would be permissible, but it could not be displayed before the jury since the police comments would be irrelevant and prejudicial”).

The trial justice concluded that the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that he set the fire willfully. Although the trial justice found that the police investigation “wasn’t perfect,” she nonetheless determined that the officers who testified for the state were credible. Despite her conclusion that, from an investigatory perspective, more could have been done, “they did a sufficient job to convince [her] and apparently to convince the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the [d]efendant planned and carried out the crime.” Critically, the trial justice also found that defendant’s version of events leading up to the time when Officer Dolan arrived at defendant’s home “lacked believability” and made no sense.', 'With respect to the eyewitness, the trial justice found that Paul Richard was a “credible witness even though he didn’t appear to be very sharp.

19,Robert Dominick : v. : State of Rhode Island. :,criminal,not affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The applicant, Robert Dominick, appeals from the denial of his application for postconviction relief. 1 The applicant maintains that the hearing justice erred by denying his application and in finding that he failed to present newly discovered evidence that would have entitled him to a new trial. This case came before the Supreme Court sitting at Smithfield High School pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'We note that subsequent to the notice of appeal in this matter, G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-9 was amended by P.L. 2015, ch. 92, § 1 to require an aggrieved party to seek review of a final judgment on an application for postconviction relief by filing a petition for writ of certiorari with this Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'The underlying facts in this case are set out in State v. Dominick, 968 A.2d 279 (R.I. 2009), in which this Court affirmed applicant’s conviction of assault and battery upon Glennis Beltram, a person over sixty years of age, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-10. 2 On May 30, 2006, Beltram was mowing her lawn near applicant’s property when a physical altercation erupted between the two next-door neighbors. Beltram’s account of the incident—and testimony in the underlying criminal trial—was that she was mowing her lawn when applicant approached her and told her to get off his property. She testified that she communicated to applicant that she was on her own property and on property owned by the state. Beltram testified that applicant then shoved her against a granite marker pole located on her property, causing scrapes to her right arm. She testified that she responded by spitting on applicant’s face and that, once again, applicant pushed her—this time “with all his force”—causing more injury to her right arm. She also claimed that, during their altercation that day, the lawn mower she had been using was damaged on the left side.', 'Beltram testified that after the altercation she entered her home, told her husband about the incident, and called 911. 3 Although Beltram did not choose to press charges when the police arrived at her home that day, she went to the Glocester Police Department that evening and filed 2', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-5-10 provides that “[a]ny person who shall commit an assault and battery upon a person sixty (60) years of age or older, causing bodily injury, shall be deemed to have committed a felony and shall be imprisoned not exceeding five (5) years, or fined not exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000), or both.” 3', 'The applicant’s account of the incident was significantly different. He claimed that Beltram was trespassing on his property and that, when asked to leave his property, she cornered him with the lawn mower. He testified that, after she spat on his face, he held the lawn mower in an attempt to protect himself and that after losing his balance, he leaned against Beltram, causing her to come into contact with the marker pole. His defense was that any injury caused to Beltram was either an accident or an act of self-defense.', '-2- a formal complaint. Beltram also provided a statement to the Glocester Police Department summarizing her account of the incident. This statement included her allegation that the lawn mower was damaged during the incident. As part of their investigation, the Glocester Police Department also acquired a statement from David Lohr, a witness who arrived at the scene during or shortly after the incident. At that time, when Lohr was asked if he had seen “any physical altercation take place between [Beltram and applicant],” he indicated that he “[did not] recall for sure.”', 'On August 8, 2006, the state filed a criminal information charging applicant with assault and battery upon Beltram. Attached to the criminal information were the statements made by Beltram and Lohr. 4 On February 22, 2007, the case proceeded to trial and, on the following day, the jury returned a guilty verdict. The applicant was sentenced to five years suspended, with probation, 5 fined $1,000, and ordered to complete 700 hours of community service.', 'The applicant then directly appealed his conviction to this Court, and his conviction was affirmed. Dominick, 968 A.2d at 285.', 'Following this Court’s decision in Dominick, Beltram filed a civil claim against applicant for the assault and battery (PM 09-2637). 6 During pretrial discovery in the civil case, Beltram produced a photograph of the lawn mower involved in the incident.

See G.L. 1956 § 9-1-2.', '-3- taken the photograph. She explained that the damage caused to the lawn mower as a result of the altercation was to the “left side” but acknowledged that it was not visible in the photograph. 7 Also during the civil action, applicant called Lohr as a witness. At deposition and at the civil trial, Lohr maintained that he had not witnessed any physical contact between Beltram and applicant, but he also characterized his initial witness statement as “probably the most accurate of what happened,” given that four years had since passed. At the close of the civil trial, the jury awarded Beltram $100 in damages, and $300 in punitive damages.', 'On April 8, 2014, applicant filed an application for postconviction relief pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-1, based on the evidence offered at the civil trial that had not been presented in applicant’s criminal trial, which he claimed was exculpatory. 8 On December 22, 2014, a hearing was held on his application. During the hearing and in his filings before the Superior Court, applicant relied on two items he described as “newly discovered”—(1) the picture of the lawn mower, coupled with the information that Beltram had disposed of the lawn mower, and (2) Lohr’s testimony. The applicant claimed that during the civil trial he learned for the first time that Beltram had destroyed the lawn mower involved in their altercation but that she had kept a photograph of the lawn mower. He claimed that the photograph could have been used to impeach Beltram’s testimony at the criminal trial that the lawn mower had been damaged as a result of applicant’s conduct because the photograph did not depict any damage to the lawn 7', 'It is undisputed that this photograph had never been presented to the Glocester Police Department or to the state during the criminal trial. 8', 'Section 10-9.1-1(a), in pertinent part, provides that:', '“Any person who has been convicted of, or sentenced for, a', 'crime, a violation of law, or a violation of probationary or deferred', 'sentence status and who claims * * * [t]hat the conviction or the', 'sentence was in violation of the constitution of the United States or', 'the constitution or laws of this state * * * may institute, without', 'paying a filing fee, a proceeding under this chapter to secure', 'relief.”', '-4- mower.', 'Additionally, applicant argued that Lohr’s testimony could also have impeached Beltram’s testimony, because he learned for the first time during the civil trial that Lohr had not seen any physical contact between Beltram and applicant despite being present at the scene. He maintained that this constituted newly discovered evidence entitling him to a new trial because Lohr’s previous statement attached to the criminal information indicated that Lohr was not sure what he saw that day, rather than that he had not seen any physical contact.', 'On December 29, 2014, judgment was entered denying applicant’s application for postconviction relief. In a written decision, the hearing justice, who had also presided over the criminal trial, found that the evidence applicant sought to label as “new” had in fact been available to applicant during his criminal trial. Specifically relating to the lawn mower, the hearing justice held that no responsibility for its loss and/or destruction could have been imputed to the state simply because Beltram decided “on her own, to take [the lawn mower] to a junk yard.” The hearing justice noted that Beltram was not a party to the criminal case and applicant “never asked to inspect the [lawn] mower” before or during his criminal trial. Moreover, the hearing justice characterized applicant’s “excitement over the missing lawn mower” as “mystifying,” given that the only issue for the jury to decide had been whether applicant assaulted Beltram—not whether the lawn mower had been damaged during their altercation. Furthermore, the hearing justice remarked that applicant’s “newly-found regret” for not having presented Lohr as a witness in his criminal trial “scarcely qualifie[d] as newly-found evidence.” Additionally, the hearing justice held that, “when juxtaposed to [applicant’s] own seriously flawed criminal trial testimony, his fresh offerings [were], at best, only marginally of value,” as he found applicant’s credibility “significantly lacking.” The hearing justice also concluded that the new evidence applicant relied on in his application would not have “in any way alter[ed] the', '-5- verdict if another trial were ceded to him.” Accordingly, the hearing justice denied applicant’s application for postconviction relief. Following the Superior Court’s decision and entry of final judgment, applicant filed a timely notice of appeal.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“This Court has previously stated that we ‘will not disturb a trial justice’s factual findings made on an application for post[]conviction relief absent clear error or a showing that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence in arriving at those findings.’” Bell v.

Quaweay, 89 A.3d 823, 828 (R.I. 2014). “If the evidence meets the four-part threshold prong, it then must meet the second prong, which is an assessment of whether it is ‘credible enough to warrant relief.’” D’Alessio, 101 A.3d at 1275 (quoting Ferrell v. Wall, 889 A.2d 177, 184 (R.I. 2005)).', 'A', 'Evidence of the Lawn Mower', 'On appeal, applicant argues that the hearing justice erred in rejecting his claim that the photograph of the lawn mower and knowledge that Beltram disposed of the lawn mower constituted newly discovered evidence. The applicant contends that, because the “sole issue for the jury in the criminal case was whether the contact was defensive or accidental, or whether [applicant] intentionally pushed * * * Beltram into the post with the intent of injuring her,” he needed any evidence that would contradict Beltram’s version of the incident. Because, in applicant’s opinion, the photograph of the lawn mower depicted no damage, applicant claims he could have used the photograph to impeach Beltram’s testimony in the criminal trial that the lawn mower was damaged as a result of their altercation.', 'We are of the opinion that the photograph of the lawn mower and the information regarding Beltram’s disposal of the lawn mower do not constitute newly discovered evidence for several reasons. First, this evidence was available at the time of the criminal trial, yet applicant completely failed to explore the issue of the lawn mower’s condition and whereabouts.', '-7- Beltram’s statement to the police, which was attached to the criminal information, included her allegation that the lawn mower had been damaged during the altercation.', 'Consequently, applicant was placed on notice—well before Beltram’s trial testimony—that she was claiming damage to the lawn mower. Nevertheless, applicant did not even attempt to discover any information regarding the lawn mower. Therefore, he cannot now establish that this evidence could not have been discoverable by due diligence, because he failed to “ma[k]e a reasonable investigation of evidence which was available to him prior to trial.” See Quaweay, 89 A.3d at 828, 829, 830 (holding that the defendant was not entitled to a new trial based on newly discovered evidence where “a careful reader who made a reasonable effort to follow up on [a witness statement to the police] could have unearthed all of the information which [the] defendant claim[ed] [was] newly discovered”). Additionally, at the criminal trial, applicant could have cross-examined Beltram concerning the lawn mower but, again, failed to explore the issue. See id. at 829. He cannot now rely on evidence he failed to develop by labeling it “new.”', 'Moreover, it is well established that, in order for new evidence to warrant postconviction relief, the evidence “must be material, not simply * * * impeaching.” D’Alessio, 101 A.3d at 1275. “Impeaching evidence * * * is ‘information that is not related to [the] defendant’s guilt or innocence and serves only to destroy the credibility of the [witness].’” Id. at 1276 (quoting Bleau v. Wall, 808 A.2d 637, 644 (R.I. 2002)). Even if applicant could meet his burden of establishing that with the exercise of due diligence the evidence relating to the lawn mower would not have come to light—which he cannot—this evidence would have served the sole purpose of impeaching Beltram’s testimony. See id. The applicant does not argue that this evidence would serve any purpose other than to cast doubt on Beltram’s criminal trial testimony. Furthermore,', '-8- the hearing justice concluded that any impeachment value the evidence could have had would not have changed the verdict at trial.', 'The hearing justice’s finding that the evidence relating to the lawn mower was not newly discovered and did not entitle applicant to postconviction relief is well supported by the record and not clearly erroneous. Accordingly, we decline to disturb his finding.', 'B', 'Lohr’s Testimony', 'The applicant also argues that the hearing justice erred in rejecting his claim that Lohr’s testimony was “newly discovered.” He claims that, although there appeared to be no reason to call Lohr as a witness at the criminal trial, Lohr’s civil trial testimony was far more telling and could have impeached Beltram’s version of events and bolstered the defense. The applicant argues that Lohr’s civil testimony was definitive—he had an unobstructed view of Beltram and applicant for a minute or two and had not observed any physical contact between them. Although applicant concedes that Lohr’s identity and his statement to the police had been disclosed in the criminal case, he claims that it was Lohr’s testimony in the civil case that constitutes new evidence and entitles him to a new trial.', 'Similar to the evidence relating to the lawn mower, Lohr was available at the time of the criminal trial, and his testimony could have been discovered and explored prior to the criminal trial with the exercise of due diligence. See Quaweay, 89 A.3d at 828, 829. It is undisputed that Lohr’s identity and witness statement were disclosed in the criminal information. Remarkably, the applicant conceded that he did not even attempt to contact Lohr during the criminal case. Accordingly, Lohr’s testimony cannot now serve as the basis for postconviction relief because the applicant had every opportunity to develop such information in a pretrial interview but failed', '-9- to do so. See State v. Hernandez, 641 A.2d 62, 72, 73 (R.I. 1994) (defense counsel’s failure to interview a known witness prior to trial meant that defense counsel did not use due diligence to obtain evidence from the witness before trial and, therefore, the evidence could not qualify as newly discovered). It is our opinion that the hearing justice was not clearly wrong, nor did he overlook or misconceive material evidence in finding that Lohr’s testimony was not newly discovered and did not entitle the applicant to postconviction relief. Accordingly, we, once again, see no reason to disturb his finding. 9', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. The record shall be returned to the Superior Court. 9', 'The applicant also made several broad constitutional arguments to this Court in his prebriefing statement, including that “[b]y disposing of the lawn mower, * * * Beltram effectively deprived him of the ability to make use of his compulsory process as guaranteed by” both the United States and the Rhode Island Constitutions and of his ability to “present exculpatory evidence.” He also claimed that her destruction of the lawn mower was “a deprivation of due process warranting dismissal of the criminal charges * * *.” It is well established that this Court generally “consider[s] an issue to be waived when a party ‘[s]imply stat[es] an issue for appellate review, without a meaningful discussion thereof or legal briefing of the issues * * *.’” Bucci v. Hurd Buick Pontiac GMC Truck, LLC, 85 A.3d 1160, 1170 (R.I. 2014) (quoting State v. Chase, 9 A.3d 1248, 1256 (R.I. 2010)). Accordingly, applicant’s constitutional arguments are not properly before this Court. In any event, his arguments lack merit. It is undisputed that the state did not have information regarding the lawn mower in the form of any picture and/or knowledge of the destruction of the lawn mower. Therefore, applicant cannot impute any knowledge of the lawn mower’s condition or whereabouts from Beltram to the state. Additionally, applicant failed to establish that the evidence he seeks to present was exculpatory in any way. As applicant himself fails to contest, the evidence he relied upon in his application for postconviction relief would serve, at best, to impeach Beltram’s testimony regarding the altercation. Accordingly, there is nothing to suggest, nor does applicant fully articulate, how any evidence would exculpate him of the charge of assault and battery.', '- 10 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S', 'OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'Robert Dominick v.

20,State : v. : Christian Rosado.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The defendant, Christian Rosado, appeals from a judgment of conviction on two separate counts of assault with a dangerous weapon, to wit, a firearm. The defendant maintains that the hearing justice erred in denying his motion for a mistrial based on what he perceived to have been the state’s discovery violation. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'This case involves a shooting that occurred in the City of Woonsocket, which left Ikey Wilson with severe injury to his stomach and required the amputation of his right leg. Three witnesses—Wilson, Jalisa Collins, and Travis Reeves—identified defendant as one of the three perpetrators of the March 30, 2013, shooting. On December 11, 2013, a criminal information was filed, charging defendant with assaulting Wilson with a dangerous weapon, to wit, a firearm,', '-1- in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2 1 (count 1), assaulting Collins with a dangerous weapon, to wit, a firearm, in violation of § 11-5-2 (count 2), and using a firearm while in the commission of a crime of violence, resulting in injury to Wilson, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-47-3.2(a) (count 3). 2', 'On September 15, 2014, the case proceeded to trial. At trial, Wilson was the first witness to testify for the state. He testified that, on the evening of March 30, 2013, Reeves, whom he considered a friend, entered Wilson’s residence wanting Wilson “to go to the liquor store[] because [Reeves] didn’t have [an] ID.” Wilson testified that at that time he resided on Arnold Street in Woonsocket with his fiancée, Collins, and two of his children. Wilson testified that although Collins “was actually going to go to the liquor store,” he decided that he did not want her “going out at that time of night by herself,” because he “[had] got[ten] into a couple of incidents with [defendant].” He testified that he had known defendant for “probably a little longer” than six to seven months at that time. Wilson further testified that they had had a friendly relationship, but that he had a falling out with defendant about “a month or two” prior to March 30, 2013, when defendant, along with about five other individuals, approached Wilson as he was walking his son to school. Wilson confirmed that he had also had other confrontations with defendant prior to that day.', 'Returning to the events of March 30, Wilson testified that he walked to the liquor store with Collins and Reeves and that Collins entered the store to purchase alcohol while he and Reeves waited outside. Wilson said that, on their walk back to his apartment, he saw defendant 1', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-5-2(a) provides, in relevant part, that “[e]very person who shall make an assault * * * with a dangerous weapon * * * shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than twenty (20) years.” 2', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-47-3.2(a) prohibits any person from “us[ing] a firearm while committing or attempting to commit a crime of violence.”', '-2- and approached him in an attempt to end their ongoing dispute. According to Wilson, defendant then “took off” while holding a phone to his ear. Wilson testified that the three then continued to walk home, having to cross a bridge on their way. Once they were at the bridge, he saw defendant “pull [a gun], cock it, and * * * fire[] [it].” Wilson further testified that he saw a total of three individuals that night involved in the shooting—one who stood next to defendant and another who stood nearby. Wilson identified the two individuals accompanying defendant as Smoke and City. 3 Wilson also testified that, although he had not personally known Smoke and City, he had seen them with defendant during the previous “incident when [he] was walking [his] son from school.” Wilson testified that he recognized Smoke and City because defendant was “always with them.”', 'Wilson further testified that, on the night of the shooting, before hearing the gun cock and attempting to flee in response, he was asked by City, “did you rob my boy[?]”—and Wilson responded that he had not. Wilson testified that at that time both City and defendant had a gun in their hands. Wilson testified that he “ran straight * * * to go toward [his] house over th[e] bridge * * * and then * * * when [he] turned around” the gun fired. Although he could not be certain, Wilson believed he had made it to the end of the bridge before being shot. He testified that he then observed defendant, Smoke, and City “just run off” and that he remembered “[waking] up in the hospital.” Wilson described his injuries, which included the loss of his right leg and injury to his stomach, and he testified that he spent roughly four months in the hospital and two months in rehabilitation.', 'On cross-examination, Wilson conceded that, in his initial interview on May 30, 2013 with Lieutenant Mark Cabral of the Woonsocket Police Department, he had not disclosed the 3', 'These were their nicknames. Although Smoke was later identified as Joshua Rojas, it does not appear that City has ever been identified.', '-3- prior school incident, but believed that he likely did not remember the incident at that time because he had just recovered from a coma. On redirect, Wilson clarified that he had, however, disclosed the prior school incident in an April 2014 meeting with Lt. Cabral and the prosecutor in this case. Wilson maintained that, in the April 2014 meeting, he had also disclosed that, during this previous incident, defendant had been accompanied by five or six individuals. 4', 'On the following morning of trial, defendant moved for a mistrial “based upon * * * Wilson’s answers to certain questions” on the previous day. The defendant explained to the trial justice that he had been notified by the state shortly before the trial began that “Wilson would testify that when [defendant] confronted [Wilson] at the school where [Wilson’s] son was, that [defendant] had five to six people with him as part of a group to confront * * * Wilson * * *.” However, defendant pointed out that at trial Wilson went a step further and testified that he could identify Smoke and City as the two involved in the shooting with defendant because they had been together at the previous school incident. The defendant maintained that he had not been informed by the state as to any testimony regarding Smoke and City’s presence at the previous incident. The defendant argued to the trial justice that this evidence was prejudicial because “it indicate[d] [he] had contact with [Smoke and City], and that they had some hard feelings as well toward * * * Wilson.” The defendant argued that, had this information been disclosed to him prior to trial, “there would have been more efforts to locate and try to talk to Smoke, or to find the identity of City, or to follow through with this information to try to either rebut it or uncover further details for [the defense] to use on cross-examination.” He claimed that the information should have been disclosed prior to trial, but he acknowledged that because the state was also 4', 'The state represented to the trial justice that it was not informed that the prior incident involved five to six other individuals until the morning of the trial and, notably, defendant does not dispute this representation.', '-4- unaware of Wilson’s account, the disclosure was not possible. The defendant argued to the trial justice that a cautionary instruction would not suffice and that the trial justice should grant his motion for a mistrial.', 'In response, the state requested that the trial justice deny defendant’s motion. The state highlighted that it also had not had the information that Wilson had allegedly disclosed to the police prior to Wilson’s actual trial testimony. The state pointed out that Wilson was at times combative on the stand and that he was “certainly * * * impeached on many, many, many inconsistencies,” but that these things went to his credibility and did not warrant a mistrial. The state also argued that, “if there was going to be an investigation into City and Smoke, * * * it would have been as to their roles into the shooting itself” and that it did not “quite understand why * * * defendant’s efforts to investigate the roles of City and Smoke would be redoubled just by the fact that they may have been present at a confrontation * * * several months[] prior to the night of the shooting.”', 'After hearing argument from both sides, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a mistrial and, in so doing, found that he “[did not] see anything unduly prejudicial * * * relative to the comment that * * * Wilson made about an incident at the school some five months prior to the incident * * * when he got shot.” The trial justice noted that Wilson’s first transcribed interview, conducted on May 30, 2013, and almost 150 pages long, “[was] replete with references to * * * Smoke and City.” The trial justice, therefore, found that the defense certainly knew about Smoke and City and that the new testimony had no “prejudicial effect on the case or the defense whatsoever.”', 'Following the trial justice’s denial of the motion for a mistrial, the trial continued and both Collins and Reeves testified about details that they recalled from the March 2013 shooting.', '-5- Additionally, two officers of the Woonsocket Police Department, Jason Berthellette and Irwin Harris, testified about their involvement in the case—from their observations upon arriving at the crime scene to their involvement in the investigation. Following the close of the state’s case, the defense called Lt. Cabral to testify. Lieutenant Cabral was the “case agent” responsible for overseeing this case. He testified that on no occasion had Wilson disclosed to him that defendant had other individuals with him during the prior school incident, nor did Wilson disclose the identities of any of the other individuals involved.', 'At the conclusion of the trial, on September 22, 2014, the jury returned a guilty verdict as to counts 1 and 2, and acquitted defendant as to count 3. On November 24, 2014, defendant was sentenced to a total of twenty years to serve; fifteen years on count 1 and five years to serve on count 2, consecutively, with fifteen years suspended on count 2. A final judgment of conviction was entered, and defendant filed a notice of appeal. 5', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'It is well settled that “a trial justice’s decision on a motion to pass the case is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial justice, and this Court will not disturb the ruling on such a motion absent an abuse of discretion.” 6 State v.

The defendant further maintains that he was “totally unaware that evidence of the prior altercation between [Wilson] and * * * defendant existed prior to trial.” He argues that he was denied the opportunity “to investigate the prior incident and determine what, if anything, actually occurred.”', 'The defendant concedes that the state’s failure to disclose was not intentional; however, he maintains that “there was a disclosure of highly relevant evidence mid- trial and the [c]ourt should have granted * * * defendant a mistrial and allowed him to * * * investigate that matter.”', '“When ruling on a motion to pass, the trial justice must assess the prejudicial impact of the statement in question on the jury and ‘determine whether the evidence was of such a nature as to cause the jurors to become so inflamed that their attention was distracted from the issues submitted to them.’” Cipriano, 21 A.3d at 428 (quoting State v. Brown, 619 A.2d 828, 831 (R.I. 1993)). “The trial justice makes this determination by examining the witness’s statement or remark in its factual context.” State v.

Simpson, 595 A.2d 803, 807 (R.I. 1991)). “A trial justice considering an alleged discovery violation pursuant to Rule 16 * * * should examine four factors: (1) the reason for the nondisclosure; (2) the prejudice to the other party; (3) whether or not a continuance can rectify any such prejudice; and (4) any other relevant factors.” State v. Marte, 92 A.3d 148, 151 (R.I. 2014) (quoting State v. Grant, 946 A.2d 818, 828 (R.I. 2008)).', 'At the outset, it is important to note that, although defendant argues to this Court that a Rule 16 violation occurred because he was “totally unaware that evidence of the prior altercation between [Wilson] and * * * defendant existed prior to trial,” the argument that he made before the trial justice differed in a significant way from the argument he makes before us. Before the trial justice, defense counsel argued that a mistrial was appropriate because the defense learned for the first time shortly before Wilson took the stand that “when [defendant] confronted him at the school where [his] son was, that [defendant] had five to six people with him as part of a group to confront * * * Wilson * * *.” (Emphasis added.) In his motion for a mistrial, defendant also relied on Wilson’s on-the-stand revelation that two of the six people accompanying', '-8- defendant during this prior incident were Smoke and City. Because defendant did not raise any challenge to the admission of testimony regarding the existence of a prior altercation altogether, but instead relied on the more specific information regarding who was present during the altercation, nor did he raise the constitutional arguments he now presents to this Court, we limit our review to the issues that were properly raised before the trial justice. 7 See State v. Ford, 56 A.3d 463, 470 (R.I. 2012) (“[a]s this Court has made clear, the ‘raise-or-waive’ rule precludes a litigant from arguing an issue on appeal that has not been articulated at trial”) (quoting State v. Brown, 9 A.3d 1240, 1245 (R.I. 2010)).', 'Accordingly, the issue before this Court is whether the trial justice was clearly erroneous in finding that the testimony disclosed by the state to defendant just moments prior to the commencement of trial, i.e., that Wilson would testify that five to six individuals were present during the prior school incident, and the information that was disclosed for the first time during Wilson’s direct examination, i.e., that Smoke and City were among those present, were not prejudicial and did not warrant a mistrial.', 'After reviewing the trial record and transcripts, it is our opinion that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in denying defendant’s motion for a mistrial.', 'Importantly, it is undisputed that any nondisclosure was unintentional. Additionally, the trial justice was in the best position to determine if the nondisclosure caused any prejudice to defendant, and we see no reason to disturb his finding that here defendant was not prejudiced. See Tully, 110 A.3d at 1191. 7', 'The defense counsel’s acknowledgment in his motion for a mistrial that the new evidence admitted at trial was not known to the state prior to Wilson’s testimony, and the state’s representation that it learned about the previous school incident in an April 2014 meeting at Wilson’s home—roughly six months before Wilson testified—indicates that the new evidence defense counsel was referring to in his motion for a mistrial was Wilson’s testimony that additional individuals were present at the prior school incident, and his identification of Smoke and City as part of that group.', '-9- References to Smoke and City were replete throughout Wilson’s initial statement to the police as accomplices to the shooting for which defendant alone was charged. Despite this, defendant did not attempt to contact Smoke or City, but argued that somehow evidence of their presence in a previous altercation that occurred months prior to the actual shooting would have created the need to contact these individuals.', 'This argument is unavailing.', 'If defendant wanted to investigate Smoke or City’s involvement further, he could have asked the trial justice for a continuance, but instead he insisted that a mistrial was the only proper remedy without articulating why a continuance would have been insufficient. See Chalk, 816 A.2d at 420 (affirming denial of a motion for a mistrial where “[t]he defendant ha[d] not articulated any reason why measures less severe than a mistrial would have been insufficient”).', 'Moreover, defense counsel questioned Wilson extensively regarding the inconsistencies between his statements to the police and his trial testimony. On one occasion during cross- examination, after attempting to highlight that Wilson had never previously disclosed the presence of other individuals at the school incident, defense counsel directly asked Wilson if he had fabricated the detail of the presence of other individuals to “make the case stronger,” and Wilson denied doing so. The inconsistencies between Wilson’s trial testimony and his previous statements to the police went to his credibility and were also highlighted both in cross- examination and during the defendant’s closing statement. 8 It is our opinion that the trial justice 8', 'In its closing statement, the defense highlighted the inconsistencies in the statements by the state’s witnesses, including the fact that Lt. Cabral corroborated that Wilson had not disclosed to him that a group of people were present at the prior school incident.

Mr. Voccola was the sole shareholder of three Rhode Island corporations—Capital City Investments, Inc. (CCI), City View Realty, Inc. (CVR), and West Side Investments, Inc. (WSI). Patricia was the President of all three corporations at the times at issue in this case. Patricia was also the sole member and manager of Red Fox. In 2005, Mr. Voccola filed suit in Providence County Superior Court against Stephen and Barbara seeking to revoke a purported gift of stock in a corporation called Redbrook Investments, Inc.

The action commenced by Mr. Voccola against Barbara and Stephen was subsequently dismissed by stipulation. The Settlement Agreement, which was entered as an exhibit at trial, stated in relevant part as follows: “[Patricia, Stephen, Paul, and Barbara] agree forthwith upon the signing of this agreement to discharge and/or release all mortgages and promissory notes which reference [Mr. Voccola], Jere Realty, Inc., Lakeview Realty, Inc., [CCI, WSI, and/or CVR].”', 'According to the Agreed Statement of Facts, on or about June 4, 2007, “three documents were signed purporting to be Waivers of Notice of Minutes of a Special Joint Meetings [sic] of the Stockholders and Board of Directors of [CCI, CVR, and WSI] respectively” (hereinafter the CCI waiver, the CVR waiver, and the WSI waiver, or the waivers collectively).

He further stated that the warranty deeds were also void because they were not supported by adequate consideration. The validity of Mr. Voccola’s signatures on the waivers and the corresponding conveyance of the properties at issue was the major factual issue to be resolved at trial,4 and it forms the basis of this appeal. The defendants also filed a counterclaim seeking “reimbursement for all sums expended [by the defendants] for taxes, maintenance, insurance and other charges on the properties which are the subject of [the] action,” which is also an issue on appeal. 3', 'It should be noted that, according to the Agreed Statement of Facts, Red Fox was not officially organized as a corporation until June 1, 2007. 4', 'As the final judgment in these actions reflects, one of the actions in Superior Court, PC 08-6628, was brought to enforce the terms of the 2007 Settlement Agreement requiring Patricia to discharge mortgages she held on certain properties owned by Mr. Voccola or one of his corporations. The other action, PC 08-1467, was brought to recover the property which Patricia transferred to Red Fox pursuant to the purported signatures of Mr. Voccola on the waivers approving the transfer. The parties limit themselves on appeal to an argument with respect to the transfer of the properties at issue, which was the subject of PC 08-1467, and we shall likewise do the same. As such, we shall discuss the Settlement Agreement only as it is relevant to this appeal.', '-4-', 'A bench trial was conducted over seven days in July of 2012. We relate below the salient aspects of what transpired at trial.', 'A', 'The Trial Testimony5', '1. The Testimony of Paul Voccola', 'Paul Voccola testified that Mr. Voccola and Patricia had “the best relationship between father and daughter that you can imagine for * * * a good 25, 30 years.” He further testified that Mr. Voccola said that “Patricia was the only one in his life that has ever done anything for him and that he was leaving all his property to her.” By contrast, when asked about his father’s relationship with Edward, Paul stated: “Well, for the past 35 years or so, there was actually no relationship at all.” He added that “they were not on speaking terms.” Moving on to the relationship between Barbara and Mr. Voccola, Paul testified that they had a contentious relationship due to what Paul claimed was the fact that Mr. Voccola gave “all the attention to his mistress’s daughter,” who was the same age as Barbara. He added that Barbara “really hated [Mr. Voccola] * * * through her whole life because of it.”', 'Paul indicated in his testimony that the signature on all three waivers was his father’s signature, but he also stated that he was not present when those waivers were signed. He further stated that it was his understanding that under the 2007 Settlement Agreement “various mortgages” “were supposed to be released.” He also acknowledged that, in his role as a licensed 5', 'It is important to note that the Agreed Statement of Facts provided as follows with respect to the testimony at trial:', '“The parties agree that all discussions by and between [Mr.', 'Voccola] and any of his children relating in any way to the above', 'matters shall not be deemed to be hearsay but shall be accepted', 'into evidence by this Court and given the weight that this Court', 'deems appropriate.”', '-5- real estate broker, he had received the “listing” for two properties from Patricia during the pendency of the instant case.', '2. The Testimony of Patricia Forte', 'Patricia testified that she opened a business named West Fountain Auto Body and Sales, Inc. (West Fountain) in June of 1997.', 'It was her testimony that her boyfriend, Kenneth Salvatore, was the general manager of West Fountain.', 'Patricia acknowledged during her testimony that she signed the Settlement Agreement because her brother, Stephen, told her to sign it. However, she testified that she did not read the document before she signed it. She further stated that, at the time of trial, she understood that she was required, under the Settlement Agreement, to release mortgages “held by [her] or Redbrook given by [her] father.” She stated that, when she realized that she was supposed to release the mortgages, she did not do so because her “father told [her] not to release them” due to the fact that he intended to “give [her] the property anyway.” She did acknowledge in her testimony that she held mortgages from her father, CVR, CCI, and WSI which had not been discharged at the time of the transfer of the properties at issue in this appeal.', 'With respect to a mortgage which her father gave to one Joe Tosoni, Patricia testified that her father was motivated to give the mortgage to Mr. Tosoni so as to obtain the money that he needed to pay some criminal fines. It was her further testimony that she “believe[d]” that she paid Mr. Tosoni $82,000 on her father’s behalf and that Mr. Tosoni was, thus, “paid in full.” She added that the mortgage was assigned to her and had not been released. When Patricia was asked at trial where she obtained the money to pay Mr. Tosoni she stated: “I think that was when I took the mortgage out on my house * * *.” The mortgage deed given by Mr. Voccola to Mr.', '-6- Tosoni and the Assignment of Mortgage from Mr. Tosoni to Patricia were both entered as exhibits at the trial.', 'Patricia’s testimony then turned to the day on which her father purportedly signed the waivers. She stated that, on June 4, 2007, Mr. Voccola came to West Fountain, as he did every day, and that on that day he told her he was “going to sign the property over to [her].” She testified that on that day she saw her father read (or have read to him) all three of the waivers and she saw him sign all three waivers.', 'She further stated that she, Raphael Fernandez, Mr. Salvatore, and an individual by the name of James Levitt, who prepared the waivers, were present when the waivers were signed. She specifically identified her father’s signature on each of the waivers at trial. Patricia added that the Exhibit A referenced in the waivers was not attached to them and she had not, at the time of trial, located Exhibit A.', 'It was Patricia’s further testimony that she executed the warranty deeds transferring the properties at issue from CVR, CCI, and WSI to Red Fox in her capacity as President of CVR, CCI, and WSI. According to her testimony, her father told her “on a million occasions” that she was getting all of his property, and she said that she remained close to him until his death, despite the instant actions. She indicated that he had conflicts with his other children. However, she did read a portion of her father’s 2008 will at trial, which provided that she would not inherit since she would be deemed to have predeceased her father unless she transferred back to him the properties conveyed to Red Fox.', 'A videotape of a will signing from January of 2004 was played before the jury at trial. In the video, Mr. Voccola was seen signing his January 2, 2004 will; and, in the course of the videotape, he disparaged each of his children, with the exception of Patricia. The videotape revealed him stating that “Patricia [was] going to be the sole owner of everything.”', '-7-', '3. The Testimony of Barbara Voccola', 'Barbara Voccola testified that in December of 2007 her father tried to obtain from Patricia “all his corporate records” regarding his properties, but that Patricia resisted providing them for several weeks. She stated that it was only by being told by Paul that Mr. Voccola found out that Patricia had transferred his properties to Red Fox. It was Barbara’s further testimony that Mr. Voccola asked Patricia to “give him back all his property” and that, when she did not do so, Mr. Voccola retained an attorney to commence litigation against Patricia. Barbara stated in her testimony that her father knew that “his property had been illegally transferred.” It was her testimony on cross-examination that she had an “on and off relationship” with her father “over the years.” It was additionally her testimony that Patricia was not involved in her father’s care in late 2009 and 2010, nor did she visit him on a regular basis.', '4. The Videotaped Deposition of Pauline Patchis', 'Pauline Patchis was plaintiffs’ handwriting expert. Her videotaped deposition in relation to Mr. Voccola’s purported signature on the WSI waiver was played for the jury at trial due to her unavailability. According to the trial justice’s written decision, Ms. Patchis testified at deposition that, in her expert opinion, the waivers were signed by someone other than Mr. Voccola.', '5. The Testimony of Dr. Marc Seifer', 'Marc Seifer, Ph.D. was defendants’ handwriting expert. He testified at trial concerning the WSI waiver.6 After discussing in detail his process of analyzing a signature, Dr. Seifer 6', 'Doctor Seifer was restricted by the trial justice to testifying with respect to only Mr. Voccola’s signature on the WSI waiver; thus, he did not testify about the signatures on the CVR and CCI waivers. His testimony was so restricted because defendants had failed to update their answers to interrogatories to indicate that Dr. Seifer would be testifying about the CVR and CCI waivers and not simply about the WSI waiver. We are aware that it was conceded that plaintiffs', '-8- concluded that in his expert opinion Mr. Voccola signed the WSI waiver. During the course of his testimony, he was critical of Ms. Patchis’s report.', 'Additionally, on cross-examination, Dr. Seifer responded in the affirmative when he was asked: “[A]t the time you were studying [Ms. Patchis’s] conclusion, you had already formed the opinion that she was wrong and the signature was actually Mr. Voccola’s?”', '6. The Testimony of Stephen Voccola', 'Stephen Voccola testified that his relationship with his father became “adversarial” after his father commenced the 2005 litigation in which he was named as a defendant. However, he testified that their relationship was mended in 2007. He stated that he was an attorney and that, before the instant suit commenced, his father asked him “if [he] would represent him to sue Patricia to get the property he had given her back;” it was Stephen’s testimony that he declined his father’s request. It was further his testimony that in 2010 his father complained to him that Barbara and Edward were “constantly badgering him to transfer property into their name” and were threatening to put him in a nursing home. However, Stephen acknowledged on cross- examination that he had recently filed his own lawsuit against Barbara and Edward concerning the pour-over trust set up in Mr. Voccola’s will.', 'Stephen testified that his father’s signatures on all three waivers were genuine. He specifically stated with respect to all of the waivers that his belief that the signatures were genuine was “without equivocation.”', '7. The Testimony of Raphael Fernandez', 'Raphael Fernandez testified that he owned an auto repair business which had operated out of the same location as West Fountain and that he was permitted to use one of the automobile were given copies and made aware of the CVR and CCI waivers themselves at least nine months prior to trial.', '-9- bays in the West Fountain building. He testified that on a day in June of 2007 he had spoken with Mr. Voccola, who indicated that he was signing all of his property over to Patricia that day. It was his further testimony that on that day he saw Mr. Voccola read several papers, have them read to him, and ultimately sign them. However, Mr. Fernandez stated that he did not recall whether Mr. Voccola signed one or several documents.', 'He acknowledged on recross- examination that Patricia had given Mr. Salvatore and him a ride to the courthouse on the morning of that trial day.', '8. The Testimony of Kenneth Salvatore', 'Kenneth Salvatore testified that he was the general manager at West Fountain. It was his further testimony that he was present at the June 4, 2007 meeting at West Fountain, at which meeting Patricia and Mr. Voccola were in attendance. He testified that Mr. Voccola stated that he was signing his property over to Patricia. Mr. Salvatore further stated that he saw Mr. Voccola sign the documents, although he said that he was not sure exactly how many documents there were. Mr. Salvatore acknowledged on cross-examination that he had been living with Patricia since 1996 or 1997.', '9. The Testimony of Edward R. Voccola', 'Edward R. Voccola testified that his relationship with his father become close in 2004; he stated that it was a “turning point” in his relationship with his father. He further testified that his father’s motivation to sign the Settlement Agreement in 2007 was to “get [the] liens off” his property. According to Edward’s testimony, in January of 2008, Mr. Voccola told him that Patricia had told Mr. Voccola that he no longer owned most of his properties. Edward also testified that he reviewed the WSI waiver with his father and that his father stated that he “never', '- 10 - signed any document, nor had any discussion concerning anything like [the] transaction [represented in the waiver].”', 'B', 'The Superior Court Decision', 'In January of 2013, the trial justice issued a thorough and well-articulated written decision. Initially, the trial justice found that the Settlement Agreement was the product of mutuality of assent and was supported by adequate consideration. She gave no weight to Patricia’s statement that she did not read the Settlement Agreement but rather determined that Patricia “intended to be bound by the Settlement Agreement.” The trial justice went on to state, with respect to Patricia, as follows: “[She] was a party to the Settlement Agreement and was therefore legally obligated to perform under its terms, which required her to release the mortgages [on Mr. Voccola’s properties].” Thus, it was the trial justice’s holding that “[t]he mortgages should have been discharged effective as of the date of the Settlement Agreement” and that “any subsequent conveyance of property to [Patricia], which was performed in exchange for [Patricia’s] release of mortgages on those properties, was done without consideration.”', 'With respect to the validity of Mr. Voccola’s signatures on the waivers, the trial justice found that Mr. Fernandez and Mr. Salvatore were “biased” due to their close relationship with Patricia, and she gave their testimony “little weight.” She did, however, find credible Stephen’s testimony about his father’s intent to recover the properties. Moreover, the trial justice accepted the testimony of Ms. Patchis, and she found that Mr. Voccola did not sign the WSI waiver. She gave little weight to Paul and Stephen’s testimony that the signatures on the waivers were their father’s due to the “divisive nature of the relationship of the siblings,” Paul’s economic interest, as a real estate broker, in Patricia’s success in the case, and Stephen’s lawsuit against Barbara', '- 11 - and Edward. Additionally, the trial justice did not find Dr. Seifer’s testimony to be credible, stating that he reached a conclusion on the validity of the signature before he prepared his report. The trial justice then proceeded to conduct her own analysis of the signatures at issue to determine their authenticity, and she concluded that they were not Mr. Voccola’s signatures. Accordingly, she declared the deeds transferring Mr. Voccola’s properties from CCI, CVR, and WSI to Red Fox to be null and void.', 'The trial justice also found that Patricia, as President of CCI, CVR, and WSI, breached her fiduciary duties by engaging in self-dealing when she transferred the properties at issue to her own company for no consideration. It was then her further ruling that the omission of exhibits (i.e., Exhibit A) to the waivers, which exhibits purported to describe the properties in question, rendered her unable to determine what transactions, if any, were allegedly approved at the purported May 29, 2007 meeting.', 'In the next section of her analysis, the trial justice rejected Patricia’s argument that the conveyance of the properties was a gift, finding no credible evidence that Mr. Voccola possessed a donative intent or that a delivery of the properties took place. In concluding that there was no donative intent the trial justice pointed to: (1) the fact that Mr. Voccola did not sign the waivers; (2) his attempts to sue Patricia to force her to return the properties; and (3) the intent manifest in his later estate plan (i.e., the 2008 will that Patricia read into the record at trial), which excluded Patricia from any inheritance. Lastly, with respect to Patricia’s counterclaim, the trial justice found Patricia’s testimony credible and stated that she had established “damages in the amount of $82,000, plus statutory interest, for a debt owed her from [Mr. Voccola].”', 'The plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration with respect to the decision on the counterclaim, which the trial justice denied following a February 22, 2013 hearing.', 'Final', '- 12 - judgment entered on March 12, 2013. The defendants then filed a timely notice of appeal on March 29, 2013. Subsequently, defendants’ motion for a new trial was denied following an April 12, 2013 hearing. The plaintiffs then filed their cross-appeal three days after the hearing.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'The following quotation aptly describes the nature of our deferential review of the factual findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury in a civil case:', '“It is well established that the factual findings of a trial', 'justice sitting without a jury are accorded great weight and will not', 'be disturbed unless the record shows that the findings clearly are', 'wrong or the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material', 'evidence. * * * If, as we review the record, it becomes clear to us', 'that the record indicates that competent evidence supports the trial', 'justice’s findings, we shall not substitute our view of the evidence', 'for [that of the trial justice] even though a contrary conclusion', 'could have been reached.” Wellington Condominium Association', 'v.

The defendants devote much of their appellate argument to the issue of the genuineness or lack of genuineness of the signatures of Mr. Voccola on the waivers. However, after a thorough review of the parties’ arguments, the record in this case, and the exemplary decision of the trial justice, it is our conclusion that we need not even address the genuineness vel non of the signatures in order to review the trial justice’s decision concerning the waivers and the transfer of the properties.7 The trial justice clearly stated in her decision that the transfer of properties at issue, which transfer was executed in exchange for Patricia’s 7', 'Although we need not delve into the specific arguments raised on appeal with respect to the trial justice’s determination that Mr. Voccola’s signatures on the waivers were not genuine in order to determine the validity of the waivers and the transfer of the properties, the genuineness of the signatures does become relevant to our analysis of whether or not Mr. Voccola gifted the properties to Patricia. As such, some of the arguments raised by defendants on appeal with respect to the signatures will be briefly discussed in Part III.B, infra.', '- 14 - agreement to release the mortgages on the properties, was done without consideration due to the fact that Patricia had already agreed to release the same mortgages in the Settlement Agreement. We are in agreement with that determination; and, in our judgment, the lack of consideration renders the warranty deeds authorizing the transfer of the properties at issue null and void.', 'It is a well-established principle that a valid contract requires “competent parties, subject matter, a legal consideration, mutuality of agreement, and mutuality of obligation.” DeLuca v. City of Cranston, 22 A.3d 382, 384 (R.I. 2011) (mem.) (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted); see DeAngelis v. DeAngelis, 923 A.2d 1274, 1279 (R.I. 2007). With respect to the requirement of consideration specifically, we have stated that consideration “consists of some legal right acquired by the promisor in consideration of his promise, or forborne by the promisee in consideration of such promise.” DeLuca, 22 A.3d at 384 (quoting DeAngelis, 923 A.2d at 1279); see Darcey v. Darcey, 29 R.I. 384, 388, 71 A. 595, 597 (1909); see also Hayes v. Plantations Steel Co., 438 A.2d 1091, 1094 (R.I. 1982) (“In this jurisdiction, consideration consists either in some right, interest, or benefit accruing to one party or some forbearance, detriment, or responsibility given, suffered, or undertaken by the other.”).', 'In determining whether there is sufficient consideration to support a finding that a contract has been formed, “we employ the bargained-for exchange test; that test provides that something is bargained for, and therefore constitutes consideration, ‘if it is sought by the promisor in exchange for his promise and is given by the promisee in exchange for that promise.’” DeAngelis, 923 A.2d at 1279 (quoting Filippi v. Filippi, 818 A.2d 608, 624 (R.I. 2003)); see also DeLuca, 22 A.3d at 384.', 'In this case, assuming without deciding that the waivers were signed by Mr. Voccola, Patricia bargained for the transfer of the properties to Red Fox and Mr. Voccola bargained for', '- 15 - the release of the mortgages on the properties held by Patricia. Each promise induced the other promise. However, the Settlement Agreement provides as follows: “[Patricia, Stephen, Paul, and Barbara] agree forthwith upon the signing of this agreement to discharge and/or release all mortgages and promissory notes which reference [Mr. Voccola], Jere Realty, Inc., Lakeview Realty, Inc., [CCI, WSI, and/or CVR].” Based upon the clear and unambiguous language of the Settlement Agreement, Patricia was obligated to release the mortgages she held on the property. See Rivera v. Gagnon, 847 A.2d 280, 284 (R.I. 2004) (“If the contract terms are clear and unambiguous, judicial construction is at an end for the terms will be applied as written.”). Due to the fact that the Settlement Agreement predated the signing of the waivers, it necessarily follows that, at the time of the signing of the waivers, Patricia was already obligated to release the mortgages. Therefore, the consideration she promised to Mr. Voccola, which induced his promise to transfer the properties, was nonexistent because it was something which she was already under a contractual obligation to carry out.', 'It is a basic principle of contract law that “[a] promise to carry out a preexisting contractual obligation owed to the promisee, or the performance of such a contractual duty, generally is not sufficient consideration; in such a case, the obligor is doing no more than he or she was already obliged to do and, thus, has sustained no detriment, nor has the other party to the contract obtained any benefit.” 17 C.J.S. Contracts § 153 at 535 (2011). Thus, “when a party performs an obligation owed under a preexisting contract, the law ordinarily will regard a demand by that party for additional benefits as void for lack of consideration.” Id. That is precisely the situation with which we are presented—Patricia was essentially seeking additional benefits in the form of the transfer of the properties in exchange for the same promise that she had made in the Settlement Agreement. As such, the signing of the waivers in the instant case', '- 16 - was not accompanied by the legal consideration necessary to make those waivers binding contracts. See DeLuca, 22 A.3d at 384. Accordingly, the trial justice did not err in holding that the three warranty deeds transferring the properties at issue were null and void.', 'The defendants contend that the waivers were supported by adequate consideration because Patricia was “not bound” by the Settlement Agreement. They aver that Patricia was not a party to the 2005 lawsuit and that, therefore, there was no consideration for her signing of the Settlement Agreement. However, defendants fail to recognize that, although the Settlement Agreement resolved the issues involved in the 2005 litigation and resulted in its dismissal, the fact that Patricia was not a party to that action does not mean she did not have an interest in the resolution of that action as a shareholder in Redbrook. The Settlement Agreement resolved conflicts among Stephen, Barbara, and Mr. Voccola that were directly related to and directly affected Redbrook. Patricia was a shareholder of Redbrook. As such, she had an interest in the resolution of the 2005 suit. Thus, it is clear to us that the Settlement Agreement was a valid and enforceable contract made with adequate consideration. See id.', 'In conclusion, it is our judgment that the three warranty deeds at issue were null and void due to the lack of consideration for the signing of the waivers. Accordingly, we perceive no error in the trial justice’s decision in that regard.8 8', 'The defendants additionally contend on appeal that the trial justice committed error in declaring that the waivers were legally ineffective because the exhibits describing the properties (i.e., Exhibit A) were missing. The defendants aver that the omission of the exhibits was a “mere ‘scrivener’s error.’” Due to the fact that we find the waivers and, thus, the conveyance of the properties to be void as lacking in consideration we need not address the effect of the missing exhibits. See Grady v. Narragansett Electric Co., 962 A.2d 34, 42 n.4 (R.I. 2009) (referencing this Court’s “usual policy of not opining with respect to issues about which we need not opine”).', '- 17 -', 'B', 'Gift', 'The defendants also contend that the trial justice erred when she determined that the transfer of Mr. Voccola’s properties was not a gift to Patricia. They fault the trial justice for looking to Mr. Voccola’s actions after the supposed signing of the waivers because they contend that what was at issue was his present intent at the time of the alleged gift. They further aver that the trial justice did not give adequate consideration to the evidence which reflected that Mr. Voccola had stated several times before the signing of the waivers that he was going to give Patricia all of his properties. Lastly, they claim that, due to the fact that this was a transfer of property from a father to a child for no consideration, it was presumptively a gift.', 'We begin our analysis by reviewing our well-settled jurisprudence with respect to what constitutes a gift. There are two elements which are required for a valid inter vivos gift. See Notarantonio v. Notarantonio, 941 A.2d 138, 150 (R.I. 2008). Those elements are: “‘a present true donative intent’” and “‘some manifestation such as an actual or symbolic delivery of the subject of the gift so as to completely divest the donor of dominion and control of it.’” Dellagrotta v. Dellagrotta, 873 A.2d 101, 110 (R.I. 2005) (quoting Black v. Wiesner, 112 R.I. 261, 267, 308 A.2d 511, 515 (1973)); see also Silva v. Fitzpatrick, 913 A.2d 1060, 1063 (R.I. 2007); Ruffel v. Ruffel, 900 A.2d 1178, 1189 (R.I. 2006). It has been our consistent holding as follows:', '“[A] claimant has the burden of establishing a gift inter vivos by', 'clear and satisfactory evidence. * * * He must establish by such', 'degree of proof that the donor intended * * * to divest himself of', 'the exclusive ownership and control over the subject matter of the', 'alleged gift and to vest such ownership and control jointly in the', 'claimant.

Gifts § 16 at 203 (2008).', 'The defendants posit that the trial justice’s decision that the transfer of properties was not a gift was improperly “based exclusively on her own examination of the CCI and CVR waiver signatures, [Ms.] Patchis’ deposition testimony on the WSI waiver signature, and the trial justice’s findings about the Decedents’;s [sic] words and actions that took place more than a year after he gave the properties to [Patricia].” (Emphasis in original.) Upon a thorough review of the record and the trial justice’s comprehensive decision, we simply cannot agree that the trial justice erred in her determination that the transfer of the properties was not a gift or that she erred in the facts which she chose to consider in making that determination. She definitively stated', '- 19 - that defendants had “failed to establish by clear and satisfactory evidence either a present donative intent or delivery of the subject of the gift.” We are in agreement.', 'The defendants correctly observe that we have endorsed the principle that the law presumes a gift when the conveyance is from a parent to a child provided there is no “clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.” Romano v. Romano, 99 R.I. 33, 38, 205 A.2d 583, 586 (1964). However, we note initially that the transaction at issue in this case does not bear the hallmarks of a gift from a parent to a child. The transaction at issue was a conveyance from three corporations to one corporation in return for what, if Mr. Voccola did in fact sign the waivers, he must have believed was adequate consideration (although we have now determined it was not). Indeed, the title of the waivers indicates the nature of the transaction: “Waivers of Notice of Minutes of a Special Joint Meetings [sic] of the Stockholders and Board of Directors of [CCI, CVR, and WSI] respectively.” We note as well that the size of the conveyance—nearly two million dollars worth of property—and the fact that the purported transfer, surprisingly, came very soon after Mr. Voccola had spent several years on the 2005 litigation in an attempt to regain control of one of his properties that was then owned by Redbrook. Moreover, after a review of the record in the instant case, it is our judgment that the evidence in this case is such that it appears that any presumption of a gift which may have existed was effectively rebutted.', 'Indeed, the testimony suggesting that Mr. Voccola did sign the waivers, which would have supported a determination of donative intent, was found by the trial justice not to be credible. She specifically said that she did not find credible the testimony of Paul and Stephen to the effect that it was their father’s signature on the waivers. Additionally, the trial justice gave “little weight” to the testimony of Mr. Salvatore and Mr. Fernandez due to their close relationships with Patricia. We accord her credibility determinations and any inferences or', '- 20 - conclusions which she drew from them substantial deference. See Banville, 84 A.3d at 430. We acknowledge that there was testimony that Mr. Voccola had told Patricia in the past that he would give her all of his properties. However, due to the fact that, if Mr. Voccola signed the waivers, he clearly did so believing that there was adequate consideration (which is not characteristic of a gift) coupled with the fact that there was disagreement as to whether or not Mr. Voccola actually signed the waivers, we simply cannot say that Mr. Voccola’s donative intent was clearly manifested at the time he purportedly signed the waivers in the instant case. See Ferer, 732 N.W.2d at 674. As such, we see no error on the part of the trial justice in looking to acts taken by Mr. Voccola after he purportedly signed the waivers in determining whether or not defendants had met their burden of proving that the transfer was an inter vivos gift. See id.', 'When the post-conveyance acts of Mr. Voccola are considered, it becomes clearer to us that the trial justice correctly concluded that the conveyance of the properties at issue was not a gift. Stephen testified that Mr. Voccola asked him to sue Patricia to get the properties back. Barbara testified that Mr. Voccola only found out from Paul that Patricia had transferred his properties and that Mr. Voccola asked Patricia to “give him back all of his property.” Edward testified that his father told him that he never signed the WSI waiver. What is more, Mr. Voccola’s 2008 will and later codicil excluded Patricia from any inheritance unless she returned the properties at issue. Moreover, we find it relevant that no gift tax return was filed by Patricia or Red Fox with respect to the conveyance of the properties at issue.9 9', 'We recognize that we have stated that the existence of a gift tax return is not “conclusive evidence that a gift has been made.” Gervais v. Gervais, 688 A.2d 1303, 1306 (R.I. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, “[w]e read th[at] statement simply to mean that gift-tax returns should be considered but are not to be treated as a final litmus test.” Id.', '- 21 -', 'In addition to all of the just-referenced facts that we consider to be reflective of a lack of donative intent, we note that the trial justice found that Mr. Voccola did not in fact sign the waivers, negating any argument that the properties were transferred in accordance with Mr. Voccola’s donative intent.', 'We decline any invitation by defendants to second-guess the credibility determinations of the trial justice with respect to the two handwriting experts presented at trial. See Banville, 84 A.3d at 430. It is clear to us that her determinations were supported by the testimony elicited at trial. We also find no error in the trial justice’s using her own analysis of the signatures with respect to the WSI waiver as one of several reasons why she found the signatures not to be genuine.10', 'Donative intent is an issue of fact. See Mitchell, 756 A.2d at 183. We give such determinations by a trial justice great weight; and, as the many just-discussed facts indicate, there was a more than ample factual basis on which the trial justice could have based her determination that Mr. Voccola was not executing an inter vivos gift when he purportedly signed the waivers and the properties at issue were ultimately transferred.', 'See Wellington Condominium Association, 68 A.3d at 599.11 Accordingly, we perceive no error on the part of the trial justice in her ruling rejecting defendants’ gift-related contentions. 10', 'We deem it important to note that defendants’ contentions on appeal with respect to the validity of Mr. Voccola’s signatures include a contention that the presumption of validity of the signatures was never rebutted with respect to the CVR and CCI waivers and that it was inappropriate for the trial justice to rely on her own analysis of the signatures on the CVR and CCI waivers since her determination was the only evidence that those signatures were not genuine. However, we need not address these contentions further because the validity of the signatures is only one factor affecting the gift analysis; and, in our judgment, there are ample factors, quite apart from the question of the genuineness of the signatures on the CVR and CCI waivers, indicating that the conveyance of the properties at issue was not a gift. 11', 'We deem it prudent to address one further issue raised by defendants on appeal. The defendants aver that the trial justice committed error in refusing to admit into evidence testimony by Dr. Seifer with respect to the validity of Mr. Voccola’s signatures on the CCI and CVR', '- 22 -', 'C', 'Patricia’s Counterclaim', 'On appeal, plaintiffs contend that the trial justice erred when she awarded Patricia $82,000 on her counterclaim. They aver that it was not clear whether the allegations in the counterclaim encompassed monies paid by Patricia in relation to Mr. Voccola’s criminal fines. Moreover, they posit that the Settlement Agreement resolved any claims with respect to the $82,000 Patricia paid on Mr. Voccola’s behalf.', 'The trial justice, in ruling on the counterclaim, stated that Patricia “testified credibly that she took out a mortgage on her house to pay for some of [Mr. Voccola’s] criminal fines.” The trial justice also noted that there was corroborating testimony from Stephen that Patricia paid Mr. Tosoni approximately $80,000. We afford substantial deference to the trial justice’s credibility determinations. See Banville, 84 A.3d at 430. We note as well that the mortgage deed from Mr. Voccola to Mr. Tosoni and the Assignment of Mortgage from Mr. Tosoni to Patricia were entered as exhibits at trial and tended to further buttress Patricia’s credibility as to this issue. Moreover, after reviewing and pondering over the plaintiffs’ contentions on appeal, we are unable to say that the trial justice lacked competent evidence to support her conclusion with respect to the counterclaim. See Wellington Condominium Association, 68 A.3d at 599 (“If, as we review the record, it becomes clear to us that the record indicates that competent evidence waivers. In this case, defendants failed to comply with Rule 33(c) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure when they failed to update their answers to interrogatories so as to state that Dr. Seifer would be testifying with respect to all of the waivers, and not simply the WSI waiver. We do not detect any abuse of discretion by the trial justice in refusing to admit the testimony as a result. See International Depository, Inc. v. State, 603 A.2d 1119, 1124 (R.I. 1992) (“The decision to impose a particular sanction [for a violation of Rule 33] is within the sound discretion of the trial court.”). Moreover, even if there had been error, it would not have affected our ultimate conclusions that the deeds were void for lack of consideration and that the conveyance of the properties was not a gift.', '- 23 - supports the trial justice’s findings, we shall not substitute our view of the evidence for [that of the trial justice] even though a contrary conclusion could have been reached.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).

Connery, appeals from two judgments of conviction rendered after a jury-waived trial held in Providence County Superior Court.1 As to the first case, Ms. Connery was found guilty of one count of simple assault. As to the second case, although Ms. Connery had initially been charged with breaking and entering a dwelling, the trial justice (after a colloquy with counsel) found her guilty of willful trespass as being a lesser-included offense. On appeal to this Court, with respect to the conviction of simple assault, the defendant contends that her constitutional right to a speedy trial was violated. With respect to the willful trespass conviction, the defendant contends that willful trespass is not a lesser-included offense of breaking and entering and that the trial justice erred in denying her motion to dismiss the original charge of breaking and entering a dwelling. These cases came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided.

Ms. Connery was accused of assaulting another woman on June 24, 2012 in Pawtucket. Subsequently, having waived her right to a jury trial in the first instance, that case was transferred to the Superior Court. On February 15, 2013, a separate criminal information was filed charging defendant with “break[ing] and enter[ing] the dwelling of [defendant’s sister] without the consent of the owner,” in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-8-2 and G.L. 1956 § 12-29-5.', 'On June 16 and 17, 2014, both charges were tried on a jury-waived basis, at the conclusion of which, defendant moved to dismiss the breaking and entering charge2 “based on the fact that [the state had] not presented evidence to establish the crime of breaking and entering * * *.” After a brief recess, both parties were provided with an additional opportunity to address the court before a decision was rendered. In addressing the court, counsel for defendant stated: “[W]hat I’m suggesting is that you apply the statutory language for * * * willful trespass. That is what my client is most likely guilty of * * *.”', 'Subsequently, the trial justice rendered a bench decision. With respect to the simple assault charge, he found defendant guilty thereof.

As to each charge of which defendant had been found guilty, the trial justice sentenced her to a one-year suspended sentence with one year of probation on each count; the sentences were to run consecutively. He also issued a no-contact order running in favor of the victim of the simple assault and a no-contact order running in favor of the victim of the willful trespass (viz., defendant’s sister).

This matter came before the Supreme Court on May 11, 2016, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised should not be summarily decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and reviewing the memoranda submitted on behalf of the parties, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown.

Rather, this is precisely the type of “unexplained neglect” and case mismanagement that we have said, on its own, does not suffice.

DeLuca, 839 A.2d 1237, 1242 (R.I. 2004).', 'Even assuming that the plaintiff was entitled to an evidentiary hearing, the extent of any such evidence he may have offered was in effect offered at the hearing on the motion to vacate, and the hearing justice found it to be unavailing. At the hearing, the plaintiff’s counsel was given the opportunity to provide an offer of proof, at which time she laid out the crux of what her litigation paralegal would testify to at a subsequent evidentiary hearing: that the firm has a “very detailed mailing system,” that all mail is “time stamped * * * dated, * * * [and] filed,” and thus, 506 N.E.2d 147, 149 (Mass. App. Ct. 1987), reversed on other grounds, 517 N.E.2d 1286 (Mass. 1988). However, we note that several other jurisdictions have treated a motion to amend that has been filed within ten days of the entry of judgment—as was the case here—as a motion to vacate. See Bengar, 506 N.E.2d at 150 (collecting cases). Given the liberal amendment policy with regard to Rule 15 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, these motions are often granted despite having the effect of eradicating the entry of judgment. See Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962) (reversing denial of motion to vacate judgment of dismissal where the District Court abused its discretion in denying motion to amend); Laber v. Harvey, 438 F.3d 404, 426-29 (4th Cir. 2006) (holding it was an abuse of discretion for the District Court to deny the plaintiff’s motions for reconsideration and to amend); Adams v. Gould Inc., 739 F.2d 858, 869- 70 (3d Cir. 1984) (holding it was an abuse of discretion to deny the plaintiff’s motion to reopen judgment and amend its complaint); Dussouy v. Gulf Coast Investment Corp., 660 F.2d 594, 597-600 (5th Cir. 1981) (holding the District Court abused its discretion in denying the plaintiff’s post-judgment motion to amend). Here, plaintiff’s motion to amend was filed on the same day judgment was entered, but the hearing justice never determined the effect of such motion.', '-7- the defendants’ motion to dismiss was never received by her office. 12 After remarking that the defendants’ certification that the motion was mailed creates a rebuttable presumption that it was in fact received, the trial justice stated that the plaintiff was attempting to “prov[e] the negative” by purporting to show the motion never arrived. With regard to the “detailed” mailing system supposedly employed by the office, the hearing justice stated that, “[p]eople make mistakes. People misfile things[,]” and he thus found the plaintiff’s proffered evidence to fall short of supporting a claim of excusable neglect. We are satisfied that the hearing justice heard and considered the plaintiff’s evidence in support of his claim of excusable neglect and that a subsequent formal evidentiary hearing would have been futile in this scenario.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.

24,,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on March 30, 2016, pursuant to a petition for a writ of certiorari filed by the petitioner, Michael Morse.', 'In his petition, Morse sought review by this Court of a decision of the Retirement Board of the Employees Retirement System of the City of Providence (the board) dated July 24, 2013. In its decision, the board denied Morse’s application for an accidental disability pension. Morse argues that the decision should be quashed because it was based solely on the fact that Morse did not satisfy the board’s self-imposed “unanimity rule,” requiring that all three physicians who examined Morse agree that the applicant was permanently disabled as a result of a work-related injury. For the reasons stated herein, we quash the decision of the board, and remand the case for further factfinding.', '-1-', '1', 'Facts and Travel', 'The petitioner is a long serving fire-rescue captain on the Providence Fire Department, who has been employed by the city since August 5, 1991. On October 11, 2012, petitioner submitted an application for accidental disability retirement, claiming that he was disabled by a work-related injury that occurred on August 10, 2012, when, after responding to an EMS call, he injured his back lifting a patient at Rhode Island Hospital. It is significant that petitioner’s medical records reveal that, during the course of his career, he suffered from three separate work-related injuries; the first incident occurred on September 21, 2009, and the second incident on October 14, 2011. Each of these injuries occurred while petitioner was working, involved injuries to his lower back, and resulted in petitioner being placed on “injured on duty” (IOD) status for some period of time.', 'After the second reported injury, petitioner’s treating physician recommended that he cease heavy lifting at work, but he was nonetheless released to work. After the third injury, a physician at Rhode Island Hospital advised that he not return to work until he was feeling better and recommended that he see a spine specialist for a cortisone injection.', 'The petitioner presented to Dr. Katherine Williams, at the Brain and Spine Neurosurgical Institute.', 'She determined that petitioner was not able to return to work and that he could not perform the duties of a firefighter. Since his most recent injury, petitioner has not returned to work and has remained on IOD status for a period approaching four years.', 'Pursuant to the Providence Code of Ordinances, petitioner was evaluated by three independent medical examiners (IMEs), Mary L. Lussier, M.D., Norman M. Gordon, M.D., and Thomas F. Morgan, M.D. Doctor Lussier examined petitioner in early 2013 and reviewed his', '-2- medical records. She rendered a diagnosis of “[c]hronic low back pain with past brief radicular symptoms in both legs, with degenerative disc disease in the [lumbosacral] spine most pronounced at L4/5.” In Dr. Lussier’s opinion, petitioner was permanently partially medically disabled, and his disability was causally related to the most recent work-related injury, which occurred on August 10, 2012. She further opined that, although he had experienced other work- related injuries in the past, the last injury “made the most definitive change in his work status.” Due to his work-related injury, “[h]e can perform tasks that do not include bending and lifting and that do allow for him to frequently change position,” but he was unable to return to his previous duties.', 'Doctor Gordon examined petitioner in March 2013.', 'He also reviewed the medical records and conducted a physical exam, finding that “[h]e has limited range of motion of the back, particularly in flexion, which causes him a lot of pain. * * * Straight leg raising was accompanied by discomfort in the back, but he was able to go through at least 45 degrees.” It was Dr. Gordon’s opinion that', '“this gentleman is disabled from his current duties as a fire rescue', 'captain and although I cannot point to a single injury or accident', 'that has been responsible for this, it clearly is an accumulation of', 'the multiple back injuries that he has had, documented at least', 'since 2009, and probably before that as well.” He concluded that “[u]nfortunately, these injuries and persistent back pain impact fully on what he can do as a result of the performance of his very strenuous, heavy activities as part of a firefighting rescue captain. I do not believe that there is any light work available in this category * * *.”', 'The third examiner, Dr. Morgan, came to a different conclusion. Although he diagnosed petitioner with multilevel degenerative disc disease and facet joint arthritis of the lumbar spine, it', '-3- was his opinion that petitioner’s chronic low back pain showed no signs of permanent injury from the lifting incidents on or before August 10, 2012. He further opined that petitioner “does not qualify for a work injury impairment to be considered for accidental disability” and that “[t]he prognosis for his chronic back pain is good and based on today’s examination, there are no restrictions or limitations that should prevent him from returning to work.”', 'The petitioner attended a hearing on June 26, 2013, before the board’s medical subcommittee, at which his attorney was permitted to argue on his behalf. The subcommittee chair informed petitioner about the procedure of the subcommittee, explaining that they were going to “hear from the doctor, if you have any questions you can question the doctor through me and then we may have some questions and then we’ll discuss it among ourselves.” Doctor Guy Geffroy, medical adviser to the board, said that he had reviewed petitioner’s medical records and the IME reports, but said that he was not a member of the board. Dr. Geffroy advised the subcommittee that they should not grant petitioner accidental disability benefits because only one of the IMEs concluded that petitioner was disabled as the result of a work- related injury. He explained that Dr. Gordon found that his disability was the result of multiple injuries, and “he interprets proximate result of an accident as including multiple back injuries, which our Ordinance does not. So, I have to conclude that if you analyze, carefully analyze what he did really think, he also is not in favor of this meeting the criteria of an accidental disability retirement.”', 'Relying on this Court’s decision in Pierce v. Providence Retirement Board, 15 A.3d 957 (R.I. 2011), the Senior Assistant City Solicitor then informed the subcommittee that a work- related disability indeed could be proximately caused by several on-the-job incidents. The solicitor then asked Dr. Geffroy if that would change his recommendation. He responded, “No,', '-4- it doesn’t. It’s beside the point because one of the consultants considers him not to be disabled. So, we don’t have unanimity regardless.” After further discussion between the subcommittee members and the attorneys on the impact of the Pierce decision on petitioner’s claim, Dr. Geffroy said, “It’s [a] moot point because one of the consultants doesn’t find him to be disabled.”', 'The city solicitor then addressed petitioner’s argument that, in view of the fact that Dr. Morgan’s evaluation was so different from the other two IMEs, he should be granted the opportunity to be examined by another physician. The city solicitor advised the subcommittee that it had granted such a request in the past, saying “[I]t’s not unprecedented that we’ve actually disqualified an IME or sought the advice of another physician.” The petitioner’s attorney then argued that the subcommittee should either grant petitioner a new examination or reconsider its adherence to the unanimity rule. Although petitioner’s counsel conceded that the board had been applying the rule for several years, he argued that it was not set forth in § 17-189(6) of the ordinance that addresses accidental disability pension status.', 'With respect to the unanimity rule, the city solicitor advised the subcommittee that the issue had come up several years before and the board decided that, even though the unanimity rule was not explicitly required by the ordinance, the city council, in 1998, had removed language requiring a mere majority of the IMEs to agree on accidental disability, thus implicitly approving the board’s employment of the unanimity rule. The subcommittee chairman, seeking clarification, then had the following exchange with the city solicitor:', '“[Chairman]: Okay. Just quickly, this board can vote with two', 'doctors and one against, is that correct? We don’t need, there’s no', 'requirement that we have unanimity, that[’s] our policy and that’s', 'what we’ve done.', '-5-', '“[City Solicitor]: This board has adopted the unanimity policy and', 'clearly if we want to change that or go in a different direction it’s –', '“[Chairman]: If we have the votes to pass this it wouldn’t be illegal', 'would it?', '“[City Solicitor]: No, no. But I –', '“[Chairman]: So, I think his argument that says that we – that – I', 'think that his argument falls short to a certain extent when he says', 'that this board requires it, although we may require it as a policy', 'we don’t – we can vote –', '“[City Solicitor]: I can tell you –', '“[Chairman]: – different.', '“[City Solicitor]: – being on the board since probably, since 1998,', 'there have been instances where there’s been two out of three and', 'the board’s granted it –', '“[Chairman]: Right.', '“[City Solicitor]: – and discounted the IME of a doctor that said', 'the individual wasn’t totally, permanently disabled.', '“[Chairman]: Right. So, his argument, although I understand his', 'argument, is not – it assumes that we can’t do it, which I believe', 'we can do it.', '“[City Solicitor]: Right. I mean, our position is that you need all', 'three doctors to be consistent that the individual fulfills these', 'requirements. There have been instances, off the top of my head I', 'don’t know, but the board has discounted a doctor who denied and', 'found a basis for it.” The subcommittee then, without any further discussion, voted to recommend to the board that the application for accidental disability retirement be denied.', 'When the full board met, the chairman of the subcommittee moved to deny petitioner’s application “based on not unanimity [sic] of doctors.” The petitioner’s attorney was permitted to restate his argument against the unanimity rule to the full board. He argued that the longstanding', '-6- interpretation by the board, that the ordinance suggests that a unanimity finding is required, was erroneous. He averred that the unanimity rule was not only contrary to the language of the ordinance, but that, by adopting the rule, the board had, in essence, “delegate[d] its authority and power to one physician.” The petitioner’s counsel urged the board to consider the consequences of their rule:', '“Stop and think about that. Every time someone comes before you', 'no matter how clear cut two of the three doctors are and no matter', 'how much of the overwhelming evidence that may be before the', 'Board, because one physician fails to make one check mark in that', 'checklist of things that he’s provided is denied. And this Board', 'doesn’t even consider any of the evidence, it simply says one of', 'the doctors failed to satisfy one of the requirements[,] end of game.', 'That’s abdicating your responsibility of the Board, with all due', 'respect, you have the responsibility to take into consideration all of', 'the evidence.” When petitioner’s attorney had concluded, the medical subcommittee chairman responded that “the Sub-Committee did hear from [petitioner’s attorney], we looked at all the facts and made the recommendation.” Without further discussion, the board voted to deny petitioner’s application. There were no dissenting votes.', 'The board issued a two-and-a-half page written decision, dated July 24, 2013, including the following pertinent findings of fact:', '“6. In connection with his Application, Morse was examined by', 'Dr. Mary L.

The petitioner asserts that adopting such a rule is contrary to the plain language of the ordinance and that the effect of such a determination is that the board has abdicated all discretion and responsibility to consider applications for an accidental disability pension under the ordinance by deferring to the opinion of a single disagreeing physician.', 'The board argues that this Court should affirm its decision because the unanimity rule is required by the plain language of the ordinance and by legislative history. The board suggests that it lacks discretion to deviate from the unanimity rule and proposes that it is vested with discretion only in situations where the three IMEs recommend the disability. In those instances, the board can choose to deny an application as the result of an additional investigation.', 'There are three avenues for a city employee to receive retirement benefits under the Providence Code: service retirement, ordinary disability retirement, and accidental disability retirement. This Court has addressed the Providence Retirement Board’s interpretation of the Retirement System Ordinance on more than one occasion, most recently in 2011 in Pierce, 15 A.3d at 962. We have said that “entitlement to accidental-disability retirement’s greater benefits requires a member to meet criteria that are more discriminating than the other two retirement options.” Id. However, we have never addressed the discrete issue that confronts us in this case;', '- 10 - whether the board is entitled to impose a unanimity rule on applicants seeking accidental disability benefits. 1', 'The pertinent language of § 17-189(6) is as follows:', '“Accidental disability retirement: * * * If a medical', 'examination conducted by three (3) physicians certified in the field', 'reasonably related to the member’s alleged injury engaged by the', 'director of personnel and such investigation as the director of', 'personnel may desire to make shall show that said member is', 'physically or mentally incapacitated for the performance of service', 'any [sic] as a natural and proximate result of an accident, while in', 'the performance of duty, and that such disability is not the result of', 'willful negligence or misconduct on the part of said member and is', 'not the result of age or length of service, and that such member', 'should be retired, and the physicians who conducted the', 'examination shall so certify to the retirement board stating the', 'time, place and conditions of such service performed by said', 'member resulting in such disability, the retirement board shall', 'retire the said member for accidental disability.” The board urges that, despite the fact that the ordinance does not “literally contain the word ‘unanimous,’” unanimity “is clearly required by the plain and unambiguous language” of the phrase “and the physicians who conducted the examination shall so certify to the retirement board stating the time, place and conditions of such service * * * resulting in such disability.” In our opinion, however, the ordinance is not well drafted and is certainly not clear and unambiguous.', 'To the contrary, it is our opinion that the ordinance is subject to a variety of constructions and is therefore, by definition, ambiguous.

Although we recognize that this Court referred to the requirement that three physicians must certify that the applicant is disabled, that reference specifically identified that as a requirement for ordinary disability retirement, which was not an issue in Pierce. In our opinion, it has no impact on this case.', '- 11 - in a statute is susceptible of more than one reasonable meaning”). In construing the intent of the drafters, we first look to the legislative history.', 'The Board contends that the General Assembly amended the Retirement System Act 2 in 1975 by P.L. 1975, ch. 158, § 9 to say:', '“If a medical examination conducted by three physicians engaged', 'by the retirement board and such investigation as the retirement', 'board may desire to make shall show that said member is', 'physically or mentally incapacitated * * * and that such member', 'should be retired, in the event a majority of the physicians who', 'conducted the examination shall so certify to the retirement board', 'stating the time, place and condition of such service performed by', 'said member resulting in such disability and the retirement board', 'shall retire the said member for accidental disability.” (Emphasis', 'added.) The city council then amended the ordinance in 1998 and removed the phrase “in the event of a majority of” from the provision. The board asserts that, by removing that majority language, the city council intended to provide for the unanimity rule in the ordinance.', 'The board argues, especially in view of the legislative history, that the city council, when it amended the ordinance, intended to impose a unanimity rule on all applicants for accidental disability retirement. Nevertheless, we are not persuaded that such a rule should be read into the ordinance.', 'First, if that was indeed the city council’s explicit intention, it surely had the opportunity and ability to specifically include the unanimity rule. Rather than simply removing 2', 'The Providence Retirement System was enacted by a special statute by the Legislature, P.L. 1923, ch. 489, entitled “The Providence Retirement Act,” which “established a comprehensive system of contributions, benefits, and regulations relating to pensions to be paid to firefighters, police officers, and civilian employees of the city.” Betz v. Paolino, 605 A.2d 837, 838 (R.I. 1992). The Retirement System Act has “become part of the local ordinances of the city of Providence by reason of the adoption of a home-rule charter in 1980, which became effective subsequent to ratification by the General Assembly and by a referendum vote of the citizens of Providence on January 3, 1983.” Id. Therefore, since 1983, the Providence City Council has had exclusive legislative power over the Providence Retirement System. Id. at 840.', '- 12 - the majority language, it could also have added language requiring that all three physicians be unanimous in their determinations.', 'Second, we read the phrase—“and such investigation as the director of personnel may desire to make”—as an explicit grant of discretionary power that cannot be reconciled with the board’s interpretation that it has no discretion to deviate from the unanimity rule. Furthermore, we find the operative language in this provision to be the following:', '“If a medical examination conducted by three (3) physicians', 'certified in the field reasonably related to the member’s alleged', 'injury engaged by the director of personnel and such investigation', 'as the director of personnel may desire to make shall show that', 'said member is physically or mentally incapacitated * * *, the', 'retirement board shall retire the said member for accidental', 'disability.” (Emphases added.) That phrase, “shall show,” directs the board to review and interpret all the evidence. If the evidence before the board “shall show” that the applicant is disabled as a result of a job-related injury, then the board “shall retire the said member.” The determination of whether the evidence shows incapacity is within the discretion of the board. If two independent medical examiners, plus the member’s treating physicians, opine that the member is disabled, and one physician disagrees, it is certainly reasonable to conclude that the evidence is that the member is disabled. Of course, the board has the authority, indeed the obligation, to review the opinions of each of those physicians and determine why there is a disagreement. The board certainly has the ability to determine that the one dissenting physician is more persuasive than the others, but that decision must be based on a reasoned analysis of the evidence before the board.', 'However, once the board determines that the evidence shows that the applicant is disabled, then the board “shall retire the said member.” “We have held that the use of the word ‘shall’ contemplates something mandatory or the ‘imposition of a duty.’” Castelli v. Carcieri,', '- 13 - 961 A.2d 277, 284 (R.I. 2008). “The use of the word ‘shall’ is readily distinguishable from the use of the word ‘may,’ which implies an allowance of discretion.” Id. The construction that the board urges on us would leave much of the wording of the provision a nullity and diminish the board to performing a ministerial function.', 'That simply cannot be what the city council intended.', 'Finally, we hold that the board’s interpretation that the ordinance requires unanimity of the evaluating physicians would lead to an absurd result.', 'Our review of the board’s interpretation of the ordinance is bolstered by the reasoning of the Appellate Court of Illinois, for the Third District, in a remarkably similar case. In Coyne v. Milan Police Pension Bd. ex rel. Jones, 807 N.E.2d 1276 (Ill. App. Ct. 2004), a majority of the court determined that the pension board could not reasonably interpret its pension code as requiring unanimity of the examining physicians on the basis of the following reasoning:', '“We believe the Board’s interpretation of section 3–115', 'yields a result that is both absurd and unconstitutional. * * * The', 'opinion of a lone minority dissenter like Doctor Harris (five', 'contrary opinions notwithstanding) would ipso facto defeat a', 'pension claim, thus rendering section 3–115 a virtual summary', 'dismissal provision. A pension board would have no use for an', 'evidentiary hearing in such cases because, regardless of the weight', 'of the claimant’s evidence, and regardless of any credibility issues', 'pertaining to the lone dissenting physician, the outcome of the case', 'would be predetermined by the mere existence of a disagreement', 'between witnesses. We cannot believe the legislature would', 'establish the adjudicatory process outlined in the Pension Code', 'expecting that the process would be so easily precluded.” Coyne,', '807 N.E. 2d at 1288-89. We embrace that reasoning and conclude that the Providence City Council could not possibly have intended the retirement board’s proceedings to be curtailed by the opinion of one physician.', 'Therefore, we are of the opinion that the retirement board impermissibly wrote a unanimity requirement into the ordinance. The duty of the board is to review each member’s', '- 14 - application for accidental disability retirement fairly, to cautiously review the medical evidence, to make factual findings on the record, and to articulate its reasons for either granting or denying a member’s application pursuant to those factual findings.', 'The board’s adoption of the unanimity rule effectively abandoned its authority to a single disagreeing physician. Because the board failed to make any factual findings with regard to the petitioner’s application, this matter must be remanded to the board for reconsideration. In so doing, the board must consider all of the evidence before it, indicating explicitly the reasons for finding the evaluation of one doctor to be more persuasive than the evaluations of the other two independent evaluations and those of the petitioner’s several treating physicians, and articulate its reasoning for either granting or denying the petitioner’s application.', '4', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons elucidated in this opinion, we hold that the board misconstrued the ordinance when it based its decision to deny the petitioner’s application for accidental disability retirement on a self-imposed unanimity rule.

25,": v. : Cardi Corporation, Inc. et al. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. Cashman Equipment Corporation, Inc. (Cashman) filed a petition for issuance of a writ of certiorari in which it stated that it was seeking review of the May 13, 2014 denial in Providence County Superior Court of its motion to compel the production from Cardi Corporation, Inc. (Cardi)1 of the following: “all materials and documents, less core attorney work product, including all computer models and drafts of materials and documents, developed and considered by [Cardi’s] testifying expert * * * in the process of formulating his written expert opinions * * *.” In a November 20, 2014 order, this Court granted Cashman’s petition. Cashman contends that the hearing justice erred in denying its motion to compel because, in Cashman’s view, materials which are considered by a testifying expert in formulating his or her opinion are discoverable, with the exception of “core attorney work product.” According to Cashman, it was, therefore, error for the hearing justice to refuse to compel Cardi to produce the requested documents. 1', 'We note that, in addition to Cardi, RT Group, Inc. also filed a brief before this Court, contending that the hearing justice did not err in denying Cashman’s motion to compel.', '-1-', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we quash the writ and affirm the ruling of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The civil action from which this discovery dispute evolved concerns work performed in the course of building the Sakonnet River Bridge. Specifically, the case addresses, among other issues, whether or not Cardi provided a defective cofferdam2 design for that bridge-building project. On May 2, 2011, Cashman commenced the instant action setting forth a number of allegations against Cardi including breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and negligence due to the fact that Cardi allegedly supplied a defective design for the cofferdams and defective materials. Cashman contended, in its May 2, 2011 complaint, that Cardi’s actions required Cashman to perform additional work on the bridge for which it was entitled to compensation.', 'During the course of discovery, Cardi refused to turn over certain computer models and draft reports that had been “considered by” its testifying expert, George Tamaro, and Mr. Tamaro’s engineering firm, Mueser Rutledge Consulting Engineers. Cardi refused to turn over the documents at issue because it contended that the documents were not included within the scope of expert discovery permitted under Rule 26(b)(4)(A) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. On April 18, 2014, Cashman moved to compel disclosure. A hearing on Cashman’s motion followed on May 13, 2014.', 'At the hearing, Cashman argued that it was desirous of obtaining any computer models which Cardi’s expert created to determine “certain stress and loads that are going to be placed on 2', 'A cofferdam is “[a] temporary watertight enclosure that is pumped dry to expose the bottom of a body of water so that construction, as of piers, can occur.” The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 358 (5th ed. 2011).', '-2- certain points on this cofferdam.” Specifically, Cashman stated that it was seeking models “that [the expert] created which [he] may not have relied on but certainly would’ve considered” as well as draft reports. Cashman stressed the usefulness of such models in cross-examining an expert witness, and it emphasized their necessity for the purpose of determining how the expert arrived at the final model or report which he ultimately relied upon in forming his expert opinion. Cardi responded by contending that materials “considered by” an expert in forming his or her expert opinion are not discoverable under the terms of Rule 26(b)(4).', 'The hearing justice issued a decision from the bench at the close of the hearing on May 13, 2014. He concluded that he did not have the authority to compel production of the draft reports and computer models; and he denied Cashman’s motion to compel, stating as follows:', '“The Court holds in this matter that it seems to the Court', 'there is no question but that under the circumstances here, counsel', 'for Cashman would certainly be advantaged in connection with the', 'cross-examination that he would undertake of the experts put forth', 'by Cardi if the Court were to grant to him what is the subject of the', 'motion pending before the Court.', '“If the Court were writing on a clean piece of paper there is', 'no question but that the Court, at least based on my reading and the', 'arguments presented and the papers presented by the parties, would', 'order the production. The Court, however, here believes that it is', 'without authority to do so.', '“* * *', '“[T]he Court is constrained to deny the motion.” On October 17, 2014, Cashman filed a petition for issuance of a writ of certiorari with this Court, seeking review of the hearing justice’s denial of its motion to compel. This Court granted that petition.', '-3-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'Typically, this Court’s “review on a writ of certiorari is limited ‘to examining the record to determine if an error of law has been committed.’” Crowe Countryside Realty Associates, Co., LLC v.

In conducting such a review “[w]e do not weigh the evidence on certiorari, but only conduct our review to examine questions of law raised in the petition.” Id. (citing Boucher v. McGovern, 639 A.2d 1369, 1373 (R.I. 1994)). Rulings on such questions of law are reviewed de novo by this Court. Id. In addition, with respect to determining the scope of Rule 26, we have repeatedly employed a de novo standard of review. State v. Lead Industries Association, Inc., 64 A.3d 1183, 1191 (R.I. 2013).', 'III', 'Analysis', 'A', 'The Parties’ Contentions', 'Cashman contends that materials considered by Cardi’s testifying expert during the process of forming his opinion are “fully discoverable.” Cashman points to ample federal precedent indicating that federal courts allow for such discovery, and it invites this Court to embrace the reasoning of the cited federal court cases. It further posits that the discovery it seeks is necessary to assure effective cross-examination of testifying experts at trial, to serve judicial economy, and to effectuate cost savings. Additionally, this Court notes that Cashman is very clear that it is not seeking any documents that would be considered “core attorney work product.”', '-4-', 'Cardi responds by averring that the plain language of Rule 26(b)(4)(A) limits discovery with respect to testifying experts to interrogatories and depositions and does not provide for discovery “by document subpoena” or discovery “of matters ‘considered by’ but not relied upon in forming an expert’s opinion.” Cardi points this Court to the differences between the Rhode Island Rule 26 and the Federal Rule 26. It has also brought to our attention the history of the Rhode Island rule to support its contention that the rule was not meant to include the discovery of documents considered by a testifying expert. Cardi goes on to posit that this Court should not expand the scope of Rule 26(b)(4)(A) absent the promulgation of a formal amendment to the rule following the statutorily provided amendment process, which would require approval by a majority of the Superior Court justices. See G.L. 1956 § 8-6-2(a). In addition, Cardi contests Cashman’s assertions that the discovery it requests would make for more effective cross- examination, would serve judicial economy, or would effectuate cost savings.', 'B', 'Rule 26(b)(4)(A)', 'We must begin our inquiry into whether or not Cashman is entitled to the discovery it seeks with the rule at issue—viz., Rule 26(b)(4)(A). The most current version of the rule, which is applicable to the instant case, reads in pertinent part as follows:', '“A party may through interrogatories require any other party to', 'identify each person whom the other party expects to call as an', 'expert witness at trial, to state the subject matter on which the', 'expert is expected to testify, and to state the substance of the facts', 'and opinions to which the expert is expected to testify and a', 'summary of the grounds for each opinion. A party may depose any', 'person who has been identified as an expert expected to testify', 'when the expert interrogatory has been responded to by the other', 'party.” Id.', '-5- We have repeatedly applied our long-standing rules of statutory construction to construing court rules. See, e.g., State v. Brown, 88 A.3d 1101, 1110 (R.I. 2014) (construing Rule 8(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure); In re Law Offices of James Sokolove, LLC, 986 A.2d 997, 1002 (R.I. 2010) (applying the rules of statutory construction to Article II, Rule 10 of the Supreme Court Rules for the Admission to Practice Law). In construing statutes or court rules, it is a fundamental principle of our jurisprudence that “[w]hen the language of a rule is clear and unambiguous, this Court must give the words of the rule their plain and ordinary meanings.” Brown, 88 A.3d at 1110; see Shine v. Moreau, 119 A.3d 1, 9 (R.I. 2015); see also McCarthy v. Environmental Transportation Services, Inc., 865 A.2d 1056, 1060 (R.I. 2005); Capital Properties, Inc. v. City of Providence, 843 A.2d 456, 460-61 (R.I. 2004). If we “find the statute [or rule] to be unambiguous, we simply apply the plain meaning and our interpretive task is done.” Shine, 119 A.3d at 9 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Diamante, 83 A.3d 546, 550 (R.I. 2014).', 'Our review of the language of Rule 26(b)(4)(A) leads us to the ineluctable conclusion that that rule is indeed clear and unambiguous. The first sentence specifically states what one party may require of another party, through interrogatories, with respect to testifying expert witnesses. The second sentence allows a party to depose an expert expected to testify at trial. Thus, the rule is confined by its very terms to discovery through interrogatories or deposition. It does not provide for the disclosure of documents. In light of our well-settled principles of interpretation, we are duty-bound to apply the plain meaning of the rule to the instant case; therefore, it is our conclusion that Cashman is not entitled to the discovery which it seeks from Cardi. To determine otherwise would require this Court to alter the present rule by judicial fiat,', '-6- a practice in which we will not engage. See Capital Properties, Inc., 843 A.2d at 460 (declining to adopt a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure by “judicial fiat”).', 'As Cardi points out, the process for amending the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure is provided by statute. Section 8-6-2(a) provides in pertinent part as follows:', '“The supreme court [and] the superior court, * * * by a', 'majority of their members, shall have the power to make rules for', 'regulating practice, procedure, and business therein. * * * The', 'rules of the superior * * * court * * * shall be subject to the', 'approval of the supreme court. Such rules, when effective, shall', 'supersede any statutory regulation in conflict therewith.”', '(Emphasis added.) We have no desire to deprive the Superior Court of the right to make a recommendation, by a majority of its members, to this Court with respect to any changes to the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. We recognize that the hearing justice in the instant case, if he were “writing on a clean piece of paper,” would have preferred to rule in Cashman’s favor. But, if there is to be a change made to Rule 26(b)(4)(A) to effectuate the result for which Cashman advocates, that change must come from the Superior Court in accordance with § 8-6-2(a); it will not be effectuated by this Court under the circumstances presented in the instant case.', 'We note as well that, in this Court’s opinion in Crowe Countryside Realty Associates, Co., LLC v. Novare Engineers, Inc., 891 A.2d 838, 843, 847 (R.I. 2006), we chose to emphasize “protection principles” with respect to discovery under Rule 26 and to apply our “strong policy” of protecting opinion work product from discovery. To rule as Cashman invites us to would be inconsistent with those general protection principles that we have applied with relation to discovery under the terms of Rule 26.3 3', 'We pause to briefly discuss the relationship between the instant case and our decision in Crowe Countryside Realty Associates, Co., LLC v. Novare Engineers, Inc., 891 A.2d 838 (R.I. 2006). Initially, it is important to clarify that our decision in Crowe was based on an earlier', '-7-', 'Accordingly, based on the clear and unambiguous language of Rule 26(b)(4)(A), we perceive no error on the part of the hearing justice in denying Cashman’s motion to compel production of “all computer models including drafts considered by Cardi’s testifying expert.”', 'C', 'The Evolution of Rule 26', 'Although we need not go beyond the clear and unambiguous language of Rule 26(b)(4)(A), we will briefly address the relevance of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and federal case law interpreting those rules to the instant case. In our judgment, an exploration of the evolution of Federal Rule 26 and of Rhode Island Rule 26 even more firmly bolsters our confidence in the correctness of our holding that Cashman is not entitled to the discovery it seeks in the instant case.', 'Prior to its amendment in 1993, Federal Rule 26(b)(4)(A) read in pertinent part as follows:', '“(i) A party may through interrogatories require any other', 'party to identify each person whom the other party expects to call', 'as an expert witness at trial, to state the subject matter on which the', 'expert is expected to testify, and to state the substance of the facts', 'and opinions to which the expert is expected to testify and a', 'summary of the grounds for each opinion. (ii) Upon motion, the', 'court may order further discovery by other means * * *.”', '(Emphasis added.) version of Rule 26(b)(4) than is at issue in the instant case—that rule having been amended in 2006. Moreover, Crowe was concerned with the discoverability under Rule 26 of core attorney work product. Cashman has expressly stated that it is not seeking any documents in the instant case that constitute core attorney work product. Crowe also dealt with factual attorney work product; however, given our conclusion that Cashman is not entitled to the discovery that it is seeking under the amended language of Rule 26(b)(4)(A), we need not address whether or not that discovery would include factual attorney work product. Therefore, we do not find Crowe to be controlling in the instant case.', '-8- In 1993, the Federal Rule 26 was amended. After the amendment, Federal Rule 26(b)(4)(A) provided that a party could depose only an expert “whose opinions may be presented at trial.” However, section (a)(2)(B) of Federal Rule 26 was amended to require that the disclosure of any expert witnesses expected to testify at trial had to be accompanied by a written report, including, among numerous other things, “the data or other information considered by the witness in forming the opinions.” (Emphasis added.)', 'In Rhode Island, Rule 26 was amended in 1995. At that juncture, the Rhode Island courts were free to adopt either the pre-1993 Federal Rule, the 1993 Federal Rule, or something else entirely.', 'The 1995 Committee Notes4 state, with respect to Rule 26(b)(4)(A), that: “This subdivision is based on the 1970 version of the federal model.” Thus, Rhode Island chose to adopt the pre-1993 Federal Rule 26(b)(4)(A) and, in fact, it did so nearly word for word. As such, the 1995 Rhode Island rule included the following language found in the pre-1993 Federal Rule: “Upon motion the court may order further discovery by other means” but did not include the “considered by” language of the 1993 Federal Rule.', 'Cashman urges this Court to look to the pre-1993 Federal Rule 26(b)(4)(A) and the case law that it has cited applying and interpreting that rule in assessing this case. It is true that we have stated on more than one occasion that “[w]hen * * * the Rhode Island rule is substantially similar to the federal rule, we often look to federal courts’ decisions for guidance and interpretation.” O’Connor v. Newport Hospital, 111 A.3d 317, 323-24 n.5 (R.I. 2015); see Brown, 88 A.3d at 1110 n.7. However, Cashman’s contention fails to take into account that Rule 4', 'We acknowledge that “we are not bound by reporter’s notes in applying [a] rule.” State v. Macaskill, 475 A.2d 1024, 1028 (R.I. 1984). However, such notes can certainly be instructive and are appropriate for consideration in our analysis of a rule. See, e.g., Crowe, 891 A.2d at 847 (looking to the committee notes to Rule 26).', '-9- 26 was amended by Rhode Island again on June 15, 2006, and it is that amended version of the rule, rather than the 1995 Rhode Island rule, that is applicable to the instant case.', 'When the 2006 amended version of Rhode Island Rule 26(b)(4)(A) (quoted in Part III.B, supra) became effective, the following sentence had been removed: “Upon motion the court may order further discovery by other means * * * ;” it was replaced with: “A party may depose any person who has been identified as an expert expected to testify when the expert interrogatory has been responded to by the other party.” Thus, Rhode Island rejected, for a second time, the 1993 Federal Rule language requiring disclosure of “the data or other information considered by the witness in forming the opinions.” (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, it would not be appropriate for this Court to look to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or federal case law in evaluating our present Rule 26(b)(4)(A) because our rule is clear on its face and also is no longer substantially similar to any of the previous or current versions of the Federal Rule.', 'As such, our examination of the evolution of Federal Rule 26 and Rhode Island Rule 26 confirms our conclusion that Cashman is not entitled to the discovery which, in its petition for issuance of a writ of certiorari, it stated it is seeking—namely, “all materials and documents, less core attorney work product, including all computer models and drafts of materials and documents, developed and considered by [Cardi’s] testifying expert * * * in the process of formulating his written expert opinions * * *.” (Emphasis added.)

26,State : v. : Sharif K. Fairweather. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. The defendant, Sharif K. Fairweather, seeks review of an adjudication of a probation violation that was entered after a hearing in the Providence County Superior Court on April 8, 2014.1 At the conclusion of that hearing, the hearing justice found that Mr. Fairweather had violated the terms and conditions of his probation, and he ordered him to serve seventy-two months of the seventy-eight months remaining on the suspended sentence that he had received as a result of an earlier conviction. The defendant contends that the hearing justice acted arbitrarily and capriciously in finding that he had violated the terms and conditions of his probation. The defendant also challenges as “excessive” the fact that the hearing justice executed seventy-two months of the original sentence. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this petition should not be summarily decided. After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties’ arguments (both written and oral), we are 1', 'This case is before us pursuant to this Court’s having granted defendant’s petition for a writ of certiorari on May 28, 2015.', '-1- satisfied that cause has not been shown and that the issues raised in this petition may be decided at this time.', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we quash the writ and affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On February 19, 2008, a judgment entered sentencing defendant to a seven-year suspended sentence with probation, after he had pled nolo contendere to one count of breaking and entering a dwelling. Subsequently, on June 29, 2012, after defendant had been found to be in violation of his probation, a judgment entered sentencing him to six months to serve, leaving seventy-eight months of his suspended sentence remaining. The defendant was still on probation on March 21 and 22, 2014, which is when the events at issue in this case transpired.', 'On March 24, 2014, the state filed a notice of probation violation pursuant to Rule 32(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure alleging that defendant had failed to comply with a condition of his probation by “fail[ing] to keep the peace and be of good behavior;” it is that notice of probation violation that gave rise to the instant case.', 'On April 8, 2014, a probation-violation hearing was held in the Superior Court. We recount below the salient aspects of that hearing.', 'A', 'The Testimony of Clarissa Randall', 'Clarissa Randall testified that in March of 2014 she and Sharif Fairweather were “boyfriend and girlfriend” and she was “about seven months” pregnant with his child. She stated that, around 5:00 p.m. on what would have been March 21, she went to the house on Rhodes', '-2- Street in Providence which was the residence of Mr. Fairweather, whom she had not seen for over a month. She said that, after she arrived, defendant “came upstairs, greeted [her] for a few minutes, [and] went back downstairs,” while she remained upstairs in his bedroom, where she stayed until about 8:30 or 9:00 when she went down to the kitchen to prepare some food. Ms. Randall further testified that defendant came into the kitchen in order to “check[]” on her and stayed for fifteen minutes. She stated that, after the food was prepared, she returned upstairs to eat it and then went to sleep.', 'Ms. Randall testified that, around 3:00 a.m. on the next morning, she was awakened by defendant, who was yelling; she described him as being “intoxicated.” She stated that she told defendant that she was going to go home if he was going to argue with her. She added that defendant “got mad” and that she told him that she was leaving; she stated that he then grabbed her by her neck and slammed her into the wall. She said that she hit her head and her back against the wall and felt pain in her neck and in her lower back. She further testified that defendant picked up a knife and told her that he would kill her, causing her to feel threatened. Ms. Randall testified that she then left the house, walked to the corner of the street, and called the police, who met her at that corner. She said that she told an officer that she had hurt her back and head; she added that a rescue vehicle was called to transport her to the hospital.', 'On cross-examination, Ms. Randall testified that, shortly after she arrived at the Rhodes Street house, she encountered a woman named “Elaine,” who told her that, on an earlier day, a woman who was a potential tenant had come to the house to look at a room and that defendant “was trying to help the [woman] to get into the place.”', '-3-', 'B', 'The Testimony of Officer Joseph Pineau', 'Joseph Pineau, an officer in the Providence Police Department, testified that, on March 22, he was instructed to report to a domestic disturbance and that, while he was en route, he was “flagged down” by a female, who he came to learn was Ms. Randall. He stated that Ms. Randall told him what had happened and that a rescue vehicle was called to transport her to the hospital.', 'Officer Pineau further testified that he, along with two other officers, went to the Rhodes Street house, where he and one of the other officers arrested defendant. Officer Pineau stated that, in the course of being arrested, defendant was “pull[ing] away” and was “cussing [the officers], telling [them] that he was going to * * * assault [them].”', 'On cross-examination, Officer Pineau stated that he “could not [one] hundred percent say that [defendant] was intoxicated” at the time in question. Officer Pineau also acknowledged on cross-examination that, in a “Providence Incident Report” prepared after he had gone to the hospital to inquire about Ms. Randall, he had indicated that Ms. Randall’s injuries were “non- conclusive.”', 'C', 'The Testimony of Sharif Fairweather', 'Mr. Fairweather testified that, after Ms. Randall arrived at the Rhodes Street house, they watched television together in his room for a short time. He testified that she then went downstairs to prepare food and that he eventually went downstairs for two or three minutes in order to “check on” her. He testified that he then returned upstairs to finish watching a movie and that he thereafter went back downstairs to JB’s room. (JB was a friend of defendant who lived on the first floor of the Rhodes Street house.)', '-4-', 'The defendant further testified that he did not see Ms. Randall again until he returned to his bedroom a “few hours” later, at which point, she “got mad” and pointed out that she had been at the house for seven hours while defendant had been with his friends and not with her. It was his testimony, however, that he had spent two to three hours with Ms. Randall out of the seven hours.', 'Mr. Fairweather testified that a woman named Elaine (who he said was JB’s wife and who “stay[ed]” with JB at the Rhodes Street house) had told Ms. Randall “something about a girl moving in [to the Rhodes Street house].” He stated that he told Ms. Randall that he “didn’t try to have [the woman] moved in;” he added that he told Ms. Randall that a friend of his had introduced the woman at issue to JB, who “was telling her about the room.” The defendant said that there ensued a “heated argument” between Ms. Randall and him with respect to the female potential tenant.', 'The defendant testified that he had never: “put [his] hand around Ms. Randall’s throat;” “rip[ped] her off the bed;” “[thrown] her against the wall;” “possess[ed] a steak knife;” or “[held] a steak knife in a threatening manner toward Ms. Randall.” He said that their argument never became “physical.” He also asserted that she had “said what she said” as a reaction to his suggestion that they should end their relationship; he added that she reacted to that suggestion by getting “mad” and that she then “ripped [his] ring off, threw it on the floor, [and] walked out the door.” The defendant testified that, after the argument with Ms. Randall, he went downstairs for a while and that, when he returned to the bedroom, Ms. Randall was no longer there.', '-5-', 'D', 'The Hearing Justice’s Decision', 'In his bench decision, the hearing justice began by reviewing the testimony of each of the witnesses. He stated that he was “impressed by Ms. Randall,” who he said had been “forthright in testifying about the events that occurred that night.” He noted that she appeared to be a “good person in the sense [that] she didn’t seem to have any axe to grind or she didn’t seem to have any motive of getting even.”', 'He further noted that there was no variance between her direct testimony and her testimony on cross-examination; he found her to be credible. The hearing justice also found Officer Pineau to be credible. In contrast, the hearing justice noted that defendant was unable to “keep his story straight, even between direct examination and cross- examination as to what actually happened * * *.” He also stated that defendant had a “motive to lie and to paint the most favorable picture * * *.” In view of these findings, the hearing justice found that Mr. Fairweather had violated his probation as he had “failed to keep the peace and be of good behavior on or about March 22, 2014 * * *.” He specifically pointed to defendant’s actions in “assaulting Ms. Clarissa Randall and also [in] resisting arrest and being disorderly with the police * * *.”', 'After hearing argument from counsel with respect to sentencing, the hearing justice reviewed defendant’s record, taking note of (inter alia) the crime for which he had received the seven-year suspended sentence in 2008. The hearing justice indicated that the record reflected that, since receiving that suspended sentence, defendant had been presented as a probation violator on numerous occasions as a result of assaults that he had committed—“particularly on women with whom he’s in a relationship or had a relationship.” The hearing justice twice alluded to one particular instance, in which a woman with whom defendant had been in a', '-6- relationship was found with “visible bruises and abrasions and contusions about her face,” which the woman said were the result of defendant having assaulted her. The hearing justice further noted that defendant had received “lenient treatment throughout the course of his criminal career” and that the “little punishment” that had been meted out to him had not “in any way, shape, or form deterred Mr. Fairweather, because he continues to engage in this type of behavior * * *.” The hearing justice did recognize that at one point in time there had been a “hiatus” in defendant’s criminal activity; but he added that he did not know whether that “hiatus” was the result of defendant staying “out of trouble” or of not being “caught as he had been in the past.” The hearing justice stated that he could “only draw one conclusion”—namely, that defendant “cannot comport himself within the confines of the law or keep the peace and be of good behavior.” Consequently, the hearing justice ordered defendant to serve seventy-two months of the seventy-eight months remaining on his previously imposed suspended sentence with the balance of six months remaining suspended with probation.', 'Thereafter, defendant filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, which this Court granted.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'It is well established that the sole issue for the court to consider at a probation-violation hearing is “whether or not the defendant has breached a condition of his or her probation by failing to keep the peace or remain on good behavior.” State v.

More specifically, he contends that the “hearing justice acted arbitrarily and capriciously in finding a violation solely based mainly on Clarissa Randall’s testimony which was uncorroborated in the record and was motivated by jealousy and bias.” In defendant’s view, Ms. Randall was “jealous and demoralized” due to his “essentially ignor[ing]” her on March 21, which he contends gave her reason to “fabricate an allegation against [him].” He also points to the following facts as showing that the hearing justice’s credibility assessment of Ms. Randall was “unsupportable:” (1) the fact that she claimed that defendant was intoxicated when the March 22 scene took place, whereas defendant asserts that Officer Pineau testified that he did not see signs of intoxication; (2) the fact that she testified that the assault by defendant was physically violent, whereas “no police officers or hospital workers saw injuries on her body;” and (3) the fact that she asserted that defendant threatened her with a steak knife, but, as defendant alleges, “the officers did not check to see if there was one present in [his] room.” The defendant also contends that the hearing justice’s assessment of defendant’s “version of events was little more than cursory.”', 'Finally, defendant contends that the “hearing justice acted arbitrarily and capriciously when he found that [defendant] failed to be of good behavior in his encounter with the Providence police because [his] conduct did not rise to the level of failure to keep the peace.”', '-9-', 'The record reflects that the hearing justice scrutinized Ms. Randall’s testimony, assessed her credibility, and ultimately accepted her version of events. See Ditren, 126 A.3d at 418. The hearing justice found her to be “credible” and “forthright in testifying about the events that occurred that night.” He noted that her testimony did not vary between direct examination and cross-examination, and he commented that she appeared to be a “good person in the sense [that] she didn’t seem to have any axe to grind or she didn’t seem to have any motive of getting even * * *.” After scrutinizing the record, we are unable to say that the hearing justice lacked plausible reasons for accepting Ms. Randall’s version of events. See State v. Shepard, 33 A.3d 158, 164 (R.I. 2011).', 'We perceive no merit in defendant’s contention that the hearing justice’s credibility determination was “unsupportable” due, in part, to the fact that Ms. Randall testified that defendant was “intoxicated,” whereas, according to defendant, Officer Pineau testified that he did not observe signs of intoxication in defendant. We note that, even if the testimony of these two witnesses was inconsistent, “it would not preclude a determination that the witnesses were credible.” State v. Lopez, 129 A.3d 77, 85 (R.I. 2016); see Jensen, 40 A.3d at 781. Moreover, Officer Pineau did not testify that Mr. Fairweather was not intoxicated, but rather that he “could not [one] hundred percent say that [defendant] was intoxicated * * *.” We similarly find meritless defendant’s contention that Ms. Randall’s credibility is undermined by the fact that, although she stated that he was physically violent towards her, “no police officers or hospital workers saw injuries on her body * * *.”', 'Not every act of physical violence results in perceptible injuries. We also note that, while Officer Pineau testified at the hearing that he had stated in a “Providence Incident Report” that Ms. Randall’s injuries were “non-conclusive,” the text of the report itself actually states that Ms. Randall’s injuries “were not conclusively known', '- 10 - at the time of th[e] report.” Likewise, we are not persuaded by defendant’s contention that the hearing justice’s determination that Ms. Randall was credible is undermined by the fact that the police did not find the knife that she said defendant held during the events in question.

See Ditren, 126 A.3d at 418. In contrast to the hearing justice’s determination with respect to the credibility of Ms. Randall, the hearing justice noted that defendant had a “motive to lie and to paint the most favorable picture * * *.” He further noted that defendant seemed unable to “keep his story straight, even between direct examination and cross-examination as to what actually happened * * *.” It is our view that the hearing justice’s rejection of defendant’s version of the events was by no means irrational. See Shepard, 33 A.3d at 164.', 'After a careful review of the record, it is clear that the hearing justice had plausible reasons to accept Ms. Randall’s version of the events and to reject defendant’s version; in our judgment, the hearing justice’s findings were more than sufficient to constitute a basis for concluding that defendant had not kept the peace and been of good behavior. See id. at 165. We perceive no basis for holding that the hearing justice acted arbitrarily or capriciously in determining that defendant had violated the terms and conditions of his probation.', 'Given our conclusion that the hearing justice did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in determining that defendant had violated the terms and conditions of his probation in view of his interactions with Ms. Randall, we need not reach the issue of whether his subsequent interactions with the police would also have provided a sufficient basis for such a determination.', '- 11 -', 'B', 'The Hearing Justice’s Further Ruling', 'The defendant contends that the sentence meted out to him by the hearing justice was “excessive;” he further contends that the “hearing justice erred when he sentenced [him] based on considerations unrelated to his original offense * * *.” In particular, defendant points to the fact that, in his view, the “hearing justice was swayed by a previous unrelated [Rule] 32(f) presentment regarding a case not before him, which he referenced twice in his sentencing.” Additionally, defendant points to the fact that the hearing justice “looked to the thickness of [his] file” and noted the “lenient treatment” that defendant had previously received as a factor in his decision to execute seventy-two months of defendant’s suspended sentence. The defendant further contends that the “hearing justice neglected to consider * * * that the vast majority of Mr. Fairweather’s charges on the ‘Criminal History Record’ attached by the state to the [Rule] 32(f) package were from 1997 or before * * *.”', 'It is well established that a hearing justice has “wide discretion to determine whether to execute any or all of a defendant’s previously suspended sentence.”', 'State v.

The hearing justice explicitly stated that there had been a “hiatus” in defendant’s criminal activity.', 'It is clear to us that, after adjudicating the defendant to be a violator, the hearing justice did not abuse his discretion in fashioning the defendant’s sentence.', 'The hearing justice’s execution of seventy-two months of the defendant’s suspended sentence was not “excessive” and did not constitute an abuse of discretion.

27,Joseph Hall et al. : v. : City of Newport et al. :,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. The plaintiffs, Joseph Hall, his wife, Marilyn Hall, and their children, Jacob and Philomena Hall (the Halls), appeal from the April 16, 2015 entry of partial final judgment (entered pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure) in favor of the defendant, Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA),1 in Newport County Superior Court. The partial final judgment was entered as a result of the Superior Court’s granting of the defendant’s motion for summary judgment. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties’ arguments (both written and oral), we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this appeal may be decided at this time.', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'There are numerous defendants in this case; for the purposes of this appeal we are concerned only with the claim brought by the Halls against RIPTA.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'According to plaintiffs’ first amended complaint, in March of 2003, Leon Budlong, a bus driver in RIPTA’s employ, claimed that he was assaulted while on his Ruggles Avenue bus route. Over a year after the assault, Mr. Budlong identified Mr. Hall as his attacker for the first time. Mr. Hall was ultimately acquitted by a jury in the Newport County Superior Court after appealing thereto for a de novo trial following his conviction in District Court. According to the first amended complaint in the instant case, Mr. Budlong’s bus route went by the Halls’ home on Ruggles Avenue in Newport “some thirty-two * * * times each day.” Mr. Budlong was assigned to that bus route during all times pertinent to this case. The plaintiffs alleged, in their first amended complaint, that Mr. Budlong “embarked on a pattern of harassment of the Halls” in 2004, after identifying Mr. Hall as his alleged attacker.', 'The plaintiffs’ attorney sent two letters to RIPTA informing them of the alleged harassment by Mr. Budlong—one letter being dated September 22, 2005 and the second letter being dated November 14, 2005. In his first letter, the Halls’ attorney stated the following:', '“One of your trolley drivers, Leon Budlong has engaged in', 'a long series of harassing actions against my clients. My clients', 'have had to resort to the Superior Court to obtain a restraining', 'order against Mr. Budlong, which remains in effect.[2]', '“After an extended absence, Mr. Budlong returned to the', 'route which includes Ruggles Avenue on September 1, 2005 and', 'his harassment of the Halls has escalated. 2', 'On July 7, 2005, in a separate civil action, a Superior Court justice granted the Halls a temporary restraining order against Mr. Budlong. On December 7, 2005, the Superior Court then issued a preliminary injunction ordering mutual restraining orders against Mr. Budlong and the Halls. That preliminary injunction specifically stated: “These proceedings do not resolve the case * * * neither the Court nor either party, respectively, having ordered or requested that the hearing be consolidated with a trial on the merits.”', '-2-', '“This all culminated on Saturday, September 17, 2005', 'when Mr. Budlong drove his trolley bus up to the Halls’ residence,', 'stopped, and took a picture of Mrs. Hall in her yard.', '“The Halls have had it with Mr. Budlong and demand that', 'you remove him from this route to prevent any further harassment', 'of them by Mr. Budlong, which would have serious implications', 'for RIPTA.” After no response was received, Mrs. Hall herself then sent a letter to RIPTA (the third written communication to that entity) on November 28, 2005. In that letter she stated that she was “in fear” for her children, herself, and her husband. She added that Mr. Budlong had “devastated our family by his aggravated, out-of-control harassments.” RIPTA’s response came on December 9, 2005. It stated that RIPTA had investigated the matter, and then it provided as follows:', '“You have indicated that you would like RIPTA to change', 'Mr. Budlong’s route. Please be advised that routes are assigned to', 'drivers pursuant to a detailed process set forth in the collective', 'bargaining agreement between RIPTA and the Amalgamated', 'Transit Union.', '“Again, it appears from what we have learned of this matter', 'that this is a private dispute. Furthermore, while you state in your', 'letter that you are in fear for yourself, your husband, and your', 'children, RIPTA considers this to be a police matter, and if at any', 'time you fear for your safety or that of your family, I urge you to', 'contact the police.', '“Finally, if you have specific complaints about what Mr.', 'Budlong may be doing while he is driving for RIPTA, I urge you', 'to write to us again.”', 'On May 23, 2007, plaintiffs filed the instant action in the Superior Court as a result of Mr. Budlong’s alleged harassment of them. (The complaint contained other counts addressing the alleged actions and/or inactions of other defendants.) In plaintiffs’ first amended complaint, they included one count against RIPTA, alleging a “[f]ailure to [p]roperly [c]ontrol [d]efendant Budlong.” The first amended complaint specifically stated that RIPTA had “received complaints from the Halls about the conduct of their employee, [d]efendant Leon Budlong, explaining his conduct and repeatedly requesting that he be removed from his route” and that RIPTA had', '-3- “failed to take appropriate action in preventing, discouraging or reprimanding [d]efendant Budlong.” The first amended complaint further alleged that RIPTA’s failure to control and supervise constituted negligence because RIPTA had a duty to prevent Mr. Budlong from harassing the Halls; the Halls further alleged that RIPTA breached that duty, which breach was the proximate cause of the Halls’ injuries.', 'Summary Judgment', 'On October 24, 2014, RIPTA filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting that the Halls failed to show that Mr. Budlong was an “incompetent or unfit bus driver” and failed to offer any evidence showing that any negligence on the part of RIPTA proximately caused physical injury or any compensable injury to the Halls. The plaintiffs objected in writing to RIPTA’s motion for summary judgment, alleging that there were numerous issues of material fact in the case.', 'Attached to plaintiffs’ objection to RIPTA’s motion for summary judgment were affidavits from each plaintiff. In his affidavit, Joseph Hall stated that Mr. Budlong: (1) drove by him and rang the trolley bell at him; (2) ripped down reward posters that the Halls had put up in an attempt to find the person who had committed the attack on Mr. Budlong of which Mr. Hall was accused; (3) had his wife call Mrs. Hall on the telephone pretending to be a witness to Mr. Hall’s purported attack on Mr. Budlong; (4) harassed Mr. Hall and his family since “May 23, 2004;” (5) stopped in front of the Halls’ home; (6) “c[a]me at [them] with [their] children in [their] vehicles to scare them;” (7) “cut off” the Halls’ vehicle and then “stalked” them; (8) tried to “run [Mr. Hall] and [his wife] off East Main Road;” (9) blocked the Halls’ driveway with his vehicle; (10) drove a RIPTA bus “straight at” the Halls’ daughter as she drove behind Rogers High School, forcing her “up onto the sidewalk” and then laughing at her; (11) drove by the', '-4- Halls’ residence and gave them “intimidating stares;” (12) “swerved at” Mr. Hall’s truck with his trolley; (13) drove a RIPTA vehicle right through “a stop sign on Ruggles Ave. onto Bellevue Ave.” at the Halls in their truck; and (14) stopped his RIPTA bus by the Halls, who were walking to church, making “masturbation motions” at them. Mrs. Hall’s affidavit provided more detail and set forth even more incidents of harassment than had her husband’s affidavit. However, the incidents Mrs. Hall referenced are similar in nature to those described by her husband. Mrs. Hall did allege in her affidavit that Mr. Budlong intentionally inflicted emotional distress on her and her family members, causing them to “lose sleep.” Additionally, the affidavits of Philomena and Jacob Hall set forth allegations of similar incidents of harassment by Mr. Budlong.', 'On April 6, 2015, a hearing was held on RIPTA’s motion for summary judgment. Numerous exhibits were entered into the record; those exhibits included the two letters to RIPTA from the Halls’ attorney, the letter from Mrs. Hall to RIPTA, and the written response by RIPTA, as well as the affidavits from the four plaintiffs. At that hearing, the hearing justice granted RIPTA’s motion for summary judgment. Partial final judgment was entered on April 16, 2015 pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. The plaintiffs then filed a timely notice of appeal.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'As we have repeatedly stated, this Court reviews the grant of summary judgement in a de novo manner. Shine v.

In addition, the several affidavits filed by the Halls detailing the numerous incidents of harassment that they allegedly suffered at the hands of Mr. Budlong over a long period of time while he was employed by RIPTA and driving the bus route past their residence constitute evidence of the “red flag” variety that genuine issues of material fact remained to be decided.

Thus, the issues of proximate cause and of damages cannot be resolved on a motion for summary judgment in the instant case.', 'It is our conclusion that the Halls adequately supported their objection to the motion for summary judgment with exhibits and affidavits. See Jessup & Conroy, P.C., 46 A.3d at 838-39.

RIPTA argues that the Halls’ case against it is barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel. With respect to the doctrine of collateral estoppel, we have stated the following: “It is axiomatic that in order for collateral estoppel to apply, there must be an identity of issues; the prior proceeding 5', 'In their filings before this Court, the Halls make an additional argument to the effect that the hearing justice inappropriately made credibility determinations during his decision on RIPTA’s motion for summary judgment.

Pelchat, 727 A.2d 676, 680 (R.I. 1999) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'RIPTA bases its contention that the Halls’ action against it is barred by collateral estoppel on an order with respect to a preliminary injunction which was entered by the Superior Court on December 7, 2005. That order states: “These proceedings do not resolve the case * * * , neither the Court nor either party, respectively, having ordered or requested that the hearing be consolidated with a trial on the merits.” Thus, by its own terms, the order is not a final judgment. As such, RIPTA’s collateral estoppel argument is without merit.', 'In addition, RIPTA makes much of the fact that, in their first amended complaint, the Halls allege that RIPTA failed to “[p]roperly [c]ontrol” Mr. Budlong, whereas on appeal the Halls focus on their claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress. RIPTA contends that, due to that fact, the Halls have waived any argument on appeal with respect to RIPTA’s failure to “properly control” claim. We are of the opinion that RIPTA’s argument elevates form over substance. Regardless of the title which the Halls put on their claim, the basis of the claim remains the same: the Halls allege that RIPTA acted in a negligent manner when it failed to properly supervise Mr. Budlong and that that failure proximately caused them emotional harm. As such, we do not perceive any waiver on the part of the Halls.', 'Accordingly, we hold that the hearing justice erred when he granted RIPTA’s motion for summary judgment in view of the fact that unresolved material issues of fact still exist in this case and those issues must be resolved by a fact-finder.', '- 11 -', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court.

28,State : v. : John Benoit.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court.', 'This case is before the Court on appeal by the defendant, John Benoit, from judgment after a jury convicted him on one count of entering an apartment with the intent to commit larceny. The defendant received a four-year sentence, with eighteen months to serve and thirty months suspended, with thirty months of probation. On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial justice erred by: (1) denying his motion for judgment of acquittal, based on his assertion that the state failed to produce sufficient evidence of his intent to commit larceny at the time he entered the apartment; and (2) denying his motion for a mistrial and for a cautionary instruction. This matter came before us, sitting at Smithfield High School, on April 6, 2016, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised by this appeal should not summarily be decided. After considering the parties’ oral and written arguments, and after examining the record, we are of the opinion that cause has not', '-1- been shown and that this case can be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the judgment of conviction.', '1', 'Facts and Travel', '“Times are tough.” This was probably not quite the reaction the complaining witness, Christopher Gervais, expected from defendant, John Benoit, when he confronted the tradesman as he was rifling through the wallet Mr. Gervais kept on top of his bedroom dresser. Although that response may have been surprising, defendant’s presence in Mr. Gervais’s apartment was not totally unexpected. That is because, in April 2013, Cowesett Hills, an expansive apartment complex located in Warwick, was undergoing renovations to replace 3,000 windows and some 1,500 to 2,000 sliding glass doors. The defendant was one of the workers hired to complete this yearlong project. As a member of the crew tasked with completing the project, Benoit’s primary responsibility was installing the trim and caulking around the new doors and windows. When he later testified at trial, Mr. Gervais said that he had received written notice that work would be done on the sliding glass door in the living room of his apartment. However, he was under the impression that the work on his bedroom window had been completed because he had been sent a separate notice about work being done on that window about a week earlier. That window already had been replaced “so there was no reason [for defendant] to be in the bedroom.” As Mr. Gervais understood it, the notice the management company provided described the work to be done that day, but it was “only for the back sliding window and the workers w[ould] only need to be at that part of the unit inside each apartment” and “[t]here was absolutely no reason why anybody should [have been] inside [his] bedroom.”', '-2-', 'Mr. Gervais testified that his girlfriend and another friend had spent the previous night at his home, but that they had left in the morning. The friend left sometime after defendant arrived to work on the sliding door. Mr. Gervais remained in bed after his guests left that morning, but he was awakened by the sound of his bedroom door opening about an hour after the work began in the living room. He said that “[w]hen I woke up, [defendant] was going through * * * my wallet to find some sort of valuables or cash.” He said that he noticed when defendant entered the room, he immediately turned right to where the dresser was, “looking for where items were situated in any typical bedroom,” and “[a]s soon as he saw the wallet, he opened it up to see what was in there.” Mr. Gervais also testified that, at no point while defendant was in his bedroom, did defendant attempt to approach the bedroom window or even look in the direction of the window.', 'Having seen enough, Mr. Gervais confronted defendant and asked him, “[C]an I help you?” According to Mr. Gervais, defendant appeared “very nervous and startled” when he realized that Mr. Gervais was still in the apartment. When asked why he was going through the wallet, defendant responded that “times are tough” and that “he really didn’t mean to do anything personal and steal from [Mr. Gervais].” Mr. Gervais said that defendant, in an apparent attempt to make amends, then offered to buy him a case of his favorite beer. After defendant put the money back, Mr. Gervais asked him to leave. However, before he left the apartment, defendant finished putting up the blinds in the living room, and wrapped up his work on the sliding glass door.', 'Irked by this incursion, Mr. Gervais called the police. After the police arrived, he made a statement and described defendant as having a thin build, pronounced veins in his arms, and gray hair. Officer Robert Hart of the Warwick police department testified that, on the morning in', '-3- question, he received a dispatch call to respond to the Cowesett Hills apartments. Over defendant’s objection, Officer Hart testified that the call was for a “[p]ossible burglary in progress.”', 'At that point, defendant moved for a mistrial, arguing that, although he was on trial for entering an apartment with the intent to commit larceny, the jury had just heard irrelevant hearsay evidence regarding a possible burglary, the prejudicial effect of which was so severe that a mistrial was warranted. The trial justice denied the motion, reasoning that the testimony was not hearsay because it did not go to the truth of the matter asserted, but rather to the state of mind of Officer Hart at the time he was responding to the call. The defendant then asked for a cautionary instruction that the testimony was “introduced only to explain why the police officer ever arrived at the apartment complex,” but “not to consider it as evidence of breaking and entering.” The trial justice denied the request as unnecessary, stating that the testimony “didn’t go to whether the burglary was in place, it went to why did he respond to this address.” Officer Hart went on to say that after he arrived on the scene, he took a statement from Mr. Gervais and then asked Mr. Gervais to come outside to see if he could identify the perpetrator. He said that, when they stepped outside there were a number of workers present, that Mr. Gervais immediately identified defendant as the person involved, and that he made note of the fact that defendant had pronounced veins in his arms and a slim build.', 'Officer James Michailides of the Warwick police department also testified. He said that, when he responded to the Cowesett Hills apartment complex, he was approached by Mr. Gervais. After speaking briefly with Mr. Gervais, he sent him back to his apartment to wait for Officer Hart to arrive. Meanwhile, Officer Michailides spoke with a group of men working at the other end of the building. As he approached, he noticed that defendant fit the description', '-4- of the suspect that had been provided to him, including the pronounced veins in his arms. He asked defendant what had occurred; at first, defendant denied being involved. However, after Officer Michailides asked the whole group of men what happened, defendant conceded that he had indeed taken money, but said that he had immediately put it back.', 'Lastly, Officer Michailides testified that in Mr. Gervais’s apartment the sliding glass door was located in the rear of the apartment, and his bedroom was located by the front door.', 'After Officer Michailides testified, the state rested. The defendant then made a motion for judgment of acquittal, arguing that the evidence established that he was in the apartment to work but that there was no evidence that defendant had the intent to commit larceny at the time he entered Mr. Gervais’s apartment. He argued that the state could not “invite the jury to speculate about some other possible intent, [as] he was there to work.” Specifically, defense counsel argued that the evidence was that he went to the apartment to complete the work there and at some point entered the bedroom, but that what occurred after he entered the apartment was not relevant, and that there was no circumstantial evidence of intent that justified giving the case to the jury.', 'The state argued that the motion for judgment of acquittal had to be denied based on Mr. Gervais’s testimony, because his testimony, if believed, was that he watched defendant enter his bedroom, go directly to his dresser, and rifle through his money. The state asserted that Mr. Gervais had testified that defendant told him that “times were tough, indicating that this defendant was in need of some money prior to entering the apartment,” which, the state argued, was circumstantial evidence of defendant’s intent.', 'The state argued that, from all of this evidence, the court could infer that defendant had the requisite intent to commit larceny. The', '-5- state also argued that it was plausible that, when defendant entered the apartment, he simultaneously had the intent to both work on the apartment and to commit larceny.', 'The trial justice denied defendant’s motion, ruling that it was premature to take the case away from the jury because there was evidence that the jury could consider to find intent. The trial justice said that, even accepting defense counsel’s argument that defendant’s intent to commit larceny needed to be formed at the time he entered the apartment, he believed there was a sufficient level of direct and circumstantial evidence that would allow a jury to make reasonable inferences about defendant’s intent at the time he entered the apartment.', 'The defendant called one witness, Henry Bozzo, to testify on his behalf. He said that, in April 2013, he was working on a yearlong project to replace all the windows and doors at the Cowesett Hills apartment complex. He testified that he hired defendant to work on the job and that, on the day of the incident, defendant’s job was to work on the trim on the inside of the apartments, including caulking the windows and cleaning up afterwards. He testified that, although workers were instructed to inspect every window before they left, the workers were allowed to touch only the windows or doors they were working on and that they were allowed to touch only furniture that needed to be moved. He confirmed that if a worker was caulking a bedroom window, “[a]t the end of the day, before we lock up we check, [and] make sure everything is done,” including “look[ing] at the doors on the way out.”', 'After defendant rested, he renewed his motion for judgment of acquittal. The trial justice said that nothing in Mr. Bozzo’s testimony had altered his decision to allow the case to go to the jury, and he again denied the motion. In so doing, the trial justice pointed out that Mr. Bozzo’s testimony—that there would have been no need for defendant to touch any furniture or other personal belongings—would actually aid the jury in its deliberations about defendant’s intent.', '-6- The jury returned a verdict of guilty on one count of entering an apartment with the intent to commit larceny. The defendant filed a timely notice of appeal. 1', '2', 'Issues on Appeal', 'On appeal, defendant assigns two errors to the trial justice. First, he argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal because the state failed to provide sufficient evidence that he had the intent to commit larceny at the time he entered Mr. Gervais’s apartment. He asserts that, when he entered the apartment, it was with the intent to work on the glass sliding door and bedroom window and that he did not enter the bedroom and handle the cash on the dresser until approximately an hour later. As he sees it, there was no evidence produced of any activity that would suggest a criminal intent before he entered the residence. He also argues that his conduct while he was in the bedroom does not suffice to prove his intent before he went into the apartment.', 'Second, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a mistrial and for a cautionary instruction after Officer Hart testified that he responded to a call for a “[p]ossible burglary in progress.” He argues that this testimony was hearsay and was prejudicial and that it was erroneous to allow it without a cautionary instruction. 1', 'The defendant’s notice of appeal was prematurely filed. Nonetheless this Court has said that in “cases in which an appeal has been prematurely filed, it will ‘treat the appeal as if it had been timely filed after judgment was entered.’” Arnold Road Realty Associates, LLC v. Tiogue Fire District, 873 A.2d 119, 125 n.4 (R.I. 2005) (quoting United Lending Corp. v.

In reviewing the denial of a motion for a judgment of acquittal, a defendant must overcome a decidedly high bar in that “we apply the same standard as that applied by the trial justice; namely, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, * * * giving full credibility to the state’s witnesses, and draw[ing] therefrom all reasonable inferences consistent with guilt.” State v. Gomez, 116 A.3d 216, 224– 25 (R.I. 2015) (quoting State v. Rolon, 45 A.3d 518, 523 (R.I. 2012)); see also State v. Fleck, 81 A.3d 1129, 1133 (R.I. 2014).

Lamoureux, 573 A.2d 1176, 1181 (R.I. 1990). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state and giving full credibility to its main witness, Mr. Gervais, several observations about defendant’s actions establish reasonable inferences of guilt. First, according to Mr. Gervais, the work that was to be done that day was limited to replacing the sliding glass door in the living room. Indeed, Mr. Gervais testified that the work to the window in the bedroom had already been completed, and that “[t]here was absolutely no reason why anybody should [have been] inside [his] bedroom.” For the purposes of the motion, Mr. Gervais’s testimony must be taken as true.', 'To explain his presence in the bedroom, defendant points to Mr. Bozzo’s testimony that defendant was instructed to inspect every window and door before he left the apartment. However, two facts undercut defendant’s argument that he was in the bedroom to inspect the window: Defendant did not enter the bedroom until after Mr. Gervais’s friend had left the apartment that morning and he did so while he was still working on the sliding glass door. Moreover, when Mr. Gervais caught defendant rummaging through his wallet, defendant in no way attempted to justify his presence in the bedroom, either while in the bedroom or before he finally left the apartment, nor did he ever explain that he was ordered to inspect the window in the bedroom. Finally, even if defendant was authorized to enter the bedroom to check the condition of the window, Mr. Gervais’s testimony was clear that defendant never even looked in the direction of the window, but instead walked directly to the dresser, and immediately started “looking for where items were situated in any typical bedroom.” It would not be unreasonable for a jury to draw the inference that defendant intended to commit larceny when he entered the', '-9- apartment, and therefore, that there was sufficient evidence, if accepted by the factfinder, to convict him of entering the apartment with the intent to commit larceny.', '4', 'Denial of Motion for Mistrial and for a Cautionary Instruction', 'A', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court will not disturb a trial justice’s ruling on a motion to pass the case and declare a mistrial unless there is an abuse of discretion.

We defer to the trial justice in this regard because he or she “has a front-row seat at the trial and is in the best position to determine whether a defendant has been unfairly prejudiced.” Tully, 110 A.3d at 1191 (quoting State v. Oliveira, 882 A.2d 1097, 1127 (R.I. 2005)). In the instance of potentially prejudicial statements, a mistrial is warranted only where the “inappropriate remark * * * has so inflamed the jurors that they no longer would be able to decide the case based on a calm and dispassionate evaluation of the evidence.” State v.

In discussing this issue at sidebar, the following exchange took place:', '“[Defense Counsel]: Now I’m asking you to instruct the', 'jury —', '“THE COURT: Read the question back.

So I don’t think a cautionary', 'instruction is necessary.” Officer Hart’s answer did not prejudice defendant to the extent that a mistrial or cautionary instruction was warranted. It is clear from the record that Officer Hart was in no way suggesting that a burglary had in fact taken place. The defendant misses the mark by focusing only on part of his response—“burglary in progress”—when he says that “the jury * * * was permitted to consider evidence of a more serious felonious and larcenous act than the one alleged in the case.” Viewing Officer Hart’s full answer in context, that he was dispatched to respond to a “[p]ossible burglary in progress,” undercuts the defendant’s claim.

I am pleased to be able to concur in the opinion of the Court regarding the denial of the motion for mistrial and for a cautionary instruction. However, with respect to the judgment of acquittal issue, I respectfully dissent. I do not do so lightly—especially in view of the fact that no other member of the Court shares my view concerning this issue. I have very carefully considered the articulate arguments of counsel and the carefully crafted opinion of the majority, but in the end I remain unpersuaded by the reasoning of the majority with respect to the judgment of acquittal issue. I am definitely convinced that a judgment of acquittal should have been granted in this case. I am quite simply unable to perceive in the record evidence of the defendant’s intent sufficient for a rational jury to reach a finding of guilt.', 'I consider it to be of capital importance to keep constantly in mind the fact that the only charge against defendant was, in the words of the Criminal Information, “enter[ing] the apartment * * * with the intent to commit larceny * * *.” As such, the entire focus should be on defendant’s state of mind at the moment of his entry into the apartment. I have found absolutely nothing in the record that constitutes evidence of defendant having a larcenous intent at that crucially important point in time.', '- 12 -', 'I am well aware that a motion for judgment of acquittal pursuant to Rule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure requires that the evidence be viewed “in the light most favorable to the prosecution, giving full credibility to its witnesses, and drawing all reasonable inferences consistent with guilt.” State v.

However, while I have tried conscientiously to scrutinize the record in that light, I nonetheless have been unable to isolate any evidence that is indicative of defendant’s intent, at the moment that he entered the apartment, to do anything other than to begin to carry out his assigned task—as he was entitled to do.', 'The facts of this case are in stark contrast to other cases involving the crime of breaking and entering with the intent to commit larceny in which this Court has held that there was sufficient evidence of a defendant’s criminal intent. See State v. Guerra, 12 A.3d 759, 767 (R.I. 2011); State v. McLaughlin, 621 A.2d 170, 178 (R.I. 1993); State v. Lamoureaux, 558 A.2d 951, 954 (R.I. 1989); State v.

In each of the just-referenced cases, the defendant’s entry into the space at issue took place in the absence of the defendant’s having the right to enter said space. See Guerra, 12 A.3d at 761 (noting that a witness saw the defendant exiting a building which he had had no right to enter); McLaughlin, 621 A.2d at 178 (noting the fact that the defendant had entered a house that he had no right to enter and did so through a cellar window); Lamoureaux, 558 A.2d at 954 (noting that the defendant’s entry into the building in question was “unauthorized”); Johnson, 116 R.I. at 455, 358 A.2d at 374 (noting that the “defendant’s aborted illicit nighttime breaking and entering into [a] teacher’s apartment warrant[ed] the inference that he was there to steal something”).

By contrast, in the instant case, the record is clear that defendant did not enter the bedroom until he had worked on the sliding door for about an hour. If he in fact had the intent of committing larceny at the point in time when he entered the apartment (which, I repeat, is the only crime with which he was charged), one wonders why he waited so long before carrying out his larcenous plan.', 'Additionally, this Court has previously found that acts committed prior to a defendant’s entry can be indicative of a defendant’s intent upon entry. See Lamoureaux, 558 A.2d at 953, 954 (noting the fact that the defendant had admitted inquiring about a business’s plans with respect to an impending hurricane so as to learn whether anyone “would be present in the building,” in determining that there was sufficient evidence in the record to warrant denial of the defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal). However, in the instant case, there is no evidence whatsoever of the defendant having committed any act or having uttered any word prior to entering the apartment that would indicate that he had the intent to commit larceny upon entering.', 'For these reasons, I respectfully dissent from the opinion of the Court upholding the trial justice’s denial of the motion for judgment of acquittal.', '- 14 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'State v.

He further testified that he was scared because he did not know defendant but did not want to be rude by not responding.', 'Joshua next testified that he got up from his seat and told his father that he was going to the bathroom.

The state then asked Joshua if he “recall[ed] describing any other type of contact between [him] and the defendant that day in the bathroom in your statement to Detective Devine?” Again, Joshua answered, “No.” After the state directed Joshua’s attention to a specific portion of his witness statement, it asked, over defendant’s continued objection, “Tell me what it is you told Detective Devine.” Joshua answered, “That he grabbed my hand and made me touch his exposed penis.” The state then asked if there was “some reason [he] didn’t want to tell us that?” Joshua responded, “Um, I was just scared to tell you.”', 'The state also called Glenn as a witness. He testified that, as he was ordering lunch, Joshua approached him and told him that he had to use the bathroom. He further testified that Joshua was still in the bathroom when he got back to the table with the food. According to Glenn’s testimony, Joshua left the bathroom, came up to him, and told him “that man touched me;” and, when Glenn asked what he meant, Joshua replied “sexually.” Glenn recounted that Joshua pointed to defendant when he walked out of the bathroom.

Kizekai, 19 A.3d 583, 589 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Guerra, 12 A.3d 759, 766 (R.I. 2011)). “If the trial justice has articulated adequate grounds for denying the motion, his or her decision is entitled to great weight and will not be overturned by this Court unless he or she has overlooked or misconceived material evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.” State v. Bunnell, 47 A.3d 220, 233 (R.I. 2012) (quoting State v.

Grullon, 984 A.2d 46, 53 (R.I. 2009))."", 'III', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Motion for a New Trial', 'The defendant first attacks the trial justice’s denial of his motion for a new trial. Before reaching the merits of his contention, however, we must first confront a procedural hurdle. Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that “[a] motion for a new trial based on any * * * grounds [other than newly discovered evidence] shall be made within ten (10) days after the verdict or finding of guilty or within such further time as the court may fix during the ten-day period.” Importantly, we have held that “[t]he time limit set forth in Rule 33 is jurisdictional and cannot be waived.” State v. Champion, 873 A.2d 92, 94 (R.I. 2005); State v. Rodriguez, 742 A.2d 728, 733 (R.I. 1999).', 'Here, the jury returned a verdict on Monday, March 31, 2014. Thus, the deadline for filing a motion for a new trial in accordance with Rule 33 was Thursday, April 10, 2014. However, defendant’s attorney did not file the handwritten motion until the date of the hearing', '-5- on Monday, April 14, 2014. 5 As such, the motion for a new trial was untimely and should not have been considered by the trial justice, and, accordingly, is beyond our review on appeal.', 'To be sure, at the hearing, the trial justice considered whether the motion was filed in a timely manner. However, the state mistakenly represented that the deadline was April 14, 2014. Thus, the trial justice issued a warning that he “would suggest that [defendant] file it today.” Even considering such a warning, however, we reiterate that “[t]he time limit set forth in Rule 33 is jurisdictional and cannot be waived.” Champion, 873 A.2d at 94. Rule 33 specifically provides that any further time for filing a motion for a new trial must be fixed by the trial justice within the ten-day period. Accordingly, the fact that the parties and the trial justice mistakenly believed that the time to file such a motion had not lapsed is of no consequence.', 'The motion was untimely and thus not properly before the trial justice.', 'Nevertheless, even if we were to consider defendant’s argument with regard to his motion for a new trial, it is devoid of any merit. In essence, defendant’s argument is that the trial justice erred by crediting Joshua’s testimony in denying his motion for a new trial because (i) the trial justice specifically acknowledged certain shortcomings of Joshua’s testimony; and (ii) the surveillance videotape from McDonald’s contradicted Joshua’s testimony with regard to whether Joshua or defendant exited the bathroom first.', '“We accord great deference when we review the decision of a trial justice on a motion for new trial ‘because a trial justice, being present during all phases of the trial, is in an especially good position to evaluate the facts and to judge the credibility of the witnesses.’” State v. Whitaker, 79 A.3d 795, 804 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Rosario, 35 A.3d 938, 948 (R.I. 2012)). 5', 'After the jury returned its verdict on March 31, 2014, defendant’s counsel indicated that he “anticipate[d] filing a motion for new trial” and sought to schedule a hearing on the motion. At that time, the hearing was scheduled for April 7, 2014, but it did not actually occur until April 14, 2014.', ""-6- In addition, “[w]e have repeatedly held that ‘neither a witness's prior contradictory statements nor the inconsistencies in his testimony inhibit a fact finder's right to accept the witness as credible, and to pick and choose from his testimony what portions he deems worthy of belief.’” King v.

While a trial justice “commits clear error when he or she completely overlooks testimony which is materially contradictory to the testimony on which the justice bases his or her determination[,]” id., that did not occur in this case. Indeed, the trial justice noted the inconsistencies in Joshua’s testimony in excruciating detail and after “[h]aving acknowledged that his testimony was not perfect nor crystal clear,” he found that “his difficulties in relating what happened to him * * * does not significantly erode the case built by the [s]tate.” Viewing Joshua’s testimony “through the lenses of a 13 year old, confronted with a situation that he was confronted with in that men’s room,” he specifically found the testimony “to be credible and trustworthy and sufficient to meet the elements of second degree sexual assault child molestation * * *.”"", 'The trial justice undertook a detailed review of Joshua’s testimony, acknowledged its shortcomings, but nevertheless found his testimony to be credible. After carefully reviewing the record before us, we conclude that, even if properly before us, the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive material evidence in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial. See State v. Paola, 59 A.3d 99, 106 (R.I. 2013).', 'B', 'Jury Instructions and Verdict Sheet', 'The defendant’s next attack sets its crosshairs at the jury instructions and verdict sheet, claiming that they permitted the jury to return a non-unanimous guilty verdict, thus running afoul of this Court’s holding in State v. Saluter, 715 A.2d 1250, 1254-55 (R.I. 1998). Specifically,', '-7- defendant contends that the trial justice incorrectly applied Saluter when he instructed the jury and failed to specifically state that the jury was required to unanimously find that defendant committed one or the other of the alleged sexual contacts, or both. That is, according to defendant, the verdict was unclear because “there is a question in the present case as to whether the jury unanimously found that [defendant] touched [Joshua] over his clothing, whether the jury unanimously found that [defendant] forced [Joshua’s] hand to touch his penis, or both, or whether the jury was split between the two allegations.” In response, the state suggests that defendant failed to object below and, therefore, his claim on appeal should be deemed waived.', '“The term ‘duplicity’ refers to the joining of two or more offenses, however numerous, in a single count of an indictment.” Saluter, 715 A.2d at 1253. We have consistently held that “a motion to dismiss based on a duplicitous complaint is * * * an objection [based on a defect of the complaint].” 6 Id. at 1254 (quoting State v. LaPlante, 122 R.I. 446, 449, 409 A.2d 130, 131 (1979)); State v. Roberts, 420 A.2d 837, 840 (R.I. 1980) (“[T]he proper way to attack a duplicitous complaint, indictment, or information is by motion pursuant to Super. R. Crim. P. 12(b)(2), (3).”). Thus, by failing to file a motion to dismiss, defendant waived his claim of duplicity. See Saluter, 715 A.2d at 1254; Roberts, 420 A.2d at 840.', 'Having failed to avail himself of this procedural tool, defendant attempts to raise his duplicity claim by asserting error in the jury instructions and verdict form. This attempt fails because it falls squarely within this Court’s “raise-or-waive” rule. In accordance with such rule, “a litigant cannot raise an objection or advance a new theory on appeal if it was not raised before the trial court.” State v. Bido, 941 A.2d 822, 829 (R.I. 2008). In the present matter, defendant 6', 'We also note that an appropriate bill of particulars could have been used to cure any potential duplicity issue, see State v. DaSilva, 742 A.2d 721, 727 (R.I. 1999); however, defendant failed to file one.', '-8- failed to object to both the jury instructions 7 and the verdict form. In fact, not only did defendant not object at any point with regard to this issue, but, when the trial justice explained his plan to deal with a potential Saluter problem, defense counsel acquiesced in the trial justice’s strategy to neutralize the issue. 8 Thus, defendant cannot now be heard to complain of the error. See Bido, 941 A.2d at 828-29.', ""We also note that the exception to the raise-or-waive rule is not available to defendant. It is well settled that our raise-or-waive rule generally “will not be disturbed unless ‘basic constitutional rights are concerned.’” Bido, 941 A.2d at 829 (quoting State v. Gomez, 848 A.2d 221, 237 (R.I. 2004)). “[T]o fall within this exception, the defendant must show: (1) that the error complained of amounts to more than harmless error; (2) that a sufficient record exists to permit a determination of the issue; and (3) that ‘counsel's failure to raise the issue [before trial] must be premised upon a novel rule of law that counsel could not reasonably have known during the trial.’” Cronan ex rel. State v. Cronan, 774 A.2d 866, 878 (R.I. 2001) (quoting State v. Donato, 592 A.2d 140, 142 (R.I. 1991)). Even assuming, arguendo, that the error complained of would constitute more than harmless error, the rule of law upon which this argument is premised 7"", 'Following the jury charge, defense counsel did state that “just for the record based on the earlier conference I would ask that my objection be noted to that one issue that we discussed earlier.” However, the basis for defendant’s objection is unclear from the record. Thus, even if this objection were in regard to duplicity, such an objection is not properly preserved for our review. See State v. Fry, 130 A.3d 812, 822 (R.I. 2016). Moreover, at oral argument, defense counsel speculated that such objection was not asserted with regard to duplicity, but, instead, may have been an exception to the trial justice’s denial of an instruction on a lesser included offense. 8', 'Specifically, prior to Joshua’s anticipated testimony with respect to a second touching, defendant objected pursuant to Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, and the parties went off the record to discuss a possible limiting instruction. When the parties returned to the record, the trial justice noted a potential Saluter issue and stated his intention to “instruct the jury if they find either one of [the two] incidences [of touching] * * * and are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of that, that is sufficient to convict on the one count.” He then asked: “Is that how we are going to proceed, gentlemen?” and defense counsel replied, “Yes, your Honor.”', '-9- is far from novel. 9 Indeed, Saluter was decided by this Court in 1998, and we have, on several occasions, expounded upon the applicability of its holding. See State v. Davis, 877 A.2d 642, 649 (R.I. 2005) (declining to apply our holding in Saluter where the “jury unanimously found the defendant guilty of two of the crimes charged, each of which constituted one offense charged in separate counts of the indictment”); State v. DaSilva, 742 A.2d 721, 727 (R.I. 1999) (declining to apply the Saluter rule where the “bill of particulars, together with the jury instructions and the verdict form, adequately clarified the counts before the jury and negated any potential duplicity in the indictment”). Accordingly, counsel could (and should) reasonably have known of the rule of law pronounced by this Court in Saluter at the time of trial, and, thus, the exception to the “raise-or-waive” rule is inapplicable.', 'The defendant presents two additional last-ditch arguments to attempt to save his claim. First, he suggests that the fact that “the trial judge seemed to represent himself as the expert in the subject” should warrant an exception from the raise-or-waive rule.', ""We have never recognized such an exception and decline to do so today. Second, defendant attempts to liken his case to State v. Dennis, 893 A.2d 250, 263 (R.I. 2006), to argue that we should find the same “circumstances peculiar” in that case and relax the raise-or-waive rule in the current instance. There, however, we declined to deem the defendant’s argument as waived “because of the trial justice's explicit statement that he would not give ‘any instructions * * * regarding Miranda rights to [the] jury.’” Id. at 264. Such circumstances simply do not exist in the case before us. Accordingly, we conclude that defendant’s multiple attempts to bypass this Court’s “raise-or- waive” rule are unavailing, and, thus, we do not consider his Saluter argument on appeal. 9"", 'Notably, defendant asks this Court to “revisit its present incarnation of the ‘raise-or-waive’ rule[,]” and, instead, adopt a framework similar to the four-principle test used by the First Circuit with regard to waiver. See United States v. Krynicki, 689 F.2d 289 (1st Cir. 1982). We decline to do so.', '- 10 -', 'C', 'Joshua’s Witness Statement', 'In his next assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial justice erred by improperly allowing the state to “refresh [Joshua’s] recollection” of the second touching by using his witness statement. He contends that Joshua did not testify to a lack of memory, but, instead, testified that he omitted the second touching from his testimony because he was scared; thus, according to defendant, a proper foundation for refreshing Joshua’s recollection had not been formed.', ""However, in ruling on defendant’s objection to Joshua’s anticipated testimony, the trial justice stated: “If he says no then he could impeach him with his own statement assuming that * * * statement is inconsistent or if he says I’m not sure I don’t remember why can’t he refresh his recollection with his own statement about something that he just can’t recall on the stand.” Although he does not cite to a specific Rule of Evidence by number, this ruling makes clear that, when Joshua answered that there had not been a second touching, the trial justice’s reasoning for allowing use of the witness statement was based on a prior inconsistent statement under Rule 801(d)(1)(A) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. Pursuant to that rule, the prior statement (Joshua’s witness statement) is admissible if “[t]he declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement, and the statement is inconsistent with the declarant's testimony[.]” Id. To admit a prior statement into evidence under Rule 801(d)(1)(A), “there must be two statements and each must be sufficiently inconsistent to render the prior statement admissible.” State v. Jaiman, 850 A.2d 984, 988 (R.I. 2004) (quoting State v. Bettencourt, 723 A.2d 1101, 1111 (R.I. 1999))."", ""“The determination of whether a pretrial statement is * * * inconsistent with the witness's in-court testimony is [within] the sound discretion of the trial justice.” Id. (quoting Bettencourt, 723 A.2d at 1111). Notably, unlike the"", ""- 11 - federal rule concerning the substantive admissibility of prior inconsistent statements, “the inconsistent statement need not have been made while under oath subject to penalty of perjury at a trial, hearing, deposition or other proceeding.” Id. (quoting Advisory Committee's Notes to Rule 801 at 1052)."", 'Here, Joshua’s testimony at trial that there was no second touching was contrary to the account that he had given in his witness statement, “[t]hat [defendant] grabbed [Joshua’s] hand and made [him] touch [defendant’s] exposed penis.” Rule 607 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence provides, in pertinent part, that “[t]he credibility of a witness may be attacked by any party, including the party calling the witness * * *.” Given the inconsistency between Joshua’s testimony at trial and his witness statement, it was within the trial justice’s discretion to allow the state to impeach him with his prior statement. Accordingly, defendant’s argument with regard to the state improperly refreshing Joshua’s recollection must fail.', 'D', 'Glenn’s Witness Statement', 'The defendant’s final point of contention concerns the trial justice limiting his use of the following portion of Glenn’s witness statement:', '“I called the police and an officer came to speak to us. I then found out', 'that the male tried to touch [Joshua’s] penis and the male tried to have [Joshua]', 'touch his penis. [Joshua] told the officer that the male asked [Joshua] to suck his', 'penis.” (Emphasis added.) The defendant suggests that the word “tried” within this statement would have aided him in casting doubt as to the act of touching and that, had the word “tried” been entered into evidence, the trial justice would not have refused to give an instruction on a lesser included offense. 10 In 10', 'While defendant suggests in his brief that the trial justice would not have refused to give a lesser included instruction had this evidence been admitted, he cites no case law and presents no', '- 12 - addition, defendant contends that this statement contradicts Glenn’s testimony at trial when he stated that he did not learn much additional information as a result of Joshua’s interview with police.', 'The defendant points to two places where he contends the trial justice improperly prevented him from using this statement. First, he suggests that the trial justice improperly denied defendant’s use of the written statement during his cross-examination of Glenn. Second, he asserts that, during Officer Slack’s testimony, the trial justice improperly excluded the statement based on his unfounded conclusion that the statement was already before the jury “by implication.” We consider each of these contentions in turn.', 'With regard to defendant’s assertion that the trial justice excluded defendant’s use of the written statement on cross-examination of Glenn, such a suggestion is belied by the record. When defendant attempted to use Glenn’s witness statement during his questioning, the state objected and a discussion at sidebar ensued.', 'Contrary to defendant’s assertion on appeal, however, the trial justice did not preclude defendant’s use of the statement in cross-examination, argument to challenge the trial justice’s refusal to give such an instruction. We have held that this Court “consider[s] an issue to be waived when a party ‘[s]imply stat[es] an issue for appellate review, without a meaningful discussion thereof or legal briefing of the issues * * *.’” Bucci v. Hurd Buick Pontiac GMC Truck, LLC, 85 A.3d 1160, 1170 (R.I. 2014) (quoting State v. Chase, 9 A.3d 1248, 1256 (R.I. 2010)).

Thus, we do not consider defendant’s argument to the extent that it may suggest that a lesser included instruction was warranted.', '- 13 - but, rather, corrected defense counsel’s form of the question. Specifically, the trial justice expressed the following:', '“I’m okay with that question. * * * I was okay with you asking him that. * * *', 'Let’s clearly show that you are using it to show that he said something different in', 'that statement than he said either previously or on this witness stand.

I’m not', 'aware of any rule that permits that.” In response, defense counsel stated: “That is fair enough. I can call the patrolman, Judge.” Thus, the record makes pellucid that defense counsel was not precluded from questioning Glenn with regard to his witness statement. Instead, defense counsel abandoned his strategy to question Glenn with respect to this statement, and, instead, opted to use it to question Officer Slack. Accordingly, defendant’s argument with respect to the use of Glenn’s witness statement during his cross-examination must fail.', 'We turn next to defendant’s assertion that the trial justice improperly excluded the statement during the examination of Officer Slack. On direct examination of the officer, defense counsel asked: “I understand that you say that [Joshua] never said the man tried to touch me, but in the statement that I show you—[.]” At that point, he was interrupted by an objection by the state, and the parties engaged in a discussion at sidebar. Defense counsel argued:', '“Judge, the witness just testified that at no point in time did [Joshua] ever say to', 'him that the man tried to touch [him]. Recognizing that the statement I’m citing', 'is the statement purportedly prepared by the Pawtucket Police after speaking to', '[Glenn], I’m merely asking this particular witness if this statement says that the', 'male tried to touch [Joshua’s] penis and the male tried to have [Joshua] touch his', 'penis. I’m not even offering it for the truth of the matter asserted[;] merely these', 'words appear in this document.” After this discussion, the trial justice sustained the state’s objection, and defense counsel reiterated: “I would just ask my exception to be noted specifically on the grounds that I would', '- 14 - submit it is not hearsay because it is not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted merely that the words appear in a statement * * *.”', 'The defendant’s basis for objection before this Court is unclear. He appears to assert that the statement should have been permitted under Rule 801(d)(1)(A) as a prior inconsistent statement. However, the trial record makes clear that such an argument was not advanced below and, therefore, is deemed to be waived. See Bido, 941 A.2d at 828-29. Indeed, defense counsel set forth but one argument below: that the statement was not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted. Nevertheless, he abandons this argument before us and, therefore, we do not consider it. 11 See State v. Giordano, 413 A.2d 93, 94 (R.I. 1980). Thus, there is no argument with respect to the use of Glenn’s witness statement in the examination of Officer Slack that is properly before this Court.

Early in the morning of October 25, 2011, as she was leaving for work, the complaining witness, Dilcia Lora, was viciously attacked by a masked assailant in the front hall of her home and was severely cut on her face with a small blade. Ms. Lora subsequently identified her attacker as the defendant, Jose A. Breton a.k.a. Pappi Valdez, a man with whom she had previously had a two-year-long romantic relationship. In a three-count information, the defendant was charged with one count of assault with a dangerous weapon and one count of simple assault on Ms. Lora. The third count was for a simple assault against Ms. Lora’s daughter, Jani Tolentino, which was alleged to have occurred on May 26, 2010. When the case was reached for trial, the defendant was convicted of the two counts of assault against Ms. Lora, but he was acquitted of the third count against Ms. Tolentino. The defendant filed a motion for a new trial, which the trial justice denied. 1 It is from that ruling that the defendant has timely appealed, arguing that the trial justice misconstrued the evidence when 1', 'On count 1 defendant was sentenced to twenty years, eleven to serve, nine years suspended, with nine years of probation. On count 2, he was sentenced to one year to serve, suspended with probation to run concurrently with count 1.', '-1- he found Ms. Lora to be a more credible witness than the alibi witnesses produced by the defendant.

For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of conviction.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On May 26, 2010, Ms. Lora and defendant had an argument, during the course of which defendant struck and pushed Ms. Lora’s daughter, Jani Tolentino. The police were called, but when they arrived, Ms. Lora told them that she did not know defendant’s real name, only his alias, “Pappi Valdez,” and that they had been dating for only three months when in fact they had been dating for two years. At trial, Ms. Lora explained that she had not been truthful with the police because she was afraid of what defendant would do if she reported him to law enforcement.', 'According to Ms. Lora, she and defendant had been in a two-year relationship that had been replete with assaults and threats. The romance, she said, came to an end in December 2010. However, Ms. Lora said that she never explained to defendant that the relationship was over and that she never “officially” broke up with him, but instead she simply left the country. Ms. Lora said that she went to the Dominican Republic to stay with her mother, remaining there for approximately two months. Ms. Lora did not tell defendant she was leaving the country or where she would be going, nor did she inform her mother why she had come to stay. However, shortly after she got to the Dominican Republic, defendant showed up at her mother’s house, unexpected and uninvited. The defendant repeatedly asked Ms. Lora to resume their relationship and he promised to enter counseling. But Ms. Lora was unmoved, and, when she refused to get back together with him, he left.', '-2-', 'Ms. Lora moved to Florida and then back to Santo Domingo before finally returning to Rhode Island in August 2011. In Rhode Island, she lived with her brother, her sister, her daughter, and her niece and nephew. Eventually, Ms. Lora secured employment at Kenny Manufacturing, where she worked with the mother of defendant’s children. Occasionally, she saw defendant as he brought that woman to work but, she explained, she avoided interacting with either of them.', 'On October 25, 2011, as she was leaving her apartment to go to work, Ms. Lora was accosted by a hooded and masked assailant. Ms. Lora made an effort to defend herself with her hands “so he wouldn’t cut [her]” and, during the course of the struggle, she was able to pull part of the mask up. When she did, she recognized defendant’s nose and chin. Ms. Lora also recognized the ski mask as belonging to defendant. Ms. Lora screamed for help and attempted to defend herself as the attacker kept slashing at her with the knife. Ms. Lora’s brother, niece, daughter, and sister, hearing her screams, rushed to her aid. When they arrived, the assailant ceased attacking Ms. Lora, fled the apartment building and ran down the street. Lisandro, Ms. Lora’s brother, chased the assailant out of the building but was unable to catch him. Ms. Lora immediately told her family that “Pappi” had cut her.', 'At the hospital, Ms. Lora informed the doctors that Jose Breton had cut her face, that she had been in a relationship with him for a long time, that he “always threatened [her]” and that she had never before reported the abuse because she feared that he “would leave [her] paralyzed.” She also told the medical personnel that defendant had followed her to the Dominican Republic and had confronted her at her mother’s house. Although Ms. Lora related these events to the doctors, she did not immediately notify the police about who had attacked her because she was still afraid of defendant.', 'However, the following day Ms. Lora advised', '-3- Det. Emilio Matos of the Providence police department that defendant had assaulted her, that she knew it was him because of his height and build, and that she recognized the “little bit” of his face that had become uncovered when she tugged on the mask. She also explained that “the only person threatening [her] was [defendant]. And he was always threatening [her] if [she] left him he was going to kill [her], this that [sic], that he was going to take [her] eyes out, that he was going to leave [her] paralyzed.”', 'At trial, the attending emergency room physician, Dr. Leo Kowayashi, testified that Ms. Lora presented with three lacerations above her right eye as well as a large deep laceration to the left side of her face, and that these wounds would result in permanent scarring. Ana Cruz, defendant’s mother, testified for her son. She said that she had brought defendant to New York City on October 24, 2011, the day before the assault, dropping him off there as she traveled to Virginia for a funeral service for a recently deceased family member. She said that she rented a minivan at the T.F. Green Airport in Warwick, on October 24, 2011, traveled to New York City with defendant, and arrived in Manhattan around 3:30 a.m. on October 25, 2011. Ms. Cruz testified that she left defendant in Manhattan and picked up other family members who were going to the funeral, and that defendant went to stay with her brother’s former girlfriend, “Fam,” for the day in Brooklyn. Ms. Cruz produced receipts for the rental car, gas, and tolls for the trip to Virginia. She testified that she returned the rental van on October 26, 2011.', 'Femije Tairi, or “Fam,” testified that defendant’s mother called her on October 24, and asked if defendant could stay with her because there were too many people going to the funeral and not everyone could afford to go. She said that she met Ms. Cruz and defendant in Manhattan early in the morning on October 25, 2011, and Ms. Cruz picked up other family members; Ms. Tairi said that she then drove with defendant back to her home in Brooklyn, where she lived', '-4- with her daughter and two small sons. She testified that she and defendant arrived at her home around 4 a.m., at which point they started talking about the deceased family member and “goofing around like normal families” before making breakfast at about 6 a.m. The defendant’s aunt, Marilyn Castillo, arrived around 6:15 a.m. “to grieve,” and Ms. Tairi explained that “[w]e have our own way of grieving.” According to Ms. Tairi, defendant stayed in Brooklyn until after 10 p.m., at which point she transported him back to Manhattan to meet his mother for the return trip to Rhode Island. 2', 'The jury returned a guilty verdict on counts 1 and 2, but acquitted defendant on count 3. When defendant was heard on his motion for a new trial, he argued that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence because it was based primarily on the credibility and reliability of Ms. Lora in identifying defendant as her assailant. The defendant challenged Ms. Lora’s ability to identify her attacker, arguing that an accurate identification was impossible given that the attack began and ended in a matter of seconds in a poorly lit stairwell. Additionally, he pointed to the fact that it took her over a day to identify defendant as her assailant to the police after she initially lied to them. And when she finally did, he argued, she did not describe defendant’s specific facial features to them. Finally, defendant argued that the state was unable to cast doubt on the unimpeached testimony of his alibi witnesses. 3', 'Standard of Review', 'Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that “[o]n motion of the defendant the court may grant a new trial to the defendant if required in the interest of 2', 'Ms. Castillo testified that Ms. Tairi had invited her to have breakfast on October 24 as a “family reunion[] [on] the occurrences of my cousin’s death.” She arrived there with her two children around 6 a.m., when she had breakfast with Ms. Tairi, her nieces, and defendant. 3', 'The defendant argued for the first time, in his supplemental Rule 12A statement and at oral arguments before this Court, that the trial justice’s decision demonstrated “a cultural bias or ignorance.” After reviewing the record, we see no merit to this argument.', '-5- justice.” The trial justice’s role in reviewing a motion for a new trial is that of the proverbial “superjuror” who independently weighs the evidence and assesses the credibility of the witnesses. Battle v. State, 125 A.3d 130, 132 (R.I. 2015). “Specifically, ‘the trial justice must (1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.’” State v. Offley, 131 A.3d 663, 674 (R.I. 2016) (quoting State v. Heredia, 10 A.3d 443, 446 (R.I. 2010)). “If, after conducting such a review, the trial justice reaches the same conclusion as the jury, the verdict should be affirmed and the motion for a new trial denied.” State v. Gregson, 113 A.3d 393, 398 (R.I. 2015) (quoting State v. Mathews, 88 A.3d 375, 388 (R.I. 2014)). In the end, we will not disturb the decision of a trial justice on a motion for a new trial unless the decision is clearly wrong or “the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material and relevant evidence * * *.” Battle, 125 A.3d at 132 (quoting Gomes v. Rosario, 79 A.3d 1262, 1265 (R.I. 2013)).', 'Analysis', 'At the outset of his decision, the trial justice acknowledged that the state’s “case rises and falls on the shoulders of the [s]tate’s first witness Dilcia Lora.” He also said that he had “listened carefully” to defense counsel’s arguments and that he did not “overlook the various points made” by him. These included the poor lighting, the fact the assailant was wearing a mask during an attack that occurred in a matter of seconds, Ms. Lora’s inability to identify the weapon used, and her refusal to identify defendant or reveal her prior relationship with him. Nonetheless, the trial justice found her to be a credible witness. In so doing, the trial justice, in evaluating her testimony, said he sought to “understand the circumstances, the background, the', '-6- relationship, between Ms. Lora and this defendant in weighing, sifting, and evaluating some of the contradictions and omissions * * *.”', 'For that, he looked to Ms. Tolentino’s testimony, which he also found credible. Even though defendant was acquitted of the assault charge related to her, the trial justice said that it was helpful that she “did describe the nature of [the relationship between Ms. Lora and defendant] and the dynamics of that relationship and the conduct exhibited by this defendant towards her mother in the period of time leading up to the events related to these specific charges.” Finding their testimony to be genuine, he summarized,', '“[t]here is no question in observing those two cases, mother and', 'daughter on this witness stand either it was an academy award', 'acting performance or it was a legitimate and sincere display of', 'fear but there is no question in this [c]ourt’s mind, I have not seen', 'witnesses testify in the manner that they testified aside from what', 'they said but the manner of delivery how they positioned', 'themselves on the witness stand, it didn’t strike me as contrived or', 'an act. It seemed like a sincere display of their feeling towards this', 'defendant.”', 'The trial justice did not stop there, however, and he went on to address the credibility of the defendant’s alibi witnesses, all of whom placed him in New York at the time of the attack. During the defendant’s argument on his motion for a new trial, the trial justice specifically questioned the alibi testimony regarding having the family gathering at 6 to 7 a.m. to memorialize a decedent.', 'The trial justice asked defense counsel to address the timing, commenting specifically:', '“[It] just so happened that is exactly the time that this assault', 'occurred. And, of course, they identified the defendant as sitting at', 'the table. I mean, I mean, I know there are different cultures and', 'different ways that people do things and [sic] but isn’t that an odd', 'time of day to gather little children and let’s all sit around and that', 'is the time you pick to memorialize this person who died.', '“* * *', '-7-', '“I just thought it peaked [sic] my interest at the time of the day that', 'took place.” In response, defense counsel dismissed any suggestion that the time of day was odd, reasoning that it was natural under the circumstances to hold a family gathering at that time of the day:', '“So if he arrives 3:30, 4:00 in the morning what is he', 'supposed to go to sleep at four a.m. or something. Of course they', 'are going to be up, and you cook breakfast, you know, young kids', 'have breakfast 6:30 seven in the morning. They get up early. So,', 'again, it was not just, not just a gathering for the memorial it was', 'also to see my client, too. Because the mother was coming into', 'town and they needed to pick my client up. She wasn’t going to be', 'staying at the house in Brooklyn. She was driving through. So', 'that is the reason for that time so the time is the trip for Rhode', 'Island time it takes to get to New York, meet them over in', 'Manhattan and instead of more driving to Brooklyn and Manhattan', 'because other people were meeting 191st Street the trip from 191st', 'Street goes back over to Brooklyn and the other aunt came over a', 'little bit later on to meet for breakfast time. I think she arrived', 'little after six she said.” However, the trial justice rejected the testimony of the alibi witnesses when he weighed it against the testimony of Ms. Lora, Ms. Tolentino, and the history of Ms. Lora’s relationship with the defendant. The trial justice opined that', '“[w]hen you take that testimony and weigh it against what', 'Ms. Lora and her daughter had to say and the history of that', 'relationship up to that point, I can’t say I disagree with the jury’s', 'conclusion that the alibi would not be accepted based on the', 'recitation of those witnesses.” We are of the opinion that the trial justice satisfied his obligations when he considered and decided the defendant’s motion for a new trial, and that he was well within his discretion when he found the state’s witnesses to be credible, despite any inconsistencies in their testimony. See State v. Gonzalez, 56 A.3d 96, 103 (R.I. 2012) (“Even taking into account [the trial justice’s] own observations that something was ‘being left out,’ the trial justice found that the witnesses', '-8- were credible * * *.”); State v. Jensen, 40 A.3d 771, 781 (R.I. 2012) (“[T]he presence of some inconsistencies between or among utterances of a witness or witnesses at different points in time does not ipso facto render the testimony unworthy of belief.”).', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of conviction.

31,: In the Matter of B.H.,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. The respondent, B.H., appeals from adjudications of delinquency entered in the Family Court. The Family Court trial justice found the respondent delinquent on two charges of first-degree child molestation sexual assault (first-degree child molestation) in violation of G.L. 1956 §§ 11-37-8.1 and 11-37-8.2. On appeal, the respondent primarily contends that the evidence at the delinquency proceeding was insufficient to establish sexual penetration—an element of both of the charges of first-degree child molestation of which the respondent was adjudged to be delinquent. We agree that the evidence was insufficient on this element, and we remand to the Family Court with directions to enter adjudications of delinquency on the lesser-included offense of second-degree child molestation sexual assault (second-degree child molestation) and for resentencing.', 'Facts and Travel', 'In August 2012, the Cranston Police Department filed delinquency petitions with the Family Court, alleging that, when respondent was thirteen years old, he committed two offenses that, if committed by an adult, would constitute the offense of first-degree child molestation and', '-1- one offense that, if committed by an adult, would constitute the offense of second-degree child molestation. The two complainants, Kevin and Henry, are twin brothers who were eleven years old at the time of the offenses.1 The state alleged that respondent committed first-degree child molestation against Kevin and Henry when he forced the victims to penetrate his anus with their penises and that he committed second-degree child molestation when he touched Kevin’s penis with his hand.2 Because the testimony of the two complainants is central to the primary issue respondent raises on appeal, we recount it in some detail.', 'The conduct giving rise to all three offenses occurred during a sleepover in August 2011. After a day of fishing, Kevin, Henry, and respondent had a sleepover at the home of the twins’ maternal grandparents. During the sleepover, the three boys shared the same room. Kevin testified that, after the three boys had retired to the bedroom that evening, respondent asked Kevin to put Kevin’s penis “in [respondent’s] butt.” Because Kevin trusted respondent, who was his best friend, and because respondent threatened to tell his grandmother “something” if he refused, Kevin complied. When asked whether his penis went “inside of [respondent’s] butt,” Kevin responded in the affirmative. Kevin also testified that respondent expressed a desire to insert respondent’s penis into Kevin’s “butt” but that Kevin refused. On cross-examination, it became apparent that Kevin was unable to recall the specifics of this episode with any great detail, and he repeatedly stated that he did not remember the details. However, Kevin was 1', 'To afford the complainants a measure of privacy, we use fictitious names to identify them. 2', 'The trial justice ultimately concluded that the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that respondent committed second-degree child molestation by touching Kevin’s penis, and this finding is not pertinent to the issues on appeal. Accordingly, we have no need to discuss the evidence relating to this charge.', '-2- emphatic that his penis went “in” and “inside” respondent’s “butt.”3 It is evident from the transcript that it was difficult for Kevin to testify about what transpired during the sleepover. The trial justice later explained in her bench decision that Kevin “was noticeably upset, crying, [and] sometimes almost sobbing” during the course of his testimony.', 'Like Kevin, Henry had difficulty testifying about this episode; he testified that “I don’t like talking about it.” The trial justice later described each twin as “visibly shaken” during his testimony. Henry’s testimony was similar to his brother’s. He testified that respondent proposed that the boys engage in “[a]n experiment to see if we wanted to be gay” and that the experiment was “[t]o stick my penis in his butt.”', 'Henry testified that he placed his penis “inside [respondent’s] butt.”4 Like Kevin, Henry explained that he complied with respondent’s request because respondent threatened to tell his grandmother that they “were trying to do something” if he did not. Henry also testified that respondent placed his penis on Henry’s body and that he, like his brother, refused to allow respondent to insert his penis into Henry’s “butt.” As was true for Kevin’s testimony, cross-examination revealed that Henry could not recall many specifics of the episode. Nevertheless, when defense counsel asked whether Henry put his penis “inside of [respondent],” Henry responded that he did.', 'On redirect examination, Henry was asked, “[W]hen you mean [respondent’s] butt, what is that part of [the] body used for?” Henry did not answer this question.5 3', 'Henry also testified that he observed Kevin “[stick] his penis in [respondent’s] butt.” 4', 'Confirming Henry’s testimony, Kevin testified that he observed his brother “[p]utting his penis in [respondent’s] butt.” 5', 'During closing argument, the state asserted that “[Henry] clarified that [the term] ‘butt’ [meant] the part of the body that one uses to poop.” However, this assertion does not comport with the transcript of the delinquency proceeding. The pertinent passage of the transcript reads as follows:', '-3-', 'The twins’ mother testified that, when she picked up her children the day after the sleepover, a hysterical Kevin told her that “[respondent] wanted them to do it in the bum bum of them, and * * * [respondent] looks like he enjoyed it.” Finally, Det. Sean Maloney of the Cranston Police Department testified that, after he explained the arraignment procedure in Family Court to respondent, respondent stated: “I understand. I did it. I did not force them. It was experimental.”', 'At the close of the state’s case, respondent moved to dismiss the petitions. With respect to the first-degree child molestation charges, defense counsel argued that the twins’ testimony that they placed their penises “in” or “inside” respondent’s “butt” was insufficient to establish sexual penetration—an essential element of the offense.', 'Defense counsel also argued— incorrectly, we conclude—that, if the state had established sexual penetration, the state was required, in the circumstances of this case, to prove that respondent “acted with the intent for sexual arousal or sexual gratification” and that it had not done so.', 'The trial justice denied respondent’s motion, concluding that the testimony of both Kevin and Henry was sufficient to establish sexual penetration. The trial justice explained her rationale as follows:', '“[I]n or inside the butt, as described by each victim, is more than', 'sufficient to satisfy the requirement of the statute for sexual', 'penetration. In or inside the butt is an intrusion, however slight. In', 'or inside the butt is certainly where the anal opening is located.', '“Q.', 'And[,] just to clarify, when you mean [respondent’s] butt, what is that part', 'of [the] body used for?', '“A.', '(NO RESPONSE).” We therefore give no weight to this assertion. Additionally, we note that the state has not repeated this assertion on appeal, and the trial justice made no mention of it in her findings of fact adjudicating respondent delinquent on the two charges of first-degree child molestation.', '-4-', '“This Court does not expect a child, now thirteen years old,', 'to describe a horrific act that occurred two years ago when the', 'child was eleven years old, with such specificity and adult', 'language that it mirrors the language of the statute. Using one’s', 'common sense, the victims each were truthful, credible[,] and', 'consistent in describing the act[,] and[,] when questioned and', 'challenged many times, each testified consistently at different', 'times that their penis[es were] inside [respondent’s] butt. Inside', 'plainly means an intrusion, however slight, in the anal opening.”', 'Although the trial justice also rejected respondent’s argument that the state was required to prove that respondent acted with the intent of sexual arousal or gratification, she nonetheless went on to conclude that the state had in fact proven that respondent’s conduct was intended for sexual arousal or gratification. She explained:', '“[T]he [r]espondent’s specific request of each victim to penetrate', 'his butt with their penis[es], [r]espondent’s description and', 'instruction on how to perform the act which he called an', 'experiment and his willingness to participate and [his] engaging in', 'the act was for the sole and exclusive purpose of sexual', 'gratification or arousal. There was no other reason or purpose for', '[r]espondent to make such a suggestion to two very young[,]', 'inexperienced boys whose innocence and trust in him practically', 'guaranteed compliance.', '“Further, [r]espondent’s later request to penetrate the', 'victims, which request was refused by them, adds another layer to', '[r]espondent’s quest for sexual gratification or arousal.', '“Even though th[e] element [that the accused act with the', 'intent for sexual arousal or gratification] is not essential to [prove]', 'when the act is purposeful penile penetration, that element does', 'exist here.”', 'Concluding that the state had met its burden of proving that respondent committed first- degree child molestation upon Kevin and Henry, the trial justice adjudged respondent delinquent on those charges. The respondent timely appealed.', '-5-', 'Standard of Review', 'On appeal from an adjudication of delinquency, our task “is to review the record to determine ‘whether legally competent evidence exists therein to support the findings made by the Family Court trial justice.’” In re Miguel A., 990 A.2d 1216, 1220 (R.I. 2010) (quoting In re Andrey G., 796 A.2d 452, 456 (R.I. 2002)). In passing on the sufficiency of the evidence, “the relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.” Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979); cf. In re Miguel A., 990 A.2d at 1223 (reciting a similar standard for this Court’s review of a motion for a judgment of acquittal).', 'Analysis', 'Sufficiency of Evidence on Sexual Penetration', 'The respondent argues that the evidence in this case, which establishes, at most, that Kevin and Henry each inserted his penis “in” and “inside” respondent’s “butt,” is insufficient to establish sexual penetration—an essential element of the offense of first-degree child molestation. We agree.', 'Section 11-37-8.1 provides that “[a] person is guilty of first[-]degree child molestation sexual assault if he or she engages in sexual penetration with a person fourteen (14) years of age or under.” (Emphasis added.) In turn, § 11-37-1(8) defines the term “[s]exual penetration” as follows:', '“‘Sexual penetration’ means sexual intercourse,', 'cunnilingus, fellatio, and anal intercourse, or any other intrusion,', 'however slight, by any part of a person’s body or by any object', 'into the genital or anal openings of another person’s body, or the', 'victim’s own body upon the accused’s instruction, but emission of', 'semen is not required.”', '-6- This case requires us to decide whether testimony that Kevin’s and Henry’s penises were “inside of [respondent’s] butt” is sufficient to establish “anal intercourse[] or any other intrusion, however slight, by any part of a person’s body or by an object into the * * * anal opening[] of another person’s body * * *.” Id. We unanimously hold that this evidence is not sufficient.', 'Although the focus below and in the briefs on appeal was whether the evidence was sufficient to establish an “intrusion, however slight, * * * into the * * * anal opening[],” § 11-37- 1(8), the state contended at oral argument that what transpired during the sleepover qualifies as “anal intercourse” as that term is used in the statute. We reject this assertion. The terms “sexual intercourse” and “anal intercourse” are not defined in § 11-37-1. Dictionaries typically provide a primary definition of “sexual intercourse” that involves the penetration of the vagina by the penis.6 See, e.g., Mosby’s Medical, Nursing, and Allied Health Dictionary 276, 1075 (3d ed. 1990) (Mosby’s) (defining “sexual intercourse” and “coitus” as “the sexual union of two people of opposite sex in which the penis is introduced into the vagina”); Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary 1074 (10th ed. 1997) (Merriam-Webster’s) (defining “sexual intercourse” as “heterosexual intercourse involving penetration of the vagina by the penis”). Although the parties have not cited, and we have not found, a dictionary definition of the term “anal intercourse,” we are persuaded that that term, like sexual intercourse, involves penetration by the penis. Therefore, the term “anal intercourse” means penetration of the anal opening by a penis. See State v. DeLeonardo, 340 S.E.2d 350, 353 (N.C. 1986) (“Anal intercourse requires penetration of the anal opening of the victim by the penis of the male.”); 70C Am. Jur. 2d 6', 'When confronted with an undefined term contained in G.L. 1956 § 11-37-1(8), we turn to dictionary definitions for that term. See, e.g., In re Ryan B., 739 A.2d 232, 235 n.2 (R.I. 1999) (consulting dictionary definition for term “fellatio”); State v. Beaulieu, 674 A.2d 377, 378 (R.I. 1996) (same for term “cunnilingus”).', '-7- Sodomy § 3 at 644 (2011) (“One act that is almost universally prohibited by sodomy statutes is anal intercourse, which requires the penetration of the anal opening of the victim by the penis of a male.”); cf. State v. Bryant, 670 A.2d 776, 778, 783 (R.I. 1996) (referring to “count 3[, which charged ‘anal intercourse,’] where anal penetration by the penis was charged and found to have occurred”).', 'Thus, if the twins’ testimony established only an intrusion into the area between respondent’s buttocks and not an intrusion into respondent’s anal opening, such an intrusion does not constitute anal intercourse. See State v. Gallagher, 668 A.2d 55, 61 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1995) (“While insertion of the penis between the left and right buttocks may be sufficient to prove sexual contact in that there is a touching of the victim’s intimate part, it is not sufficient to prove anal intercourse.”). The precise issue we must decide, then, is whether the testimony of each twin that his penis went “in” and “inside” respondent’s “butt” is sufficient to qualify as an intrusion into the anal opening.', 'The word “butt” in the context in which it was used by Kevin and Henry is slang for buttocks. See 1 J.E. Lighter, Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang 333 (1994); Richard A. Spears, NTC’s Dictionary of American Slang and Colloquial Expressions 61 (3d ed. 2000); Kenneth G. Wilson, The Columbia Guide to Standard American English 82 (1993); see also Merriam-Webster’s, at 155. The buttocks are defined as “[t]he prominence formed by the gluteal muscles of either side.” Stedman’s Medical Dictionary 283 (28th ed. 2006) (Stedman’s); see also Dorland’s Illustrated Medical Dictionary 248 (27th ed. 1988) (defining “buttock” as “one of the gluteal prominences; called also clunis or breech and, in the plural, nates”); Mosby’s, at 795 (defining “nates” and “buttocks” as “the large fleshy protuberances at the lower posterior portion of the torso comprising fat and the gluteal', '-8- muscles”). The anus or anal orifice, by contrast, is defined as “[t]he lower opening of the digestive tract. It is associated with the anal sphincter and lies in the cleft between the buttocks, through which fecal matter is extruded.” Stedman’s, at 114. “The words [buttocks and anus] are not synonyms as they describe entirely different parts of the anatomy.” Downey v. State, 726 N.E.2d 794, 797 (Ind. Ct. App. 2000).', 'When enacting the chapter of our general laws relating to sexual assault, the General Assembly drew a distinction between the buttocks and the anus.', 'The term “sexual penetration”—an essential element of first-degree sexual assault, see § 11-37-2, and first-degree child molestation, see § 11-37-8.1—is defined to include intrusions into the “anal opening[].” Section 11-37-1(8). By contrast, the offenses of second-degree sexual assault and second-degree child molestation require “sexual contact.” Section 11-37-4; § 11-37-8.3. Sexual contact is defined as “the intentional touching of the victim’s or accused’s intimate parts, clothed or unclothed, if that intentional touching can be reasonably construed as intended by the accused to be for the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification, or assault.” Section 11-37-1(7). In turn, the phrase “[i]ntimate parts” is defined as “the genital or anal areas, groin, inner thigh, or buttock of any person or the breast of a female.” Section 11-37-1(3) (emphases added). It is clear from this carefully constructed statutory framework that the General Assembly appreciated the distinction between the buttocks and the anus or anal opening.', 'This Court’s decision in State v. McDonald, 602 A.2d 923 (R.I. 1992), is instructive. In that case, the defendant was charged with first-degree sexual assault arising from digital penetration of the complainant’s vagina. Id. at 924, 925. The complainant testified that the defendant “touched her ‘in the vagina.’” Id. at 924. She also testified that the defendant had “touched her ‘in the breasts.’” Id. at 925. We held that this evidence was insufficient to', '-9- establish sexual penetration. Id. In so holding, we explained that, “in respect to such a serious allegation [as digital vaginal penetration], precise and specific testimony is necessary to support it” and that “[t]o infer penetration from [the complainant’s] testimony would be to draw an inference that could scarcely justify a finding of digital penetration beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id.', 'In this case, the necessary precise and specific testimony was lacking. The twins’ use of the term “butt” rendered their testimony too imprecise and vague on the pertinent question of whether sexual penetration occurred in this case: that is, whether there was an intrusion, however slight, into respondent’s anal opening. In reaching this conclusion, we necessarily reject the trial justice’s reasoning that “[i]n or inside the butt is certainly where the anal opening is located.” This circumstance is beside the point. To sustain a prosecution for first-degree child molestation, the state had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that sexual penetration—an intrusion into an anal opening in the circumstances of this case—occurred. By eliciting only testimony about an intrusion into respondent’s “butt,” the state failed to carry its burden.', 'An intrusion into the space between a person’s buttocks, while perhaps a necessary step on the path to intrusion of the anal opening, is not, in itself, an intrusion into the anal opening. See Downey, 726 N.E.2d at 798 (“Despite their proximity, the buttocks and anus are not the same, and an inference that contact with the buttocks necessarily includes contact with the anus[7] cannot be made beyond a reasonable doubt in this case.”).', 'Although we reaffirm today that “precise and specific testimony is necessary to support” a prosecution for first-degree sexual assault or first-degree child molestation, McDonald, 602 7', 'Unlike Rhode Island’s first-degree child molestation statute, which requires an intrusion, however slight, into the anal opening, the statute in Downey v. State, 726 N.E.2d 794, 798 (Ind. Ct. App. 2000), required only that contact with the anus be made.', '- 10 - A.2d at 925, we by no means impose upon young children the burden of employing anatomically correct labels for the parts of the body.8 To the contrary, it is entirely appropriate for a young child to use his or her own words to describe the pertinent body parts during his or her testimony, so long as there is some evidence to link these words to the body parts delineated in the statute. See, e.g., In re Andrey G., 796 A.2d at 454, 455 & n.2, 458 (rejecting sufficiency-of-the- evidence challenge with respect to sexual-penetration element of first-degree child molestation where the complainant, who was six years old at the time of the offense, testified that the respondent “put his finger ‘inside of [her] privates’ and then ‘put more fingers in it’” and the respondent kept “tapping me, and I didn’t like it”; the complainant also clarified that “‘privates’ are used for going to the bathroom”); cf. In re Ryan B., 739 A.2d 232, 233, 234, 237 (R.I. 1999) (rejecting sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge in a first-degree child molestation case involving fellatio where, among other evidence, a detective testified that the complainant, who was six years old at the time of trial, “told him that she had sucked on [the respondent’s] lollipop, in his bum, when [the respondent] pulled down his pants” and that the complaint “correctly identified body parts using an anatomical drawing and she pointed to the penis when asked to identify the ‘lollipop’”).', 'In this case, however, there was no evidence to link the twins’ use of the word “butt” to respondent’s anal opening. When the prosecutor asked Henry “what * * * part of [the] body” the “butt” was used for, Henry provided no response. The prosecutor did not follow up to ensure an answer to this question was given, and she did not pose a similar question to Kevin. Consequently, there was a failure of proof. 8', 'We note that, when they testified, Kevin and Henry were less than four months shy of their fourteenth birthdays.', '- 11 -', 'For these reasons, we hold that the evidence in this case—the testimony of Kevin and Henry that their penises were “in” and “inside” respondent’s “butt”—was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that sexual penetration of respondent’s anal opening occurred.9 9', 'Numerous courts have reached similar conclusions.

App. Ct. 1976) (holding that the complainant’s testimony that the defendant’s penis was “in my butt” was insufficient to sustain conviction for deviate sexual assault, which required proof of an act involving the defendant’s sex organs and the complainant’s anus); Downey, 726 N.E.2d at 796, 796-98 (holding that testimony of child complainant that the defendant “rubbed his penis between her buttocks until orgasm” was insufficient to prove contact between the defendant’s penis and the complainant’s anus); State v.

Malouin, 433 A.2d 176, 178 (R.I. 1981) (“[S]econd-degree sexual assault is necessarily a lesser- included offense of first-degree sexual assault.”). The element that differentiates the greater offense from the lesser-included offense is the type of touching that occurs; first-degree child molestation requires sexual penetration, while the lesser-included offense of second-degree child molestation requires only sexual contact. See § 11-37-8.1; § 11-37-8.3; see also Malouin, 433 A.2d at 178.10', 'This jurisdiction follows the common-law rule that, when the state charges an accused with an offense that has a lesser-included offense, the accused is on notice that “an accusation of the greater crime carries with it the charge that he [or she] has committed all the necessarily 10', 'At oral argument, respondent contended that second-degree child molestation is not a lesser- included offense of first-degree child molestation because the second-degree offense requires proof of an element not required for conviction or adjudication on the first-degree offense: that the “intentional touching can be reasonably construed as intended by the accused to be for the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification, or assault.” Section 11-37-1(7). We reject this argument. For starters, it is inconsistent with this Court’s decisions in State v. Silvia, 798 A.2d 419, 424-25 (R.I. 2002), and State v. Malouin, 433 A.2d 176, 178 (R.I. 1981).

Walsh, 113 R.I. 118, 123, 318 A.2d 463, 466 (1974); see also id. at 122-23, 318 A.2d at 466. The General Assembly has codified this rule in G.L. 1956 § 12-17-14, which provides that:', '“Whenever any person is tried upon an indictment, information, or', 'complaint and the court or jury, as the case may be, shall not be', 'satisfied that he or she is guilty of the whole offense, but shall be', 'satisfied that he or she is guilty of so much of the offense as shall', 'substantially amount to an offense of a lower nature, or that the', 'defendant did not complete the offense charged, but that he or she', 'was guilty only of an attempt to commit the same offense, the', 'court or jury may find him or her guilty of the lower offense or', 'guilty of an attempt to commit the offense, as the case may be, and', 'the court shall proceed to sentence the person for the offense of', 'which he or she shall be so found guilty, notwithstanding that the', 'court had not otherwise jurisdiction of the offense.” Additionally, as we explained in Silvia, this rule applies to sexual-assault offenses:', '“[W]hen ‘[a]ny person who is indicted for * * * first * * * degree', 'child molestation * * * upon trial the jury [or trial justice] acquits', 'that person of any of the charges of sexual assault and finds him or', 'her guilty of any of the other [lesser-included] offenses [including', 'second[-]degree child molestation], judgment and sentence may be', 'entered against him or her accordingly.’” Silvia, 798 A.2d at 424', '(quoting § 11-37-9).', 'Therefore, in this case, each count of the petition charging respondent with first-degree child molestation necessarily included a charge on the lesser-included offense of second-degree child molestation.11', 'See Walsh, 113 R.I. at 122, 318 A.2d at 466.', 'Similarly, in finding 11', 'For this reason, the dissent’s position that our disposition of this case “is grossly unfair to this respondent” and that “the unsuspecting respondent has been waylaid by the sua sponte decision of this Court” rings hollow. Irrespective of whether the lesser-included offense was addressed by the parties or the trial justice, the above-cited statutes, as a matter of law, placed respondent on notice that he was charged with first-degree child molestation as well as all of that crime’s lesser-included offenses; such is the case in every criminal trial. See State v. Walsh, 113 R.I. 118, 122-23, 318 A.2d 463, 466 (1974) (“[General Laws 1956] § 12-17-14 is but a reaffirmation of the common[-]law rule that where an indictment charges an offense which includes within it another lesser offense, it is sufficient to prove so much of the charge as demonstrates that the accused is guilty of a crime therein contained, although not to the full extent charged against', '- 14 - respondent delinquent on the greater offense, the trial justice necessarily found that all of the elements of the lesser-included offense had been met. In fact, it was respondent who argued that the state was required to prove that he acted with the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification, and the trial justice complied, finding beyond a reasonable doubt that respondent acted with such intent.12 On appeal, respondent argues that there was insufficient evidence to support this finding. We reject this contention.', 'In State v. Erminelli, 991 A.2d 1064 (R.I. 2010), we held that evidence that the defendant “intentionally touched [the complainant’s] naked buttocks with his penis” was sufficient to sustain a conviction for second-degree child molestation because “[s]uch contact ‘can be reasonably construed as intended by [the defendant] to be for the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification, or assault.’” Id. at 1070 (quoting § 11-37-1(7)). Similarly, in this case, there is sufficient evidence that the contact between respondent’s “butt” and the twins’ penises can be reasonably construed as intended by respondent to be for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification. The trial justice found that respondent, by asking the twins to penetrate his “butt” with their penises and by voluntarily engaging in the act of contact between his intimate parts and those of Kevin and Henry, acted “for the sole and exclusive purpose of sexual gratification or arousal.” She further noted that respondent’s expressed desire to switch roles with Kevin and him. * * * Consequently, a defendant is charged with the knowledge that an accusation of the greater crime carries with it the charge that he has committed all the necessarily included lesser offenses that make up the greater crime. He will not be heard to complain that he is not prepared to defend against the lesser offenses or that the statute authorizing the return of a guilty verdict on the lesser offenses deprives him of his constitutional right to a presentment on indictment relative to the ‘infamous crime’ which the jury believes he has committed.”). 12', 'The dissent characterizes the trial justice’s action in this regard as “mention[ing], almost as an aside, that the element of sexual gratification was present.” In our opinion, this is not accurate. In the course of three paragraphs of her bench decision, the trial justice explained that she was “convinced” that respondent acted “for the sole and exclusive purpose of sexual gratification or arousal” and that “[t]here was no other reason or purpose” for respondent’s conduct.', '- 15 - Henry and put his penis on or in their intimate parts was further evidence of his purpose in engaging in this conduct.', 'Moreover, the twins’ mother testified that Kevin told her that respondent “look[ed] like he enjoyed it.” After viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the contact between respondent and the twins can be reasonably construed as intended by respondent to be for the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification, or assault. See Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319.', 'Contrary to respondent’s suggestion, the mere fact that he characterized the exchange as an “experiment” does not foreclose this conclusion. Cf. State v. Rossi, 520 A.2d 582, 583, 584 (R.I. 1987) (rejecting sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge in second-degree child molestation case where the defendant argued that the purpose of the contact between his penis and the minor complainant’s vaginal area was to rehearse the minor’s testimony that she was molested by the defendant’s landlord, a story that was concocted by the defendant to combat a rent increase imposed by the landlord; the Court explained that, when “view[ing] the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, drawing all reasonable inferences therefrom, one can reasonably infer from this record that when [the defendant] was ‘contacting’ the eight-year-old after removing all her clothing, other things were on his mind than attempting to gain revenge on his landlord for increasing the rent”). The evidence was sufficient on this element.', 'When, as in this case, this Court determines on appeal that the evidence adduced at a bench trial was insufficient only on the element that differentiates the greater offense from the lesser-included offense, such that a conviction or adjudication on the greater offense cannot be upheld, we have directed the entry of judgment on the lesser-included offense. See State v. Eiseman, 461 A.2d 369, 383-84 (R.I. 1983), abrogated in part on other grounds by Horton v.', '- 16 - California, 496 U.S. 128 (1990).13', 'Therefore, we remand this matter to Family Court with directions to enter an adjudication of delinquency on the lesser-included offense of second- degree child molestation and for resentencing.', 'Although the dissent suggests that we are “significantly departing from our well-settled law,” our remand in this case follows from a straightforward application of the law of lesser- included offenses. On the way to adjudging the respondent delinquent on the greater offense, the trial justice necessarily adjudged him delinquent on the lesser-included offense. See Douglas v. Jacquez, 626 F.3d 501, 506 (9th Cir. 2010) (“[The defendant] was convicted of the greater offense [of arson of an inhabited structure]. On the way to finding him guilty of arson of an inhabited structure, the [factfinder] had necessarily found adequate proof that [the defendant] committed [the lesser-included offense,] arson of a structure. * * * In this circumstance, the prosecution necessarily already proved the elements of a lesser-included offense.”). Therefore, that the respondent has not conceded culpability and the evidence is not uncontroverted on appeal is entirely beside the point. As a matter of law, the respondent has been adjudged delinquent on the lesser-included offense because the trial justice’s adjudication of delinquency on the greater offense necessarily included an adjudication of delinquency on the lesser-included offense. There is no way to avoid this conclusion. 13', 'The dissent points out that §§ 12-17-14 and 11-37-9 refer only to the trial court’s authority to find a defendant guilty on a lesser-included offense. This is true, because criminal cases arise in the trial court, but it is beside the point in this case. We cite these statutes merely to establish that respondent was, as a matter of law, on notice of the lesser-included offense. Our authority to remand for entry of judgment of conviction or adjudication on a lesser-included offense does not depend on an express grant of such power by the General Assembly. To the contrary, as we explained in State v. Eiseman, 461 A.2d 369 (R.I. 1983), “[s]tate and federal appellate courts have long exercised the power to reverse a conviction while at the same time ordering the entry of judgment on a lesser-included offense.” Id. at 384 (quoting Dickenson v. Israel, 482 F. Supp. 1223, 1225 (E.D. Wis. 1980)).', '- 17 -', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons articulated above, we conclude that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the Family Court’s adjudications of delinquency on the two charges of first-degree child molestation.', 'Accordingly, we remand this case to Family Court with directions to enter adjudications of delinquency on the lesser-included offense of second-degree child molestation and for resentencing.', 'Justice Flaherty with whom Justice Robinson joins, concurring in part and dissenting in part. We concur with the majority’s well-reasoned and articulate conclusion that there was insufficient evidence at trial of penetration to sustain a finding of delinquency by reason of first-degree child molestation sexual assault. However, we depart from the majority when it concludes that this case should be remanded to the Family Court for entry of judgment of adjudication of delinquency by reason of second-degree child molestation sexual assault (second-degree child molestation), a lesser-included offense.', 'It is our opinion that this Court’s ruling is grossly unfair to this respondent because, in the Family Court, this case was tried solely as a case of first-degree child molestation sexual assault. There was no argument by either party that the trial justice should make a finding of second- degree child molestation if she found insufficient evidence of first-degree child molestation. Although the trial justice did mention, almost as an aside, that the element of sexual gratification was present, that was neither necessary for her finding of first-degree child molestation nor was it an essential part of her decision. When the case was appealed to this Court, neither party briefed nor argued that the respondent could be adjudicated as delinquent because he committed an act of second-degree child molestation. Indeed, on appeal, the state’s sole argument was that', '- 18 - the evidence was sufficient to prove penile penetration to support an adjudication of delinquency on first-degree child molestation. As a result, the unsuspecting respondent has been waylaid by the sua sponte decision of this Court.', 'We agree with the majority that second-degree child molestation is a lesser-included offense of first-degree child molestation. See State v. Silvia, 798 A.2d 419, 424-25 (R.I. 2002); State v. Malouin, 433 A.2d 176, 178 (R.I. 1981). However, it is our opinion that that does not provide an adequate basis for allowing this respondent to be subjected to further proceedings. In each case decided by this Court involving the interplay between greater and lesser-included offenses, the controversy has been initiated in the trial court, either because a trial justice refused to charge or decide on a lesser-included offense or because, over the defendant’s objection, the trial justice actually did so. See Silvia, 798 A.2d at 424 (citing G.L. 1956 § 11-37-9 on joinder of offenses for the trial court’s authority to enter judgment on lesser-included offenses). We are aware of no case in which this Court, on its own initiative and without argument of the parties or a decision in a trial court, remanded for entry of judgment on a lesser-included offense after vacating a conviction based on insufficient evidence.', 'The majority cites two statutes, G.L. 1956 § 12-17-14 and § 11-37-9, to support its reasoning that respondent was on notice of all lesser-included offenses. Section 12-17-14 says,', '“[w]henever any person is tried upon an indictment, information,', 'or complaint and the court or jury, as the case may be, shall not be', 'satisfied that he or she is guilty of the whole offense, * * * the', 'court or jury may find him or her guilty of the lower offense or', 'guilty of an attempt to commit the offense, as the case may be, and', 'the court shall proceed to sentence the person for the offense', '* * *.” In adopting this language, the General Assembly was clearly referring to the trial court, not this Court. Similarly, § 11-37-9 provides that, “If upon trial the jury shall acquit the person of any of', '- 19 - the charges of sexual assault and shall find him or her guilty of any of the other offenses, judgment and sentence may be entered against him or her accordingly.” The wording of this statute, likewise, can lead to no rational conclusion other than that the General Assembly was referring to the trial court and only the trial court. Although we do not disagree with the majority that respondent was on notice when he went to trial that he could be found delinquent on any lesser-included offense, that fact does nothing to support the majority’s disposition in this matter.', 'Rather, the majority claims to derive authority for directing entry of delinquency on the lesser-included offense from this Court’s decision in State v. Eiseman, 461 A.2d 369, 384 (R.I. 1983), abrogated in part on other grounds by Horton v. California, 496 U.S. 128 (1990). In Eiseman, the defendant was charged with possession with intent to deliver cocaine. Id. at 372. After a justice of the Superior Court denied his motion in limine to suppress the cocaine, the defendant conceded during a bench trial that the quantity of cocaine found in his possession was wholly consistent with personal use, but argued that it was not sufficient to support a conviction for possession with intent to deliver. Id. Nonetheless, the trial justice found the defendant guilty of the greater offense. Id.', 'On appeal, this Court agreed with the defendant. Eiseman, 461 A.2d at 383. Having arrived at that conclusion, the Court then found itself in a quandary about how to resolve the case. Id. at 383-84. We observed that, “in a jury trial of a charge of possession with intent to deliver, the trial justice would instruct the jury on the elements of the lesser offense,” and that it could find him guilty of that lesser charge. Id. at 384. This Court further noted that “[c]learly, this alternative was available to the trial justice in this case if he had determined, as he should have, that the state had failed to prove intent to deliver * * *.”', 'Id.', 'This Court then acknowledged that “[s]tate and federal appellate courts have long exercised the power to reverse', '- 20 - a conviction while at the same time ordering the entry of judgment on a lesser-included offense.” Id. (quoting Dickenson v. Israel, 482 F.Supp. 1223, 1225 (E.D. Wis. 1980)). But, noting that our Court had “never availed itself of the opportunity to adopt this practice,” it nonetheless determined that it would employ it in Eiseman because the evidence of guilt was overwhelming, because the defendant had conceded at trial and on appeal that the state had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he indeed possessed cocaine, and that, as a result, there would be no prejudice to the defendant if this Court simply ordered the Superior Court to enter judgment on the lesser-included offense. Id. Therefore, the Court concluded “that a reduction of [the] defendant’s conviction to the lesser-included offense * * * would serve the interests of justice and would not prejudice [the] defendant since the sufficiency of evidence on this charge is uncontroverted on appeal.” Id.', 'The rationale employed in Eiseman is singular in our jurisprudential history and it simply is not appropriate for the case before us at present.', 'Here, respondent has not conceded culpability, the evidence is not uncontroverted on appeal, and respondent would be manifestly prejudiced on remand. The majority here is significantly departing from our well-settled law and embracing what it maintains is the rationale of Eiseman in ordering the entry of judgment on a lesser-included offense. It has done this despite the fact that the Eiseman Court specifically explained that the Court had never before adopted such a practice. We have been unable to find any other case in which we employed that approach after doing so in Eiseman. Furthermore, it is significant that, in each of the cases cited in Eiseman as examples of appellate courts exercising the power to modify a judgment, none of those courts wielded that power sua sponte, as the majority does here. See United States v. Swiderski, 548 F.2d 445, 452 (2nd Cir. 1977) (case had been tried twice and government argued that the appellate court should enter judgment on lesser-', '- 21 - included offense); Austin v. United States, 382 F.2d 129, 140, 142-43 (D.C. Cir. 1967) (federal statute conferred power to modify judgments only where no prejudice results to the defendant; court found that the defendant had a full and fair adjudication on all elements of the lesser- included offense and based his defense on insanity, which the jury clearly rejected); State v. Grant, 411 A.2d 917, 920 n.6 (Conn. 1979) (noting that the jury was instructed on both burglary in the first degree and the lesser-included offense of burglary in the third degree); Miller v. State, 426 A.2d 842, 844 (Del. 1981) (the defendant specifically requested instruction on lesser- included offense of second-degree arson and was denied by the trial judge); State v. Smith, 603 P.2d 638, 642 (Kan. Ct. App. 1979) (lesser-included offense of possession is not contested); People v. Monaco, 197 N.E.2d 532, 534 (N.Y. 1964) (the defendant argued on appeal that the most the facts could support was the lesser-included offense of manslaughter in the first degree).', 'Thus, by remanding for entry of judgment, the majority’s decision greatly expands the holding enunciated by this Court in Eiseman. As a result, it is our firm opinion that a remand to the trial court for entry of judgment on second-degree child molestation unfairly prejudices the respondent.', 'For these reasons, we respectfully dissent from the opinion of the majority.

These appeals arise from a medical malpractice lawsuit brought by the plaintiff, Antonio Ribeiro, against his optometrist, Dr. Martin Newman, and Dr. Newman’s employer, the Rhode Island Eye Institute, LLC. At trial, Ribeiro argued that Dr. Newman had breached the duty of care to him because he failed to diagnose a detached retina, and that that negligence had resulted in a permanent vision loss in Ribeiro’s right eye. Ribeiro also sought to hold the Eye Institute liable vicariously for Dr. Newman’s negligence. At the close of Ribeiro’s case, the defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law, pursuant to Rule 50 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, arguing that Ribeiro had failed to meet his burden of proving that there had been a deviation from the standard of care, proximate causation, and damages. The trial justice took the motions under advisement and the defendants proceeded with their case.', 'After hearing all the evidence, the jury returned a verdict in favor of defendants, finding that, although Dr. Newman had violated the standard of care in treating Ribeiro, that violation', '-1- was not the cause of Ribeiro’s vision loss. All parties then filed posttrial motions. Ribeiro moved for a new trial, arguing that the trial justice erred by restricting the trial testimony of his causation expert. The defendants renewed their motions for judgment as a matter of law and, in the alternative, moved for a new trial on the issue of standard of care. The trial justice denied all posttrial motions. The parties, having timely appealed and cross-appealed, are now before this Court, arguing that the trial justice erred in denying their respective motions. We conclude that the trial justice impermissibly limited the testimony of Ribeiro’s causation expert. Consequently, we vacate the judgment and remand for a new trial on all issues.', '1', 'Facts and Travel', 'A. The Appointments', 'The August 24, 2004 Appointment', 'On August 24, 2004, Antonio Ribeiro, a forty-year-old tradesman, came to see Dr. Newman at the Eye Institute because he had been experiencing blurred vision in his right eye for the previous three to four weeks. Doctor Newman testified that he examined Ribeiro’s eye, and, during the course of that exam, he employed five separate diagnostic tests to determine the cause of Ribeiro’s blurred vision.', 'First, Dr. Newman said, he set out to determine Ribeiro’s visual acuity and to determine to what extent Ribeiro could see out of his right eye. Doctor Newman found that Ribeiro’s corrected vision in his right eye was 20/60, whereas previously it had been 20/20. 1 Second, Dr. Newman performed an Amsler Grid Test, which revealed that, although Ribeiro had normal peripheral vision in his right eye, his direct vision—the point at which the eye focuses—was 1', 'This meant that Ribeiro could read with his right eye, at a distance of twenty feet, what a person with normal vision could see at sixty feet.', '-2- blurry. 2 Third, Dr. Newman said that he conducted a Confrontation Visual Field Test; this test also indicated that Ribeiro had normal peripheral vision. Doctor Newman then performed a physical examination on Ribeiro’s right eye. Using a slit lamp, Dr. Newman determined that the front of the eye appeared normal. Finally, Dr. Newman used an ophthalmoscope to examine the back of Ribeiro’s eye—including the retina, the macula, and the fovea—by performing what is known as a fundoscopy. 3 Doctor Newman testified that at that point, he noticed that something was amiss: a “circumscribed elevation” in the macula of Ribeiro’s right eye that appeared to be filled with fluid.', 'Based upon Ribeiro’s age and complaints, Dr. Newman determined that Ribeiro was suffering from central serous retinopathy, commonly referred to as CSR. Doctor Newman explained that CSR occurs when fluid accumulates behind the retina, and that it will normally appear as a “blister” on the back of the eye. He said that central serous retinopathy is not normally a serious condition and that it often resolves on its own when the fluid is reabsorbed into the eye. Doctor Newman testified that he instructed Ribeiro to return for a follow-up appointment in six to eight weeks because that is normally how long it takes for CSR to resolve. However, he also cautioned Ribeiro that if his condition worsened, or if it did not improve in the course of the six to eight weeks, that Ribeiro should contact him.', 'Finally, Dr. Newman referred the patient for an Optical Coherence Tomography scan, or OCT. Doctor Newman testified that he ordered the scan to confirm his diagnosis and to garner 2', 'According to Dr. Newman, an Amsler Grid Test requires the patient to focus on a point in the grid and describe any distortions in the grid pattern surrounding that point. 3', 'In medical parlance, “fundus” refers to the back or base. The back of the eye is known as the retina, and the macula is the center of the retina. The eye’s cornea and lens project images onto the retina. The macula’s center, the fovea, is responsible for direct vision. When the macula is damaged, the eye loses its ability to focus, resulting in blurred vision and reduced visual acuity.', '-3- additional information about Ribeiro’s eye. At the time of Ribeiro’s visit, OCT was a relatively new technology that Dr. Newman had been using for several months. A fundoscopy provides a two-dimensional view of the back of the eye, but OCT gives optometrists a better view of the back of the eye by taking a series of photographs that result in a more detailed, three-dimensional scan. Doctor Newman testified that he interpreted the six images from the OCT scan the following day, August 25, 2004. He said that, based on the images from the test, he was able to confirm that Ribeiro was, in fact, suffering from CSR. Doctor Newman said that he did not report the results of the OCT to Ribeiro because they merely reinforced his earlier diagnosis of CSR.', 'The October 25, 2004 Appointment', 'Ribeiro traveled to Portugal for a family vacation from mid-September into early October. While he was away, his vision worsened. Ribeiro testified that towards the end of the trip, he was experiencing increasingly blurred vision. Ribeiro returned to see Dr. Newman on October 25, 2004. This time, when Dr. Newman examined Ribeiro, he noticed that the vision in Ribeiro’s right eye had significantly worsened from 20/60 in August to 20/400 in October. Doctor Newman conducted another fundoscopy and slit lamp exam, and he ordered another set of OCT scans. Doctor Newman also dilated Ribeiro’s eye and examined it. Doctor Newman testified that, despite the patient’s deteriorating vision, his eye appeared “very similar” in October as it had appeared to be in August. He said that he did not “find anything additional going on in the retina that [he] had seen back in August.” Doctor Newman again diagnosed Ribeiro with CSR. However, because Ribeiro’s symptoms had not resolved on their own, Dr. Newman also referred Ribeiro to a retinal specialist, Dr. Timothy You, an ophthalmologist at the Eye Institute.', '-4-', 'The November 1, 2004 Appointment', 'Ribeiro met with Dr. You on November 1, 2004. After examining Ribeiro, Dr. You diagnosed Ribeiro not with CSR, but with a retinal detachment. 4', 'The record reveals that although CSR and retinal detachments each involve fluid buildup in the back of the eye, a retinal detachment, unlike CSR, is a serious condition that has the potential to cause permanent vision loss. When the retina is detached, a tear develops in the back of the eye. That tear fills with fluid, eventually causing the retina to pull away from the eye. Over time, the retina loses its blood supply and ceases to function. Because of the significant risk of vision loss from a retinal detachment, Dr. You recommended surgery. Ribeiro agreed, and three days later he underwent surgery in hopes of repairing the tear and restoring blood flow to his eye. Despite Dr. You’s efforts, however, surgery was unable to improve Ribeiro’s vision. The result has been that since November 2004, Ribeiro’s corrected vision is 20/400, he has lost his central vision, and his vision remains blurry.', 'B. The Evidentiary Rulings', 'Before and during trial, defendants made several motions that sought to limit the scope of the issues to be determined by the jury and to limit which witnesses would be allowed to testify about those issues. The plaintiff disclosed that he would be calling two expert witnesses. First, he would produce an optometrist, David Greenstein, O.D., who would testify that Dr. Newman deviated from the standard of care when he failed to rule out a detached retina on August 24, 2004. Second, he would call Susan Bressler, M.D., an ophthalmologist, who would testify to the causes and consequences of the fluid buildup in Ribeiro’s right eye in August 2004. Because 4', 'A retinal detachment occurs when a hole, break, or tear causes the retina to pull away from the surrounding tissue of the eye. Stedman’s Medical Dictionary 523 (28th ed. 2006).', '-5- Ribeiro alleged that Dr. Newman was negligent only on August 24, 2004, much of the discussion between the parties and the trial justice focused on the extent, if any, to which Dr. Bressler would be allowed to testify about the results of the October 2004 OCT scans and the conclusions she drew from Dr. You’s notes.', 'The November 1, 2011 Motion', 'At first, defendants sought to preclude Dr. Bressler from testifying about her interpretation of either of the OCT scans. At a hearing on their motion in limine, defendants conveyed their concern that the jury might well conclude that Dr. Bressler, an ophthalmologist, was opining that Dr. Newman violated the standard of care of an optometrist. 5', 'Ribeiro countered that Dr. Bressler would testify about the OCT results only to the extent that they helped her form her opinion that the scans showed that Ribeiro’s condition worsened in the interim between the two tests and that it could no longer be repaired. As he considered the parties’ arguments, the trial justice asked for and received an offer of proof from plaintiff as to what Dr. Bressler would say about her interpretations of the OCT scans. The plaintiff said that:', '“Dr. Bressler will testify about causation, the rest of the', 'case, the causation and damage[s] piece.', 'She is an', 'ophthalmologist.

Ophthalmologists and optometrists differ in their levels of training and in what they can diagnose and treat. An ophthalmologist can diagnose and treat all forms of eye disease and can perform eye surgery. Stedman’s Medical Dictionary at 1374. On the other hand, an optometrist’s primary role is to provide vision care by testing and correcting vision using corrective lenses as well as detecting certain eye abnormalities. See id. at 1376.', '-6-', 'August 24th, 2004 OCT, the information contained in the October', 'OCT results show that at that point the macula is completely off, is', 'off, and it cannot be – vision at that point, even with surgery,', 'cannot be restored. You have to reattach the macula but it will not', 'restore vision because there’s been too much passage of time and', 'that has allowed the macula to become completely detached.', 'That’s her testimony.” After hearing that explanation, the trial justice determined that it was unnecessary to rule on defendants’ motion at that time. Rather, he thought it best to allow the parties to limit the scope of Dr. Bressler’s testimony through the usual means: by plaintiff examining the witness and defendants objecting to any questions that they thought would elicit standard-of-care testimony from the causation witness.', 'The November 10, 2011 Motion', 'Despite the seemingly straightforward disposition of the November 1 pretrial motion, the trial justice took up additional motions from defendants about the scope of Dr. Bressler’s testimony after trial began. Again raising concerns about jury confusion, defendants sought to confine Dr. Bressler’s testimony about the August and October OCTs to hypothetical questions so that the jury would not confuse her opinion as to causation with a determination of whether Dr. Newman breached the standard of care when he examined plaintiff. The plaintiff countered that the issue had already been decided on November 1, and that the court had concluded that it was unnecessary to rule on defendants’ motion. The plaintiff again stressed that Dr. Bressler’s interpretations of the August and October OCT results was necessary to meet his burden on causation. Specifically, plaintiff argued that the jury needed to hear Dr. Bressler’s interpretations of both results in order to weigh her credibility and evaluate the basis for her opinion that Ribeiro’s eyesight could have been repaired in August, but not in October.', '-7-', 'The defendants then asked that the trial justice instruct the jury, in advance of Dr. Bressler’s testimony, that her opinion could not be used to evaluate whether or not Dr. Newman deviated from the standard of care. The plaintiff responded that the issue had already been decided during the November 1 hearing and, further, that defendants’ concerns about juror confusion if Dr. Bressler was allowed to testify about her interpretations of the October OCT were misplaced, because the jury would not be asked to determine if Dr. Newman breached the standard of care in October. Eventually, the trial justice found that because there was', '“the potential risk of confusion as it relates to Dr. Bressler’s', 'testimony about the October OCT scan. * * * The [c]ourt will', 'permit the plaintiff to conduct – question Dr. Bressler without', 'hypotheticals concerning the August OCT. However, the [c]ourt', 'will order that the questioning of Dr. Bressler concerning the', 'October OCT be presented to her by use of a hypothetical', 'question.” The plaintiff articulated that this limitation would prejudice his case because it would prevent Dr. Bressler from testifying about how the condition in Ribeiro’s eye progressed from the August 2004 office visit through the November 2004 corrective surgery.', 'The defendants raised two more concerns. First, they urged that plaintiff was attempting to use Dr. Bressler’s causation testimony to “fix” the testimony of his standard of care expert, Dr. Greenstein. Specifically, they argued that plaintiff was trying to correct Dr. Greenstein’s testimony in which he said that, to a reasonable degree of medical probability, the August OCT showed a detached retina, but the October OCT showed CSR. The parties agreed that this was a medical impossibility.', 'Second, they objected on relevance grounds to Dr. Bressler testifying about the October OCT. They argued that any opinion Dr. Bressler had about the condition of Ribeiro’s eye in October was irrelevant to her causation opinion because there was no allegation', '-8- that Dr. Newman was negligent in October. Thus, defendants argued, Dr. Bressler’s testimony should be limited strictly to her interpretation of the August OCT.', 'After asking plaintiff whether it was necessary for him to ask Dr. Bressler about her interpretation of the October OCT and receiving an affirmative response, the trial justice amended his earlier ruling:', '“The [c]ourt will modify or change its earlier ruling. The [c]ourt', 'will first, before Dr. Bressler testifies, inform the jury of the', 'limited purpose for which she is being offered, that being', 'causation. The [c]ourt will certainly invite counsel to suggest a', 'proper instruction that they feel would be appropriate on that', 'statement. The [c]ourt will permit the plaintiffs to question Dr.', 'Bressler concerning both the August and October OCT results.” Undeterred, defendants then challenged the extent to which the court would allow Dr. Bressler to testify about the “chronicity” or duration of Ribeiro’s detached retina, contending that plaintiff had failed to disclose Dr. Bressler’s opinion about the chronicity of Ribeiro’s retinal detachment, either in Dr. Bressler’s deposition or in their expert disclosure. Specifically, the parties and the court discussed whether chronicity was described in Dr. You’s medical records. Complicating matters even further was the fact that when plaintiff posed hypothetical questions about Dr. You’s medical records to Dr. Greenstein during his testimony, the trial justice had instructed the jury that as a matter of law, Dr. You did not conclude that Ribeiro suffered from a chronic retinal detachment. 6', 'Although plaintiff conceded that the word “chronicity” did not appear either in Dr. You’s notes or in his deposition, counsel argued that the description of Ribeiro’s eye injury and its prolonged nature was detailed at length in those materials and that Dr. Bressler explicitly 6', 'At defendants’ request, the trial justice provided the following cautionary instruction: “I am instructing you as a matter of law, and this is something that you will not be able to disagree with, that there is no fact in this matter that Dr. You diagnosed Mr. Ribeiro as having a chronic detached retina. You cannot — you will not be able to make that conclusion. That is a nonexistent issue or fact for the jury.”', '-9- stated during her deposition that she relied not only on the OCT images, but also Dr. You’s subsequent examination to form her own opinion that Ribeiro suffered from a chronic detached retina. The defendants responded by reiterating their argument that, regardless of what Dr. You’s conclusion was, Dr. Bressler’s opinion regarding the October OCT scan was irrelevant because it was not needed to dispute defendants’ position that Ribeiro presented with CSR, and not a detached retina, in August.', 'Finally, the trial justice terminated the merry-go-round of argument and attempted to resolve the dispute surrounding Dr. Bressler’s testimony about the duration of Ribeiro’s injury. The trial justice said that:', '“I respect the parties’ right to ask the [c]ourt by way of a motion in', 'limine to restrict the witness from being asked a question and', 'answer it in a certain way. It is not abundantly clear to this [c]ourt', 'at this moment, and I doubt that it will become clearer in the', 'remaining time today, exactly what question the plaintiff will put', 'to Dr. Bressler concerning the condition of Mr. Ribeiro’s eye based', 'upon her examination of the evidence and the deposition. * * *', '[D]epending on the cross-examination of Dr. Bressler, then * * *', 'the [c]ourt may permit the plaintiffs [sic] on redirect examination', 'to further opine as to the chronicity of Mr. Ribeiro’s eye in her', 'opinion. I hope that’s clear.” With that, the hearing ended.', 'C. Dr. Bressler’s Testimony', 'When Dr. Bressler finally got to the witness stand, she testified that, in her opinion, Ribeiro was suffering from a detached retina at the time of his initial appointment with Dr. Newman in August. Based on her review of the August OCT, the medical records from the Eye Institute, and Dr. You’s medical records from the November surgery, Dr. Bressler opined that it was more likely than not that Ribeiro’s vision would have been restored to 20/20 corrected—that is, with the aid of eyeglasses or contact lenses—if Dr. Newman had immediately referred him to', '- 10 - a retinal specialist. This was important, she said, “[b]ecause every moment one is delaying in an opportunity for that detachment to extend in a superior direction through the remaining central vision and even go beyond that to lift off more of the superior retina, all of which would lead to a much poorer prognosis.”', 'The plaintiff then asked Dr. Bressler to consider the October 25 OCT scans.', 'The defendants immediately objected.', 'At sidebar, during another complicated and confusing argument, the parties and the trial justice attempted to reconstruct exactly what the trial justice’s previous ruling had been with respect to Dr. Bressler’s proposed testimony concerning the October OCT. The defendants insisted that the trial justice’s final ruling was that “unless the defendants got into the October OCT, the witness was not going to be permitted to testify to that October OCT and that the plaintiff, if the defense opened the door, would be permitted to explore the OCT in redirect examination.” The plaintiff disagreed, arguing that the court had ruled that plaintiff would be permitted to ask Dr. Bressler about both the August and October OCTs. This, plaintiff argued, was necessary to reveal the condition of Ribeiro’s eye on both dates, as well as to provide a foundation for Dr. Bressler’s opinion testimony. Adopting defendants’ view of his earlier ruling, the trial justice sustained their objection. However, the trial justice added the caveat that “if the defendants, even in the slightest degree on cross-examination directly or inferentially, get into the duration of Mr. Ribeiro’s retinal detachment, the [c]ourt will consider allowing the plaintiff to redirect this witness based upon her examination of the October OCT.”', 'Following the sidebar, plaintiff asked Dr. Bressler if she had reviewed the evidence in the medical records from Ribeiro’s appointment with Dr. You on November 1, 2004.', 'The defendants immediately objected again on the grounds that if plaintiff was precluded from asking Dr. Bressler about the October OCT, then she could not be asked about Dr. You’s records either.', '- 11 - When asked by the trial justice why he should be allowed to ask Dr. Bressler about Dr. You’s medical notes, plaintiff responded that “[t]his goes exactly to her opinion, * * * that by the time [Ribeiro] went back in October, nothing could have been done for him * * *. [The plaintiff needs] to provide her some [basis] for her to testify about what was the status by the time [Ribeiro] went back in November.” The trial justice ruled that plaintiff was precluded from inquiring of Dr. Bressler about Dr. You’s records unless defendants first broached the subject on cross-examination.', 'Barred from asking Dr. Bressler about the worsening condition of Ribeiro’s eye from August through November, plaintiff moved on to the current state of his vision. Doctor Bressler did testify that Ribeiro lost all his central vision and that his vision was 20/200 to 20/400 with the best possible correction in his right eye. She also testified that Ribeiro’s loss was permanent, due to a loss of blood flow to the optic nerve in his right eye, causing it to atrophy.', 'During cross-examination, neither counsel for Dr. Newman nor counsel for the Eye Institute asked Dr. Bressler about the October OCT or Dr. You’s treatment of Ribeiro. As a result, Dr. Bressler concluded her testimony without offering an opinion about what the October OCT or Dr. You’s notes revealed about the cause of Ribeiro’s injury or any available treatment for it. The following day, plaintiff rested and defendants made their Rule 50 motions. The trial justice reserved ruling on their motions. The defendants proceeded with their case, calling only Dr. Newman as a witness.', 'On direct examination, defendants, over plaintiff’s objections, questioned Dr. Newman about Ribeiro’s eye condition during the period from August through October 2004.', 'Doctor Newman testified that, based on his treatment records and his interpretation of the October OCT, Ribeiro suffered from CSR on October 25, 2004, and not from a detached retina. At the conclusion of trial, the jury returned a verdict that Dr. Newman', '- 12 - had indeed deviated from the standard of care, but that his deviation was not the proximate cause of Ribeiro’s injury.', 'D. Posttrial Motions and Decision', 'After the verdict, all parties filed posttrial motions. The plaintiff moved for a new trial, arguing that the trial justice erred when he restricted Dr. Bressler’s testimony about the October OCT because that testimony was necessary to demonstrate that plaintiff’s eye condition was no longer correctable after Dr. Newman failed to diagnose a retinal detachment in August. The defendants renewed their motions for judgment as a matter of law and, in the alternative, they filed a motion for a new trial on the issue of standard of care. The trial justice denied all posttrial motions. In denying plaintiff’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice found that,', '“[b]ecause the alleged negligence was limited to August 24, 2004,', 'evidence of causation was appropriately similarly limited to that', 'date. * * * The risk that the jury would conclude that Dr. Bressler,', 'an ophthalmologist, was opining that Dr. Newman had breached the', 'standard of care for an optometrist outweighed the probative value', 'of her testimony about the diagnosis of Mr. Ribeiro’s condition', 'after the time frame in which she had testified surgery was', 'necessary to avoid the eventual outcome.” Moreover, the trial justice found that, to the extent that there was any error in excluding this portion of Dr. Bressler’s testimony, such error was harmless because it was limited “only to the extent that she intended to talk about Mr. Ribeiro’s condition in October, two months after anything could have been done to prevent his permanent vision loss.” Likewise, the trial justice denied defendants’ motion for judgment as a matter of law and motion for a new trial.', '2', 'Issues on Appeal', 'The parties argue that the trial justice erred in denying their respective motions.

Indeed, the trial justice serves an important “gatekeeping function” when it comes to admitting expert testimony. See Owens v. Silvia, 838 A.2d 881, 891 (R.I. 2003).

Sharples, 860 A.2d 674, 678 (R.I. 2004).

Our review of the record leads us to conclude that there was no basis on which to characterize Dr. Bressler’s testimony as irrelevant or enormously prejudicial.', 'In his posttrial decision denying plaintiff’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice determined that, because plaintiff’s theory of the case was that Dr. Newman violated the standard of care on August 24, 2004, the only relevant causation testimony from Dr. Bressler was what would have happened to Ribeiro’s eye had Dr. Newman complied with the standard of care on that date. For that reason, the trial justice allowed Dr. Bressler to testify that, in her professional opinion, had Dr. Newman complied with the standard of care when he arrived at his differential diagnosis on August 24, 2004, and had Dr. Newman referred Ribeiro to a retinal specialist on that date, the retinal specialist could have with “reasonable probability” restored vision to Ribeiro’s eye.', 'However, it is our opinion that plaintiff not only needed to prove that Dr. Newman deviated from the standard of care in August 2004, but also that his failure to do so set in motion the “natural, unbroken and continuous sequence” that eventually resulted in the patient’s grossly', '- 16 - diminished vision. DiPetrillo, 729 A.2d at 692. That is, plaintiff needed to show not only a deviation from the standard of care, but he also needed to prove what actually did happen as a result of that deviation. The key to proving causation is establishing the link between a deviation from the standard of care and the harm that results. It is our opinion that this would necessarily require that Dr. Bressler testify about the consequences of Ribeiro’s eye going unrepaired from August 2004 until the unsuccessful effort at surgical repair in November 2004. In that regard, the expert’s comparison between the August OCT and October OCT would have been of assistance to the jury because it would help establish that it was “more probable”—within the meaning of Rule 401—that Dr. Newman’s failure to diagnose Ribeiro with a detached retina in August, and the subsequent passage of time that followed, caused Ribeiro’s condition to become irreparable.', 'Nor do we agree with the trial justice that the potential to confuse the issues and confuse the jury outweighed the probative value of Dr. Bressler’s testimony about the October OCT. Indeed, any concerns that defendants had about possible confusion between Dr. Bressler’s testimony concerning causation and Dr. Newman’s alleged deviation from the standard of care about which Dr. Greenstein testified should have been allayed by the trial justice’s crisp and succinct cautionary instruction.

Not only was this thorough instruction more than adequate, but it is also “well settled that ‘the members of the jury are presumed to follow the trial justice’s instructions.’” Oden v. Schwartz, 71 A.3d 438, 455 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Clark, 754 A.2d 73, 80 (R.I. 2000)). This, combined with the fact that Dr. Bressler’s testimony about the October OCT was not, in our opinion, “enormously prejudicial,” convinces us that the trial justice strayed beyond the bounds of his discretion when he excluded that portion of her testimony under Rule 403. See Wells, 635 A.2d at 1193.', 'We also disagree with the trial justice’s conclusion that any error that occurred in precluding Dr. Bressler from testifying about the October OCT and Dr. You’s notes was harmless. Doctor Bressler’s opinion regarding the October OCT was important both as to her credibility and as a basis for her opinion. Doctor Bressler testified that, had Ribeiro undergone surgery immediately after his first examination in August 2004, his vision would have been restored to an optimal degree, but that deferred treatment allowed the retina to become further', '- 18 - detached and therefore eliminated any prospect for a beneficial result. It is clear from the record that Dr. Bressler reached this conclusion by comparing the August OCT against the October OCT and by reviewing Dr. You’s notes. However, in the absence of hearing how she arrived at her conclusion, the jury was not allowed to hear evidence that would have assisted it in evaluating the impact of Dr. Bressler’s testimony. We agree with plaintiff that the jury needed to hear Dr. Bressler’s interpretation of both test results so it could assess the basis for her opinion that Ribeiro’s eyesight would have more likely been repaired in August, but not in October. For these reasons, we are of the opinion that the trial justice’s exclusion of Dr. Bressler’s testimony was an unsustainable exercise of his discretion and plaintiff is entitled to a new trial on all issues.', '5', 'The Defendants’ Motion for Judgment As a Matter of Law', 'Under Rule 50, judgment as a matter of law is appropriate if, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff, the trial justice determines that he did not present legally sufficient evidence to allow the jury to arrive at a verdict in his favor. See McGarry v. Pielech, 47 A.3d 271, 280 (R.I. 2012) (citing Gianquitti v. Atwood Medical Associates, Ltd., 973 A.2d 580, 590 (R.I. 2009)). For their part, defendants argue that the trial justice erred in two ways when he denied their Rule 50 motion. First, they argue that Dr. Greenstein failed to testify that Dr. Newman deviated from the standard of care in interpreting the August OCT results. Second, they argue that the trial justice erred by failing to properly apply the applicable law to the facts of the case.', 'Whatever the merits of these arguments may be, we will not address them. In Skaling v. Aetna Insurance Co,, 742 A.2d 282, 287 (R.I. 1999), we reaffirmed “our established rule that if one party makes a motion for judgment as a matter of law at the close of the opponent’s case and', '- 19 - then presents evidence on his * * * own behalf, the motion must be renewed at the close of all [the] evidence.” Failure to do so means “the earlier motion is deemed waived and may not be reviewed.” Id. The record is clear that neither defendant renewed the Rule 50 motion at the close of all the evidence; rather, each waited until after the jury returned its verdict to renew the motion for judgment as a matter of law. Because that is insufficient under our well-settled jurisprudence, we will not review its denial on appeal.', '6', 'The Defendants’ Motion for a New Trial', 'Because we have sustained the plaintiff’s appeal and held that he is entitled to a new trial on all issues, we need not, and shall not, rule on the defendants’ motion for a new trial on the issue of deviation from the standard of care.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth above, we vacate the decision of the Superior Court.

Mr. Conley contends that the trial justice erred in allowing the Bank to redeem even though it had been “negligent” with respect to filing its “Response to Petition to Foreclose Tax Lien,” its Motion to File a Late Answer, and its entry of appearance; he avers that the just-referenced documents were filed improperly, in that the Bank did so only after the return date specified in the “Petition to Foreclose Tax Lien,” and he further contends that the Bank has “failed to explain its tardiness.” This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be', '-1- summarily decided.

These consolidated cases came before the Supreme Court after the Superior Court entered an order of dismissal as a sanction for the mid-trial production of certain documents and denied the plaintiff, Bryan Joachim’s (plaintiff or Joachim), motion to vacate such order. On appeal, Joachim, who appeared pro se for oral argument, 1 sets forth a myriad of arguments to support his contentions that the hearing justice erred in (1) dismissing the case pursuant to Rule 37(b)(2) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure; and (2) denying his motion to vacate the order of dismissal pursuant to Rule 60(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.', 'For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On March 4, 2009, Joachim filed a complaint in Providence County Superior Court against defendants, Straight Line Productions, LLC, Joseph Strong, and Ann Strong 1', 'Joachim was represented by counsel in the Superior Court; however, he pursues this appeal pro se.', '-1- (collectively, defendants). In his second amended complaint, Joachim set forth allegations of, inter alia, breach of fiduciary duty resulting from oppressive conduct, breach of fiduciary duty resulting from self-dealing, fraud in the inducement, and negligent misrepresentation.', 'The essence of Joachim’s complaint is that, after he paid $ 260,000 for a membership interest in Straight Line Productions, Joseph and Ann Strong shut him out by purchasing the interests of two other members to form a collective ownership interest of 80 percent. Thereafter, according to Joachim, the Strongs used their position to, among other things, engage in oppressive conduct by converting Straight Line’s assets for their own personal gain and to engage in self-dealing by entering into transactions with other corporate entities for which the duo also serve as fiduciaries.', 'During discovery, defendants served three requests for production of documents upon plaintiff. It is undisputed that, throughout the course of discovery in this matter, the Superior Court did not enter any order compelling plaintiff to provide or permit discovery.', 'On April 25, 2012, a jury was impaneled and a trial commenced. Throughout the first several days of trial, various witnesses were called, including a forensic accountant, the accountant for Straight Line, and Joseph and Ann Strong. On Monday, April 30, 2012, four days into trial, plaintiff’s counsel called Joachim as a witness. During cross-examination, defense counsel inquired into a letter (marked as exhibit No. 29) that Joachim had written to Joseph Strong. When he asked Joachim about the March 19, 2008, date on the letter, Joachim indicated that this letter had apparently been auto-dated by his computer. He further elaborated that he was “going through [his] files just this past weekend, [and he] came across one with a date September, I believe, 17th.”', 'The cross-examination then continued without scrutiny into anything else that Joachim may have stumbled upon over the weekend.', '-2-', 'Joachim’s cross-examination continued into the fifth day of trial, which was followed by redirect examination. During this questioning, plaintiff’s counsel showed Joachim an exhibit marked for identification as exhibit No. 41. When plaintiff’s counsel asked Joachim if he recognized exhibit No. 41, defense counsel objected. The trial justice requested both parties to approach, and the following exchange took place at side bar:', '“The Court:', 'What is it?', '“[Plaintiff’s Counsel]: These are notes of Mr. Joachim apparently talking in at the', 'time that he – he had the conversations.', '“The Court:', 'Were they produced?

But let me see what the request was. I', 'am going to send the jury for the midmorning break.” The trial justice then excused the jury and took a brief recess. When the court reconvened outside of the presence of the jury, defense counsel noted that exhibit No. 41 appeared to be Joachim’s handwritten notes and were not “helter skelter written on a piece of paper and put aside[,]” but, instead, “appear to be part of a journal or diary.” Defense counsel further stated that he “would question what other documents Mr. Joachim has that * * * we were not provided with. This is clearly pertinent stuff.” Based upon the fact that these notes were not disclosed until mid-trial and after his cross-examination of Joachim, defense counsel moved to dismiss all claims in the action pursuant to Rule 37(b).', '-3-', 'The trial justice ordered that plaintiff’s counsel turn over to the defense all documents that had allegedly been recently discovered by Joachim other than such documents believed to be privileged. The court then recessed until that afternoon. When the parties reconvened, plaintiff produced 155 pages of documents that had not been produced to defendants during discovery. The plaintiff’s counsel stated that the documents had been provided to him the day before, at which point he compared the documents to the document requests propounded on behalf of defendants and concluded that “none of these documents fall directly within any of those requests.” However, when further questioned about this position, plaintiff’s counsel indicated that, “[i]n the broad category of – there’s a request for documents to support [c]ount 1, documents to support [c]ount 2.

But that’s far short of perjury.”', '-4- unfortunately have been denied tools which would have enabled them to have had a fair trial” and that “the bell cannot be un-rung by bringing the jury back and having them hear further and additional testimony.” Accordingly, the trial justice dismissed the case with prejudice pursuant to Rule 37(b), but he declined to impose any monetary sanctions or counsel fees. The trial justice entered a written order to that effect on May 25, 2012, and final judgment entered on July 23, 2012.', 'On August 10, 2012, Joachim filed both a motion to vacate the Superior Court’s judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b) and a notice of appeal to this Court. On April 19, 2013, the trial justice delivered a bench decision on Joachim’s motion to vacate. In it, the trial justice noted that “the action [taken] by this [c]ourt was draconian and unprecedented in this jurisdiction.” Nevertheless, he went on to declare:', '“[U]nder the unique circumstances of this case, the [c]ourt believed that any other', 'resolution would have imposed upon defendants an inappropriate burden not of', 'their making which resulted from a claimed last-minute discovery by plaintiff of', 'some 155 pages of material, portions of which, if produced by him in a timely', 'manner, would have substantially assisted defendants in preparation for the trial,', 'both by way of defense as to certain claims and as to their counsel’s ability to', 'cross-examine [Joachim] effectively.” The trial justice then analyzed Joachim’s asserted reasons for vacating the judgment against the various provisions of Rule 60(b). In so doing, the trial justice noted that “the belated document dump essentially at the end of plaintiff’s case in chief made it impossible for the defendants, not having had access to portions of the material, to have a fair trial * * *.” Accordingly, the trial justice denied Joachim’s motion to vacate the earlier judgment.

In addition, Joachim asseverates that the trial justice abused his discretion because (i) he made no finding that Joachim’s conduct was willful, intentional, or in flagrant bad faith; (ii) he made no finding that Joachim’s late production of the documents unfairly prejudiced defendants; (iii) the dismissal of his claim without affording him an opportunity for a hearing on the merits of his case flew in the face of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution; and (iv) a clear and convincing evidence standard should have been applied with respect to the trial justice’s order of dismissal. 5', 'We turn first to Joachim’s assertion that violation of a court order is a prerequisite to a trial justice’s imposition of sanctions under Rule 37(b).', '“Like questions of statutory construction, the interpretation of court rules of procedure is a legal question for the court” and, thus, is reviewed by this Court de novo.

This contention was not advanced before the trial justice and, in accordance with our well-settled raise-or-waive rule, the argument is deemed to be waived. See Peloquin v. Haven Health Center of Greenville, LLC, 61 A.3d 419, 430-31 (R.I. 2013). Further, this Court has never required such a burden of proof under these circumstances, and so the trial justice could not have been expected to apply such a standard sua sponte.', '-7- comply with discovery demands and to sanction a noncompliant party. This assortment of tools provided by Rule 37 includes (i) permitting a party to file a motion for an order compelling discovery and (ii) providing the trial justice with authority to sanction a party for failing to comply with a court order, attend a deposition, serve answers to interrogatories, or respond to a request for inspection.', 'Rule 37(b)(2)(C) provides, in pertinent part, that: “If a party * * * refuses to obey an order to provide or permit discovery, including an order made under subdivision (a) of this rule or Rule 35, the court may make such orders and enter such judgment in regard to the failure or refusal as are just, and among others the following: * * * a final judgment dismissing the action or proceeding or any part thereof * * *.” In reading this language, it becomes inescapable that in order to implicate Rule 37(b)(2), a party must engage in conduct that amounts to a “refus[al] to obey an order to provide or permit discovery.” Here, it is undisputed that there was no order compelling Joachim to produce any of the late-disclosed documents. Thus, without an “order to provide or permit discovery,” Rule 37(b)(2) is inoperative. 6', ""However, our analysis does not stop there: It is well-settled that “this Court can affirm the Superior Court's judgment on grounds other than those relied upon by the trial justice.” Berman v. Sitrin, 991 A.2d 1038, 1043 (R.I. 2010). While Rule 37(b)(2) requires a prior order for dismissal, this is not the only weapon in a trial justice’s arsenal to protect against abuse of the discovery process. Rule 37(d) presents an avenue for the trial justice to impose sanctions 6"", ""The language surrounding the sanction provision also confirms that an order is a prerequisite to the imposition of such sanctions. For example, the provision authorizing the imposition of costs and fees, also within Rule 37(b)(2)(E) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, explicitly states that “the court may require the party failing to obey the order or the attorney advising that party or both to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, caused by the failure * * *.” (Emphasis added.)"", '-8- without the requirement that the party violate a court order. 7', 'Specifically, Rule 37(d)(3) provides, in pertinent part, that:', '“If a party * * * fails * * * to serve a written response to a request for inspection', 'submitted under Rule 34, after proper service of the request, the court on motion', 'may make such orders in regard to the failure as are just, and among others the', 'court may take any action authorized under subparagraph (A), (B) and (C) of', 'subdivision (b)(2) of this rule.” To be deemed to have failed to serve a written response, a party need not fail to respond entirely; instead, “an evasive or incomplete answer or response is to be treated as a failure to answer or respond.”', ""Aguayo v.

Thus, even without having violated a court order, Joachim’s incomplete discovery response placed him within the realm of Rule 37(d); and, therefore, it was within the trial justice’s discretion to impose sanctions.', 'Having determined that the trial justice had sufficient authority upon which to ground the imposition of sanctions, we turn next to evaluate the specific one imposed and whether that sanction was within his discretion. We reiterate that we will find an abuse of discretion only when a motion justice has dismissed an action “in the absence of evidence demonstrating persistent refusal, defiance or bad faith.”', 'Flanagan, 882 A.2d at 573 (quoting Travelers Insurance Co., 785 A.2d at 569).

According to Joachim, the responsive documents at issue were overlooked throughout discovery because they had been misfiled along with his files from another business. Over a weekend during the middle of trial, Joachim discovered the documents and turned them over to his attorney the following Monday morning. But, instead of giving the documents to defendants or at least disclosing their existence to the court at that time, Joachim proceeded through trial on Monday and into Tuesday, the fifth day of trial. It was only after plaintiff’s attorney attempted to use some of the documents 9 during his redirect examination of Joachim (and after defendants’ cross-examination thereof) that the existence of the documents was revealed to defendants and the trial justice. Such conduct presents a brazen defiance of the discovery rules and a disregard for the purpose of such rules, which serve “‘to prevent trial by ambush’ and ‘to enable litigants to prepare for trial free from the elements of surprise and concealment so that judgments can rest upon the merits of the case rather than the skill and maneuvering of counsel.’” Narragansett Electric Co. v. Carbone, 898 A.2d 87, 95 (R.I. 2006) (quoting Neri v. Nationwide Mutual Fire Insurance Co., 719 A.2d 1150, 1152 (R.I. 1998)). In appropriate cases, a trial justice must have the ability to protect the integrity of the judicial system by penalizing those whose conduct may warrant dismissal and deterring others from engaging in similar conduct. See Lett v. Providence Journal Co., 798 A.2d 355, 365 (R.I. 2002); 8', 'In addition, the trial justice found that “[t]he [c]ourt clearly does not believe that the plaintiff seriously undertook the [discovery] responsibilities that were his.” 9', 'Notably, plaintiff’s counsel asked Joachim to identify three pages of documents and, at that point, defense counsel indicated that he had never seen the documents before. It was not until the trial justice ordered that all of the documents be turned over that Joachim produced the full 155-page volume of documents to defendants. We are deeply troubled by plaintiff’s delay in disclosing these documents after receipt and by the piecemeal manner in which the documents were ultimately disclosed.', '- 10 - see also National Hockey League v. Metropolitan Hockey Club, Inc., 427 U.S. 639, 643 (1976) (“[T]he most severe in the spectrum of sanctions provided by statute or rule must be available to the district court in appropriate cases, not merely to penalize those whose conduct may be deemed to warrant such a sanction, but to deter those who might be tempted to such conduct in the absence of such a deterrent.”). Where, as here, the plaintiff flouts the discovery rules and he appears to be less than forthcoming upon discovery of such violation, the ultimate sanction of dismissal with prejudice is warranted. Thus, we conclude that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in selecting dismissal with prejudice as an appropriate sanction.', 'Joachim next contends that the trial justice abused his discretion in ordering the dismissal of his claim because he made no finding that Joachim’s late production unfairly prejudiced defendants. To the extent that an assessment of prejudice may be warranted, a trial justice certainly need not use any magic words or talismanic incantations in performing this task. Here, while the trial justice did not specifically use the word “prejudice” in his analysis, he nevertheless took into account the effect of the discovery violation on defendants’ case. Specifically, the trial justice found that “defendants unfortunately have been denied tools which would have enabled them to have had a fair trial.” In support, he stated that defendants “have been denied a fair trial because information contained in the various documents to which I have referred would have permitted them to properly cross-examin[e] plaintiff with respect to a multitude of issues to which he testified * * *.” In addition, the trial justice considered whether the detrimental position caused by the late disclosure could be mitigated, stating that defendants “tell[] us that the bell cannot be un-rung by bringing the jury back and having them hear further and additional testimony. And with that, * * * the [c]ourt must agree.” Thus, the record belies', '- 11 - Joachim’s assertion that the trial justice did not consider the prejudice to defendants in determining that dismissal of his claim was warranted.', 'Finally, Joachim contends that the trial justice’s dismissal of his claim without affording him an opportunity for a hearing on the merits of his case flew in the face of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. We need not tarry. In assessing whether a party is denied procedural due process, the inquiry to be made is “whether the offending party was given sufficient notice and opportunity to explain its noncompliance or argue for a lesser penalty.” Malloy v. WM Specialty Mortgage LLC, 512 F.3d 23, 26 (1st Cir. 2008). Here, Joachim was given an extensive opportunity to argue against dismissal under Rule 37. Moreover, Joachim was permitted to testify regarding the late production of the documents prior to the trial justice’s decision on the Rule 37 motion. Therefore, Joachim’s argument that he was denied due process is wholly unsubstantiated. 10', 'Having disposed of the assortment of arguments presented by Joachim in his direct appeal, we conclude that the trial justice did not err in dismissing Joachim’s claim with prejudice pursuant to Rule 37.', 'B. Rule 60(b) Motion to Vacate', 'Joachim’s next collection of arguments attacks the trial justice’s denial of his Rule 60(b) motion to vacate. We reiterate that it is contested whether the Superior Court had jurisdiction to entertain this motion, but nevertheless decline to consider that issue because we conclude that, in any event, Joachim’s motion to vacate was meritless. On appeal, Joachim contends that the trial justice abused his discretion in denying (i) Rule 60(b)(2) relief because newly discovered 10', 'In addition, Joachim failed to advance this procedural due process argument before the trial justice and, thus, such failure may have resulted in its being deemed waived. See Peloquin, 61 A.3d at 430-31.', '- 12 - evidence proves that defendants were not prejudiced by Joachim’s late production of certain bank records; (ii) Rule 60(b)(3) relief because defendants made misrepresentations during the hearing on the Rule 37 motion; and (iii) Rule 60(b)(6) relief because the sanction of dismissal with prejudice was excessive and disproportionate. Each of these arguments is unavailing and easily dismissed. We explain briefly.', 'Joachim first contends that certain bank records constituted “newly discovered evidence” warranting relief under Rule 60(b)(2). Rule 60(b)(2) provides that the court may relieve a party from a final judgment based upon “[n]ewly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b)[.]” Here, final judgment entered with respect to the Rule 37 motion on July 23, 2012. Joachim was required to file a new trial motion within ten days of July 23, 2012, and, thus, evidence could be considered “newly discovered” for purposes of Rule 60(b)(2) only if it could not have, with due diligence, been discovered prior to such a date. Yet, Joachim’s own affidavit provides that on May 7, 2012, he visited a Bank of America branch, at which time he obtained copies of two signature cards that he now argues should offer him relief under Rule 60(b)(2). This admission shows that these documents were obtained by Joachim before final judgment entered, and, thus, well before the expiration of the ten-day period for filing a motion for a new trial. Accordingly, Joachim’s argument must fail.', 'Similarly, there is no support for Joachim’s argument that defendants made misrepresentations during the hearing on the Rule 37 motion and that Rule 60(b)(3) should provide relief. Rule 60(b)(3) requires a showing of “[f]raud [or] misrepresentation * * * of an adverse party.”', 'The trial justice disagreed that anything in defendants’ arguments was a misrepresentation and summarily dismissed Joachim’s argument that he had been “bamboozled”', '- 13 - into rendering his decision in defendants’ favor. Such a decision is vested within the trial justice’s sound discretion. See Turacova, 45 A.3d at 514. If more were needed—and we do not think that it is—the alleged “misrepresentations” were presented in argument by defense counsel and can be most accurately categorized as his view of the evidence, rather than misrepresentations of the facts.', 'See Pari v. Pari, 558 A.2d 632, 637 (R.I. 1989) (“The discrepancies [the] defendant insists are misrepresentations are really the different views of the evidence that arise between adverse parties.”). Thus, we find Joachim’s argument based upon Rule 60(b)(3) to be unconvincing.', 'Joachim’s final point of contention is that the dismissal of his claims should have been vacated under Rule 60(b)(6) because such a sanction was excessive and disproportionate. Rule 60(b)(6) provides that the court may relieve a party from a final judgment for “[a]ny other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.” Despite the broad language of the rule, this Court has noted that it is not intended to be a “catchall,” but rather should be applied only where “there has been a showing by appropriate evidence of circumstances that would establish a uniqueness that puts the case outside of the normal and usual circumstances accompanying failures to comply with the rules.” Bailey v. Algonquin Gas Transmission Co., 788 A.2d 478, 486 (R.I. 2002) (quoting Greco v. Safeco Insurance Company of America, 107 R.I. 195, 198, 266 A.2d 50, 52 (1970)).', 'Joachim has not set forth any argument to suggest that the circumstances of this case are anything beyond a run-of-the-mill disagreement with the trial justice’s decision. Indeed, Joachim’s argument with regard to the trial justice’s error in denying his Rule 60(b)(6) motion to vacate mirrors the argument that he presents in his Rule 37 direct appeal. “A motion for relief from judgment cannot be used as a substitute for an appeal.” Gray v. Stillman White Co., 522 A.2d 737, 740 (R.I. 1987). “An appeal from the denial of such a', '- 14 - motion raises for review only the order denying relief and not the underlying judgment.” Id. Therefore, because in his Rule 60(b)(6) motion Joachim merely reasserted the arguments made with respect to the underlying judgment, his appeal with respect to his Rule 60(b)(6) claim is denied.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

The confidential informant identified this drug dealer only by his nickname, “CJ.” Detective Macera also was informed that CJ drove a blue Mercury vehicle with unknown Rhode Island registration plates. Finally, the confidential informant told Det. Macera that CJ either was at or would soon arrive at the Royal Buffet restaurant in Cranston, where he would be found in possession of crack cocaine.3', 'Armed with this information, Det. Macera contacted his supervisor, who, in turn, contacted the Rhode Island State Police High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Task Force (task force).', 'Later that day, Det. Macera, the confidential informant, and several members of the task force proceeded to a Cranston shopping plaza in which the Royal Buffet is located. Detective Macera testified at the suppression hearing that “surveillance was set up at the Royal Buffet,” but it is evident from his testimony that the “surveillance” consisted of nothing more than establishing a police perimeter around the shopping plaza and waiting for CJ to emerge. No attempt was made to locate a blue Mercury vehicle in the shopping plaza’s parking lot because of the “large amount of vehicles” in the plaza. 3', 'The record is unclear whether CJ was at the Royal Buffet at the time the confidential informant relayed the tip to Det. Macera. At the suppression hearing, Det. Macera testified that the confidential informant told him that CJ “was presently at the Royal Buffet * * * in possession of crack cocaine.” At trial, Det. Macera similarly testified that “the [confidential informant] told me that the suspect was eating at the Royal Buffet” and that “[t]he confidential informant advised me that [CJ] had cocaine on his person at the time at a specific restaurant.” Likewise, Det. Macera read a portion of his police report while on the witness stand in which he stated: “[The confidential informant] advised that the subject was presently eating at the Royal Buffet * * *.” Elsewhere in his trial testimony, however, Det. Macera testified that, between approximately 3 p.m. and 3:30 p.m. that day, the confidential informant called CJ while in State Police custody and, after the phone call, informed the officer that CJ would be at the Royal Buffet at approximately 4 p.m. Detective Macera made no mention of this phone call during the suppression hearing, and he acknowledged at trial that he had not included this detail in his police report. During Det. Macera’s trial testimony, defense counsel’s efforts to discover more information about the phone call and how the confidential informant knew the information that was related to Det. Macera were thwarted by the state’s successful objections.', '-2-', 'When defendant—who Det. Macera testified matched the physical description of CJ provided by the confidential informant—exited the Royal Buffet, the confidential informant identified him as CJ. The defendant immediately was taken into custody. According to Det. Macera, he and his colleagues “surrounded” defendant,4 had him place his hands on a vehicle,5 and conducted a pat-down search. During the course of the pat-down of defendant’s outer clothing for weapons, Det. Macera felt a “bulge” in defendant’s front pocket; Det. Macera reached into defendant’s pocket to remove the material, which turned out to be $62 in cash. Detective Macera read defendant his Miranda rights and explained that he was suspected of selling drugs. At first, defendant told the officers that he was not in possession of any drugs.', 'During this encounter, after he had been “surrounded” by police officers, defendant “appeared [to Det. Macera] to be very nervous”; “his body was trembling,” and he “would not make eye contact” with the officer. When Det. Macera asked defendant about the odor of burnt marijuana that he detected, defendant admitted that he had smoked that substance earlier that day. Detective Macera informed defendant that a State Police K-9 unit was en route to the scene. Faced with this prospect, defendant lowered his head and said, “It’s in my pocket.” A search of the waistband of defendant’s jacket revealed two bags of suspected crack cocaine.

Macera, arguing that he was arrested without probable cause and that the subsequent search of his jacket violated the state and federal constitutions. After a suppression hearing, the trial justice denied the motion, concluding that police had probable cause to arrest defendant. In reaching his probable- cause determination, the trial justice relied on the following evidence from the suppression hearing: Det. Macera’s testimony that he smelled the odor of burnt marijuana when questioning defendant; defendant’s nervous behavior and incriminating statement that “[i]t’s in my pocket”; the “surveillance” that occurred at the Royal Buffet before defendant was apprehended; and the match between defendant’s appearance and the description given by the confidential informant.', 'After trial, a jury convicted defendant of the charged offense, and the trial justice sentenced him to two years of probation.

United States, 517 U.S. 690, 691, 699 (1996).', 'Analysis', 'Before embarking on our analysis, we reiterate that the state has conceded on appeal that, from the moment he was surrounded by the officers in the parking lot of the Royal Buffet, defendant was under arrest. This circumstance alters the factual landscape upon which the probable-cause determination so heavily depends.7 A valid arrest must be supported by probable cause at its inception; information—however incriminating it might be—that is discovered after a suspect is arrested cannot be used to establish the existence of probable cause. See State v. Ortiz, 824 A.2d 473, 480 (R.I. 2003) (“Rhode Island case law indicates that the existence of probable cause at the time of arrest determines its legality. * * * ‘[P]robable cause * * * must not be derived from evidence that a subsequent search might disclose.’” (quoting State v.

Di Re, 332 U.S. 7', 'The state’s concession also delineates the scope of our review. As a result of the concession, the only issue before us is whether the arrest was supported by probable cause. We therefore need not consider whether defendant’s initial encounter with police constituted a brief investigatory stop instead of an arrest, or, if it did, whether such a stop was supported by reasonable suspicion. See State v. Casas, 900 A.2d 1120, 1131 (R.I. 2006).', '-5- 581, 595 (1948) (“[A] search is not to be made legal by what it turns up. In law it is good or bad when it starts and does not change character from its success.”).', 'In this case, several of the facts relied upon by the trial justice came to light after the point in time at which the state concedes defendant was arrested. The trial justice’s conclusion that probable cause existed was grounded, in part, on Det. Macera’s testimony that he smelled the odor of burnt marijuana while questioning defendant after providing him with Miranda warnings and defendant’s nervous behavior and incriminating statement that “[i]t’s in my pocket.” Detective Macera discovered this evidence, however, only after he and several other officers “surrounded” defendant and, as the state concedes, arrested him in the parking lot of the Royal Buffet. Similarly, police did not learn that defendant drove a blue Chevrolet Impala with Rhode Island license plates or that defendant had $62 in cash and two bags of crack cocaine on his person until after they arrested him. Thus, the only pre-arrest evidence that might support probable cause to arrest defendant consists of the confidential informant’s tip, the “surveillance” conducted by the officers in the shopping plaza before defendant exited the Royal Buffet, and the consistency between defendant’s physical appearance and the confidential informant’s description of CJ. To its credit, the state does not rely on any of the post-arrest evidence, but instead argues that probable cause existed at the time of defendant’s arrest.', 'We are not convinced.', 'Probable cause to arrest a suspect exists when “the facts and circumstances within * * * [the officers’] knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information [are] sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that an offense has been or is being committed” and that the suspect is the perpetrator. Chum, 54 A.3d at 462 (quoting State v. Flores, 996 A.2d 156, 161 (R.I. 2010)); see also Ortiz, 824 A.2d at 480.', '-6- Because “probable cause is a fluid concept—turning on the assessment of probabilities in particular factual contexts—not readily, or even usefully, reduced to a neat set of legal rules,” we must carefully examine the totality of the circumstances in determining whether probable cause exists. Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 232 (1983); see also id. at 230-31, 238.', 'This fluidity extends to probable-cause determinations involving informants’ tips. “Informants’ tips, like all other clues and evidence coming to a policeman on the scene, may vary greatly in their value and reliability.” Gates, 462 U.S. at 232 (quoting Adams v. Williams, 407 U.S. 143, 147 (1972)). Thus, courts no longer analyze an informant’s tip by artificially compartmentalizing the informant’s veracity or reliability, on the one hand, and his or her basis of knowledge, on the other. See id. at 230, 233. Instead, we examine all relevant considerations surrounding the tip and any other relevant factors of the case in the familiar totality-of-the- circumstances analysis. See id. at 230-31, 233. In this analysis, “an informant’s veracity, reliability, and basis of knowledge remain highly relevant.” State v. Cosme, 57 A.3d 295, 303 (R.I. 2012) (quoting State v. King, 693 A.2d 658, 661 (R.I. 1997)); see also Gates, 462 U.S. at 230. “[A] deficiency in one [of these three aspects of an informant’s tip] may be compensated for, in determining the overall reliability of a tip, by a strong showing as to [another aspect], or by some other indicia of reliability.” Gates, 462 U.S. at 233. Additionally, “corroboration of details of an informant’s tip by independent police work” can strengthen the argument for probable cause in a particular case. Id. at 241; see also Cosme, 57 A.3d at 303. Indeed, independent police investigation can carry the day in a probable-cause determination. Cf. State v. Keohane, 814 A.2d 327, 328, 330, 330-31 (R.I. 2003) (concluding that police had reasonable suspicion—and explaining that “any suspicions * * * approached the level of probable cause”— to stop a van where police were informed by an anonymous tip that the defendant “would be', '-7- traveling to Providence in a van to purchase heroin” that would be sold in Woonsocket, and police corroborated the tip by observing the defendant, accompanied by “a known heroin user,” drive to Providence in a van, “approach a group of males,” and then “proceed[] back to Woonsocket, following the pattern predicted by the tipster,” driving in an erratic manner).', 'In examining the totality of the circumstances in this case, we conclude that, because of the combined effect of several aspects of the tip and the accompanying failure of the police to corroborate any information provided by the confidential informant, there was no probable cause to arrest this defendant. We begin by examining the tip itself. For starters, the confidential informant had not previously provided information to Det. Macera. Although past experience between an informant and police is by no means required, see State v. Ricci, 472 A.2d 291, 297 (R.I. 1984) (explaining that “[f]irst-time informants can be found to be reliable”), it is a factor that, when present, increases the likelihood that the informant’s information is reliable and truthful on the occasion under review. See, e.g., Draper v. United States, 358 U.S. 307, 309, 312-13, 313 (1959) (tip from informant who was a “‘special employee’ of the Bureau of Narcotics” for six months when tip was made and who had given “accurate and reliable” information in the past; court concluded that, in these circumstances, the officer “would have been derelict in his duties had he not pursued [the tip]”).', 'To be sure, the confidential informant hardly was anonymous to police; he or she8 was in State Police custody as a result of an outstanding warrant at the time the tip was given and when defendant was arrested.', 'The state argues that this circumstance bolsters the confidential informant’s reliability because an untruthful tip would have resulted in negative consequences 8', 'The record is unclear on whether the confidential informant was male or female. At the suppression hearing, Det. Macera used both male and female pronouns to describe the confidential informant. For efficiency, we shall employ the male pronoun.', '-8- for the confidential informant. It is true that an informant’s statement against his or her penal interest may, in some circumstances, be deemed credible. See United States v. Harris, 403 U.S. 573, 583-84 (1971) (plurality op.); State v. Read, 416 A.2d 684, 689 (R.I. 1980). Such a statement generally arises after the informant has been caught in the act. In this case, however, the confidential informant did not make a statement against his penal interest, as was the case in Read, upon which the state relies. See Read, 416 A.2d at 686-87, 689 (informant admitted to purchasing marijuana from the address that police later searched pursuant to a search warrant); see also Harris, 403 U.S. at 575-76, 583 (informant admitted to purchasing illicit whiskey from address controlled by the defendant); United States v. Tyler, 238 F.3d 1036, 1038-39 (8th Cir. 2001) (informant identified the defendant as his supplier of drugs); State v. Grossi, 588 A.2d 607, 608 (R.I. 1991) (informant implicated himself in a drug-smuggling ring involving the defendant); State v. Germano, 559 A.2d 1031, 1035 (R.I. 1989) (informant admitted to purchasing cocaine from the defendant). Unlike the informants in the above-cited cases, the confidential informant did not admit to purchasing crack cocaine from defendant or that he was involved in defendant’s drug-dealing operations.9', 'The statement-against-penal-interest concept is closely tied to the informant’s basis of knowledge, another relevant consideration in the totality-of-the-circumstances analysis. See Gates, 462 U.S. at 230-31; Cosme, 57 A.3d at 303. In all of the above-cited cases, each informant’s statement against penal interest established his basis of knowledge; having admitted 9', 'To the extent that the state is suggesting that the fact that Det. Macera knew the confidential informant’s identity supports a finding that the tip was reliable because it is a misdemeanor to falsely report a crime to police, see G.L. 1956 § 11-32-2; cf. Adams v. Williams, 407 U.S. 143, 146-47 (1972), we note that the mere fact that police know the identity of the informant is not alone a sufficient basis to find probable cause on the basis of the tip, see United States v. Koerth, 312 F.3d 862, 867-68 (7th Cir. 2002) (concluding that affidavit submitted in support of search- warrant application failed to furnish probable cause notwithstanding facts that informant’s identity was known, he was in police custody, and he made a statement against penal interest).', '-9- to committing a crime, the informant necessarily had personal knowledge of the place, instrumentalities, or persons involved in that criminal activity. See, e.g., Harris, 403 U.S. at 575- 76, 578-79 (informant’s sworn tip that the defendant sold illicit whiskey at a particular address was based on informant’s purchase of illicit whiskey at that address); Grossi, 588 A.2d at 608 (informant’s tip that the defendant was involved in a drug-smuggling ring was based on informant’s own involvement in that operation); Germano, 559 A.2d at 1033, 1035 (informant’s tip that the defendant was selling cocaine out of his home was based, in part, on informant’s own purchase of cocaine from the defendant; informant also had visited the defendant’s home on numerous occasions and observed the defendant sell cocaine); Read, 416 A.2d at 686 (informant’s tip that marijuana was located at a particular address was based on informant’s purchase of marijuana at that location earlier that evening); see also Tyler, 238 F.3d at 1038-39 (informant’s tip that the defendant was a drug dealer was based, in part, on informant’s own purchase of drugs from the defendant); cf. Ricci, 472 A.2d at 293, 296-97 (informant’s tip that the defendant was in possession of stolen earrings was based on the fact that the defendant gave informant a sample of the stolen earrings, and informant confirmed with the victim of the theft that the earrings were stolen). In stark contrast to these cases, there is no evidence in this record to suggest that the confidential informant had personal knowledge that defendant was engaged in the trafficking of crack cocaine.10 All we know about the confidential informant is that he was the subject of an outstanding warrant issued for reasons not disclosed by the record. 10', 'We pause to note that the confidential informant’s basis of knowledge cannot be inferred from Det. Macera’s subsequent testimony at trial that the confidential informant called defendant while in State Police custody. When defense counsel asked Det. Macera how the confidential informant knew that defendant was in possession of cocaine, the state objected, and the trial justice sustained the objection. Had the state possessed information concerning the confidential informant’s basis of knowledge, it should have presented that evidence during the suppression hearing.', '- 10 -', 'Finally, the type of detail provided by the confidential informant further undermines the value of this tip in the totality-of-the-circumstances appraisal. Apart from the assertion that defendant was in possession of crack cocaine (which may or may not have been based on the confidential informant’s personal knowledge), the tip boils down to an accurate characterization of defendant’s physical appearance, a technically incorrect, albeit close, description of defendant’s vehicle, and a correct statement of the restaurant at which defendant either was or would soon be dining, see supra note 3. Although verifiable, the first two components of the tip—the description of defendant and his car—have no bearing on the reliability of the informant’s assertion that defendant was engaged in criminal activity. As the United States Supreme Court explained in the related context of a stop-and-frisk based on a tip from an anonymous informant:', '“An accurate description of a subject’s readily observable', 'location and appearance is of course reliable in this limited sense:', 'It will help the police correctly identify the person whom the', 'tipster means to accuse. Such a tip, however, does not show that', 'the tipster has knowledge of concealed criminal activity. The', 'reasonable suspicion here at issue requires that a tip be reliable in', 'its assertion of illegality, not just in its tendency to identify a', 'determinate person.” Florida v. J.L., 529 U.S. 266, 272 (2000). Cf. Alabama v. White, 496 U.S. 325, 332 (1990) (“The fact that the officers found a car precisely matching the [anonymous] caller’s description in front of the 235 building is an example of [an ‘easily obtained fact[ or] condition[] existing at the time of the tip’]. Anyone could have ‘predicted’ that fact because it was a condition presumably existing at the time of the call.” (quoting Gates, 462 U.S. at 245)).', 'The tip in this case failed to provide predictive detail from which police could assess the informant’s claims that he had knowledge of defendant’s criminal conduct. The state disputes this conclusion, arguing that the tip contained predictive information because the confidential', '- 11 - informant “called [defendant] to confirm that he would be dining at the Royal Buffet sometime around 4:00 p.m.” We are unpersuaded. At the outset, we note that the record is unclear on whether defendant was already at the Royal Buffet or instead on his way there at the time of the tip. See supra note 3. This uncertainty is caused by the state’s failure to elicit testimony concerning the telephone call during the suppression hearing. Instead, this information made its debut during defense counsel’s cross-examination of Det. Macera at trial, and the state successfully objected to several attempts by defense counsel to explore the details of this call.', 'In any event, even had the tip contained information regarding defendant’s future plans to visit the Royal Buffet, this lone detail pales in comparison to the predictive information provided by the confidential informants in the cases cited by the state. See, e.g., Draper, 358 U.S. at 309- 10 (tip—given by an informant who was a paid employee of the Bureau of Narcotics and had provided reliable information in the past—indicated that the defendant had gone to Chicago the day before and would return to Denver by train either the next day or the day after, accurately described the precise clothing the defendant would be wearing and the tan zipper bag that he would be carrying, and correctly stated that the defendant “habitually” walked very quickly); United States v. Miller, 925 F.2d 695, 697 (4th Cir. 1991) (Powell, J.) (informant’s tip indicated that the defendant—a picture of whom the informant identified—would be traveling by bus and arriving on one of two days later that week; informant also accurately described the precise clothing that the defendant would be wearing and a tote bag that she would be carrying); cf. Keohane, 814 A.2d at 330 (concluding that anonymous tip was “sufficiently detailed, and thereafter corroborated, to warrant an experienced detective to become reasonably suspicious of [the defendant’s] behavior” where “[t]he tip provided details of where [the defendant] lived, the', '- 12 - type of vehicle he would be driving, and the itinerary and alleged purpose of his travel to and from Providence”).', 'For these reasons, we conclude that the tip in this case, standing alone, failed to provide probable cause to arrest defendant. This conclusion, however, does not end the analysis because an informant’s tip that alone does not furnish probable cause can be shored up by independent police investigation. See Gates, 462 U.S. at 241; Cosme, 57 A.3d at 303. The state contends that police corroborated the details of the confidential informant’s tip. We disagree with this assertion.', 'The “surveillance” referred to by Det. Macera consisted of establishing a police perimeter at the shopping plaza and confirming that the confidential informant recognized defendant. The police did not even attempt to corroborate the confidential informant’s description of defendant’s vehicle, having summarily deemed such an endeavor impractical because of the large number of vehicles in the parking lot; nor is there any evidence that they performed a records check. We conclude, on the basis of this record, that the efforts of the police in this case, even when combined with the tip, fell short of what was necessary to establish probable cause to arrest. Cf. Casas, 900 A.2d at 1132 (remarking, in the course of expressing doubt as to whether reasonable suspicion existed to justify vehicle stop, that “little, if any, informant information was confirmed before the stop,” notwithstanding four or five surveillance efforts by police).', 'In the final analysis, the state has not presented this Court with—and our independent research has not unearthed—any case in which probable cause to arrest a suspect was found based on a tip from a first-time informant who has merely been detained on an outstanding warrant, where the tip is devoid of predictive detail and fails to indicate the informant’s basis of knowledge of the alleged criminal activity, and police undertake no effort to corroborate or', '- 13 - independently investigate such a bare-bones tip. Instead, the cases cited by the state are readily distinguishable. For example, in Draper, 358 U.S. at 309, the tip came from an informant who “had been engaged as a ‘special employee’ of the Bureau of Narcotics * * * for about six months, and from time to time [had given] information to Marsh,” the federal narcotics agent who arrested the defendant, and “Marsh had always found the information given by [the informant] to be accurate and reliable.” See also id. at 310. The Court explained that, because the tip “[came] from one employed for that purpose and whose information had always been found accurate and reliable, it is clear that Marsh would have been derelict in his duties had he not pursued it.” Id. at 313. The established reliability of the informant in Draper stands in stark contrast to the circumstances of this case, which involve a first-time informant who neither made a statement against his penal interest nor revealed his basis of knowledge.', 'Moreover, the tip in Draper contained predictions relating to specific details that the officer corroborated. The informant predicted that the defendant would arrive in Denver from Chicago by train on one of two consecutive mornings; the informant also told Marsh that the defendant would be “wearing a light[-]colored raincoat, brown slacks[,] and black shoes,” and that he would be walking at a rapid pace while carrying a tan zipper bag. Draper, 358 U.S. at 309 & n.2.', 'Two days later, Marsh observed the defendant, “wearing the precise clothing described by [the informant]” and “carrying a tan zipper bag,” disembark from an incoming Chicago train and quickly walk towards the exit of the train station. Id. at 309, 310. As the Supreme Court explained:', '“Marsh had personally verified every facet of the information', 'given him by [the informant] except whether [the defendant] had', 'accomplished his mission and had the three ounces of heroin on his', 'person or in his bag. And surely, with every other bit of [the', 'informant’s] information being thus personally verified, Marsh had', '‘reasonable grounds’ to believe that the remaining unverified bit of', '- 14 -', '[the informant’s] information—that [the defendant] would have the', 'heroin with him—was likewise true.” Id. at 313.', 'Another case cited by the state, Miller, 925 F.2d at 697, involved an informant who similarly predicted specific details. The informant told Patrick, the investigator who ultimately made the arrest, that the defendant, whose identity the informant confirmed by identifying her picture, “would be bringing a shipment of drugs [by bus] from New York City” on one of two consecutive days. Id. Two days later, the informant confirmed that the defendant’s bus would be arriving later that day and that the defendant “would be wearing blue jeans and a blouse” and “carrying a brown tote bag with a shoulder strap.” Id. Later that day, Patrick observed the defendant, wearing the clothing the informant had predicted and carrying the brown shoulder bag, disembark from a bus arriving from New York City. Id. In this case, by contrast, the tip did not contain a prediction of the kind of specific detail related by the tips in Draper and Miller, and police did not even attempt to corroborate the readily verifiable detail concerning defendant’s vehicle or learn to whom it was registered.', 'Additionally, this case is distinguishable from Miller for another significant reason: police in this case had no prior knowledge that defendant was a drug dealer. In Miller, 925 F.2d at 697, Patrick had arrested the defendant for a drug offense about a year earlier. The court explained that prior knowledge of the defendant’s involvement in the narcotics trade, when coupled with Patrick’s substantial corroboration of the predictive detail related in the tip, “pointed towards the tip’s reliability.” Id. at 700; see also id. at 699-700. The factor of independent knowledge of a defendant’s previous involvement in drug trafficking was also present in Tyler, another case relied upon by the state. In that case, the police “found that [the informant’s] account matched [the defendant’s] known reputation as a drug dealer.” Tyler, 238 F.3d at 1038. Moreover, the informant initially made contact with police when they arrested him', '- 15 - for possession of drugs. Id. at 1039. Caught red-handed, the informant identified his source of the drugs—the defendant—and added that “he had purchased drugs from [the defendant] on ‘numerous occasions’ over the previous year.” Id. The court concluded that “[the informant’s] disclosures were presumptively credible because they were made against his penal interest.” Id. Unlike in Tyler, the confidential informant in this case neither made a statement against his penal interest nor revealed how he knew about defendant’s criminal activity.', 'In sum, we hold that the defendant’s arrest was not supported by probable cause. We emphasize that no one feature of this case compels this conclusion. Instead, after conducting the requisite totality-of-the-circumstances analysis, we are of the opinion that the facts and circumstances were not sufficient to “warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that an offense ha[d] been or [was] being committed” and that the defendant was the perpetrator. Chum, 54 A.3d at 462 (quoting Flores, 996 A.2d at 161); see Ortiz, 824 A.2d at 480. The defendant’s motion to suppress the evidence seized and his statements to police should have been granted.', 'Conclusion', 'For these reasons, we vacate the judgment of conviction. The papers may be remanded to the Superior Court.', 'Justice Robinson, concurring. After a considerable amount of time spent reviewing the pertinent cases and in applying their teachings to the facts of the instant case, I have decided that I am able in good conscience to concur in the result reached by the majority. I consider this to be an extraordinarily close case—one in which the “correct” answer was by no means apparent at the outset. What in the end convinced me that probable cause was lacking is the fact that, after considering the other factors in a totality of the circumstances review, I was struck by the reality', '- 16 - that there is no indication in the record before us that the first-time informant advised the police of the basis for his or her assertion that the defendant would be at the Royal Buffet in possession of crack cocaine.', '- 17 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'State v.

The defendants, Baird Properties, LLC (Baird Properties) and Michael Baird (Baird), appeal from a Superior Court judgment in favor of Tracy Gregoire and Mark Traynor (collectively, plaintiffs) in an action brought under the Residential Landlord and Tenant Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 18 of title 34.1 This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'The complaint included a third plaintiff, Carl Truax. The trial justice entered judgment against Truax from which he has not appealed. Consequently, his claims are not before this Court for review.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On November 4, 2011, plaintiffs entered into a residential lease with Due North Investments, LLC (Due North) to reside in the second-floor unit of 29 Spring Street, West Warwick (the property), commencing on November 15, 2011. The plaintiffs resided on the property with Gregoire’s two minor children and Carl Truax, who was a father-figure to Traynor. Robert and Linda Carey (the Careys) were the principals of Due North and resided on the first floor of the property. Due North had purchased the property from Baird Properties in 2011; however, Baird Properties reacquired title in 2012 when it foreclosed upon a mortgage it held on the property. A foreclosure deed was recorded on December 5, 2012. Shortly thereafter, on December 10, 2012, the property was condemned by the Town of West Warwick due to a lack of electricity, heating, and water, and plaintiffs were required to vacate the premises and remove their belongings.', 'On December 27, 2012, plaintiffs filed a complaint in Kent County District Court alleging that defendants purposely sabotaged utility services to the property in order to deliberately set events in motion that would force plaintiffs to vacate the premises. Specifically, the complaint alleged that Baird Properties violated § 34-18-44 2 (count 1), that Baird individually violated § 34-18-44 (count 2), malicious destruction of property by both defendants (count 3), and negligence by both defendants (count 4). The plaintiffs removed the matter to the Superior Court on October 8, 2013, by appealing from a judgment by stipulation in the District 2', 'General Laws 1956 § 34-18-44 provides, in relevant part, that “[a] landlord may not * * * take possession of [a] dwelling unit by * * * willful diminution of services to the tenant by interrupting or causing the interruption of heat, running water, hot water, electric, gas, or other essential service to the tenant * * *.”', '-2- Court. 3 On January 15, 2014, the case proceeded to trial de novo in the Kent County Superior Court.', 'A', 'Trial Testimony', 'The evidence adduced at trial may be summarized as follows. Traynor testified that he and Gregoire entered into a lease agreement with Due North to reside in the second-floor unit of the property. 4', 'He testified that, in a September 7, 2012 letter, Baird Properties informed plaintiffs that it had been appointed to act on behalf of Southbridge Savings Bank (Southbridge) to collect rental payments to the property and that as of that date all payments should be made payable to Southbridge and delivered to Baird Properties. The letter informed plaintiffs that rental payments should no longer be paid to Due North. Traynor testified that plaintiffs also received a letter from Due North, dated September 8, 2012, claiming that Baird was forbidden to enter properties owned by Due North and that all rents owed should be paid to Due North. Traynor testified that he had continued to make rent payments to Due North for the months of September and October; however, after obtaining legal advice, he had not paid the November rent to either Due North or Baird Properties.', 'Traynor further testified that, on December 9, 2012, as plaintiffs were leaving their apartment with their children, they ran into Baird on the sidewalk near Traynor’s vehicle. 3', 'Appeals from actions brought pursuant to the Residential Landlord and Tenant Act, chapter 18 of title 34 (RLTA) shall follow G.L. 1956 § 9-12-10.1. Section 34-18-47. Section 9-12-10.1 provides that any party to a civil action brought pursuant to the RLTA “may cause the case to be removed for trial on all questions of law and fact to the [S]uperior [C]ourt * * *.” 4', 'Although the lease was executed on November 4, 2011, by both Traynor and Gregoire, the transcript indicates that Traynor testified that he moved into the unit “around November of 2012.” This appears to be a mix-up with dates or a typographical error because Traynor’s testimony throughout the trial and filings before this Court are consistent with his having moved into the second-floor unit in November 2011, not 2012.', '-3- According to Traynor, Baird communicated to them that he had “gained control of six properties” and that plaintiffs “needed to be at his office the next day to pay a security deposit and any back rent and to sign a new lease * * * [o]r he [would] hav[e] the water and electrical turned off.” Traynor further stated that despite not wanting to leave the property or intending to abandon it, he was required to leave because the property had been condemned. He also explained that he entered the basement on the property on a weekly basis, including a last visit on December 8, and that he had never observed any problems with the boiler while he was there. He testified that while he resided at the property he never had any problems with the electrical panel.', 'Gregoire also testified that on December 9, 2012, plaintiffs were approached by Baird as they were getting into their vehicle. She testified that Baird “told [plaintiffs] [they] had to be at his office on Monday morning * * * [t]o sign a new lease, pay any back rent and a new security deposit * * * before noontime or he was coming back to shut the electric and water off.” She recalled that on the next day, December 10, 2012, Baird came to the property in the early morning and she notified Truax that he was there.', 'She testified that she heard banging downstairs and yelling directed at the first-floor tenants. She explained that she was not sure what the banging noise was but that she heard Baird say “that the first[-]floor tenants were ‘F-ing squatters’” and “needed to get the hell out of the apartment.” She also testified that later that day the building inspector and the fire department came to the property and she was informed by the building official that she would not be allowed to remain on the property as it was “unlivable.” She testified that she did not want or intend to leave the property, but did so “[b]ecause the building was deemed unsafe and [she] ha[d] two children.” Gregoire testified that she was in the property’s basement “[w]eekly, if not a couple of times a week,” and had never observed any', '-4- problems with the boiler or electrical panel. During cross-examination, Gregoire acknowledged that, although she testified to having no electrical issues on the property prior to December 10, she would “pop a breaker if the washing machine and microwave went off at the same time * * *.”', 'Truax, who also resided in the second-floor unit, testified that on December 10 Gregoire informed him that Baird was on the property but that he did not think much of it because Baird was always there. Truax testified that, when he went to make coffee, there was no running water. He testified that he proceeded to call Baird and inquire about the water and Baird informed him that he would return to the property in fifteen minutes to turn the water on. Truax explained that when Baird arrived at the property he turned the water back on, but then it went off again. Truax testified that “[o]nce the water went off [he] heard a lot of banging downstairs.” He also testified that he heard a lot of yelling and profanity from Baird, including Baird calling out to the first-floor tenants: “f-ing squatters. Get off my property. You’re scum.” Truax testified that, when he went downstairs to the basement, he observed Baird “taking the heater unit off of the first[-]floor boiler.” He also testified to observing that the covers had been taken off of the electrical panels, and that the first-floor panel was smashed and the wires were pulled out of the second-floor panel. Truax testified that at that moment Baird told him “that he turned the water and electric off,” that the “[s]cumbags on the first floor need[ed] to get the ‘F’ off [his] property[,]” and that Truax needed to get to Baird’s office and sign his lease. Truax testified that he became angry and told Baird that Baird needed to get a copy of the lease to his lawyers. At that moment, Truax testified, Baird grabbed his phone and dialed what he assumed to be 911 because within minutes the fire department arrived, as well as the building official and building inspector.', '-5-', 'Truax further testified that, prior to December 10, he had last been in the basement on December 6. At that time, he observed that the electrical panel was intact, that the cover was on, and that the boiler had no problems. He stated that the building inspector communicated that, although the tenants did not have to move, they could not sleep on the property. He explained that, after everyone left, Baird told him that if Truax “got down there and signed the lease and gave money, [Baird] could sign the lease and fix things tomorrow.” Truax testified that he was forced to find somewhere else to stay until the electrical panel was fixed for their unit, but he posted a sign on the exterior door to the unit before leaving that read: “This property is not abandoned. To gain access, to call Carl Truax.” 5', 'Next, Joseph Argenti, the chief electrical inspector for the Town of West Warwick, testified regarding the field inspection notice that he prepared on December 10, 2012. Argenti testified that Baird asked him and the building official to go out that morning to take a look at the property. He testified that he did not recall smelling any smoke but did observe several building code violations, including that the electrical panels were compromised and all the wiring was pulled out of both electrical panels. He also testified that he observed that the junction boxes, which usually are a termination point for wiring, had no covers on them and the wiring was ripped out. He further observed that there was open wiring in overhead fixtures in both the first- and second-floor units.', 'Argenti also testified regarding other deficiencies found in the apartments, including the lack of any smoke detectors. Due to all the violations he observed, Argenti called National Grid to shut the power off. He testified that “within a day or so [he was] sure any contractor could have corrected the deficiencies.” He testified that a permit was issued 5', 'Truax also testified regarding the occurrences of December 21, 2012, when he found out that his personal belongings had been placed in a dumpster by Baird. However, because Truax and his claims relating to the destruction of personal property are not before this Court, we shall abstain from summarizing that portion of his testimony.', '-6- on December 27, 2012, for the repairs and that when he re-inspected the property on December 31, “[t]he electrical in both units passed.” As such, he called National Grid and the electricity was restored.', 'Kerry Anderson, the building official for the Town of West Warwick, testified that on December 10, 2012, he received a call from Baird asking that he inspect the property. He testified that he noted many deficiencies on the property upon his inspection, including that the burner had been removed and placed on the floor, which rendered it useless, and that the electrical panel covers were off, exposing all the connections to the circuit breakers and wires. He testified that the wires “were all pulled forward from the panels themselves like somebody reached in and did this.” Additionally, Anderson testified that it appeared that the boiler was also serving as a water heater and that the safety shutoff button was removed from the second safety device above the boiler. 6 He testified that he did not smell smoke or observe signs of a fire. He also noted that the smoke detectors were removed from the second and third floors of the property.', 'Anderson testified that, after his inspection, he spoke to the tenants, including plaintiffs, and “told them that without heat or water, that the building would be determined to be unsafe and uninhabitable and they would have to leave” effective on December 10. He also estimated that the repairs that needed to be made to the property could have been made within a day. He testified that he sent a notice to Baird Properties on December 11, informing it that the violations found on the property needed to be repaired. He also sent a fax to the Kent County Water Authority requesting that the water to the property be “shut off at the street due to house being unsafe due to no heat or electric.” Lastly, he testified regarding a notice sent from him to all 6', 'The safety device turns off the boiler in the event that the boiler overheats or catches fire.', '-7- tenants reminding them that the property was posted as unsafe and that the property needed to be “fully vacated” by four o’clock on December 17—meaning that all the tenants’ personal belongings had to be completely removed.', 'Gerald Barlow, the owner of Barlow Heating, LLC, testified on behalf of defendants. He testified that on December 10, in response to a call from Baird’s property manager, he met Baird at the property to “check some issues with the boiler.” He recalled that the basement on the property had “an odor of fumes or something coming from the boiler.” He noted that “[t]here was only one boiler in operation” and that the boiler was the source of the odor. He testified that the “fuses weren’t plugged, [and that] the boiler needed to be cleaned.” Barlow testified that the boiler’s poor condition was due to the boiler not having been serviced properly and having been neglected over a period of time. Barlow also testified that, for the boiler that was operational, he removed the oil burner and took it back to his shop to clean it. He also disconnected the fire switch so that the burner could not run. He testified that he ultimately repaired the boilers in January, after the electricity was back on at the property.', 'Baird was the final witness to testify. He testified that he was the sole member of Baird Properties, and that on December 5, 2012, Baird Properties obtained a foreclosure deed for the property, which had been previously owned by Due North.', 'He testified that during the foreclosure process he had not had a good relationship with the Careys, who resided in the first- floor unit of the property during that time. He testified that, in addition to the property at issue, Baird Properties had also foreclosed on four other properties that Due North owned. Baird testified that on December 9, 2012, he approached plaintiffs informing them that “if they wanted to stay in the apartment * * * they [had] to re[-]sign a lease with [him] and that there was a threat from the [Kent County] Water Authority indicating that they were going to shut the water off for', '-8- nonpayment and [that] now [he] owned the property.” Baird testified that he learned through a conversation that he had with the Water Authority that Due North had not paid the water bills since it purchased the property from him, but that in fact, the Water Authority had never threatened to shut off the water.', 'Baird testified that on December 10, he went to the West Warwick Police Department with a copy of the foreclosure deed and visited Anderson, who informed Baird that he would be inspecting the property that day. He testified that he next went to the property, where he observed that the latch to the basement door was broken and upon entering the basement he “immediately smelled fumes.” He testified that with the help of a flashlight he observed that “[t]he first[-]floor furnace was puffing back.” He further testified that he instantly “shut the switch off to it and went and shut the breaker off,” then “went to [his] truck and contacted the West Warwick building official,” and then had his office contact Barlow. He testified that he saw Truax outside at that time, and told Truax that the furnace in the first floor was off, that the water was shut off, and that Barlow was on his way. He testified that Truax shrugged his shoulders and told him to do whatever he had to do. Baird testified that he asked Truax to notify him when the building inspector arrived, “in the event that he show[ed] up before [Baird] g[o]t back” to the property. He testified that Truax called him and he returned to the property shortly after the building official arrived. At trial, Baird insisted that there was “no reason” to threaten Truax that he would turn off the water if he did not sign the lease—as Truax had testified— “because [] Truax was not on the lease that the Careys had turned over” to him.', 'Moreover, Baird testified that Barlow also arrived to inspect the boiler and informed Baird that, if he wanted him to fix the boiler, he could not do it right there “because he needed some parts” and “had to take it, fix it and bring it back.” Baird also testified that Barlow “told', '-9- [him] that he was taking the [fire switch] off of the boilers * * * until he returned to fix them.” He further testified that he spoke to the electrical inspector, Argenti, and the building official, Anderson, regarding the situation as it existed in the basement. He testified that he explained to both that Barlow was in the basement and he had shut the breaker off on the switch to the first floor, but that the second floor was still on. At this point, Baird testified that Argenti inquired regarding the whereabouts of the panel covers and observed that the wires in the house were hanging in disarray. He testified that the two inspected the basement in his presence, but that he was not present when they inspected the two units. He testified that “[p]rior to that morning[,] he had been to the basement “[a] year and a half ago”—at a time when he held title to the property. When asked who made the decision to turn off the electricity to the property, he attested that “[w]hen [the building official] went upstairs and found no smoke detectors and bare open wires on two or three electrical boxes on the first floor * * * [he] indicat[ed] that there was no way he was going to leave power in this house until this stuff was fixed.” Baird testified that, because the power was being shut off and it was quite cold outside, he suggested that they call the Kent County Water Authority to have the water shut off as well. He also testified that plaintiffs had contacted his office “a couple of days later” and indicated that they would not sign a lease or stay at the second-floor unit and would be out by the time noted on the building official’s notice.', 'Baird testified that, on December 11, he went to the property to protect it because the property was not insured and the first-floor tenant, Robert Carey, had “indicated to [him] in a prior conversation * * * that he would lighter fluid the floor [sic] and burn the house to the ground.” He testified that he knocked on the first-floor door that was “open and the latch was all busted and smashed” but that this did not “alarm” him “because it happen[ed] all the time.” He', '- 10 - claimed that he noticed that the tenants’ cars parked on the street near the property had “windows [that] were completely frozen over,” indicating that the tenants had stayed overnight, and he contacted the police to remove them from the property. He testified that the police told him “it was not their problem,” but they arrived later that morning at the request of the Careys, who reported that Baird had kicked in their door. The police interviewed the Careys, Truax, and a neighbor, and then arrested Baird for disorderly conduct. Baird testified that he was later found not guilty of this charge.', 'B', 'Superior Court Decision', 'Following the close of evidence, the trial justice issued a written decision rendering judgment in favor of plaintiffs Gregoire and Traynor, and against plaintiff Truax. The trial justice—in finding that Baird was at all times acting as an agent of Baird Properties—rendered judgment exclusively against Baird Properties and not against Baird in his individual capacity. Importantly to this appeal, the trial justice found that Gregoire and Traynor testified more credibly regarding their interaction with Baird on December 9, 2012, which was characterized by Gregoire as a threat. He found that the “only reason” plaintiffs left on December 10 was that “they were forced to do so by the notice from the building inspector posted at the [p]roperty” and that plaintiffs had not abandoned the property. The trial justice further found that Baird went to the property on December 10, 2012, “with the intent of tampering with the electrical system” and that “his calls to the building officials that morning were for the purpose of alerting them to conditions he knew would result in an order” from the town to vacate the property.', 'Moreover, the trial justice found that Gregoire and Traynor were tenants on the property owned by Baird Properties and that Baird Properties was the landlord as a result of the Due', '- 11 - North foreclosure. Additionally, the trial justice found that Baird Properties was bound by the terms of the written lease executed by Due North, that it was not legally necessary for plaintiffs to sign a new lease or pay an additional security deposit, and that Baird Properties was deemed to be holding all rent that plaintiffs had paid to Due North in 2012. The trial justice also ruled that Baird Properties could not exercise a self-help remedy as a result of plaintiffs owing back rent. Next, he determined that Baird acted in violation of § 34-18-44 when he threatened loss of heat and electricity on December 9, 2012, unless plaintiffs signed a new lease, paid back rent, and paid a new security deposit. Finally, he found that Baird “acted in accordance with his threat by intentionally creating an uninhabitable condition on December 10, 2012.” Ultimately, the trial justice held that plaintiffs Gregoire and Traynor were entitled to the statutory remedy provided by § 34-18-34. As damages, he awarded three months’ rent ($2,955), reasonable attorney’s fees (amount to be determined), and the return of plaintiffs’ security deposit ($985).', 'The plaintiffs filed a petition for attorney’s fees in the amount of $22,750 with a supporting affidavit by trial counsel, including a detailed four-page statement of services rendered compiled from the billing records maintained by trial counsel’s firm, and an affidavit from an attorney with twenty-nine years’ experience practicing law attesting to the reasonableness of the fee. The defendants filed an objection without any supporting documents. A hearing was held on May 16, 2014, to determine the amount of attorney’s fees to be awarded. During the hearing, defendants’ objection to the sum requested by plaintiffs was two-fold. First, defendants claimed that, because plaintiffs’ counsel knew “going into this case” that the maximum recovery value was $3,940—three months’ rent and a return of the security deposit— the $22,750 requested could not be reconciled with the recovery amount. Second, defendants argued that when looking at the affidavit and timesheets provided by plaintiffs, it became', '- 12 - impossible to break out the time spent pursuing Truax’s claims—claims that were ultimately unsuccessful and therefore should not be the basis for any of the attorney’s fees awarded.', 'The plaintiffs argued, and the trial justice agreed, that this case was not a simple landlord- tenant proceeding, but was “extremely fact-intensive.” Additionally, the trial justice found that requiring trial counsel to seek “separate legal fees for each plaintiff that he represented * * * would be an unreasonable burden to place on counsel.” The trial justice noted that there was no evidence before the court to rebut the affidavits submitted by plaintiffs. The trial justice held that the attorney’s fees requested were “fair and reasonable” and ordered Baird Properties to pay $22,750. Final judgment entered on June 13, 2014. The defendants filed a notice of appeal. This Court remanded the case to the Superior Court for entry of a corrected judgment providing that judgment entered in favor of Baird on all claims against him individually. The corrected judgment entered on May 27, 2015.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“When a trial justice presides over a nonjury trial, Rule 52(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure requires that he or she ‘find the facts specially and state separately [his or her] conclusions of law thereon.’” South County Post & Beam, Inc. v.

Additionally, defendants argue that because the rent checks and money orders were to be made payable to Southbridge, “this clearly shows that Baird Properties * * * was acting as an agent for Southbridge * * * at the bank’s request pursuant to the bank’s assignment of rents. As such[,] this does not create a landlord[-]tenant relationship between * * * [p]laintiffs and Baird Properties * * *.” The defendants also argue that, although the trial testimony indicated that plaintiffs executed a lease with prior owners, “there was no testimony establishing that the lease was recorded and that there was any landlord[-]tenant relationship with * * * Baird for the [property].” The defendants insist that plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of proof in part because “[t]here is not a scintilla of evidence that * * * Baird caused any of th[e] damage * * *.” The defendants suggest that the apartment units’ deficiencies and the malfunctioning furnaces were a result of neglect by the former owners and that Baird was on the property to safeguard it against threats made by the Careys. Finally, defendants argue that “the award for attorney’s fees in the sum of $22,750 is not reasonable in light of the amount of recovery and lack of complexity of litigation.”', 'After reviewing the material submitted and arguments made by the parties, it is our opinion that this case hinges on the following three issues: (1) whether the trial justice correctly determined that a landlord-tenant relationship existed; (2) whether the trial justice correctly determined that Baird tampered with essential services to the property; and (3) whether the award of attorney’s fees was reasonable.', 'A', 'Landlord-Tenant', 'The Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (the act) defines “[l]andlord” as “the owner * * * of * * * the building.” Section 34-18-11(7). An “[o]wner” is defined as “any person who,', '- 15 - * * * [h]as legal title * * * to any dwelling * * * or [h]as charge, care, or control of any dwelling * * * as owner or agent of the owner * * *.” Section 34-18-11(10)(i),(ii). The act defines “[t]enant” to mean “a person entitled under a rental agreement to occupy a dwelling unit to the exclusion of others.” Section 34-18-11(17).', 'Here, it is undisputed that Baird Properties obtained title to the property at a foreclosure auction and recorded the deed on December 5, 2012, and that Baird was the sole member of Baird Properties. It is also undisputed that plaintiffs entered into a residential lease with Due North to reside on the property as tenants commencing in November of 2011. Section 34-18- 23(c) provides, in pertinent part, that a “purchaser of property * * * takes title subject to the same rights and responsibilities toward the tenant that the seller or mortgagor had.” 7 Therefore, according to the act, there was a landlord-tenant relationship between plaintiffs and Baird Properties on December 9, 2012. Thus, the trial justice correctly found that plaintiffs were lawfully on the property on December 9 and 10, as tenants under an existing lease and that a landlord-tenant relationship with Baird Properties existed at that time.', 'B', 'Tampering', 'Section 34-18-44 of the act provides that:', '“A landlord may not recover or take possession of the dwelling', 'unit by action or otherwise, including willful diminution of', 'services to the tenant by interrupting or causing the interruption of 7', 'The trial justice’s decision in this case issued on February 20, 2014; subsequently, § 34-18- 23(c) was amended, effective July 8, 2014. Because “this Court has traditionally applied the law in effect at the time we consider an appeal,” Solas v. Emergency Hiring Council of Rhode Island, 774 A.2d 820, 826 (R.I. 2001), we apply § 34-18-23(c) as amended by P.L. 2014, ch. 486, § 1.

This Court accords a substantial amount of deference to such credibility determinations given that the trial justice “had an opportunity to appraise witness demeanor and to take into account other realities that cannot be grasped from a reading of a cold record.” Id. at 392 (quoting B.S. International Limited, 13 A.3d at 1062).', 'After a careful review of the trial transcript and exhibits, it is our opinion that the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive material evidence. The defendants’ contentions with respect to the trial justice’s decision are mainly centered on issues of credibility—that the trial justice chose to believe plaintiffs’ versions of events over defendants’. It is precisely these types of credibility findings with which this Court is loathe to interfere. See D’Ellena, 21 A.3d at 392. The trial justice’s findings that Baird threatened plaintiffs on December 9 with shutting off the water and electricity if they did not sign a new lease, pay rents due, and make another security deposit were supported by the trial testimony of both plaintiffs. Gregoire testified that Baird “told [them] that [they] had to be at his office on Monday morning before noontime or he was coming back to shut the electric and water off.” Similarly, Traynor testified that Baird told them that they “needed to be at his office the next day to pay a security deposit and any back rent and to sign a new lease * * * [o]r he was having the water and electrical turned off.” The trial justice’s finding in this regard was clearly supported by trial testimony.', '- 17 -', 'Furthermore, we are satisfied that the trial justice’s finding that it was in fact Baird who caused the damage to the property on December 10 was a permissible inference given the evidence. Testimony was presented by Gregoire, Traynor, and Truax that, prior to December 10, no deficiencies were observed with the boiler or electrical panel, despite plaintiffs having routinely visited the basement. Additionally, there was testimony from plaintiffs, and from Baird himself, that he had not had a good relationship with the first-floor tenants. Both Truax and Gregoire testified to hearing Baird yell at the Careys on December 10 that they needed to leave his property. Furthermore, several witnesses placed Baird in the basement early that morning. Therefore, the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in finding that Baird acted with the intent of making the property uninhabitable and the tenants being ordered to vacate. We perceive no cause, therefore, to disturb the factual findings of the trial justice.', 'C', 'Attorney’s Fees', 'Section 34-18-34 of the act provides, in relevant part, that “[i]f a landlord * * * willfully diminishes services to the tenant by interrupting or causing the interruption of heat, running water, hot water, electric, gas, or other essential service, the tenant may recover * * * reasonable attorney’s fees.”', 'This Court affords deference to the trial justice’s determination of what constitutes reasonable fees.

On appeal, however, defendants have failed to properly present an argument to', '- 18 - this Court to support their assertion that the trial justice’s award of attorney’s fees was unreasonable. In their prebriefing statement, defendants’ argument in its entirety consists of one sentence claiming that “the award for attorney’s fees in the sum of $22,750 is not reasonable in light of the amount of recovery and lack of complexity of litigation.” Moreover, defendants chose not to file a supplemental statement explicating the basis of their reasoning. It is well established that this Court generally “consider[s] an issue to be waived when a party ‘[s]imply stat[es] an issue for appellate review, without a meaningful discussion thereof or legal briefing of the issues * * *.’” Bucci v.

Consequently, the issue is not properly before us.', 'At oral argument, the defendants made a valiant attempt to resurrect the issue of attorney’s fees. A thorough review of the record, however, reveals the futility of such efforts. 8 The plaintiffs’ counsel filed an affidavit itemizing the work he performed on the case, which totaled 113.75 hours, and averring that his billing rate was $200 per hour. The plaintiffs also submitted an affidavit from a veteran litigator who opined that the billing rate and hours expended were fair and reasonable and necessary for the plaintiffs to pursue their claims. The defendants, on the other hand, neither presented a counteraffidavit nor did they accept the trial justice’s invitation for an evidentiary hearing.

In this appeal, we revisit the defendant’s argument that the statements he made after his arrest and during his interrogation at the Woonsocket Police Department should have been suppressed by the trial justice as the product of illegal coercion by the detectives who interrogated him. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'In State v. Bojang, 83 A.3d 526 (R.I. 2014) (Bojang I), this Court remanded this case to the Superior Court for additional factfinding and credibility determinations regarding both the events that transpired during an unrecorded portion of defendant’s interrogation and the voluntariness of defendant’s confession. On remand, the parties waived their opportunity to present additional evidence, and the trial justice made oral findings of fact and credibility determinations based on his review of the testimony provided during both the hearing on defendant’s motion to suppress and the jury trial. In this section, we recount the facts and travel', '-1- of this case that are relevant to the present issues on appeal—namely, the testimony and evidence regarding defendant’s interrogations and the statements that he made during these interrogations, as well as the travel of defendant’s motion to suppress these statements.', 'For a complete summary of the facts that led to defendant’s conviction, we refer the reader to Bojang I. 1', 'In the spring of 2009, a grand jury returned an indictment charging defendant with eight counts of first-degree child molestation, allegedly perpetrated against one of the young daughters of the friends with whom defendant was living at the time (the complainant), in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-37-8.1. The defendant filed a motion to suppress the statements he had made after his arrest and during his interrogations at the Woonsocket Police Department, claiming that the statements were coerced and not made voluntarily. A trial justice of the Superior Court held a hearing over two days in April 2010, at which he heard extensive testimony from one of the detectives who had arrested and interrogated defendant as well as brief testimony from the patrolman who had transported defendant to the police station after his arrest. 2', 'At the suppression hearing, Det. Kevin Hammann testified that, on February 2, 2009 at 9:40 p.m., he was one of two detectives who executed the arrest warrant for defendant at a residence in Woonsocket. Detective Hammann stated that defendant was calm throughout his arrest. Detective Hammann testified that defendant’s interrogation was conducted in two parts: 1', 'In State v. Bojang, 83 A.3d 526 (R.I. 2014) (Bojang I), we resolved the other two issues that defendant argued were errors made by the trial justice that required vacating his conviction. We held that the trial justice had not erred in either his evidentiary rulings or when he denied defendant’s motion for a new trial. Id. at 540. 2', 'Woonsocket Patrolman Anthony Conetta, Jr. testified that he had transported an “African male, approximately [five foot eight]” from East School Street to the police station, a journey that took “two minutes.” Patrolman Conetta could neither definitively identify defendant as the male subject he had transported, nor recall any details from this transport. Patrolman Conetta denied assaulting, yelling at, or threatening the male subject; he asserted that he had “never done that in [his] career.”', '-2- the first occurred at approximately 10:10 p.m. in a room that did not have video or audio recording equipment, and the second occurred at approximately 10:50 p.m. in a room that did have video recording equipment. Detective Hammann testified that this second interrogation was video-recorded in its entirety. Detective Hammann further testified that defendant read, initialed, and signed a form acknowledging his Miranda rights 3 (rights form) in each interrogation room before the detectives began asking questions. Detective Hammann also testified that defendant had not, at any point, either asked for an attorney, a break from the questioning, or for the detectives to stop the interrogation.', 'With respect to the first (unrecorded) interrogation, Det. Hammann testified that, after initially denying any sexual contact with the complainant, defendant admitted to kissing her one time and to inserting his finger in her vagina one time. According to Det. Hammann, these statements were made after he told defendant that the complainant had, that morning during an interview at the Child Advocacy Center, alleged repeated instances of rape. Detective Hammann admitted that he had spoken to defendant about his immigration status and that he had discussed calling the immigration authorities. According to Det. Hammann, the other detective in the room, Ronald LaBreche, was standing near the door during the first interrogation. Detective Hammann admitted that Det. LaBreche yelled at defendant at one point, but he also repeatedly stated that he could not recall many details of the first interrogation, such as whether Det. LaBreche swore at defendant several times.', 'Detective Hammann admitted that “it [was] possible” that Det. LaBreche had banged on the table during the first interrogation. Detective Hammann denied that defendant was assaulted at any time during this first interrogation. 3', 'Miranda v.

Hammann’s testimony. The first two minutes of the DVD showed defendant sitting alone at a table before the detectives entered. After the detectives entered the room, the DVD showed defendant reading, initialing, and signing a rights form. Next, the DVD captured an interrogation in which defendant admitted to three separate sexual encounters with the complainant, as well as to kissing her. The defendant specified that he had inserted his finger into her vagina one time, that he had rubbed her naked body on his naked body one time, resulting in his orgasm, and that he had rubbed her against him on another occasion when they were both fully clothed. The defendant denied any penile penetration. The DVD showed that the second interrogation ended approximately thirty minutes after it began and that defendant was again left alone in the room for approximately two minutes before he was instructed to follow someone (off camera) out of the room and the recording ended.', 'At the conclusion of the testimony, the trial justice rendered a bench decision denying defendant’s motion to suppress, finding that the state had proven by clear and convincing evidence that defendant’s confession was not the product of coercion and that defendant had “knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his constitutional rights.” The trial justice noted that, based on Det. Hammann’s testimony, defendant was in the first interrogation room for approximately thirty minutes and that defendant had signed the second rights form forty minutes after he had signed the first form. The trial justice also specifically commented on Det. Hammann’s demeanor during the hearing:', '“The Court did notice before it was even pointed out by opposing', 'counsel that there was a difference in dynamics timing responses', '-4-', '[sic] when [Det.] Hammann would respond to [the prosecutor],', '* * * as opposed to what was happening with [defendant’s', 'attorney], all of which leaves me wondering exactly what went on', 'in interview room number one.”', 'The trial justice also commented on the DVD of the second interrogation. He found that the detectives were visible at times, “albeit from the back sides * * *, so the [c]ourt was unable to see any facial expression.” The trial justice described defendant’s demeanor as “relaxed. He actually sat and twirled his thumbs, one around the other. He did not appear to be overly sensitive. He did not appear to be emotionally upset * * *. He did not appear apprehensive at that time * * *.” The trial justice also noted that he had not observed defendant’s hand shaking as defendant was reading the rights form, that defendant had not rubbed his head or “appear[ed] as if he had been wounded,” and that defendant “became increasingly more comfortable as the interview progressed.”', 'During the jury trial, Dets. Hammann and LaBreche as well as defendant testified about the interrogations. Detective LaBreche testified that defendant had not invoked any of the rights that were listed on the rights form. Detective LaBreche also testified that Det. Hammann asked most of the questions during the interrogations. Detective LaBreche admitted that, during the first interrogation, defendant had initially denied the allegations several times and that defendant had stated several times that he was innocent. Detective LaBreche further testified that, at one point, defendant was not paying attention to a question that Det. LaBreche had asked, so the detective “banged on the table in front of [him] to get [defendant’s] attention to look at [him].” Detective LaBreche admitted that, when he banged on the table, he “raised [his] voice, trying to get [defendant’s] attention because [defendant] wasn’t focusing on what [Det. LaBreche] was asking him.” Detective LaBreche denied making any threats or promises of leniency with respect to immigration proceedings, and he denied slapping defendant on the head or swearing at', '-5- him. Detective LaBreche testified that he could not recall whether he or Det. Hammann had accused defendant of lying. Detective LaBreche also stated that defendant’s calm demeanor was the same in the second interrogation as in the first.', 'When Det. Hammann testified at trial regarding Det. LaBreche’s behavior during the first interrogation, he stated that he', '“believe[d] at one time [he] might have been looking through [his]', 'notes [and Det. LaBreche] might have, [he] wouldn’t say raised his', 'voice, [but Det. LaBreche] might have elevated his voice a little bit', 'to get * * * [defendant’s] attention * * *. [Detective LaBreche]', 'might have banged on the end of the table to get his attention.” Detective Hammann admitted that he had accused defendant of lying when defendant initially denied the allegations against him. According to Det. Hammann, “it [was] possible” that Det. LaBreche had used profanity when speaking to defendant but Det. Hammann denied that Det. LaBreche had slapped defendant on the head. Detective Hammann also denied making any deportation-related threats during the first interrogation.', 'When defendant took the stand during the trial, he testified that he was thirty-eight years old and that he came to the United States from The Gambia in West Africa in 2005 on a student visa to pursue studies in business administration and engineering management. The defendant had attended a three-year technical college for electrical engineering in West Africa, and he had left his wife and young daughter there to pursue his studies abroad. With respect to his arrest, defendant testified that he had initially assumed that the detectives were immigration officials because his student visa had expired and he was waiting to hear about the application for permanent residency that he had filed prior to the expiration of his student visa. The defendant also testified that, during his arrest, he was kicked and pushed on his way to the police car and', '-6- that Det. Hammann had said ‘“[h]ow about f[’]ing deporting you to Gambia?’ and ‘[y]ou’re f[’]ing going to get killed.’”', 'With respect to the charges filed against him, defendant testified that he had never had any sexual contact with the complainant. He testified that, during the first interrogation, he was told that he was lying when he denied the complainant’s allegations against him. He asserted that he was slapped on the head twice, once after he commented that the complainant was lying and once after he agreed to take a lie-detector test. He further testified that the detectives had threatened to call immigration officials, and that he would be deported and killed, and that they had also promised not to call the immigration officials if he admitted to molesting the complainant. The defendant also testified that he had falsely confessed to the sexual encounters with the complainant because he was scared of being deported and he wanted to seem cooperative. Because he had been assaulted and threatened by the detectives, he thought that anything he told them would be deemed “involuntary” and “void” by the court once the court was made aware of the assault and threats. The defendant asserted that he had taken cues from what the detectives had said when they accused him of rape and had used these cues to provide the false details in his confession. The defendant further testified that, during the second interrogation, he was feeling both nervous and relieved because he had decided to tell the court what had happened during the first interrogation. 4 The defendant acknowledged that he had not invoked any of the rights that he read and waived on the rights forms.', 'On May 13, 2010, after an eight-day jury trial, the jury returned guilty verdicts on two of the eight counts of first-degree child molestation that had been charged in the indictment. The defendant filed a motion for a new trial, which the trial justice denied.', 'The trial justice 4', 'The DVD of the second interrogation had been played in open court earlier in the trial, during Det. LaBreche’s testimony.', '-7- subsequently sentenced defendant to thirty years’ incarceration with twenty years to serve and ten years suspended, with probation.', 'In defendant’s first appeal from his conviction, he argued that the trial justice had made three errors: (1) denying the motion to suppress the statements defendant had made to the police during his post-arrest interrogation, (2) not allowing defendant to inquire into a false accusation by the complainant against her mother regarding physical abuse, and (3) denying defendant’s motion for new trial. In Bojang I, this Court affirmed the trial justice’s evidentiary ruling and his denial of the motion for a new trial; but, as previously stated, we remanded the case to the Superior Court for additional factfinding and credibility determinations regarding the first interrogation and the voluntariness of defendant’s confession.', 'On remand, the trial justice held a hearing in which he rendered additional findings and conclusions from the bench. He noted that the attorneys had not sought to enter any additional evidence and that they had agreed that he could make the additional findings of fact and credibility determinations based on his review of the transcripts and the notes that he had taken during the trial. He also noted that he had reviewed 671 transcript pages of suppression-hearing and trial testimony from Dets. Hammann and LaBreche as well as from defendant. After reviewing these testimonies, the trial justice found that defendant’s version of events during the first interrogation was “at odds” with the DVD of the second interrogation. The trial justice also noted that defendant became “more and more relaxed and more and more engaged as the interview progresse[d].” The trial justice found that defendant’s allegations of “assaults, threats, and fear” were not credible because defendant was “somewhat inconsistent.” The trial justice further found that Det. Hammann, notwithstanding his resistance during the suppression-hearing testimony to defense counsel’s questions, had unequivocally denied that Det. LaBreche had', '-8- struck defendant. The trial justice concluded that Det. LaBreche had not assaulted defendant, that the detective’s raised voice and banging on the table had not affected the voluntariness of defendant’s statement, and that defendant’s confession was “voluntary and not the result of assault, threats, or coercion.” The trial justice entered an order denying defendant’s motion to suppress his confession, from which defendant timely appealed.', 'Additional facts will be provided as we discuss the issue raised on appeal.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“Both the Rhode Island and the United States Constitutions bar the use of a defendant’s involuntary statements in a criminal trial.” State v.

(quoting Perez, 882 A.2d at 588).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice erred by admitting his confession into evidence because his confession was coerced in violation of his due process rights pursuant to the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and article 1, section 10 of the Rhode Island Constitution.', 'The defendant contends that the trial justice’s credibility determinations were clearly erroneous because Det. Hammann was not a credible witness and defendant’s testimony regarding the first interrogation should not have been discredited. The defendant also contends that the trial justice “overlooked and misconceived critical evidence” that the detectives had threatened and assaulted defendant.', 'The defendant argues that his confession was involuntary because, “[w]hen viewing the ‘totality of the circumstances,’ it is apparent that [his] will was overborne by a combination of actual violence, threats of violence, deportation, and harsh punishment if he were not to confess.” The defendant asserts that he is entitled to a new trial because, without evidence of physical trauma or eyewitnesses to the molestation, the only other evidence of guilt in the trial court’s record was the complainant’s testimony; thus, the admission of his confession was not a harmless error.', 'We begin our analysis with a careful review of the record to determine whether the trial justice’s findings of fact and determinations of credibility are clearly erroneous. “A finding is clearly erroneous when, although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the basis', '- 10 - of the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.” Bido, 941 A.2d at 835-36 (quoting Perez, 882 A.2d at 588). The trial justice noted his concern with Det. Hammann’s apparent resistance to answering questions throughout the record, commenting on several occasions about Det. Hammann’s evasive demeanor and testimony during the suppression hearing. During the hearing on remand—and after reviewing the voluminous transcripts in this case—the trial justice noted that, during the suppression hearing, Det. Hammann “resist[ed] answering yes or no to certain questions * * * a lot.” The trial justice also noted on remand that there were two redirect and two re-cross examinations during the suppression hearing, and that “[e]ach time there was a cross, [Det.] Hammann would become more disengaged * * *.”', 'During the suppression hearing itself, the trial justice acknowledged an “exceptional cross-examination” despite Det. Hammann “resisting on every question,” and he assured defense counsel that he was absorbing “the dynamics of what [wa]s going on.” The trial justice also made a comment in the midst of trial—outside of the presence of the jury—regarding Det. Hammann’s testimony during the suppression hearing.', 'After defendant had moved for a mistrial upon hearing that Det. Hammann would not be available to testify during the trial, the trial justice stated:', '“Before I hear from the [s]tate, let’s make the record clear this', 'morning on what the [c]ourt recalls, notwithstanding what the', 'transcript indicates from the suppression hearing. The [c]ourt', 'remembers, without extensively reviewing my own notes, it took', '[Det.] Hammann, especially in day number two of the suppression', 'hearing, it took him several seconds, at least, to acknowledge what', 'was possible. And, the [c]ourt remembers him thinking on the', 'stand, and there was clearly a dynamic that was related to that,', 'between the pause, [Det.] Hammann sometimes would look', 'straight ahead, he would sometimes look up * * *. At one point', 'the pauses became so pronounced, the record would show that', '[Det.] Hammann was actually excused from the courtroom, where', '- 11 -', 'we could speak about what exactly was going on, notwithstanding', 'what the transcript would show in this particular case.” 5 After wading through all the testimony regarding the interrogations and his own notes, and despite all of his expressions of reservations regarding Det. Hammann’s demeanor and testimony, the trial justice concluded on remand that defendant had not been assaulted because Det. Hammann had consistently denied that Det. LaBreche had ever struck defendant. The trial justice also concluded that Det. Hammann’s resistance to some of defense counsel’s questions had not “undermine[d] [his] credibility regarding denials as to specific assaults and threats.”', 'The trial justice also found that, when defendant testified at trial, he was “confrontational, * * * not shy or reserved * * *,” and that his testimony regarding the first interrogation was “at odds” with his demeanor reflected in the second interrogation, such that “defendant’s allegations with regard to assaults, threats and fear * * * [were] not credible because he’s somewhat inconsistent * * *.” In addition, the trial justice found that Det. LaBreche’s raised voice and banging on the table “did not affect” the voluntariness of defendant’s statements made during the second interrogation.', 'After carefully scrutinizing the record, it is our opinion that the trial justice’s findings of fact regarding the voluntariness of defendant’s confession were not clearly erroneous.', 'On remand, the trial justice had to consider divergent accounts of the events that had transpired during the first interrogation in order to render factual findings and credibility determinations. The trial justice clearly parsed through the record as well as his own recorded observations from the hearing and trial to conclude that (1) despite Det. Hammann’s hesitant behavior on the witness stand, he had consistently denied any physical assault on defendant and (2) defendant’s 5', 'The trial justice reserved his ruling on defendant’s motion for a mistrial, and then Det. Hammann did testify the following week, which rendered defendant’s motion moot.', '- 12 - account of the events in the first interrogation room was not credible. Clearly the trial justice was troubled, as were we, by Det. Hammann’s evasive responses at the suppression hearing. The trial justice’s initial failure to make adequate factual findings and credibility assessments left us unable—during defendant’s first appeal—to review the factual predicates of his finding that defendant’s statement had been freely and voluntarily given. On remand, however, the trial justice has supplied the insight that cannot be derived from reading a cold transcript, but rather is only possible through the firsthand observation of a witness’s demeanor during the course of a trial. With respect to Det. Hammann’s testimony, the trial justice observed a difference between how this witness responded to questions on direct and redirect examination and how he responded on cross- and recross-examination.', 'The trial justice characterized the cross- examination as “above vigorous” and “exceptional,” noting that “the detective began to fence with the cross-examiner” and “resist[ed] answering yes or no to certain questions.”', 'He ultimately concluded that this resistance did not “undermine [Det.] Hammann’s credibility regarding denials as to specific assaults and threats.” This conclusion, together with his finding that “defendant’s testimony was not credible in this regard,” are just the sort of evidentiary determinations for which we afford a trial justice abundant discretion. We rely on a trial justice’s assessment of the credibility of the witnesses because, as we have often acknowledged, a trial justice is in the best position to assess the credibility of the witnesses. See Bido, 941 A.2d at 836. After reviewing the recorded portion of defendant’s confession and considering Det. LaBreche’s denial that defendant was physically assaulted, we are not “left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.” Id. at 835-36 (quoting Perez, 882 A.2d at 588). 6 6', 'We note, however, that the remand would undoubtedly have not been necessary if defendant’s', '- 13 -', 'Since we have accepted the trial justice’s findings of historical fact, we must now apply these facts and review de novo whether defendant’s confession was voluntary. See Mlyniec, 15 A.3d at 994. “A defendant’s statement is voluntary when it is the product of his free and rational choice.” Bido, 941 A.2d at 836 (quoting Humphrey, 715 A.2d at 1274).', '“A statement is involuntary if it is extracted from the defendant by coercion or improper inducement, including threats, violence, or any undue influence that overcomes the free will of the defendant.” Id. (quoting Humphrey, 715 A.2d at 1274). “In deciding whether a statement is voluntary, this Court considers ‘the totality of the circumstances surrounding the challenged statement.’” Id. (quoting State v. Ramsey, 844 A.2d 715, 720 (R.I. 2004)). “The factors this Court may consider are the background, experience and conduct of the accused, as well as the level of a suspect’s educational attainments.” Id. (quoting Ramsey, 844 A.2d at 720).', 'After carefully reviewing the record, including the taped interrogation, we agree with the trial justice that defendant’s confession was voluntary. The defendant testified that he had been in the United States since 2005, had studied electrical engineering at a college in West Africa and that he had traveled to the United States to pursue studies in engineering management. The defendant read and signed a form describing his Miranda rights on two occasions in a one-hour period. Based on the evidence admitted during the suppression hearing and at trial, the first interrogation was twenty to thirty minutes in duration, and the total interrogation time was less than ninety minutes in duration. We accept the trial justice’s findings that defendant was not assaulted during the first interrogation and that defendant’s statement was not the result of threats or coercion. See Ramsey, 844 A.2d at 718, 720 (holding that a defendant’s confession was voluntarily made when there was no evidence that the defendant was intimidated by the entire interrogation had been recorded.', '- 14 - detectives, who had admitted to yelling at the defendant during the interrogation and calling him a “f’ing liar”).', 'In addition, the record is replete with references to the defendant’s demeanor throughout his arrest and interrogations as “calm.” For example, Det. Hammann referred to the defendant’s calm demeanor several times during his testimony at the suppression hearing and at trial. Detective LaBreche described the defendant as “calm” on at least three occasions during his testimony at trial, and the trial justice noted that the defendant was relaxed during the second interrogation. As this Court has previously observed, a defendant’s “calm, detached” voice during a confession can be an indication that the confession was not the product of impermissibly coercive tactics. Humphrey, 715 A.2d at 1273, 1274.

38,: v. : East Greenwich Fire District et al. :,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. In 2002 the Board of Fire Commissioners (board) of the East Greenwich Fire District (fire district) adopted a resolution imposing development impact fees on developers who applied for a building permit to develop land within the Town of East Greenwich. Five corporate plaintiffs sued the fire district and the Town of East Greenwich by and through its finance director, Kathleen Raposa, (collectively, defendants) alleging that the defendants’ imposition and collection of development impact fees pursuant to this resolution violated Rhode Island’s Development Impact Fee Act (RIDIFA), G.L. 1956 chapter 22.4 of title 45. A hearing justice of the Superior Court resolved the case on cross-motions for summary judgment and entered judgment in favor of the defendants on all of the counts in the plaintiffs’ complaint. The plaintiffs appeal from the final judgment, arguing that the defendants did not have the authority to impose development impact fees. In the alternative, they contend that, even if the defendants did have the requisite authority to impose the fees, the process by which they imposed the fees was deficient and the fees were therefore not properly collected. For the reasons set forth below, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'None of the material facts of this case are in dispute. In 1998 the General Assembly amended P.L. 1902, ch. 1039 and created the fire district, a municipal corporation that included all of the land within the Town of East Greenwich. P.L. 1998, ch. 26, § 1. The fire district had been initially established by a charter passed by the General Assembly in 1797. The charter was amended several times prior to its revocation in 2013, when the Town of East Greenwich acquired the fire district’s property, assets, and personnel. P.L. 2013, ch. 47, §§ 1, 2. In 2002 the fire district adopted a resolution imposing development impact fees, defining an “[i]mpact fee” as “the charge imposed upon new development to fund all or a portion of the public facility’s capital improvements affected by the new development from which it is collected[.]” Resolution Sec. 2(g). The resolution declared that an impact fee would be imposed pursuant to the schedule set forth therein on “[a]ny developer who * * * [sought] to develop land within the Town of East Greenwich * * *.” Id. Sec. 3(a). Within eight years of collection, the impact fees were to be “expended or encumbered for the construction of public facilities’ capital improvements * * *.” Id. Sec. 5(a). The resolution defined “[p]ublic facilities” to include fire stations, fire facilities, fire apparatus, communications equipment, and “[o]ther facilities consistent with the Fire District’s capital improvement program.” Id. Sec. 2(i)(v).', 'In 2009 and 2010, one of the plaintiffs, Amalfi Homes, LLC, paid impact fees in the amount of $3,432 on three lots of property.', 'In 2011 another plaintiff, Link Commercial Properties, LLC, paid $75,017.72 in impact fees. A third plaintiff, Coastway Community Bank, paid $7,502.95 in 2012.', 'A fourth plaintiff, 5750 Post Road Medical Offices, LLC, paid', '-2- $34,483.56 to the fire district in 2013. 1 Subsequently, plaintiffs filed a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment pursuant to the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 30 of title 9, declaring that the imposition of the impact fees by the fire district was beyond its power and also violated the mandates of RIDIFA (counts 1 and 4). The plaintiffs also alleged that the manner in which the 2002 resolution was adopted violated their due process rights pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 because the fire district had not provided plaintiffs with either notice or an opportunity to be heard prior to adopting the impact fees by means of a resolution (count 2). The plaintiffs also sought to enjoin the Town of East Greenwich from enforcing the impact fee schedule or spending any of the funds collected from the imposition of the impact fees (count 3); they further sought a refund of all of the impact fees paid to the fire district pursuant to the impact fee schedule (count 5).', 'In November 2013 defendants filed a motion for summary judgment seeking judgment as a matter of law in their favor on the basis of their contention that the fire district’s charter expressly granted the fire district “all the rights, powers and privileges conferred upon towns by the provisions of title 45 of the Rhode Island [G]eneral [L]aws * * *,” P.L. 1998, ch. 26, § 10, and that, because title 45 included RIDIFA, the fire district clearly had the authority to impose and collect development impact fees.', 'The defendants also contended that the resolution complied with the mandates of RIDIFA because the requisite assessments were completed and subsequently adopted by the fire district’s board at a regularly scheduled open meeting. The plaintiffs objected to defendants’ motion for summary judgment and also filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. The plaintiffs contended that the fire district had not had the authority to adopt a schedule of development impact fees and that, even if the fire district had the genuine 1', 'The fifth plaintiff, East Greenwich Acquisitions, LLC, had not paid the impact fees assessed and charged to them.', '-3- statutory authority to impose these fees, it had not complied with the requirements set forth in RIDIFA because the fees were imposed through the adoption of a resolution and not with the requisite formalities of an ordinance.', 'The hearing justice heard oral arguments on the cross-motions and thereafter issued a written decision granting defendants’ motion and denying plaintiffs’ motion. The hearing justice examined the language in RIDIFA and the fire district’s charter, and found that RIDIFA’s enabling authority to impose development impact fees extended beyond cities and towns within Rhode Island to include fire districts, and he also found that the charter specifically empowered the fire district to impose impact fees. The hearing justice further found that the resolution was effectively an ordinance and that there was “no genuine issue of material fact that the Fire District complied with RIDIFA’s mandate that the fees be adopted by ordinance.” The plaintiffs subsequently appealed from the judgment entered in favor of defendants. 2', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“This Court examines an appeal from cross-motions for summary judgment de novo.” 3 Medical Malpractice Joint Underwriting Association of Rhode Island v.

Before this Court, plaintiffs reiterate their argument that the fire district is neither a city, a town, nor a governmental entity that was authorized by RIDIFA to enact an ordinance imposing the impact fees. The plaintiffs also contend that the section within the fire district’s charter providing that the fire district “shall be entitled to all the rights, powers and privileges conferred upon towns by the provisions of title 45,” P.L. 1998, ch. 26, § 10, should not be interpreted literally because to do so would mean that the fire district had the authority to do everything that a city or town is enabled to do pursuant to all of the chapters within title 45. In addition, plaintiffs assert that, because various sections within titles 44 and 45 of the General Laws specifically empower fire districts to act and RIDIFA does not specifically mention fire districts, the General Assembly did not intend to empower fire districts to impose development impact fees. The defendants respond', '-6- that the language in the fire district’s charter and RIDIFA is clear and unambiguous that the fire district had the authority to impose development impact fees. The defendants assert that the fire district is unquestionably a unit of local government as defined by RIDIFA and that the stated intent of RIDIFA in combination with § 10 of P.L. 1998, ch. 26, of the fire district’s charter make it clear that the fire district had been authorized to impose the fees.', 'The General Assembly enacted RIDIFA in 2000 to address the need “for the planning and financing of public facilities to serve new growth and development in the cities and towns * * *.” Section 45-22.4-2(a); see also North End Realty, LLC v. Mattos, 25 A.3d 527, 535 (R.I. 2011). The RIDIFA authorizes cities and towns to impose and collect development “impact fees for all new development within their jurisdictional limits,” § 45-22.4-2(b), so that “those who benefit[ted] from new growth and development pa[id] a proportionate fair share of the cost of new and/or upgraded public facilities * * *.” Section 45-22.4-2(c)(3). Fire protection facilities are among the public facilities specifically identified by RIDIFA. Section 45-22.4-3(7)(vi). The RIDIFA expressly “[e]mpower[s] governmental entities which are authorized to adopt ordinances to impose development impact fees,” § 45-22.4-2(c)(5), with “[g]overnmental entity” defined as “a unit of local government.” Section 45-22.4-3(4). The RIDIFA prescribes several rules regarding how governmental entities are to calculate, collect, and spend impact fees, as well as refund unexpended impact fees. Section 45-22.4-4(c),(d); §§ 45-22.4-5, 45-22.4-6. The most important section of RIDIFA for the appeal before us instructs that impact fees are to be adopted by ordinance, by an “affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the total membership of the governing body in attendance at the meeting, in the manner prescribed by law.” Section 45-22.4-8.', '-7-', 'While this Court has not previously had the occasion to construe RIDIFA, we have highlighted it as an example of the General Assembly’s providing explicit enabling authority for local government to implement development impact fees to “offset the impact of new growth and development in a particular municipality by requiring that those who benefit from such development pay their fair share of the cost of any new public facilities needed as a result of the development * * *.” North End Realty, LLC, 25 A.3d at 534-35, 537 (holding that the Town of East Greenwich had imposed a fee-in-lieu of constructing affordable housing units without the required specific statutory authorization by the Legislature). As plaintiffs argue before us, however, while RIDIFA specifically mentions cities, towns, and units of local government, it neither specifically recognizes fire districts as a unit of local government nor authorizes fire districts to impose development impacts fees. See chapter 22.4 of title 45.', 'The defendants argue that P.L. 1998, ch. 26, § 10 provides the necessary nexus to enable the fire district to impose and collect impact fees. Section 10 purports to cloak the fire district with “all the rights, powers and privileges conferred upon towns by the provisions of title 45 of the Rhode Island General Laws.” P.L. 1998, ch. 26, § 10. Section 10, however, is a slender reed indeed to support such a weighty assertion. Arguably, § 10 could be read to authorize the fire district to enact zoning and subdivision ordinances, to adopt a comprehensive plan, and even to establish retirement plans for police and firefighters. We do not mean to suggest that, in enacting P.L. 1998, ch. 26, the General Assembly intended any of these results; clearly it did not. It does point out, however, the obvious premise that the language of § 10 must be tempered with a good deal of common sense.', 'For the purposes of resolving this appeal, however, we need not examine or decide the precise parameters of the fire district’s authority.', 'The fire district no longer exists as an', '-8- independent corporate municipal entity; rather, its charter has been revoked and it is now a subordinate agency of the Town of East Greenwich. See P.L. 2013, ch. 47, § 1. Moreover, even if the fire district had been authorized to impose and collect impact fees, we are convinced that it so improperly executed such authority that its imposition of impact fees cannot stand.', 'The plaintiffs argue that the resolution adopted by the fire district was invalid because it did not comply with either RIDIFA’s mandate that the fees be imposed through an ordinance or the town’s notice and public-hearing requirements for the enactment of ordinances.', 'The plaintiffs assert that there was no evidence that the fire district published either a notice regarding the proposed resolution or an advertisement for a public hearing to discuss the proposed resolution, and that the fire district adopted the resolution in the confines of a regular meeting of its board and then imposed the fees on the public. The plaintiffs contend that they requested copies of notices or public-hearing announcements during discovery as well as through a public-information request, but that defendants did not produce anything other than the minutes from the November 2002 meeting at which the board adopted the resolution. The defendants respond that the resolution adopted by the board was a valid legislative act by the fire district— completed in compliance with the rules set forth in RIDIFA—and that plaintiffs’ argument is based completely on semantics.', 'In our opinion, the fact that the fire district adopted the schedule of impact fees by a “resolution” during a regular monthly meeting of its board is more than a mere issue of semantics. The RIDIFA clearly requires that development impact fees be imposed through an ordinance, see § 45-22.4-8, 4 and the terms are not merely interchangeable. A leading treatise on municipal corporations asserts that each term clearly carries specific connotations with it: 4', 'General Laws 1956 § 45-22.4-8 states, in its entirety, that:', '-9-', '“A resolution ordinarily denotes something less solemn or formal[]', 'than, or not rising to the dignity[] of, an ordinance. The term', '‘ordinance’ means something more than a mere verbal motion or', 'resolution, adopted, subsequently reduced to writing, and entered', 'on the minutes and made a part of the record of the acting body.[]', '“A resolution in effect encompasses all actions of the', 'municipal body other than ordinances.[] * * * [I]t may be observed', 'that a resolution deals with matters of a special or temporary', 'character; an ordinance prescribes some permanent rule of conduct', 'or government, to continue in force until the ordinance is', 'repealed.[] An ordinance is distinctively a legislative act;[] a', 'resolution, generally speaking, is simply an expression of opinion', 'or mind or policy concerning some particular item of business', 'coming within the legislative body’s official cognizance,[]', 'ordinarily ministerial in character[] and relating to the', 'administrative business of the municipality.[]” 5 Eugene', 'McQuillin, The Law of Municipal Corporations § 15:2 at 97-105', '(Rev.3d ed. 2013). When this Court was called upon to review a town’s pension fund that had been established through a resolution instead of by an ordinance, we focused on the substance of the legislative action by the municipal body as being more important than the form in which the town council had memorialized the legislative action. O’Connell v. Bruce, 710 A.2d 674, 675 (R.I. 1998) (“[b]ecause the challenged resolution was in substance and effect the functional equivalent of an ordinance and because the General Assembly did not purport to prevent the council from creating the fund via a resolution, we conclude that the town’s municipal pension fund was legally established”). As in O’Connell, 710 A.2d at 679, we acknowledge that:', '“Generally, whether what is done by a municipal legislative', 'body is an ordinance or a resolution depends not on what the action', 'is called but on the reality. * * * [W]here a resolution is in', 'substance and effect an ordinance or permanent regulation, the', 'name given to it is immaterial.[] If it is passed with all the', '“Impact fees shall be adopted by ordinance and the adoption of an', 'impact fee ordinance or amendment to that ordinance shall be by', 'affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the total membership', 'of the governing body in attendance at the meeting, in the manner', 'prescribed by law.”', '- 10 -', 'formalities of an ordinance it thereby becomes a legislative act,', 'and it is not important whether it be called ordinance or', 'resolution.[]” McQuillin, § 15:2 at 110. In the case under review, however, the resolution imposing development impact fees was not “passed with all the formalities of an ordinance.” See id.', 'In our opinion, § 45-22.4-8 clearly and unambiguously indicates that the General Assembly intended that impact fees be adopted by an ordinance, using all of the procedural formalities set forth in the laws of the local governing body. The charter for the Town of East Greenwich (town charter) provides specific formalities that the town council must follow in order to enact, amend, or repeal an ordinance. See Town of East Greenwich Town Charter, Article IX, §§ C-68 – C-72. The town charter provides that “[e]very proposed ordinance and amendment to ordinances shall be filed with the Town Clerk not later than four business days prior to the date of the meeting at which it is to be introduced.” Id. at § C-68. The town charter also provides that:', '“Every hearing on an ordinance or amendment to an ordinance,', 'other than an emergency ordinance, shall be advertised by', 'publication by the Town Clerk of a notice in a newspaper of', 'general circulation within the Town once at least five days before', 'the date of hearing.

When the fire district adopted the resolution, it purported to be acting pursuant to the authority granted to it in RIDIFA. While § 10 of P.L. 1998, ch. 26, stated that the fire district “shall be entitled to all of the rights, powers and privileges conferred upon towns by the provisions of title 45,” § 10 also mandated that, “upon availing itself of said rights, powers and privileges [it] shall be subject to all the duties and liabilities contained in said title 45.” If the fire district had the authority to impose the impact fees pursuant to RIDIFA and § 10 of its charter—as previously noted, a question we need not answer—then it also had the duty to impose the new regulations concerning impact fees using the same formal procedures that bound the town council.', 'In the case under review, the defendants failed to present any evidence that the proposed resolution had been advertised by publication before it was enacted.', 'Notwithstanding the plaintiffs’ request for copies of any notices or advertisements regarding the proposed language of the resolution, the defendants produced only the minutes from the November 2002 meeting in which the resolution was initially adopted. There is no genuine issue of material fact, therefore, that the resolution was adopted without the formalities that are required for the enactment of an ordinance. While the board adopted the resolution at a regular monthly meeting, in our opinion it was required to publish the proposed regulation and hold a public hearing before it could vote to adopt the proposed schedule of development impact fees. The defendants, therefore, were not entitled to summary judgment on the plaintiffs’ complaint; rather, the plaintiffs were entitled to summary judgment on their claims against the defendants.', '- 12 -', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'Based on the foregoing analysis, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court.

39,State : v. : Robert Beaudoin.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The defendant, Robert Beaudoin, seeks review of a judgment finding him to be in violation of the terms of his probation and sentencing him to serve two years of a previously imposed suspended sentence. On appeal, the defendant argues that the hearing justice acted arbitrarily and capriciously in finding that he violated the terms of his probation. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1 1', 'Although we affirm the judgment adjudging defendant to have violated the conditions of his probation, we are mindful that in a companion case we have quashed the sentence of imprisonment imposed as a result of the violation. Following the violation hearing, defendant was tried before a jury on the two charges underlying the violation: second-degree sexual assault and larceny (amended from second-degree robbery). After the jury found him not guilty of both counts, he filed a motion to terminate imprisonment under the provisions of G.L. 1956 § 12-19- 18. See State v. Beaudoin, No. 2013-254-C.A. (R.I., filed April 26, 2016).', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'The defendant pled nolo contendere in June 2009 to one count of felony assault. He was sentenced to fifteen years with five months to serve at the Adult Correctional Institutions and the balance suspended with probation. On May 14, 2012, the state filed a notice of probation violation pursuant to Rule 32(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, alleging that defendant had failed to comply with a specific condition of his probation by “fail[ing] to keep the peace and be of good behavior.” The violation report also stated that “[s]aid violation of probation is not contingent upon any specific criminal offense.” Nevertheless, the report referred to various attached documents from the Woonsocket Police Department containing allegations of second-degree sexual assault and second-degree robbery. A three-day violation hearing was held in Superior Court in July 2012, during which eight witnesses testified about certain events occurring on or about May 9, 2012. As the issues raised by defendant on appeal concern the factual findings and credibility assessments of the hearing justice, we set forth the testimony of the various witnesses in some detail.', 'The complaining witness, Matthew—who was twenty-three years old at the time of the hearing—testified that he had suffered a traumatic brain injury when he was twelve years old that left him disabled. He stated that, as a result of his injury, he has problems with short-term memory and he goes to the Resource for Human Development (RHD) for treatment. However, Matthew described his long-term memory as “excellent.” He added that he takes “Depakote” and “Abilify” to “stabilize [his] mood, and * * * stabilize all the functions up in [his] head, making sure everything is in an equilibrium balance.”', '-2-', 'Matthew testified that on May 9, 2012, he rode his bicycle to his then girlfriend, Hiedi Caron’s, apartment in Woonsocket. He testified that normally he stored his bicycle in Caron’s third-floor apartment, but when he arrived on May 9, defendant, a friend of Caron’s family, offered to help him bring his bicycle to defendant’s second-floor apartment. After helping Matthew store his bicycle in the apartment, Matthew testified, defendant asked him “if he could show [him] something.”', 'Matthew testified that he then followed defendant into the bedroom of defendant’s second-floor apartment because he knew and trusted defendant. Matthew stated that he heard the door “click” and realized that defendant had locked it. In the bedroom, defendant showed Matthew a “scorpion sword,” which Matthew described as “about two-and-a-half feet long” with a “beautiful handle on it.” Matthew testified that defendant also showed him a “22 caliber hand gun” and a “[n]ine-and-a-half inch[] long, ten inch[] long” dagger.', 'Matthew stated that defendant approached his right side and defendant’s “hand then went into [Matthew’s] pants.” Matthew explained that he was wearing “loose-fitted shorts for biking” and that defendant “grabbed [his] scrotum very tightly and said, ‘[n]ice eyes.’ And then after that [defendant] asked [Matthew] if [he] had $50.”', 'Matthew added that he was in “excruciating pain.” Matthew further testified that when defendant asked for $50, “[i]t was more of a demand for it.” He described: “It was, like, he said, ‘I know you have $50. Give it to me or else,’ because he had a gun and one sword and dagger in his room.” Matthew gave defendant a $50 bill and then left the apartment to go upstairs to see Caron.', 'Matthew testified that he had not told Caron about the incident while he was at her house. However, after Matthew returned home that night, he spoke with Caron on the phone and, at that point, he told Caron what had happened. Matthew explained that he had not reported this', '-3- incident to his parents because they were both in the hospital on that day. Matthew stated that, the following day, he disclosed the incident to a staff member at the RHD, and then reported it to the Woonsocket Police Department. 2', 'Subsequently, at the hearing, the state presented Det. Jamie Paone of the Woonsocket Police Department, who assisted with interviewing defendant. Detective Paone testified that defendant told her that he had sold a sword to Matthew and that Matthew’s parents were upset over the sale and wanted the money returned to Matthew. Detective Paone further stated that, during the interrogation, defendant denied owning a gun or a dagger and denied touching Matthew.', 'Matthew’s mother, Doree, also testified at the hearing. She explained that, on May 9, 2012, she had been admitted to the hospital for a week because of a fever. She learned about the incident involving her son and defendant several days later, when her son and daughter went to visit her at the hospital. Doree added that she never discussed the sale of a sword or any kind of weapon with her son that day and “never” had a conversation with Caron’s mother about the sale of a sword. Furthermore, she testified that, although she had given Matthew greater financial independence, she has also “monitored” his bank account “on and off.”', 'On cross-examination, Doree confirmed that her son took “Abilify,” “Depakote,” “blood pressure medicine[,] and multivitamins.”', 'She also stated that RHD has worked well to rehabilitate Matthew’s memory and that his ability to observe, recollect, and recount went from a “six,” on a scale of one to ten, to now a “ten” on “some days.” Doree added that Matthew “can recollect every event.” 2', 'Although Matthew testified that he had reported the incident to the Burrillville Police Department, the police report was clearly prepared by the Woonsocket Police Department.', '-4-', 'The defense presented Pauline Glaude, defendant’s mother-in-law. Glaude testified that she lived with defendant and her daughter. She stated that she met Matthew on May 9, 2012, when she saw him go into defendant’s bedroom and close the door.', 'Glaude, however, acknowledged that she did not hear or see anything that had happened in the bedroom. Glaude testified that she had seen a sword on the bedroom wall, but had never seen any guns or daggers in defendant’s bedroom. Nancy Beaudoin, defendant’s wife, also testified that she had not known defendant to own a gun or dagger. However, she acknowledged that defendant had a sword, and she confirmed that she wanted him to get rid of it.', 'Officer Gregory Klocek of the Woonsocket Police Department testified that he interviewed Matthew on May 10 and typed Matthew’s witness statement.', 'Relying on the statement that he prepared on that same day, Officer Klocek confirmed that Matthew had reported that defendant showed him weapons, including brass knuckles, and that Matthew said defendant had “felt [his] penis and testicles.”', 'Caron also testified at the hearing and stated that she was no longer dating Matthew. She then recounted the night of May 9, 2012. Caron testified that, after Matthew left her apartment, she “skyped” with him from about 11:30 p.m. to 1:30 a.m. When she asked Matthew why he looked upset, she recalled that Matthew told her that he had fought with “either both of his parents or one of his parents about money” because he had loaned defendant $50. She added that Matthew then confided in her that defendant had “groped” him, explaining that defendant “had cupped him outside his pants and gripped him a little bit.” Caron testified that she told Matthew to report the incident to his parents or the police and that Matthew asked her to talk to her mother. Caron said that she agreed to see if she could get Matthew’s money returned, but she testified that “it wasn’t [her] place to tell her [mother] what happened between them.”', '-5-', 'The defendant was the final witness to testify at the hearing. He stated that he lived with his wife and mother-in-law, and then proceeded to describe the events of May 9, 2012. The defendant testified that he had met Matthew “about three times” through Caron, and he was checking the mail on May 9 when he recognized Matthew arrive on his bicycle. The defendant helped Matthew with his bicycle and asked Matthew if he knew anyone who wanted to buy a sword “like in Scorpion King * * * the movie.” The defendant stated that Matthew was excited about the sword and wanted to see it. The defendant testified that Matthew gave him $20 for the sword, but left the sword in the bedroom because defendant had not wanted Matthew to take it home on his bicycle. The following day, defendant went upstairs to see Caron’s mother and learned that Matthew’s parents were upset that Matthew “lent” defendant money. The defendant recalled that Caron’s mother complained that she had been dealing with Matthew’s parents until 1:30 a.m. The defendant testified that he had “assume[d]” Matthew’s parents were upset about the sale of the sword.', 'The defendant testified that on May 11, 2012—two days after the incident—detectives went to his house and asked him to go to the police station because they were following up on a complaint. The defendant testified that he had not known why he was brought to the police station, and he denied owning a gun, knives, or daggers.', 'At the hearing, defendant acknowledged that he was on probation for assault with a dangerous weapon, and he emphatically denied touching Matthew.', 'After the close of the hearing, the hearing justice issued a bench decision stating that he is “obliged to look at the evidence to see whether * * * [he is] reasonably satisfied that the defendant did not keep the peace and/or was not of good behavior in order to find him and adjudge him to be a violator of the terms and conditions of a suspended probationary sentence.”', '-6- The hearing justice continued to explain that he was “not obliged to decide whether * * * [defendant] put his hands underneath the clothing of [Matthew] and groped his genitals.” The hearing justice described Matthew as “limited” because of the head injury he suffered at a young age, and consequently, found “a child-like innocence to [him],” and “a genuine flavor to his statements.” The hearing justice specified that Matthew’s statements were “without guile or pretense.” He acknowledged that there were “inconsistencies with respect to what [Matthew] testified to at [the hearing] and what he said on earlier occasions,” but that “given [Matthew’s] limited mental circumstances, [the hearing justice] [found] that these inconsistencies [were] explainable and normal.” The hearing justice found it was “plain” that defendant recognized Matthew “was an easy target,” and he found defendant’s explanation for taking Matthew into his bedroom—to sell him a sword—“nonsensical.” The hearing justice stated that he did not know what went on in the apartment, but added “[w]hatever went on there wasn’t good.” The hearing justice concluded that he was “convinced, if nothing else, [defendant] took [Matthew’s] money. Whether he groped [Matthew] under his clothes, over his clothes, [he] wouldn’t be surprised if that did happen; but [he was] convinced [defendant] took [Matthew’s] money.”', 'Ultimately, the hearing justice found “absolutely no persuasive reason why [Matthew] would invent an entire parable” or “knowingly and purposefully lie” to cause defendant “to be adjudged a violator.” He further found that defendant had not kept the peace or been of good behavior, thus violating the conditions of his probation. As a result, the hearing justice ordered defendant to serve two years of his suspended sentence, with the balance suspended with', '-7- probation.

In other words, the hearing justice need only be reasonably satisfied “that an alleged violator has failed to keep the peace or be of good behavior.” Barrientos, 88 A.3d at 1134.', 'In this case, the hearing justice recognized Matthew’s injury and the rehabilitative measures he had taken, but the hearing justice stated that “it [was] clear to any casual observer who would have walked into th[e] courtroom and listened to no more than five minutes of his', '-9- testimony that this young man is limited.” The hearing justice described Matthew as having a “child-like innocence” and being “rather simple,” and he added that Matthew’s statements were “without guile or pretense.” The hearing justice acknowledged the “inconsistencies with respect to what [Matthew] testified to at [the hearing] and what he said on earlier occasions,” but the hearing justice found the inconsistencies “explainable” given Matthew’s injury.', 'Conversely, the hearing justice found defendant’s testimony that he wanted to sell the sword to Matthew “nonsensical.” Ultimately, the hearing justice stated that he did not know whether a sexual assault occurred, but he was “convinced” that defendant “took [Matthew’s] money.” The hearing justice was “persuaded * * * defendant did not keep the peace and was not of good behavior.”', 'The defendant’s arguments center on the hearing justice’s credibility determinations. However, a review of the record reveals that the hearing justice thoroughly assessed the evidence presented before concluding that he was reasonably satisfied that the defendant had failed to keep the peace and remain of good behavior. See Prout, 116 A.3d at 204. We have repeatedly stated that “we will not second-guess supportable credibility assessments of a hearing justice in a probation-revocation hearing * * *.” Id. (quoting Raso, 80 A.3d at 44). The hearing justice observed from his unique perspective on the bench the witnesses’ words and their demeanors. Accordingly, we are convinced that the hearing justice acted neither arbitrarily nor capriciously.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of conviction in so far as it adjudges the defendant to have violated the conditions of his probation.

General Laws 1956 § 12-19-18 was amended by the General Assembly in 2010, see P.L. 2010, ch. 311, § 1, to provide that a sentence of imprisonment after a finding of probation violation shall be quashed, and the imprisonment terminated, in certain circumstances occurring after a judgment of probation violation is entered by a justice of the Superior Court.

For the following reasons, we conclude that this case entails prospective, not retroactive, application of the statute. Therefore, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court.2', 'Facts and Travel', 'In 2009, defendant—no stranger to the criminal justice system—entered a plea of nolo contendere to one count of felony assault, which involved stabbing his victim in the throat with a razor blade or knife; he was sentenced to fifteen years at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI), five months to serve and the remaining 175 months suspended with probation.3 The', '“(3) After consideration by an assistant or special assistant', 'designated by the attorney general, a ‘no information’ based upon', 'a lack of probable cause is returned;', '“(4) A motion to dismiss is made and granted pursuant to', 'the Rhode Island [G]eneral [L]aws [1956] § 12-12-1.7 and/or', 'Superior Court Rule of Criminal Procedure 9.1; or', '“(5) The charge fails to proceed in District or Superior', 'Court under circumstances where the state is indicating a lack of', 'probable cause, or circumstances where the state or its agents', 'believe there is doubt about the culpability of the accused.” 2', 'We acknowledge the amicus curiae brief submitted by the Rhode Island Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. 3', 'The record is silent as to the reasons why this brutal stabbing warranted only five months of imprisonment when a fifteen-year prison sentence was imposed.', '-2- General Assembly amended § 12-19-18 and added subsections (b) and (c)4 on June 25, 2010. See P.L. 2010, ch. 311, § 1. Thereafter, in May 2012, defendant was arrested and charged with one count of second-degree sexual assault, see G.L. 1956 § 11-37-4, and one count of robbery, see G.L. 1956 § 11-39-1. Additionally, the state filed, pursuant to Rule 32(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, a notice of probation violation in this case based on the conduct giving rise to these charges. After an evidentiary hearing, a trial justice declared defendant to be a probation violator, removed two years of the suspended sentence, and ordered defendant to serve two years at the ACI.5 The defendant then proceeded to a jury trial in Superior Court on the underlying charges6 and was acquitted on both counts on April 26, 2013.', 'On the heels of his acquittal, defendant filed a motion to terminate his imprisonment under § 12-19-18(b). Pursuant to an administrative order of the presiding justice of the Superior Court, all motions seeking relief under § 12-19-18(b) were assigned to a single Superior Court trial justice. Accordingly, before hearing this case, the trial justice decided a motion in a case with a similar chronology to that of defendant’s case: where the judgment of conviction was entered before the effective date of § 12-19-18(b), and the defendant was adjudicated to be a probation violator after the 2010 amendment. See State v. Ford, No. P2/05-83A, 2012 WL 4', 'Section 12-19-18(c) provides that:', '“This section shall apply to all individuals sentenced to imprisonment for', 'violation of a suspended sentence or probationary period by reason of the alleged', 'commission of a felony or misdemeanor and shall not alter the ability of the court', 'to revoke a suspended sentence or probationary period for an allegation of', 'conduct that does not rise to the level of criminal conduct.” 5', 'A description of the conduct giving rise to the probation violation hearing is unnecessary to this appeal but is set forth in our opinion affirming the trial justice’s adjudication of probation violation.

Id. at *2. In light of this identity of issues, the trial justice permitted defendant to incorporate the arguments made by the defendant in Ford. Similarly, the state in this case incorporated the arguments it made in Ford. The state’s arguments in Ford rested on its position that the word “sentence” in § 12-19-18(b) refers to the imposition of the suspended sentence—which, in Ford’s case, predated the 2010 amendment— and not the execution of that previously imposed sentence following the adjudication of probation violation. From this premise, the state argued that § 12-19-18(b) was not available to Ford because the statute could not be applied retroactively. Finally, the state contended that “the retroactive application of * * * § 12-19-18(b) would not pass constitutional muster” under separation-of-powers principles because it would vacate or modify a prior court judgment—the original judgment of conviction that included the suspended sentence—that was entered before the 2010 amendment. (Emphasis added.) In making this constitutional argument in Ford, the state did not argue that, if this case involved prospective, and not retroactive, application of the statute, § 12-19-18(b) was unconstitutional.', 'In this case, although the trial justice determined that defendant met the prerequisites for relief under § 12-19-18(b),7 he nonetheless denied defendant’s motion for two reasons. First, the trial justice concluded that application of § 12-19-18(b) in this case required retroactive application of the 2010 amendment, and he was of the opinion that the statute could not be applied retroactively. To support this conclusion, he expressly adopted his reasoning in Ford, in 7', 'At oral argument before this Court, the state conceded that, because it failed to argue below that defendant had not satisfied the requirements of the statute, it was not challenging this determination of the trial justice. Accordingly, we express no opinion on this issue.', '-4- which the trial justice, relying on this Court’s opinion in State v. Garnetto, 75 R.I. 86, 63 A.2d 777 (1949), determined that, because a probation violation hearing is but “a continuation of the original prosecution,” a defendant who was given a suspended sentence before the 2010 amendment could not be granted relief under the statute without retroactive application. Ford, 2012 WL 3638916, at *8 (quoting State v. Gautier, 871 A.2d 347, 359 (R.I. 2005)).', 'The trial justice went on to conclude that, notwithstanding the infirmity of retroactive application, defendant’s motion also should be denied for an independent reason: that, even if applied prospectively, § 12-19-18(b) constituted an unconstitutional exercise of judicial power by the General Assembly. As he did for his conclusion on the retroactivity issue, the trial justice expressly incorporated the constitutional analysis that he laid out in Ford. The trial justice reasoned that § 12-19-18(b) improperly disturbed the judgment embodying the probation violation adjudication and the incarcerative term ordered as a result of that adjudication. He declared:', '“[T]he General Assembly is without authority to affect a', 'judgment--such as a finding of violation along with the particular', 'imposition of sentence--that was previously entered by this [c]ourt.', 'Such action usurps the authority of [the Superior] Court and its', 'ability to determine if a defendant has failed to keep the peace [and', 'be] of good behavior.', '“* * * [T]he General Assembly exceeds its power when it', 'passes legislation that affects, or otherwise encroaches on', 'judgments and verdicts entered by the [c]ourts.', '“* * * Any attempt by the Legislature to disturb a finding', 'of a violation and the resultant imposition of a sentence by the', 'hearing justice is an encroachment on or an attempt to subvert the', 'power of the judiciary.” Ford, 2012 WL 3638916, at *14', '(emphases added).

The trial justice also found it problematic that “the statute provides for no discretion to the members of [the Superior] Court; instead, the statute mandates that the sentence must be quashed.” Ford, 2012 WL 3638916, at *15. In addition, the trial justice concluded that § 12-19-18(b) unconstitutionally “attempts to impose a rule of decision on a judgment of the Superior Court in the instant case at a time subsequent to the entry of that judgment.” Ford, 2012 WL 3638916, at *15.

Leviton Manufacturing Co., 716 A.2d 730, 735 (R.I. 1998) (Leviton). Once properly identified, the triggering event guides the analysis.', 'See id.

Fleet Bank of Massachusetts, N.A., 989 F.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir. 1993))). On the one hand, in a case where the triggering event occurs before the statute’s enactment, the statute applies retroactively. See id. (“Only when the adverse effects of the statute are activated by events that occurred before the effective date of its enactment will the statute’s reach be declared retrospective.” (emphasis added)). On the other, when a statute’s application is triggered by an event that occurs after the statute’s effective date, it operates prospectively, not retroactively. See McAndrews, 989 F.2d at 16 (“[A] statute’s application is usually deemed prospective when it implicates conduct occurring on or after the effective date. * * * Even when the later-occurring circumstance depends upon the existence of a prior fact, that interdependence, without more, will not transform an otherwise prospective application into a retroactive one.”).', 'In the last analysis, the retroactivity inquiry “demands a commonsense, functional judgment,” Martin v. Hadix, 527 U.S. 343, 357 (1999), and “[t]he key lies in how the law interacts with the facts,” McAndrews, 989 F.2d at 16.', '-7-', 'In this case, we turn to the statutory text to divine the triggering events. Section 12-19- 18(b) provides:', '“Whenever any person, after an evidentiary hearing, has been', 'sentenced to imprisonment for violation of a suspended sentence or', 'probationary period by reason of the alleged commission of a', 'felony or misdemeanor said sentence of imprisonment shall, on a', 'motion made to the court on behalf of the person so sentenced, be', 'quashed, and imprisonment shall be terminated when any of the', 'following occur on the charge which was specifically alleged to', 'have constituted the violation:', '“(1) After trial [the] person is found ‘not guilty’ or a', 'motion for judgment of acquittal or to dismiss is made and granted', 'pursuant to Superior or District Court Rule of Criminal Procedure', '29;', '“(2) After hearing evidence, a ‘no true bill’ is returned by', 'the grand jury;', '“(3) After consideration by an assistant or special assistant', 'designated by the attorney general, a ‘no information’ based upon', 'a lack of probable cause is returned;', '“(4) A motion to dismiss is made and granted pursuant to', 'the Rhode Island [G]eneral [L]aws [1956] § 12-12-1.7 and/or', 'Superior Court Rule of Criminal Procedure 9.1; or', '“(5) The charge fails to proceed in District or Superior', 'Court under circumstances where the state is indicating a lack of', 'probable cause, or circumstances where the state or its agents', 'believe there is doubt about the culpability of the accused.” Our close examination of the statute convinces us that there are three events that trigger application of § 12-19-18(b): (1) there is an evidentiary hearing; (2) a defendant is declared a violator and is “sentenced to imprisonment for violation of a suspended sentence or probationary', '-8- period,” id.; and (3) the subsequent occurrence of one of the five events specified in subsection (b)(1)-(5) of § 12-19-18.9', 'In this case, there is no dispute that two of the triggering events—namely, an evidentiary hearing and an acquittal on the underlying charges, see § 12-19-18(b)(1)—occurred well after the 2010 amendment. With respect to the other triggering event, the state argued before the trial justice that the term “sentence” in § 12-19-18(b) refers to the imposition of the suspended sentence, which, in this case, occurred in 2009. We reject this interpretation of the statute.', 'Under the plain language of § 12-19-18(b), the phrase “sentence of imprisonment” clearly refers to imprisonment that results from the adjudication of probation violation and the execution of some or all of the previously imposed suspended sentence. See § 12-19-18(b) (“Whenever any person, after an evidentiary hearing, has been sentenced to imprisonment for violation of a suspended sentence or probationary period * * * said sentence of imprisonment shall * * * be quashed, and imprisonment shall be terminated * * *.” (emphasis added)). In this case, defendant’s motion seeks to terminate the imprisonment that was ordered as a result of the 2012 probation violation adjudication. The judgment reflecting that adjudication and the trial 9', 'The statute imposes certain requirements that need not concern us in this case. For instance, the violation adjudication must be based on “the alleged commission of a felony or misdemeanor,” and the subsequent occurrence of one of the five events specified in subsection (b)(1)-(5) of § 12-19-18 must relate to “the charge which was specifically alleged to have constituted the violation.” Section 12-19-18(b). We note that the statute does not apply to other misconduct by the probationer “that does not rise to the level of criminal conduct.” Section 12- 19-18(c). Therefore, violation proceedings that arise from noncriminal conduct that transgresses the terms and conditions of probation—such as refusal to comply with special conditions of probation; failure to comply with sex-offender registration laws, where the violation adjudication is not predicated on a knowing failure to register, see G.L. 1956 § 11-37.1-10 (providing for criminal penalties for those who “knowingly” violate the registration laws); or failing to notify authorities after witnessing a murder, see State v. Gautier, 774 A.2d 882, 887 (R.I. 2001)—do not come within § 12-19-18(b). In this case, the state does not challenge, nor do we consider, whether the additional requirements of § 12-19-18(b) have been met. See supra note 7.', '-9- justice’s decision to execute a portion of the previously imposed suspended sentence is the “sentence of imprisonment” envisioned by § 12-19-18(b).', 'Therefore, because all three triggering events occurred after the 2010 amendment to § 12- 19-18, the statute operates prospectively, not retroactively, in this case.10 The state, in arguing to the contrary, insists that this case involves retroactive application of § 12-19-18(b) because the statute “would alter the legal consequences of the probationary sentence that the Superior Court imposed in 2009.” We disagree with this assertion. Application of § 12-19-18(b) in this case in no way modifies or amends the judgment that imposed the suspended sentence: The length of the suspended sentence remains unaffected; the terms and conditions of defendant’s probation have similarly not changed; and, contrary to the state’s assertion, the 2010 amendment had no effect on the burden of proof employed at a probation violation hearing.11', 'Undeterred, the state presses on, arguing that this case involves retroactive application of § 12-19-18(b) because it would “undermine the intent of the trial justice who imposed” the suspended sentence.', 'Once again, we are unpersuaded.', '“A statute does not operate ‘retrospectively’ merely because it is applied in a case arising from conduct antedating the statute’s enactment * * * or upsets expectations based in prior law.” Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 269 10', 'In his reply brief, defendant appears to assert that the only event that needs to postdate the 2010 amendment for § 12-19-18(b) to apply prospectively is the occurrence of one of the events set forth in subsection (b)(1)-(5) of § 12-19-18. Because we need not do so to decide this case, we express no opinion on the issue of whether a case where the defendant is determined to be a probation violator and imprisoned pursuant to the execution of a previously imposed sentence before the 2010 amendment, but an event delineated in subsection (b)(1)-(5) of § 12-19-18 occurs after the amendment, involves retroactive or prospective application of § 12-19-18(b). 11', 'At most, § 12-19-18(b), by providing for termination of imprisonment, mandates the modification of the incarcerative component of the judgment of conviction and commitment that was entered after defendant was adjudicated to be a probation violator. However, because that judgment was entered in 2012, after the effective date of the 2010 amendment to § 12-19-18, this circumstance does not present a retroactivity problem in this case.', '- 10 - (emphasis added); cf. McAndrews, 989 F.2d at 16 (“[A] statute may modify the legal effect of a present status or alter a preexisting relationship without running up against the retroactivity hurdle.”). Our decision in Leviton is instructive on this point. In that case, Leviton purchased workers’ compensation insurance policies from American Mutual Life Insurance Company (American Mutual), at a time when the Rhode Island Insurers’ Insolvency Fund Act (Insolvency Act) provided that “the fund shall have no cause of action against the insured of the insolvent insurer for any sums it has paid out.” Leviton, 716 A.2d at 732 (quoting P.L. 1970, ch. 166); see also id. at 735. In 1988, one year before American Mutual became insolvent and two years after Leviton’s insurance contract expired, the General Assembly repealed the Insolvency Act in its entirety, see P.L. 1988, ch. 407, § 1, and replaced it with a new Insolvency Act, see P.L. 1988, ch. 407, § 2, that included a provision that “permitted the fund to recover all amounts paid on behalf of an insured with a net worth in excess of $50 million.” Leviton, 716 A.2d at 732. In 1993, the fund sued Leviton for a full refund of payments the fund made to Leviton, which had a net worth in excess of $50 million. Id. at 733. Leviton demurred, asserting, among other things, that the application of the refund provision of the new Insolvency Act to its situation constituted retroactive application. See id.', 'This Court rejected Leviton’s retroactivity argument. See Leviton, 716 A.2d at 735-36. While acknowledging that Leviton purchased the policies at a time when state law barred the fund from seeking recovery and that “Leviton may have relied upon the then-existing law at the inception of the contracts,” the Court explained that:', '“[N]one of these factors triggered the fund’s right of recovery.', 'Rather the triggering factor was the subsequent insolvency of', 'American Mutual in March 1989, an event that occurred well after', 'the enactment of [the refund provision of the new Insolvency Act].', '* * * [M]erely entering into contracts for insurance to discharge', 'one’s potential workers’ compensation liability does not in itself', '- 11 -', 'implicate the recoupment provision of the act.

See also id. at 736 (“[I]n the context of a retrospective analysis, the date the insurer becomes insolvent is the controlling criterion and not the date that gives rise to the claim.”). The Court thus concluded that the new Insolvency Act was not operating retroactively. See id.', 'Similarly, in this case, the mere fact that application of § 12-19-18(b) might frustrate the intent of the trial justice who imposed defendant’s suspended sentence in 2009 does not mean that the statute is being applied retroactively in this case. As was true for the purchase of the policies in Leviton, the trial justice’s imposition of the suspended sentence in 2009 is not the event that triggers application of § 12-19-18(b).12', 'For these reasons, we hold that this case involves prospective, not retroactive, application of § 12-19-18(b). See Desjarlais, 731 A.2d at 718; Leviton, 716 A.2d at 735.', 'Constitutionality', 'There is one loose end. The trial justice did not base his denial of defendant’s motion solely on the ground that this case involved retroactive application of § 12-19-18(b); instead, he concluded that, even disregarding the retroactivity issue, § 12-19-18(b) constituted an unconstitutional legislative exercise of judicial power because the statute purports to affect a judgment of the Superior Court embodying the adjudication of probation violation and the 12', 'Additionally, we pause to note that our decision in State v. Garnetto, 75 R.I. 86, 63 A.2d 777 (1949)—on which the trial justice relied for his conclusion that a case such as this one involved retroactive application of § 12-19-18(b), see State v. Ford, No. P2/05-83A, 2012 WL 3638916, at *8 (R.I. Super. Ct. Aug. 20, 2012)—is distinguishable. To be sure, in Garnetto, 75 R.I. at 87-88, 63 A.2d at 777-78, as in this case, the suspended sentence was imposed prior to the effective date of the relevant statute. Critically, however, the defendant in Garnetto was, unlike in this case, adjudged to be a violator—and the trial justice executed his suspended sentence and incarcerated him—prior to the statute’s enactment. See id. at 87-88, 63 A.2d at 778. Therefore, unlike in this case, the triggering events in Garnetto predated the statute.', '- 12 - execution of all or a portion of a previously imposed suspended sentence. See Ford, 2012 WL 3638916, at *14, *19. Because this conclusion is not tethered to a case involving retroactive application, it effectively declares the statute unconstitutional in all cases involving prospective application: where, as here, the three triggering events occur after the 2010 amendment to § 12 19-18. The trial justice reached this conclusion sua sponte.', 'After scouring the record, we are convinced that the question of whether § 12-19-18(b) is constitutional when applied prospectively was not raised by either party below. To be sure, the state argued that, if applied retroactively, the statute would be unconstitutional under separation- of-powers principles. That argument, however, was founded on the premise that the application of the statute modified the 2009 judgment embodying the imposition of the suspended sentence—a premise that we reject.', 'The state did not argue that, if this case involved prospective, and not retroactive, application of the statute, § 12-19-18(b) was unconstitutional. In sum, the state argued that this case involved a retroactive application of § 12-19-18(b) and, for that reason, resulted in an unconstitutional application of the statute, but the trial justice not only agreed that this case concerned a retroactive application of the statute, but went on to conclude that the statute was unconstitutional even when applied prospectively.', 'The distinction between the state’s argument below and the trial justice’s decision may be subtle, but it is of critical importance to the responsibility of this Court. When, as in this case, this Court faces a fork in the road, with one turn that will require it to slog through the thicket of a constitutional issue and the other offering a journey through more hospitable terrain, we routinely elect to take the path of least resistance.

Nuzzo, appeals to the Supreme Court from a judgment of the Providence County Superior Court. At issue in the jury-waived trial were a number of disputes between the parties that arose after the defendant corporation, Nuzzo Campion Stone Enterprises, Inc. (NCS), was purchased by its present owner.1 After a two-day trial and after addressing various post-trial submissions, the trial justice held that Mr. Nuzzo was not entitled to commissions on orders that had been placed prior to his termination, but not actually paid for by customers of NCS until after his termination. The trial justice further held that NCS, as counterclaimant, was due $16,898.20 for both “work in progress” and warranty work pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement signed by the parties.2 Mr. Nuzzo contends that the trial justice erred in determining that he was not entitled to commissions for orders that had been placed, but not actually paid for, prior to his termination. He also contends that the trial 1', 'James F.

This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties’ arguments (both written and oral), we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this appeal may be decided at this time.', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On May 23, 2008, plaintiff filed a complaint, in which he alleged that he was owed a total of $133,816 in unpaid commissions and severance pay in accordance with his understanding of the Sales Commission Agreement signed by the parties.3 He contended that he had earned sales commissions in the amount of $119,663. He acknowledged that NCS had already paid him $15,761 in commissions, leaving $103,901 in allegedly unpaid sales commissions. In addition, he alleged that NCS owed him a severance payment of twenty-five percent of the commissions allegedly due to him, which would amount to $29,915.4', 'In its answer, the defendant corporation denied that it owed Mr. Nuzzo the sales commissions that he alleged were due to him; and it filed a counterclaim for breach of contract, alleging that plaintiff had failed to indemnify NCS for certain amounts covered by the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement. 3', 'The relevant sections of the document known as the “Sales Commission Agreement” are quoted, infra. 4', 'The plaintiff focuses his contentions on appeal on the commissions that he claims he is due.

The Sales Commission Agreement was admitted as a full exhibit at trial. The relevant portions of that document (contained in sections 6(a) and 6(b)) read as follows:', '“6. Compensation.

Mr. Nuzzo and David Corriveault, the present owner of NCS, testified at trial.', 'A', 'The Trial Court’s Decision', 'On May 29, 2013, the trial justice issued a written decision addressing the commissions due to Mr. Nuzzo, the severance pay due to Mr. Nuzzo, and NCS’s counterclaim against Mr. Nuzzo. Thereafter, the defendant corporation filed a motion contending that the discussion of the counterclaim in the trial justice’s decision erroneously focused on the Sales Commission Agreement rather than the Asset Purchase Agreement. After conducting a hearing with respect to that contention, the trial justice vacated his initial decision in its entirety. Subsequently, after entertaining further argument, he issued a revised decision on January 2, 2014, in which he considered the counterclaim issues in light of the Asset Purchase Agreement and not the Sales Commission Agreement. (The revised decision is essentially identical to the initial decision in all other respects.) In the discussion that follows, we shall limit our attention to the revised decision.', 'In the revised decision, the trial justice first addressed plaintiff’s contentions concerning commissions and severance. With respect to plaintiff’s claim for commissions that he alleged were due to him from sales placed, but not actually paid for by the defendant corporation’s customers, prior to plaintiff’s termination, the trial justice concluded that plaintiff had not 5', 'The “closing date” that is mentioned in the language from the Asset Purchase Agreement quoted in the text refers to the sale of the defendant corporation that, according to the Statement of Agreed Facts, took place in October of 2006.', '-4- established that he was owed any commissions from sales falling into that category. The trial justice found the Sales Commission Agreement to be “clear on its face and unambiguous,” and he read it as providing (in his words) that a “commission is only due and earned when the customer pays for the order.” (Emphasis in original.) The trial justice further noted that, pursuant to that Agreement, “no commission is due when a sale is worked up, and a customer is tended to, or even when an order is placed.” As such, the trial justice ruled that Mr. Nuzzo was not entitled to the commissions that he was seeking.6 As to the severance pay that plaintiff claimed was due to him (calculated as a percentage of commissions on orders paid for after his termination), the trial justice determined that plaintiff had not “submitted sufficient proof * * * to substantiate the amount of severance he claims.”7', 'Additionally, the trial justice concluded that the defendant corporation was due $16,898.20 in reimbursement costs on its counterclaim pursuant to Article IV, Section 4.5(c) of the Asset Purchase Agreement (a completely different document from the one relied upon in the initial decision), which provides that plaintiff shall indemnify the defendant corporation for the costs incurred in connection with “work in progress”8 and warranty work. The trial justice noted that “there was no real dispute that Mr. Nuzzo executed this indemnification and that the indemnification is enforceable.”', 'Additionally, the trial justice stated that the defendant 6', 'As for commissions that were not barred by the Sales Commission Agreement, the trial justice stated that plaintiff was due $28,691.02—an amount which the defendant corporation does not contest on appeal. 7', 'The trial justice noted that plaintiff was owed $7,176.76 in unpaid severance (being a percentage of the $28,691.02 in commissions undisputedly due to plaintiff)—an amount which the defendant corporation once again does not contest on appeal. 8', 'According to the Statement of Agreed Facts, it is undisputed that the terms “work in progress” and “jobs in process” refer to jobs that were underway, but had not yet been completed at the time of the sale of NCS.', '-5- corporation “performed work and satisfied customer orders, obligations and commitments for ongoing work and for warranty work” and that invoices reflecting those charges were then provided to Mr. Nuzzo. The trial justice further stated that a balance of $16,898.20 remained due to the defendant corporation from plaintiff pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement. The trial justice noted that Mr. Corriveault, the present owner of the defendant corporation, testified concerning the services performed and submitted invoices for the “work in progress,” which Mr. Nuzzo never established were inaccurate. Furthermore, the trial justice determined that the testimony of Mr. Corriveault as well as the submitted invoices, were “clear, rational, reliable, comprehensive and highly persuasive.” Accordingly, the trial justice determined that “indemnification [was] reasonable and appropriate.”', 'Judgment entered on July 2, 2014 in accordance with the trial justice’s decision.', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'The plaintiff contends: (1) that the trial justice erred in determining that plaintiff was not entitled to commissions on those orders which had been placed prior to his termination, but for which payment was actually made after the date of his termination; and (2) that the trial justice made “fundamental mistakes regarding the contract and damages” relating to the counterclaim and that plaintiff was consequently entitled to a new trial.', 'III', 'Standard of Review', 'It is well established that this Court applies a “deferential standard of review with respect to the factual findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury in a civil case.” B.S.

The trial justice determined that sections 6(a) and 6(b) of the Sales Commission Agreement, which pertain to commissions, are unambiguous; accordingly, he applied those sections to the agreed- upon facts. The trial justice noted that the two just-referenced sections of the Sales Commission Agreement both explicitly provide that the commissions at issue “shall be deemed to have been earned when an order is paid in full * * *.” (Emphasis added.) The trial justice concluded that that language clearly provides that “[a] commission is only due and earned when the customer pays for the order.” (Emphasis in original.) After a thorough review of the record and the pertinent agreement, we perceive no error in the trial justice’s reasoning in that regard.', 'In connection with his claimed entitlement to commissions, plaintiff further contends that he falls within the general rule laid out in Oken v. National Chain Co., 424 A.2d 234, 235 (R.I. 1981). In Oken, the Court stated: “As a general rule, a person employed on a commission basis to solicit sales orders earns or is entitled to his commission when the order is accepted by his employer.” Id.

The plaintiff has not directed our attention with specificity to any error that he alleges has been committed in that regard or otherwise. See Town Houses at Bonnet Shores Condominium Association v.

42,In re Kyle A.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The respondent, Kyle A., appeals from an adjudication that he was delinquent for engaging in second-degree child molestation sexual assault in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-37-8.3. The respondent also was ordered to register as a sex offender. On appeal, the respondent argues that there was insufficient evidence to support the trial justice’s finding that he touched the complainant for the purposes of sexual gratification and, therefore, it was error to adjudicate him to be delinquent. The matter came before us on December 9, 2015, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised by this appeal should not summarily be decided. After considering the parties’ oral and written arguments and examining the record, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that this case can be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons given below, we affirm the adjudication of the Family Court.', '-1-', '1', 'Facts and Travel', 'During a one-day bench trial that took place before a justice of the Family Court on June 3, 2014, the state presented four witnesses: the complainant, respondent’s sister Molly, East Providence Det. Mark Jones, and Dr. Christine Barron. 1 The respondent did not testify, nor did he call any witnesses.', 'Erin, the complainant, testified that during the summer of 2013 she, then thirteen, was a friend of Molly and her fifteen-year-old brother, Kyle. Erin said that when she stayed overnight at Molly’s house, the pair would sleep either in Molly’s bedroom or on the living room couch. One day that summer, Erin and Molly spent the day swimming in Molly’s backyard pool. Around eleven or twelve that night, Erin and Molly relaxed on the living room couch while watching television before falling asleep a couple of hours later. However, Erin’s sleep was interrupted twice that night by Kyle, who had been with the girls in the living room earlier that evening. While she was sleeping on the couch, Erin awoke and noticed that Kyle was standing over her and that he was “reaching.” Although he did not touch her, Erin was troubled by respondent’s presence and told him to go away because she was trying to sleep. Erin said that, after respondent left, she pulled the blanket back over her and went back to sleep.', 'Erin awoke about two hours later to find Kyle standing over her again. This time, however, she felt Kyle’s hand under her blanket and shorts, touching her vagina over her underwear. Erin pushed Kyle away and told him to get away from her. According to Erin, Molly also woke up at this point and told her brother to stop bothering them. Kyle left the room and did not return for the rest of the night. Erin did not tell Molly what had happened until the 1', 'We use pseudonyms to protect the privacy of complainant and respondent’s sister.', '-2- following day. According to Erin, Molly said that she would tell her mother about the incident. Erin, however, said that she did not report the incident to anyone, including her own mother, because “she didn’t want anyone else to know.”', 'Nevertheless, the incident came to light at the end of that summer.', 'On July 31, Dr. Christine Barron met with Molly at the Aubin Child Protection Center at Hasbro Children’s Hospital. 2 During that meeting, Molly told Dr. Barron about the incident that had occurred between Kyle and Erin. Molly told Dr. Barron that Erin had been sleeping at her house and she awoke to find her brother leaning over Erin, touching her in her genital area. According to Dr. Barron, Molly told her that she actually saw the incident and that Erin had asked her not to tell anyone because she was afraid to disclose what had happened. Doctor Barron reported what Molly had revealed to her to Det. Mark Jones of the East Providence Police Department. The ensuing investigation ultimately led to respondent’s arrest and subsequent finding of delinquency.', 'However, when Molly testified, she was somewhat reticent about the details that she shared earlier with Dr. Barron. According to Molly, respondent did “not really” hang out with her and Erin and he usually slept in his own room when Erin spent the night. She also denied telling Dr. Barron that she had seen her brother touch Erin. Rather, she said that she was merely repeating to Dr. Barron what Erin had told her had occurred.', 'During his closing argument, respondent’s counsel argued that the state had failed to meet its burden of proving that respondent’s touching of Erin was intentional or that it had been done for the purposes of sexual gratification. With respect to the issue of intentional touching, respondent argued that the evidence was insufficient because no one had testified that they had 2', 'The reason for Molly’s meeting with Dr. Barron is not relevant to this appeal.', '-3- seen respondent’s hand touch Erin and that it could have been an accidental touching by Molly, who was sleeping on the same couch. Alternatively, respondent argued that, if a touching had occurred, it was at most innocent or accidental because there was no evidence that respondent rubbed, attempted to penetrate, moved his fingers, or said anything to Erin. The state countered that respondent had planned the touching for about two hours, and, from the totality of the circumstances, the trial justice could infer that respondent intentionally touched Erin for sexual gratification or arousal.', 'In her decision, the trial justice found Erin to be an honest and consistent witness who clearly testified that she was touched intentionally by respondent, and not by Molly accidentally. She also specifically found that Molly did, in fact, witness her brother touch Erin on the night in question. Regarding the elements in § 11-37-8.3 requiring that the “intentional touching” be “for the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification or assault,” the trial justice found that the evidence was sufficient for her to reach that conclusion. Specifically, she stated that respondent was', '“a young man who came in twice for the same thing and', 'succeeded the second time. Oh, yes, I believe that. I', 'believe he was standing over [Erin] the first time and if she', 'hadn’t woken up and said get out of here, go away, a', 'touching might have occurred on that occasion.

It was purposeful.', 'That was his intent. He had a plan. He executed that plan', 'on the second attempt and this Court believes the State has', 'met each and every element of second degree child', '-4-', 'molestation and', 'this', 'Court', 'finds', 'the', 'Respondent', 'delinquent.”', 'At the sentencing hearing, the trial justice indicated that she “had some very serious concerns regarding [respondent’s] behaviors and the actual act for which he was charged and found delinquent” and ordered respondent to register as a sex offender. The trial justice declined respondent’s request to stay execution of registration, finding that “presently * * * he has had a sexual offender evaluation, that he has been found to be a moderate to high risk of behavior and I find that the statute requires registration and he shall register as a sex offender.” The respondent timely appealed to this Court.', '2', 'Standard of Review', 'When reviewing an appeal from an adjudication of delinquency, this Court reviews the record to determine “whether legally competent evidence exists therein to support the findings made by the Family Court trial justice.” In re Malik D., 730 A.2d 1070, 1072 (R.I. 1999). Importantly, the “factual findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury are granted an extremely deferential standard of review.” State v. Gianquitti, 22 A.3d 1161, 1165 (R.I. 2011). For that reason, we will not upset the trial justice’s findings unless respondent establishes that she “overlooked or misconceived material evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.” In re David G., 741 A.2d 863, 865 (R.I. 1999).', '3', 'Analysis', 'The sole issue to be decided is whether legally sufficient evidence existed to support the finding that respondent was delinquent because his actions were motivated by sexual arousal or', '-5- gratification. 3', 'The Family Court justice found that respondent was delinquent because he committed an offense that, if committed by an adult, would constitute second-degree child molestation sexual assault in violation of § 11-37-8.3. Section 11-37-8.3 says that “[a] person is guilty of a second degree child molestation sexual assault if he or she engages in sexual contact with another person fourteen (14) years of age or under.” Section 11-37-1(7) defines “[s]exual contact” as “[t]he intentional touching of the victim’s or accused’s intimate parts, clothed or unclothed, if that intentional touching can be reasonably construed as intended by the accused to be for the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification, or assault.” The respondent argues that the trial justice was clearly wrong because she failed to account for his youth, arguing that this “one- time touch—though misguided—was most likely a product of age-appropriate curiosity.” A curiosity, he argues, that “often revolves around the opposite sex and is distinct from pleasure- seeking gratification.” We do not agree.', 'To support his argument, respondent cites to State v. Brown, 586 A.2d 1085, 1087-89 (R.I. 1991), in which we held that a single incident of a momentary touch of a child’s vagina on the outside of a child’s clothing, where the defendant did not move his hand or fingers and no words were spoken, could not be reasonably construed as having been done for sexual gratification. It is true that both Brown and this case involve a brief, momentary touching where fingers did not move and words were not spoken, but the similarity ends there. Unlike the defendant in Brown, respondent entered the room twice during the middle of the night while Erin slept, and on the second occasion he did not just reach under her blanket—he reached into her shorts so that he could touch her vagina through her underwear. 3', 'On appeal, respondent does not contest the Family Court’s finding that he reached under Erin’s shorts and touched her vagina over her underwear.', '-6-', 'In seeking to mitigate this fact, respondent compares his actions to those of the defendants in State v. Tracy, 816 A.2d 1275 (R.I. 2003) (mem.) and State v. Hammond, 733 A.2d 727 (R.I. 1999) (mem.). In Tracy, 816 A.2d at 1276-77, there was evidence that the adult defendant fondled the ten-year-old victim’s pelvic region under her underwear in a circular motion and squeezed her buttocks. And in Hammond, 733 A.2d at 729, the defendant pulled down his daughter’s pants, pulled up her leg, put his hand between her legs for about five minutes, and then warned her not to tell anyone about the incident, or else she would “really get it if she did tell.” The fact that the conduct in those cases might have been more egregious than the actions of this respondent does nothing to undermine the trial justice’s finding that he touched Erin for the purposes of sexual gratification in violation of § 11-37-8.3.', 'The respondent next directs us to cases in other jurisdictions that illustrate the difficulty of comparing the relative behavior of children and adults. We agree with the respondent that it is not always permissible to “impute the same intent into a child’s action that one could reasonably impute into the actions of an adult” and that determining the intent of sexual gratification in minors must be determined on a case-by-case basis. In re A.J.H., 568 N.E.2d 964, 968 (Ill. App. Ct. 1991). However, the state’s evidence that he entered the room on two occasions and placed his fingers over Erin’s vagina is not in dispute. In In re Matthew K., 823 N.E.2d 252, 253-54, 254 (Ill. App. Ct. 2005), the defendant used the uncontroverted testimony of a child psychiatrist to establish that the defendant’s touching of the victim was “simply a brief, socially inept * * * behavior that occurred.” But, in this case the trial justice, from the evidence brought forth at trial, made a reasonable inference that Kyle touched Erin for his sexual gratification and there is simply no foundation for us to hold that she was clearly wrong when she made her finding.

43,Joseph Lemerise : v. : The Commerce Insurance Company. :,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The plaintiff, Joseph Lemerise, appeals from an order of the Superior Court denying his motion to confirm an arbitration award and granting the motion of the defendant, The Commerce Insurance Company, to modify the award. The plaintiff contends that the trial justice erred when he modified the arbitration award because there was no basis to do so under Rhode Island’s Arbitration Act, codified at G.L. 1956 chapter 3 of title 10. Therefore, the plaintiff argues, the award should have been confirmed. The plaintiff also argues that the trial justice further committed error when he reviewed the arbitrator’s award under a de novo review, because he permitted the defendant to expand the record of the arbitration by introducing new evidence in the trial court, and because he allowed the arbitrator to testify during the hearing on the motion to modify. For the reasons set forth herein, we vacate the order of the Superior Court and direct that the arbitration award be confirmed in its entirety.', '-1-', '1', 'Facts and Travel', 'There is no serious dispute about the underlying facts of this case. In August 2011, plaintiff was a pedestrian in a crosswalk in Newport when he was struck by a vehicle operated by an uninsured motorist. At the time, plaintiff was an insured under his mother’s automobile insurance policy, pursuant to the terms of which he made a claim for uninsured-motorist coverage for his injuries. Apparently there were some negotiations concerning this claim; the parties agreed that the motorist was at fault and that plaintiff suffered an injury to his foot and ankle. However, the parties were unable to reach closure with respect to the extent of plaintiff’s injuries and the amount that he was entitled to be compensated under the policy. After the parties were unsuccessful in resolving plaintiff’s claim by negotiation, plaintiff filed suit in Newport County Superior Court against Commerce.', 'Eventually, the parties entered into a written stipulation to stay the action pending “participation in Arbitration pursuant to the terms of the plaintiff’s [un]insured motorist policy.”', 'The matter was submitted to arbitration before a single arbitrator, who heard testimony and received documents into evidence. In his award, the arbitrator said that “[t]he question for decision is the extent of the injury, and the amount of compensation plaintiff is entitled to because of it.” The arbitrator determined that plaintiff was credible and that he believed his testimony that the injury had continued to affect him. The arbitrator further found that he would be surprised if plaintiff ever completely recovered from the injury to his foot. The arbitrator determined that the fair and reasonable compensation to plaintiff for his injuries was $150,000. He then awarded interest on the award at a rate of 12 percent from the date of the injury, amounting to $47,550, for a total award of $197,550.', '-2-', 'The plaintiff then filed a motion in the Superior Court to confirm the arbitration award, pursuant to § 10-3-11. The defendant promptly objected to plaintiff’s motion to confirm and filed its own motion, pursuant to § 10-3-14, to modify/correct the arbitration award to conform with the insurance policy, which provided uninsured-motorist coverage up to a limit of $100,000. A hearing was held on April 29, 2014 before a justice of the Superior Court. At the hearing, plaintiff argued that the issue presented to the trial justice was identical to that decided in Wheeler v. Encompass Insurance Co., 66 A.3d 477, 483 (R.I. 2013), in which this Court held that it was error to modify an arbitration award to conform to the policy limits when the policy had not been submitted to the panel of arbitrators, because any error by the arbitrators was a mistake of law, and that is not grounds for modifying an arbitration award. He urged the court to confirm the award for the same reasons—that no grounds for modification existed to modify the award.', 'The defendant argued that the parties had stipulated that they would submit the dispute to arbitration in accordance with the terms of the insurance policy, which contained an uninsured- motorist coverage limit up to $100,000 per person. See Appendix. It claimed that the issue presented to the arbitrator was the amount of damages that plaintiff would have been entitled to recover from the tortfeasor, and not the extent of the insurer’s liability. The defendant argued that the court should grant its motion to modify the award to conform to the policy and, further, that the policy should be construed in accordance with the laws of the state of issuance, Massachusetts. It is noteworthy, however, that these arguments were made to the trial justice, even though the arbitrator was never provided with the policy, nor was he asked to apply Massachusetts law.', '-3-', 'The trial justice heard the arguments of each party, and he directed defendant to enter the insurance policy and other documents into evidence. The trial justice then heard the testimony of the arbitrator, who had been subpoenaed by defendant.', 'The following colloquy took place on the record during the arbitrator’s testimony:', '“Q', 'At any time were you ever asked to look at any policies or', 'evaluate how much would be covered under the Commerce policy?', '“A', 'I did not have the policy submitted to me. It was not', 'offered as an exhibit. I was aware of the policy limit because', 'Plaintiff’s memorandum contained it. I decided that my job wasn’t', 'to issue a ruling in relation to policy limits; that it was just to', 'decide damages and calculate interest.', '“Q', 'So your award was simply for the injuries sustained by Mr.', 'Lemerise regardless of the amount of the coverage or any coverage', 'issues; correct?', '“A', 'I didn’t view it – that’s correct, I didn’t view it as my role', 'to determine coverage issues.', 'I wasn’t aware it was a', 'Massachusetts policy. I basically assumed that it was a Rhode', 'Island matter and calculated interest as I understood it to be', 'calculated under Rhode Island law.', '“* * *', '“THE COURT: As far as your issue committed to you, if', 'you want to put it in that context, in that language, you applied', 'Rhode Island law in determining the nature of the injury, the extent', 'of the injury, and the amount of compensation that the insured, Mr.', 'Lemerise, would be entitled to collect from the uninsured tort', 'feasor [sic]?', '“THE WITNESS: Yes. I had no idea that there was a', 'Massachusetts insurance contract here. No choice of law issues', 'were presented, so I assumed it was Rhode Island and I applied', 'Rhode Island law as I understood it.”', 'At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial justice found that the issue before him was different from, and not controlled by, Wheeler, noting that “I can’t ignore it – my job, at the risk of sounding corny, is to do justice between the parties here. I can’t ignore the fact that suit was', '-4- brought against Commerce Insurance Company on the insurance policy.” The trial justice went on to hold that the arbitrator’s award was based upon a determination of “what the injury was and what was the compensation as a consequence of the injury caused by the uninsured motorist.” Furthermore, he said, “I’m not going to allow [plaintiff] to take advantage of some technicality to get more than he bargained for in this case.” The hearing justice then concluded that the record before him was distinguishable from Wheeler because it had been supplemented by the testimony of the arbitrator and the exhibits introduced by defendant. Therefore, the trial justice granted defendant’s motion to modify the arbitration award and entered an order for plaintiff in the amount of $100,000.', 'The plaintiff timely appealed to this Court.', '2', 'Standard of Review', '“Public policy favors the finality of arbitration awards, and such awards enjoy a presumption of validity.” State Department of Corrections v.

The plaintiff argues that the trial justice disregarded both the narrow statutory grounds for modifying an arbitration award and this Court’s holding in Wheeler, 66 A.3d at 483-84. The plaintiff urges that, when viewed in the proper statutory context, none of the grounds for modification delineated in § 10-3-14 apply to the arbitrator’s award, and, therefore, pursuant to the provisions of § 10-3-11, the trial justice should have confirmed the award.', 'The defendant counters that the trial justice correctly modified the award because the arbitrator was not asked to decide coverage issues or to consider prejudgment interest and, therefore, his award of a sum that exceeded the policy limit was based upon a matter not submitted to him. In its argument, defendant relies heavily on our decision in Allstate Insurance Co. v. Pogorilich, 605 A.2d 1318 (R.I. 1992), for the proposition that, under Rhode Island law, an arbitrator may not exceed the policy limits when he is asked only to determine the amount of recovery from the tortfeasor and not to determine coverage issues. The defendant also advances a parallel argument that because the contract at issue here was a Massachusetts insurance policy, an application of Massachusetts law was required. 1', 'In deciding this case, we do not write on a blank slate. On several occasions we have addressed the issue of whether an arbitration award that purports to award damages in excess of the policy limit of an injured party’s uninsured motorist coverage should be modified. In Sentry Insurance Co. v. Grenga, 556 A.2d 998 (R.I. 1989) (Sentry), we held that arbitrators have the authority to award prejudgment interest in excess of policy limits and “that arbitrators should add prejudgment interest to their awards unless the parties specifically provide otherwise by 1', 'The defendant contends that Massachusetts law does not allow prejudgment interest on arbitration awards.', '-7- agreement.” Id. at 1000 (quoting Paola v. Commercial Union Assurance Co., 461 A.2d 935, 937 (R.I. 1983) (emphasis added)). 2', 'In Balian v. Allstate Insurance Co., 610 A.2d 546, 549 (R.I. 1992), we held that “the panel was properly empowered to render its decision on the issues of liability and damages * * *.” (Emphases added.) We further held that the insurer should be liable for the full value of the award of the arbitration panel, including prejudgment interest, even if the total award, with interest, exceeds the policy limits. Id. at 550 (citing Sentry, 556 A.2d at 1000).', 'In Pogorilich, 605 A.2d at 1320, upon which defendant relies, the issue did not involve the modification of an arbitration award. Although it is true that the parties had submitted the issue of damages to arbitration, the insurer then filed a declaratory judgment action in the Superior Court to resolve the issue of coverage because, when the plaintiffs accepted payment of the policy limits, they “expressly reserved their rights to pursue their claim for interest awarded by the arbitrators in excess of the policy limits * * *.” Id. at 1319, 1320. The Superior Court “certified the question of interpretation of the policy to this [C]ourt.” Id. at 1320. On the issue of prejudgment interest, this Court held that “[a]n uninsured/underinsured motorist policy limit may not be expanded to include prejudgment interest even though the injured party may be entitled to recover such prejudgment interest from the tortfeasor.” Id. at 1321. In distinguishing the case from Sentry, we held that', '“In the present case the arbitrators were not requested to', 'determine, nor did they purport to determine, the amount of', 'recovery to which [the plaintiffs] were entitled from Allstate. The', 'questions propounded to the arbitrators by the parties in this case,', 'and the questions that the arbitrators answered, concerned the', 'amounts [the plaintiffs] were entitled to recover from the', 'tortfeasor, Dow. * * * Consequently our holding in Sentry is not 2', 'There was no such agreement in the case before us.', '-8-', 'applicable in determining the question of prejudgment interest in', 'the instant case.” Id.', 'Indeed, since Pogorilich was issued, we have, on several occasions, explained that the case does not stand for the proposition that arbitrators may never award prejudgment interest. In Murino v. Progressive Northern Insurance Co., 785 A.2d 557, 558 (R.I. 2001), we were again asked to decide if a plaintiff was entitled to an arbitration award that included prejudgment interest that pushed the total award over the policy limits. We decided that he was. Id. at 559. We distinguished Pogorilich because, in Murino, “the arbitrator was requested only to determine the amount due to the plaintiff under his [uninsured motorist] coverage.” Id. We further ruled that “[o]ur holding in Sentry controls here, and it remains the law in this jurisdiction that prejudgment interest in excess of policy limits may be awarded when an arbitrator is asked to determine only the amount that a plaintiff is entitled to recover in [uninsured motorist] benefits from the plaintiff’s insurance company.” Id. at 560.', 'Finally, in Wheeler, 66 A.3d at 482-84, this Court addressed an issue remarkably similar to the one now before us at this time. There, the plaintiff suffered injuries in a collision with an underinsured driver and sought recovery from her own insurer, Encompass. Id. at 478-79. As is the case here, the carrier disputed the nature and extent of the plaintiff’s injuries and the parties agreed to submit the dispute to arbitration. Id. at 479. The arbitrators found that the plaintiff suffered damages in the amount of $150,000, and they also awarded prejudgment interest. Id. The plaintiff sought confirmation of the award in Superior Court and the defendant objected, arguing that the award could not be confirmed because the total award exceeded the policy limit of $100,000. Id. The trial justice, relying on Pogorilich, 605 A.2d at 1321, denied the plaintiff’s motion to confirm and ordered that the award be modified to conform to the limits of the policy. Wheeler, 66 A.3d at 480.', '-9-', 'When we decided that case, we observed that there was neither a record of the arbitration proceedings nor of the question that had been presented to the arbitrators. Wheeler, 66 A.3d at 483. Indeed, “the parties agreed that they did not submit a specific question or frame the issue for the panel; they also agreed that the insurance policy was not introduced for the arbitrators’ consideration.” Id. (emphasis added). We reversed the trial justice’s decision, holding that, when the trial justice accepted the defendant’s argument that the arbitrator could not award prejudgment interest, he, in effect, “modified the award based on his belie[f] that the arbitrators had made an error of law. However, it is settled beyond a hint of contradiction that a mistake of law is not grounds for upsetting an arbitration award.” Id. (citing Aponik, 844 A.2d at 704; Purvis Systems, Inc. v. American Systems Corp., 788 A.2d 1112, 1115 (R.I. 2002); Westminster Construction Corp. v. PPG Industries, Inc., 119 R.I. 205, 210, 376 A.2d 708, 711 (1977)). We reiterated that the trial justice had no authority under the Arbitration Act to conduct a de novo review of the arbitrators’ award and that his review of the award was channeled by the statutory mandates of § 10-3-14. Wheeler, 66 A.3d at 483-84.', 'In this case, the parties filed cross-motions in the trial court—plaintiff moved to confirm the award and defendant objected to plaintiff’s motion and moved to modify the award—thus triggering the trial justice’s review of the award within the limited confines of § 10-3-14. However, at no point during the hearing below or in his decision did the trial justice refer to the statute or to the three limited grounds that garbed him with any authority to modify the award. Instead, it appears clear to us that he founded his decision to modify the award on a valiant effort to distinguish this case from the facts of Wheeler by supplementing the record with the testimony of the arbitrator and ordering the entry of the policy as an exhibit. He went on to invoke his', '- 10 - authority to “do justice between the parties” and, in effect, seems to have disregarded the Arbitration Act altogether.', 'Indeed, we are of the opinion that the trial justice went beyond the de novo review that we disapproved of in Wheeler by admitting testimony and expanding the record to allow, and to even suggest, the admission of exhibits not submitted to the arbitrator. We think that it is important for us to observe that we are aware of no authority, nor has any been cited to us, that would allow the parties to examine the arbitrator through testimony or to offer new exhibits into the record. In our view, it was patently erroneous for the trial justice to hear new evidence and to consider documents that had not been submitted to the arbitrator. We further conclude that the trial justice strayed far beyond the limited authority granted to him by the Arbitration Act when he decided to modify the arbitration award. 3 See § 10-3-14.', 'We hold that a trial justice reviewing an arbitration award is constrained to the four corners of the award itself and the record of the arbitration proceeding. 4 Because that was not done below, we will proceed to engage in just such a review now. 3', 'When addressing a motion to confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award, a trial justice in essence performs limited appellate review of the award. We believe that placing the arbitrator on the witness stand under oath and examining him about the basis of his decision is analogous to this Court examining a trial justice on the rationale for his decision. Indeed, the review of arbitration awards by the Superior Court is subject to a far more stringent standard than our review of trial court judgments. 4', 'We recognize that there may be occasions when a trial justice is required to consider testimony and evidence beyond the four corners of the award, such as when a party moves to vacate an award, under G.L. 1956 § 10-3-12, for one of the following reasons:', '“(1) Where the award was procured by corruption, fraud or undue', 'means.', '“(2) Where there was evident partiality or corruption on the part of', 'the arbitrators, or either of them.', '- 11 -', 'In the first paragraph of his award, the arbitrator wrote, “[t]he question for decision is the extent of the injury, and the amount of compensation plaintiff is entitled to because of it.” As was the case in Wheeler, there is no record of the testimony in the arbitration proceeding that gave rise to the award, the insurance policy was not submitted for the arbitrator’s consideration, and even the trial justice could not “ignore the fact that suit was brought against Commerce Insurance Company on the insurance policy.” The arbitrator’s award contained the caption “Joseph Lemerise v. The Commerce Insurance Company,” and it contains no reference to the tortfeasor, except in the first two sentences of the award: “Plaintiff was injured on August 7, 2011 when his foot was run over by an admittedly uninsured motorist. There is no disagreement that the uninsured motorist was at fault, or that plaintiff suffered an injury to his foot and ankle.”', 'Furthermore, at the end of the award, the arbitrator wrote, “In my opinion, fair and reasonable compensation to plaintiff for his injuries and damages resulting from the crush injury to his foot is $150,000. I award interest on these damages at the rate of 12% from the date of the injury, in the amount of $47,550, for a total award to plaintiff in the amount of $197,550.” We find it significant that the arbitrator’s award for damages declared that plaintiff “is” entitled to the amount set forth in the award, as opposed to what he “would be” entitled to, had the arbitrator been determining the liability of the tortfeasor.', 'The defendant urges us to elucidate grounds for modification—despite the trial justice’s failure to invoke any statutory directives—and find that the arbitrator awarded upon a matter not', '“(3) Where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to', 'postpone the hearing, upon sufficient cause shown, or in hearing', 'legally immaterial evidence, or refusing to hear evidence pertinent', 'and material to the controversy, or of any other misbehavior by', 'which the rights of any party have been substantially prejudiced.” However, none of those circumstances are relevant to the review conducted pursuant to § 10-3-14, as is the case here.', '- 12 - submitted to him, based on the fact that the arbitrator granted prejudgment interest when he was not specifically asked to do so. The defendant also argues that it was error for the arbitrator to calculate prejudgment interest because, according to it, Massachusetts law does not provide for prejudgment interest to be included in uninsured motorist arbitration awards. 5 However, as mentioned above, we have specifically held that arbitrators have the authority to award prejudgment interest in excess of policy limits and “that arbitrators should add prejudgment interest to their awards unless the parties specifically provide otherwise by agreement.” Sentry, 556 A.2d at 1000 (quoting Paola, 461 A.2d at 937) (emphasis added). Thus, we hold that defendant’s argument that the arbitrator awarded on a matter not submitted to him has no merit.', 'Furthermore, we hold that any argument that defendant makes pursuant to the application of Massachusetts law was waived because it was not submitted to the arbitrator. See Aponik, 844 A.2d at 706 (holding that the failure to request attorneys’ fees and costs during arbitration waived any rights provided by the Mechanics’ Lien statute). The defendant admitted in the trial court and in his argument to this Court that the policy was never submitted to the arbitrator, that the arbitrator was unaware that the policy was a Massachusetts policy, and that the arbitrator was never asked to apply Massachusetts law.', 'Therefore, we will not address arguments not submitted to the arbitrator. 6', 'Because we have decided that there were no grounds for modifying the arbitrator’s award, we are constrained to hold that the trial justice should have granted plaintiff’s motion to confirm the award under the terms of § 10-3-11. 5', 'This issue is not before us, and we take no position on it. 6', 'Even if we were to address defendant’s contention that Massachusetts law should have applied to the issue of prejudgment interest, we note that any oversight resulting therefrom would likely constitute an error of law, and an error of law is not grounds for modifying an arbitration award. See Wheeler v. Encompass Insurance Co., 66 A.3d 477, 481 (R.I. 2013); Aponik v. Lauricella, 844 A.2d 698, 704 (R.I. 2004).', '- 13 -', 'We close with this observation. This Court has twice now been called upon to intervene in arbitration proceedings involving insurance companies who declined, for reasons best known to them, to submit the insurance policy to the arbitrator. It appears to us that the decision not to submit the policy to the arbitrator was tactical in nature, as has been demonstrated in this case by the defendant’s extremely low valuation of the plaintiff’s injuries at $7,000. However, as has now been demonstrated in this case, as it was in Wheeler, it is a decision that is fraught with danger, because the insurer is bound to suffer the consequences in the event that the arbitrator disagrees with the insurer’s valuation to such an extent that the policy limit is exceeded by the award. The insured would similarly have been bound by the arbitrator’s decision had the arbitrator agreed with the insurer’s valuation or had the insured failed to submit some of his medical records. We are certain that an insurer would vociferously object if an insured sought to introduce additional evidence of his or her injury to a trial court in order to modify an arbitrator’s award. Such circumstances are not grounds for modification and would be wholly contrary to the public policies underlying arbitration proceedings.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth above, we vacate the order of the Superior Court. We remand the papers to the Superior Court with instructions to issue an order confirming the arbitration award.', 'Justice Robinson, dissenting. While I have genuine respect for my colleagues and their reasoning with respect to this difficult case, my own thoughts about the underlying principles of law have not changed from those which I articulated in my dissent three years ago in Wheeler v. Encompass Insurance Co., 66 A.3d 477 (R.I. 2013), a case which the majority in this case describes as involving “an issue remarkably similar to the one now before us * * *.”', '- 14 -', 'In my judgment, the one-sentence Stipulation between the parties that is referred to in the majority opinion leads directly to what I believe should be the proper analytical approach to this case. That Stipulation reads as follows:', '“The parties hereby agree that the above action, including', 'but not limited to [d]efendant’s obligation to file an answer to the', 'complaint, shall be stayed pending the parties participation in', '[a]rbitration pursuant to the terms of the plaintiff’s [un]insured', 'motorist policy.” By virtue of the presence in the Stipulation of the words “pursuant to the terms of the plaintiff’s [un]insured motorist policy,” it is clear to me that the arbitration at issue sprang from and ultimately required a return to the contract of insurance. See State Department of Corrections v. Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional Officers, 866 A.2d 1241, 1247 (R.I. 2005) (stating that “[a]rbitration is a creature of the contract between the parties”). In my view, it is critical to keep in mind that, from the beginning, a contract existed—viz., the contract of insurance between Mr. Lemerise’s mother and The Commerce Insurance Company (Commerce). That contract never ceased to exist at any pertinent time; and, like all contracts, it defined the parameters of the rights and responsibilities of the insured and the insurer. Once Mr. Lemerise and Commerce found themselves unable to reach agreement as to what amount Commerce should pay Mr. Lemerise in view of his injuries, the parties resorted to arbitration for that issue to be determined. As such, the arbitration was chronologically subsequent to and ancillary to the pre-existing contract. The arbitrator’s role was to determine what amount would represent compensation to Mr. Lemerise with respect to his injuries; but the arbitrator had no authority to, in effect, rewrite the contract. Once he determined that $150,000 represented fair and reasonable compensation for the injuries, his role was at an end. It is my opinion that, at that point, there should have been a return to the terms of the contract of insurance in the context of the still-', '- 15 - pending Superior Court action. That contract of insurance explicitly limits the amount which the insurer was required to pay; under the contract, there should have been a payment of $100,000 to Mr. Lemerise from Commerce. But, in my judgment, Commerce had no obligation to pay the balance of the amount calculated by the arbitrator—because the contract imposed no such obligation on it. My view is that the contract of insurance (which no one has characterized as ambiguous) is self-limiting: it contains an express limitation on the amount to which the insured is entitled even in the worst-case scenario. I recall the ancient adage: “pacta sunt servanda” (agreements ought to be adhered to).', 'I will not go on at length. I recognize that the majority largely rests its opinion on the Wheeler case. I dissented there; I have given a good deal of further thought to this difficult issue, but I remain convinced that the analytical approach which I sketched in Wheeler was correct.

This case came before the Supreme Court on March 2, 2016, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. The defendant, Daniel Hunt, was charged with two counts of second-degree child molestation sexual assault (second-degree child molestation). After a jury trial in the Superior Court, the defendant was convicted on count 1 and acquitted on count 2. He was sentenced to twenty years at the Adult Correctional Institutions, with nine years to serve and eleven years suspended with probation. On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial justice committed reversible error when, in his instructions to the jury and in the jury-verdict form, he failed to adequately inform the jury of the distinction between counts 1 and 2, which were identically worded. Having carefully considered the memoranda submitted by the parties and the arguments of counsel, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown, and the appeal may be decided at this time. We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'Facts and Travel', 'The defendant began dating Sandra1 in 2005. They had one child together, and defendant assumed a paternal relationship with Sandra’s two older children from a prior relationship. The romantic relationship between defendant and Sandra ended in 2010, but they remained friends until the summer of 2012, when their relationship soured. Despite the breakup, Sandra’s two older children continued to view defendant as their father, and all three children periodically saw him. The defendant, a truck driver, spent substantial time outside the state for work and sometimes slept over at Sandra’s home when he was in Rhode Island.', 'On April 7, 2012, the night before Easter Sunday and months before defendant’s friendship with Sandra ended, defendant spent the night at Sandra’s home. Several months later, on August 23, 2012, Sandra came across a private message that her oldest child, Emily, had written to a friend on Facebook; in the message, Emily had disclosed to her friend that defendant had inappropriately touched her while he was visiting the night before Easter.2 The crux of the allegation against defendant was that, on the evening of April 7, 2012, when Emily was twelve years old, defendant twice touched Emily’s breasts under her shirt and her bra; in particular, defendant fondled her for “[a]bout 20 minutes,” left the room to go outside to his truck, and, upon returning, he touched her again for approximately ten minutes, until Emily retired to her bedroom. A police investigation ensued.', 'On December 4, 2012, defendant was charged by criminal information with two counts of second-degree child molestation. Both counts charged “[t]hat [Daniel Hunt], * * * on or about the 7th day of April, 2012, in the City of Woonsocket, * * * did engage in sexual contact with 1', 'To protect the privacy of the complainant, who is a minor, we use pseudonyms to identify both her (“Emily”) and her mother (“Sandra”). 2', 'The Facebook message was not entered into evidence at trial.', '-2- [Emily], a person fourteen (14) years of age or under, in violation of [G.L. 1956] § 11-37-8.3 and § 11-37-8.4.”3 The defendant did not seek a bill of particulars in accordance with Rule 7(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.', 'The case was reached for trial in Providence County Superior Court on December 6, 2013. At the close of trial, the trial justice instructed the jury that it was to consider two charges against defendant:', '“In order to convict * * * defendant of second[-]degree child', 'molestation, the [s]tate must prove beyond a reasonable doubt first', 'that on or about April 7, 2012, * * * defendant engaged in two', 'separate acts of sexual contact[—]namely[,] * * * defendant', 'touched [Emily]’s breast and shortly thereafter again touched', '[Emily]’s breasts and nipples.” (Emphases added.) The trial justice further charged:', '“[B]ecause * * * defendant has been charged with more than one', 'criminal offense, each alleged violation must be considered by you', 'separately and the [s]tate must prove its case beyond a reasonable', 'doubt as to each offense.', '“[D]efendant is entitled to your independent consideration', 'of each of the charges.” Defense counsel raised no objection to the jury instructions, nor did he object to the contents of the jury-verdict form—which listed the charges as follows:', '“1.', 'As to [c]ount 1, which charges that[,] on or about April 7,', '2012[,] Daniel Hunt committed Second[-]Degree Child', 'Molestation Sexual Assault upon [Emily], a child 14 years', 'old or younger, we the jury find the [d]efendant:', '[guilty/not guilty]. 3', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-37-8.3 provides that “[a] person is guilty of a second[-]degree child molestation sexual assault if he or she engages in sexual contact with another person fourteen (14) years of age or under.” Section 11-37-8.4 reads: “Every person who shall commit second[- ]degree child molestation sexual assault shall be imprisoned for not less than six (6) years nor more than thirty (30) years.”', '-3-', '“2.', 'As to [c]ount 2, which charges that[,] on or about April 7,', '2012[,] Daniel Hunt committed Second[-]Degree Child', 'Molestation Sexual Assault upon [Emily], a child 14 years', 'old or younger, we the jury find the [d]efendant:', '[guilty/not guilty].”', 'During its deliberations, the jury submitted two questions to the trial justice: First, the jurors asked to review Emily’s “description of the second touching,” and, next, her testimony about “what happened after the first incident.”4 On both occasions, after relevant portions of the transcript were read aloud to the jury, the trial justice asked defendant if he wished to make an objection for the record. The defendant declined each time.', 'The jury returned a verdict of guilty on count 1 and not guilty on count 2.5 On January 6, 2014, the trial justice heard and denied defendant’s motion for a new trial. The defendant filed this timely appeal.', 'Standard of Review', 'We apply de novo review to “issues pertaining to jury instructions.” State v. Vargas, 991 A.2d 1056, 1060 (R.I. 2010). We “examine[] ‘the instructions in their entirety to ascertain the manner in which a jury of ordinary intelligent lay people would have understood them, * * * and * * * review[] [the] challenged portions * * * in the context in which they were rendered.’” State v. Carpio, 43 A.3d 1, 10 (R.I. 2012) (quoting State v. Cardona, 969 A.2d 667, 674 (R.I. 2009)). “[A]n erroneous charge [to the jury] warrants reversal only if it can be shown that the jury ‘could have been misled’ to the resultant prejudice of the complaining party.” Vargas, 991 A.2d at 1063 (quoting Maglioli v. J.P. Noonan Transportation, Inc., 869 A.2d 71, 75 (R.I. 2005)). 4', 'Specifically, in the first question, the jurors asked to review the transcript from Emily’s testimony “where she talks about the touching[.] [P]articularly interested in description of the second touching and hand position.” They next asked to “hear [Emily]’s testimony covering what happened after the first incident until she went to her room.” 5', 'The polling of the jury with respect to count 1 revealed that the jurors were unanimous.', '-4-', 'Analysis', 'The defendant argues on appeal that the trial justice erred in his instructions to the jury and by employing the jury-verdict form. Specifically, defendant asserts that the trial justice failed to sufficiently advise the jury of the distinction between counts 1 and 2. The defendant contends that this failure resulted in the infringement of his constitutional right “to be adequately informed of the nature and cause of the accusations against him.”', 'Fatal to defendant’s challenge, however, is the fact that he did not raise this argument until he filed his motion for a new trial. Rule 30 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure provides, in relevant part, that “[n]o party may assign as error any portion of the charge or omission therefrom unless the party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict * * *.”', 'This requirement serves the important function of promoting judicial efficiency by alerting the trial justice to “alleged deficiencies” while there still is an opportunity to rectify them. State v. Flori, 963 A.2d 932, 937 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. Hallenbeck, 878 A.2d 992, 1006 (R.I. 2005)). For this reason, we repeatedly have declared that a party’s failure to timely object to jury instructions will result in the waiver of that issue on appeal, unless “issues of constitutional dimension are implicated.” Id.; see also State v. Mendez, 116 A.3d 228, 243 (R.I. 2015) (“With respect to objections to jury instructions in particular, this Court has ‘consistently been exacting about applying the raise[-]or[-]waive rule.’” (quoting Ferris Avenue Realty, LLC v. Huhtamaki, Inc., 110 A.3d 267, 285 (R.I. 2015))). The raise-or-waive rule similarly applies to an appellate challenge to the jury-verdict form if the party fails to object to its use at trial. State v. Mohapatra, 880 A.2d 802, 810 (R.I. 2005).', 'A defendant who is confronted with an ambiguous complaint or indictment has a remedy: a bill of particulars. See Rule 7(f). As we have previously explained, its “function * * * is to', '-5- provide the defendant with the factual detail omitted from an indictment or information.” State v. Saluter, 715 A.2d 1250, 1253 (R.I. 1998) (quoting State v. Collins, 543 A.2d 641, 654 (R.I. 1988), overruled on other grounds, State v. Rios, 702 A.2d 889, 890 (R.I. 1997)). The “primary purpose [of a bill of particulars] is to supply the defendant with such particulars as are necessary in order that judicial surprise is avoided at trial.” Id. (quoting Collins, 543 A.2d at 654). Having failed to seek a bill of particulars, a defendant should not be heard to complain about the lack of notice of the specificity of the charge.', 'We further note that, although a bill of particulars is not mandatory, State v. Prefontaine, 667 A.2d 531, 532 (R.I. 1995), the timely objection to jury instructions at trial is required, State v. Davis, 877 A.2d 642, 648 (R.I. 2005). In Davis, 877 A.2d at 646, the defendant, Davis, claimed that the jury verdict did not specify whether he was convicted on the basis of his role as a principal of the offenses charged or as an aider or abettor. Davis had not requested a bill of particulars to clarify the charges against him before trial. Id. at 647. Further, despite being afforded the opportunity to review the jury instructions before the trial justice charged the jury, Davis did not object to the jury instructions or the jury-verdict form until he argued his motion for a new trial. Id. at 647-48. Since no issue of constitutional dimension underlay Davis’s claim of error, this Court concluded that Davis had waived the issue on appeal. Id. at 648.', 'The circumstances in this case closely parallel those in Davis. Here, we are presented with a defendant who did not seek a bill of particulars, which could have clarified the issues that are now presented on appeal. Also like Davis, defendant had the opportunity to review and provide input regarding the jury instructions in advance of the charge to the jury but ultimately did not object to the instructions, nor did he object to the use of the jury-verdict form. The defendant also did not object on either of the two occasions that the requested portions of the', '-6- transcript were read aloud to the jury. As in Davis, defendant posed his objection to the jury instructions and jury-verdict form for the first time when arguing his motion for a new trial—in this case, after the jury returned with a split verdict. As the raise-or-waive rule precluded Davis from challenging the jury instructions and jury-verdict form on appeal, Davis, 877 A.2d at 648, so too does it in this case.6', 'We pause to observe that, although the issue was not properly preserved for review on appeal, it also lacks merit. As this Court has declared, “[i]t is well settled that, absent a showing to the contrary, the jury will be assumed to have followed an instruction given it by the trial court in reaching its factual conclusions.” Mazzaro v. Narragansett Improvement Co., 109 R.I. 244, 250, 283 A.2d 887, 891 (1971); see also State v. Whitfield, 93 A.3d 1011, 1022 (R.I. 2014) (“The Court presumes that members of the jury follow the trial justice’s instructions.”). Here, the trial justice instructed the jury to consider “two separate acts of sexual contact,” in which the allegations were that “defendant touched [Emily]’s breast and shortly thereafter again touched [Emily]’s breasts and nipples.” We also are satisfied that there was no confusion between or among the parties and the jury in this case. Throughout Emily’s testimony—both on direct and cross-examination—Emily, the prosecutor, and defense counsel referred to the twenty-minute period when defendant touched Emily before he went to his truck and the alleged ten-minute period after he returned to the living room as two discrete occurrences. For example, defense counsel asked Emily, “[Y]ou told us that there were two different occasions that [defendant] 6', 'There exists a “narrow exception” to the raise-or-waive rule. State v. Mendez, 116 A.3d 228, 242 n.20 (R.I. 2015). For that exception to apply, “the alleged error must be more than harmless, and the exception must implicate an issue of constitutional dimension derived from a novel rule of law that could not reasonably have been known to counsel at the time of trial.” Id. at 242-43 n.20 (quoting State v. Breen, 767 A.2d 50, 57 (R.I. 2001)). We are not presented here with an error that involves a “novel rule of law” reasonably unknown to counsel at trial, and thus this narrow exception does not apply.', '-7- touched your breast, correct?” (Emphasis added.) Emily, the prosecutor, and defense counsel repeatedly distinguished the two occurrences as the “first” and the “second” episode.7 The two questions submitted by the jurors—in which they referenced “the first incident” and “the second touching” respectively—suggest that the jurors also distinguished the incidents following the same scheme as used at trial.', 'Further, there was evidence adduced at trial that tended to suggest that the second incident may not have happened as Emily had testified but that the first incident did occur. On cross-examination, Officer Patrick Roy (Officer Roy) of the Woonsocket Police Department, the officer who responded to Emily’s home when the police were first called, testified that Emily had told him that defendant had touched her before he went outside, but Officer Roy did not 7', 'The following colloquy on cross-examination illustrates the distinction made at trial:', '“Q', '* * * Why did you get up [ten minutes after defendant', 'started touching you again upon his return to the living', 'room]?', '“* * *', '“A', 'Because I wanted to go to bed and I was scared.', '“Q', 'The second time you wanted to go [to] bed and you were', 'scared but weren’t you scared the first time?', '“A', 'Yes.', '“Q', 'Tell the jury why you didn’t get up the first time to go to', 'bed[.]', '“A', 'Because I was scared and I was just laying [sic] there. I', 'didn’t know what to do.', '“Q', 'Well, were you scared to a greater degree the first time', 'than you were the second time?” (Emphases added.)', '-8- testify that Emily reported a second touching after defendant returned.8 Moreover, the questions submitted by the jurors, in which they sought to shed light on “what happened after the first incident” (emphasis added) and Emily’s “description of the second touching” but did not request to review testimony regarding the first incident, indicate the jury’s particular interest in the evidence surrounding the second incident. See Commonwealth v. Morales, 874 N.E.2d 698, 705 (Mass. App. Ct. 2007) (“The questions asked by the deliberating jury are of significance in that they may demonstrate the jury’s focus.”).', 'Both Officer Roy’s testimony and the jury questions suggest that the jury found that the prosecution had proven count 1, the first touching, beyond a reasonable doubt but had failed to establish count 2, the second touching, under the same standard. A unanimity instruction by the trial justice and the polling of the jury that revealed that the verdict was unanimous further demonstrate that the jury understood its charge and followed it accordingly. There simply is no evidence in the record before us to indicate that the jury suffered from any confusion. See 8', 'On this point, Officer Roy testified as follows:', '“A', '[Emily] informed me that she was sleeping on the couch', 'in the living room or she was asleep on the couch. She', 'was awoken to [defendant] moving cushions around right.', 'After that, the suspect * * * placed his hand inside her', 'shirt underneath her bra for a short amount of time.

She just walked into her', 'room.”', '-9- Vargas, 991 A.2d at 1064 (refusal of the trial justice to differentiate between identically worded counts did not constitute error because there was “no evidence of juror confusion”).', 'For this reason, this case differs from Prefontaine, 667 A.2d at 532, in which the Court granted a new trial where “[i]t [was] clear that the jury as well as the [trial] justice were hopelessly confused about what exact offenses had been committed for which [the] defendant was being tried.” This case also is distinguishable from Saluter, 715 A.2d at 1251, 1255, in which this Court vacated seven counts of a judgment of conviction because separate incidents of sexual assault were alleged in each count of the indictment. As we observed in Davis, 877 A.2d at 648-49, the reversible errors found in Prefontaine and Saluter are not present when the jury finds the defendant guilty of a crime in which only one offense is charged per count. Accordingly, Prefontaine and Saluter do not apply here.', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of conviction is affirmed, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court.', '- 10 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S', 'OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'State v.

On appeal, the defendant presents two claims of error: (1) that the trial justice improperly excluded testimony from one of the responding police officers which concluded that the defendant was afraid of the complaining witness; and (2) that the trial justice erred in denying her motion for a new trial. This matter came before the Supreme Court on February 25, 2016, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised should not be summarily decided.', 'After hearing the arguments of counsel and reviewing the memoranda submitted on behalf of the parties, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown. Accordingly, we shall decide the appeal at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the Superior Court’s judgment of conviction.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The defendant’s conviction arises from an incident that occurred on the afternoon of August 10, 2012, between her and the complaining witness, Rick Butler (Butler). At that time,', '-1- Butler and defendant were living with defendant’s mother, Brenda Washington, who is Butler’s cousin, and defendant’s sister, G’tobia Washington, 1 in a three-story, townhouse-style apartment located at 214 Hillside Avenue in Newport, Rhode Island. 2 Brenda and defendant each occupied separate bedrooms on the second floor of the apartment and shared the second-floor bathroom, while Butler and G’tobia each occupied separate bedrooms on the third floor and shared the third-floor bathroom.', 'As Butler tells the story, on the afternoon of the altercation, he was between shifts at his jobs at Burger King and Walmart. He was in a hurry and wanted to take a shower, but both bathrooms were occupied—the second-floor bathroom by defendant and the third-floor bathroom by G’tobia. Butler testified that he asked Brenda if she could “talk to one of the girls and let [him] use the restroom” so he could get ready for work. Brenda went upstairs to ask defendant how much longer she would be occupying the bathroom, to which she responded: “Not too long, Mom.” According to Butler, fearing that he would be late, he reluctantly opted to skip the shower and instead decided to just put on his uniform and go to his shift at Walmart.', 'Butler further testified that at this point, he told G’tobia that he felt as though he “was being nit-picked” and that the sisters had set him up to be late by purposely occupying both bathrooms at a time when they knew he needed to get ready for work.', 'According to Butler, an argument then ensued between him and defendant on the second- floor “landing area” of the apartment. Butler testified that defendant put her hand in his face twice and that, at one point, her hand “touched his nose.” Butler “removed” defendant’s hand from his face, and the two “got into it.” Butler testified that defendant pushed him, he pushed her back, and then defendant “left the scene and went in her room and came out with a box cutter 1', 'To avoid confusion, we will refer to Brenda and G’tobia by their first names. 2', 'Butler moved in with Washington in late 2011.', '-2- * * * and started just swinging it.” Butler went on to testify that defendant was “just like cutting * * * just was going everywhere” and demonstrated for the jury a “vigorous slashing motion.” Butler testified that he felt a cut across his left bicep and inner forearm. He stated that the incident ended shortly thereafter because G’tobia had called the police.', 'Butler added that the police took a photograph of the cut on his forearm and that this was the only photograph of his injuries taken at that time. Butler testified that afterwards, he left the house to go to Walmart to explain to his managers what had transpired. After leaving Walmart, Butler testified that he came back to the apartment and then took a walk “to clear [his] mind.” He then went back home, went upstairs to take a “bath;” and, “when [he] went into the bathroom, [he] noticed that there was a big gash up on [his] arm.” Thereafter, Butler took Brenda’s cell phone, walked up the street, and called the police, who arrived that evening and took a photograph of the newly-discovered cut on his left bicep.', 'Aside from Butler, the state called only one other witness, Officer Stephen Carrig (Officer Carrig) of the Newport Police Department, who, along with another officer, initially responded to the altercation. Officer Carrig testified that he spoke to “all the parties involved,” including both Butler and defendant, and photographed the scene, Butler, and defendant. Officer Carrig further stated that he was also one of the officers who responded to Butler’s call later that evening.', 'G’tobia, Brenda, and defendant all testified for the defense. G’tobia took the stand first. She testified that, at the time of the incident, Butler had not been getting along with anyone in the house. She recounted that, on the day of the incident, Butler was upset because defendant went to his place of work and took the car that they shared because she needed to use it. She testified that, after Butler came home from work that afternoon and after she thought he was done using', '-3- the third-floor bathroom, she went into the bathroom to take a shower. She then recalled that Butler came upstairs and started banging on the door, saying he needed to use the bathroom. She said she tried to calm him down by indicating she would be out of the bathroom soon, but that Butler kept banging on the door saying, “[t]hese bitches, they keep playing * * * I’m going to show them I’m not playing.” G’tobia recounted that she came out of the bathroom shortly thereafter and saw Butler and defendant “arguing back and forth”—defendant was standing in front of the closet doors on the second floor, and Butler was standing on the second step going up to the third floor.', 'She testified that Butler turned the altercation into a physical one when he “jumped” on defendant and was “just punching her.” G’tobia stated that defendant “started to fight back” and hit Butler and that Brenda tried to break up the altercation. After deducing that Brenda was not going to be able to break up the fight, G’tobia stated that she went into Brenda’s room to call the police. G’tobia testified that she never saw defendant holding a box cutter, but that she heard a box cutter was involved and relayed that over the phone to the police dispatcher. She stated that she did not see any injuries on Butler and that the altercation ended shortly after she announced the police were on their way.', 'Brenda was the next to testify, and she too stated that Butler was not getting along very well in her home, especially with her daughters. Her version of events was similar to that of G’tobia’s and also indicated that it was Butler who turned the altercation physical. She testified that she saw defendant with a box cutter and that defendant cut Butler on the arm when “he [went to] swing at her face again[.]” She further narrated that, after the police had come and gone, she gave Butler a ride to Walmart, picked him up about ten minutes later, and when they returned home, he asked to borrow her cell phone and left the house. She stated that when Butler', '-4- returned, he first went upstairs, and then came back downstairs and told her “I just found another cut on me[.]”', 'The defendant was the last to take the stand. She testified that, on the afternoon in question, Butler was banging on the door of the third-floor bathroom while G’tobia was occupying it. The defendant recalled that she tried yelling up the stairs to calm Butler down and that, in response, Butler ran down the stairs “charging at [her]” and “got in [her] face and started yelling at [her].” The defendant next testified that “out of nowhere” Butler punched her in the face and she pushed him in an effort to get him off her. She further stated that, during the altercation, her back was to her bedroom door and, at some point, Butler “pushed [her] or punched [her]” and she “kind of * * * lost [her] balance.” The defendant said that, when she regained her balance, she saw the box cutter3 within arm’s reach on her bedroom dresser, grabbed it, and swung it at Butler because she thought “he’d get out of [her] face and leave [her] alone.” The defendant testified that she saw two cuts on Butler’s forearm, but did not see them until after the police arrived and the altercation had ended.', 'After the defense rested, the trial justice—without objection from either party—instructed the jury, including an explanation of the law as it pertained to self-defense and the duty to retreat. 4 On February 11, 2014, the jury found defendant guilty of the charge of assault with a dangerous weapon, a box cutter.', 'The defendant filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that the jury’s verdict was against the weight of the evidence. Defense counsel argued that the motion was not a typical “pro forma motion” for the purposes of appeal, but that “[t]he jury got [it] wrong.” The defense relied on the 3', 'The defendant testified that she used the box cutter at her job at Walmart. 4', 'During deliberation, the jury submitted a specific question regarding the law of self-defense and the duty to retreat.

In ruling on the motion, the trial justice noted that it was undisputed that defendant was “wielding” a box cutter and that Butler was in fear for his safety at that time. He also noted that, while portions of Butler’s testimony “stretch[ed] his credibility[,]” the jury was entitled to disregard those portions it considered non-believable and credit those portions it found to be believable. As such, the trial justice found that the portions of Butler’s testimony the jury found to be believable supported a conviction of felony assault, and he denied defendant’s motion.', 'On April 21, 2014, defendant was sentenced to five years imprisonment, suspended, with five years of probation. 5 A judgment of conviction was entered on April 24, 2014; defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.', 'II', 'Standards of Review', '“We will not disturb a trial justice’s evidentiary ruling without first determining that the ruling constitutes a clear abuse of his or her discretion.” State v.

First, she claims that the trial justice abused his discretion by not allowing Officer Carrig to testify that she was “scared” of Butler, which she argues was “extremely relevant” to her defense. She also claims that the trial justice erred in denying her motion for a new trial. We discuss each claim of error in turn.', 'A. Officer Carrig’s Testimony', 'On cross-examination, Officer Carrig was questioned about defendant’s demeanor on the day of the altercation. Officer Carrig testified that defendant was “cooperative” and that she “wasn’t agitated.” When Officer Carrig stated that he “d[id not] recall” any other observations pertaining to defendant’s demeanor, defense counsel attempted to refresh his recollection by having him review a copy of the Domestic Violence & Sexual Assault/Child Molestation (DV/SA) form that was filled out by another officer in connection with the incident. When he was asked if the DV/SA prompted any further recollection as to defendant’s demeanor on the day of the altercation, the state objected. The trial justice then heard the attorneys at sidebar. As', '-7- grounds for the objection, the state argued that the DV/SA form included the phrase “scared of Butler[,]” which the state posited did not refer to the officer’s observation of defendant’s demeanor, but rather memorialized a statement defendant made to the reporting officer. The trial justice indicated that the statement was a conclusion either based on Officer Carrig’s observations or based on a statement made by defendant, and that, if it were the latter, then the statement was inadmissible hearsay under State v. Harnois, 638 A.2d 532 (R.I. 1994). Nevertheless, the trial justice gave defense counsel the opportunity to lay a foundation for the admissibility of Officer Carrig’s testimony that defendant was “scared of Butler.”', 'Defense counsel then tried to broach the topic of how Officer Carrig came to the conclusion that defendant was scared, and the state lodged another objection. The jury was removed from the courtroom, and a voir dire of the witness commenced. During the voir dire, Officer Carrig confirmed that he did not fill out the DV/SA form; rather, his colleague, Officer Nick St. Lawrence (Officer St. Lawrence), completed the form, and he was not consulted. Officer Carrig also testified that he did not recall seeing Officer St. Lawrence fill out the form. Defense counsel asked Officer Carrig if reviewing the form helped him to recall that defendant “was scared of Mr. Butler,” to which Officer Carrig responded in the affirmative. Officer Carrig testified that he came to this conclusion based in part on defendant’s body language and the way she was acting, but also that he could not recall if his conclusion was based on “physical signs [of fear] or if she verbally stated it.”', 'The state fleshed out its objection to Officer Carrig’s testifying that defendant was “scared of Butler” and argued that, absent an accompanying statement, one’s body language or demeanor alone does not indicate fear of a particular individual or object. The trial justice determined that Officer Carrig’s recollection had not been refreshed by the DV/SA form because', '-8- he could not remember whether the statement “scared of Butler” was derived from defendant’s demeanor and/or an accompanying verbal statement, and he ultimately disallowed the testimony.', 'The jury returned, and defense counsel continued to ask Officer Carrig about defendant’s demeanor based solely on his observations and not on any statements made by defendant. Officer Carrig stated that defendant “was upset and seemed to be pretty nervous.” When defense counsel pressed and asked if defendant “was nervous because Mr. Butler was still in the house[,]” the state objected, and the trial justice sustained the objection on the basis of lack of personal knowledge. Officer Carrig’s testimony concluded shortly thereafter.', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice was “misguided” in thinking that Officer Carrig’s testimony that she was “scared of Butler” was inadmissible hearsay and implicated our holding in Harnois. In that case, we held that a defendant who did not testify and was not subject to cross-examination could not then “manipulate[]” the rules of evidence by introducing exculpatory statements he made through the testimony of police officers via the “catchall” exception to the hearsay rule, Rule 803(24) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. Harnois, 638 A.2d at 535-36. Here, defendant argues that Officer Carrig’s testimony that she was “scared of Butler” was not based on a statement she made, but rather was based solely on Officer Carrig’s observations of her demeanor following the altercation. However, despite being given ample opportunity to do so, defense counsel failed to lay a foundation to demonstrate that Officer Carrig knew defendant was scared of Butler specifically and that his conclusion was based solely on his observations.', 'To begin, we note that Officer Carrig was permitted to testify as to what he observed following the altercation, which included any observations pertaining to defendant’s demeanor. See State v. Bruskie, 536 A.2d 522, 522, 523 (R.I. 1988) (state troopers permitted to testify as to', '-9- their observation that a defendant suspected of driving under the influence appeared to be “belligerent” and “dis-arranged”). Indeed, he testified without objection that defendant was “cooperative” and “wasn’t agitated[;]” and, likewise, he was permitted to testify that she appeared “upset” and “nervous.” Officer Carrig’s testimony became problematic, though, when he attempted to identify Butler as the source of defendant’s fear.', 'We have said that “a witness may not give an opinion as to the inner thoughts or feelings of another person * * *.” State v. Covington, 69 A.3d 855, 866 (R.I. 2013); see State v. Ellis, 619 A.2d 418, 423 (R.I. 1993) (“[I]t can scarcely be contended that in the ordinary course of events a lay witness is able to determine such inner feelings as might arise if a person was threatened. This is a question that a lay witness (and probably most expert witnesses) would be totally unqualified to answer.”). That afternoon, defendant could have exhibited an “upset” or “nervous” demeanor for any number of reasons, not the least of which being that the police were in her mother’s home as a result of a violent altercation she was involved in.', 'Despite being given leeway to do so, defense counsel declined to ask any questions to elicit specific observations made by Officer Carrig that would support his conclusion that the source of defendant’s nervousness or fear was Butler. Additionally, Officer Carrig testified that he could not recall whether his conclusion that defendant was “scared of Butler” was based on physical signs of fear or based on a statement made by defendant. He also testified that he did not author the DV/SA form, nor was he consulted during the process. 6', 'As such, it is questionable that Officer Carrig knew that defendant was in fact scared of Butler in particular. See Rule 602 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence (“A witness may not testify to a matter 6', ""To be sure, the fact that Officer Carrig did not author the DV/SA form does not bar the defense from using it to refresh his recollection. See State v. Presler, 731 A.2d 699, 704 (R.I. 1999) (noting that “any writing or object may be used in an effort to refresh a witness's recollection * * *” quoting State v. Souza, 708 A.2d 899, 903 (R.I. 1998))."", '-10- unless evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding that the witness has personal knowledge of the matter.”).', 'Accordingly, we conclude that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in barring the testimony.', 'B. Motion for a New Trial', 'The defendant next argues that the trial justice erred in denying her motion for a new trial because he overlooked and misconceived material evidence by failing to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses and failing to address her self-defense argument. She also takes issue with the fact that the trial justice “disposed of [her] motion for new trial in only six pages of transcript.” However, we have said that “[i]n setting forth the rationale for a decision [on a motion for a new trial], ‘the trial justice need not refer to all the evidence supporting the decision,’ rather he ‘need only cite evidence sufficient to allow this [C]ourt to discern whether the trial justice applied the appropriate standards.’” State v. Swiridowsky, 126 A.3d 436, 442 (R.I. 2015) (quoting State v. Kizekai, 19 A.3d 583, 589 (R.I. 2011)). We “accord[] great weight to a trial justice’s ruling on [such a motion] if he or she has articulated sufficient reasoning in support of the ruling.” Id. (quoting Kizekai, 19 A.3d at 589).', 'We are satisfied that the trial justice articulated such reasoning in denying the defendant’s motion for a new trial and that he applied the appropriate standard. He correctly assumed the role of the “legendary thirteenth juror,” and exercised his independent judgment when weighing the evidence and assessing the credibility of the witnesses. Karngar, 29 A.3d at 1235 (quoting Clark, 974 A.2d at 569). The trial justice’s decision includes a fairly extensive review of the testimony presented by both sides, and ultimately found that the jury “followed the evidence and', '-11- followed the law as given to it by [the court].” 7 While he noted that portions of Butler’s testimony “stretch[ed] his credibility,” he concluded that the jury was nevertheless “entitled to disregard that portion [of Butler’s testimony] which they found was non-believable, but accept that portion that was believable.” The defendant has not convinced us that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence or that he otherwise clearly erred. Thus, we decline to disturb his ruling. See Mendez, 116 A.3d at 247.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the Superior Court’s judgment of conviction. The record in this case may be returned to that tribunal. 7', 'The defendant also argues that the jury instruction given with regard to her duty to retreat was incorrect. However, the record reveals that defense counsel failed to object to the instruction at the time it was given and even agreed to the same instruction being reread in response to a question submitted by the jury. As such, we need not address this assignment of error. See State v. Whitaker, 79 A.3d 795, 806 (R.I. 2013) (objections to a jury charge that are raised for the first time on appeal are deemed to be waived).', '-12-', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S', 'OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'State v.

O’Donnell, in his capacity as the Commissioner of the Rhode Island Department of Public Safety and Superintendent of the Rhode Island State Police (collectively, defendants). The Journal filed suit in Providence County Superior Court alleging violations of Rhode Island’s Access to Public Records Act (APRA), G.L. 1956 chapter 2 of title 38, after they unsuccessfully requested records from the Rhode Island State Police concerning an investigation of an underage drinking incident at property owned by the then-Governor, Lincoln Chafee. On appeal, the Journal takes issue with the Superior Court’s determination that the requested documents are not subject to public disclosure pursuant to the APRA. After careful consideration of the submitted memoranda and oral arguments, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The travel of the case is easily sketched. On May 28, 2012, Caleb Chafee (Caleb), the son of then-Governor Lincoln Chafee, hosted a party on property owned by the then-Governor, during which some underage attendees consumed alcohol. At some point, an underage female left the party and, shortly thereafter, she was taken to a local hospital for alcohol-related illness. As a result, the Rhode Island State Police went to the property 1 to conduct an investigation. This investigation resulted in the compilation of 186 pages of investigative documents, including witness lists, witness statements, land evidence records, and narrative reports written by various officers (collectively, the requested records). At the conclusion of the investigation, Caleb was charged with the furnishing or procurement of alcoholic beverages for underage persons in violation of G.L. 1956 § 3-8-11.1, to which he pled nolo contendere in Rhode Island District Court on August 22, 2012, and received a $500 civil penalty. On March 13, 2013, a judge of the District Court granted Caleb’s motion to expunge his record.', 'However, Caleb’s liability was not the only product of the police investigation. In an effort to gather further information about the incident, on June 21, 2012, Amanda Milkovits (Milkovits), a reporter for the Providence Journal Company, sent an email to Colonel Steven G. O’Donnell (Col. O’Donnell), in which she “request[ed] copies of state police reports regarding the May 28 incident involving Caleb Chafee.” This email further stated: “This is a public report, regarding the responses and actions of public employees. It’s in the public interest to know how the situation was handled regarding the governor’s son—especially since the state 1', 'The property at which the party occurred is located in Exeter, Rhode Island. It is notable that the Rhode Island State Police responded because the Town of Exeter does not maintain its own police force.', '-2- police answer directly to the governor. This is a matter of transparency.” In a letter dated June 25, 2012, the Rhode Island Department of Public Safety (the department) denied Milkovits’ request for access to the documents. The purported reason for the denial was two-fold: (i) “the requested records [were] exempt from disclosure at [that] time, due to an ongoing criminal investigation and/or prosecution”; and (ii) the records “could reasonably be expected to be an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy * * *.”', 'At some point, a state trooper revealed redacted copies of at least three of the requested records to a WPRO radio talk show host. 2 Apparently, this information suggested that Caleb demanded that the underage female who was treated for alcohol-related illness be removed from the premises and requested that no one call 911 until she was well away from the property.', 'On August 21, 2012, Milkovits sent another email to Col. O’Donnell in which she stated that she was “following up on the charging of Caleb Chafee in the Memorial Day party.” Milkovits further indicated that “now that he’s being charged, I’d like a copy of the report.” In a letter dated August 29, 2012, the department again denied her request. As a reason for its denial, the department provided that the requested records “are not considered public records under Rhode Island law [because] * * * Rhode Island General Law § 38-2-2 excludes records identifiable to an individual in any files and law enforcement records, the disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to be an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” This letter also contained the following language: “[E]nclosed please find a copy of the summons issued in this matter, as well as the violation complaint as filed with the Rhode Island District Court. These records have been entered into the District Court file and are therefore publicly available.” 2', 'This state trooper was charged administratively for revealing the material.', '-3-', 'By letter dated September 5, 2012, the Journal requested that the department reconsider its denial of the records request. 3 On September 10, 2012, the department stated that it had reconsidered its initial denial as requested, but its position had not changed; thus, it denied the Journal’s request for the same reasons as provided in its letter dated August 29, 2012. On September 24, 2012, the Journal filed an appeal with Col. O’Donnell pursuant to § 38-2-8, which was also denied.', 'Finding no relief through this preliminary out-of-court skirmishing, on October 22, 2012, the Journal filed a complaint in Providence County Superior Court, alleging violations of, inter alia, the APRA, the United States Constitution, and the Rhode Island Constitution. On March 5, 2013, pursuant to the Journal’s request, defendants provided the Journal with a Vaughn index 4 of each item withheld by the government.', 'In due course, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. In the Journal’s motion, it argued that summary judgment should be granted because it was entitled to the requested records pursuant to the APRA. In response, defendants argued that public disclosure of the requested records would be inconsistent with the District Court’s expungement order in Caleb’s case. The defendants also argued that the records were exempt from public disclosure pursuant to the APRA, which deems not to be public “[a]ll records maintained by law enforcement agencies for criminal law enforcement and all records relating to the detection and 3', 'In addition, this letter provided that it was to serve as “a new request, this time under the recently amended [APRA] * * *, which became effective September 1, 2012, for all records relating to Caleb Chafee * * * and the investigation which arose from occurrences at his home on May 28, 2012 * * *.” Before us, both parties in their arguments rely on the APRA as amended in 2012. 4', 'A “Vaughn index” is “[a] comprehensive list of all documents that the government wants to shield from disclosure in Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) litigation, each document being accompanied by a statement of justification for nondisclosure.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1788 (10th ed. 2014).

Kirby, 529 A.2d 633, 637 (R.I. 1987)).', 'However, a trial justice’s determination in balancing the public interest in disclosure against the privacy interests at stake presents a mixed question of law and fact, and we accord such questions the same amount of deference that we provide to a trial justice’s findings of fact. See Direct Action for Rights and Equality v. Gannon, 819 A.2d 651, 662 (R.I. 2003). “[W]e will not overturn a trial justice’s findings of fact absent a showing that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.” Id.', '-6-', 'III', 'Discussion', 'In 1979, the General Assembly enacted the APRA in recognition that “[t]he public’s right to access to public records and the individual’s right to dignity and privacy are both * * * principles of the utmost importance in a free society.” Section 38-2-1, as enacted by P.L. 1979, ch. 202, § 1. Thus, the General Assembly provided a two-fold function of the APRA: “The purpose of this chapter is to facilitate public access to public records. It is also the intent of this chapter to protect from disclosure information about particular individuals maintained in the files of public bodies when disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” Id. In addition, “this Court has ‘long recognized that the underlying policy of the APRA favors the free flow and disclosure of information to the public.’” In re New England Gas Co., 842 A.2d 545, 551 (R.I. 2004) (quoting Providence Journal Co. v. Sundlun, 616 A.2d 1131, 1134 (R.I. 1992)).', 'In recognition of these competing purposes, the General Assembly carefully defined, on the one hand, what is subject to public disclosure and, on the other, what is protected. See § 38- 2-2. Specifically, to perform its purpose of “facilitat[ing] public access to public records[,]” the APRA pronounces a general rule of disclosure, providing:', '“Except as provided in § 38-2-2(4), all records maintained or kept on file', 'by any public body, whether or not those records are required by any law or by', 'any rule or regulation, shall be public records and every person or entity shall', 'have the right to inspect and/or copy those records at such reasonable time as may', 'be determined by the custodian thereof.” Section 38-2-3(a). However, the exception provided in § 38-2-2(4) serves to curtail this general rule of disclosure by defining “public records” to include only certain records. These limitations illustrate the', '-7- General Assembly’s desire to “protect from disclosure information * * * when disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.” Section 38-2-1.', 'Section 38-2-2(4) defines “public records,” in pertinent part, as, “all documents, papers, letters, maps, books, tapes, photographs, films, sound recordings, magnetic or other tapes, electronic data processing records, computer stored data * * * or other material * * * made or received pursuant to law or ordinance or in connection with the transaction of official business by any agency.” However, the provision continues by providing that certain records “shall not be deemed public.” Id. Among those records deemed to not be public, are:', '“All records maintained by law enforcement agencies for criminal law', 'enforcement and all records relating to the detection and investigation of crime,', 'including those maintained on any individual or compiled in the course of a', 'criminal investigation by any law enforcement agency. Provided, however, such', 'records shall not be deemed public only to the extent that the disclosure of the', 'records or information * * * could reasonably be expected to constitute an', 'unwarranted invasion of personal privacy[.]” G.L. 1956 § 38-2-2(4)(D)(c). It is this provision—exempting from disclosure records that “could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,” id.—that forms the basis of this appeal. 5', 'Because the APRA mirrors the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. § 552, we look to federal case law interpreting FOIA to assist in our interpretation of the APRA. See, e.g., In re New England Gas Co., 842 A.2d at 551. Like the APRA, the FOIA provides for public 5', 'In an effort to avoid the interpretation of the APRA entirely, the state contends that the fact Caleb’s records were expunged precludes their disclosure under the APRA. Specifically, the state cites to G.L. 1956 chapter 1.3 of title 12, the general “Expungement of Criminal Records” statute, which provides that, “[w]henever the records of any conviction and/or probation of an individual for the commission of a crime have been expunged under the provisions of this chapter, any custodian of the records of conviction relating to that crime shall not disclose the existence of the records upon inquiry from any source * * *,” subject to certain exceptions not applicable here. Section 12-1.3-4(c). However, it is unclear whether Caleb’s expungement was granted under chapter 1.3 of title 12, or, rather, pursuant to another statute. Because we conclude that the records should not be disclosed in accordance with the APRA and that Caleb’s privacy interest is sufficient to preclude disclosure without consideration of the expungement, we need not determine the effect of the expungement on the records at issue.', '-8- disclosure of records unless those records fall within one or more of the several exemptions. See National Archives and Records Administration v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157, 160 (2004). One such exemption, 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(C), “excuses from disclosure ‘records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes’ if their production ‘could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.’” Favish, 541 U.S. at 160 (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(C)).', 'In Favish, 541 U.S. at 171-75, the United States Supreme Court considered the applicability of this exemption to certain photographs depicting the condition of a decedent’s body at the scene of death. In so doing, the Court stated that “[t]he term ‘unwarranted’ requires us to balance the * * * privacy interest against the public interest in disclosure.” Id. at 171. To effectuate this balance, the Court provided a two-step process by which a citizen must prove that it is entitled to disclosure of the records. Specifically, it provided that: “First, the citizen must show that the public interest sought to be advanced is a significant one, an interest more specific than having the information for its own sake. Second, the citizen must show the information is likely to advance that interest. Otherwise, the invasion of privacy is unwarranted.” Id. at 172. In our opinion, the framework that the Supreme Court sets forth in Favish is sound; thus, we follow this example and adopt this scheme in our interpretation of the APRA.', 'As a threshold matter, we address the Journal’s contention that this Court’s adoption of the interpretation of the FOIA in Favish would displace the burden that the APRA places upon the public body to demonstrate that “the record in dispute can be properly withheld from public inspection.” Section 38-2-10. What the Journal fails to recognize in making this argument is that the FOIA contains a nearly identical statutory provision. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B) (granting the district court “jurisdiction to enjoin the agency from withholding agency records', '-9- and to order the production of any agency records improperly withheld from the complainant * * * and the burden is on the agency to sustain its action”). In Favish, 541 U.S. at 172, the Supreme Court observed that “[t]o effect [the balance of privacy interest against the public interest in disclosure] and to give practical meaning to the exemption, the usual rule that the citizen need not offer a reason for requesting the information must be inapplicable.” We agree, and so we place the same gloss upon the APRA.', 'We now proceed to the thrust of the Journal’s appeal. Here, the Journal seeks the investigatory files related to the facts underlying the charge of a private individual in hopes of potentially uncovering some hint of impropriety.', 'Like Favish, where the Court dealt with “photographic images and other data pertaining to an individual who died under mysterious circumstances,” the justification most likely to satisfy the APRA’s public interest requirement “is that the information is necessary to show the investigative agency or other responsible officials acted negligently or otherwise improperly in the performance of their duties.” Favish, 541 U.S. at 173. Of course, this standard would be toothless if disclosure were required based upon mere speculation, without the need to provide some evidence of negligence or impropriety. See id. at 174. Thus, we hold, in line with Favish, that:', '“[W]here there is a privacy interest protected by [G.L. 1956 § 38-2-2(4)(D)(c)]', 'and the public interest being asserted is to show that responsible officials acted', 'negligently or otherwise improperly in the performance of their duties, the', 'requester must establish more than a bare suspicion in order to obtain disclosure.', 'Rather, the requester must produce evidence that would warrant a belief by a', 'reasonable person that the alleged Government impropriety might have occurred.”', 'Favish, 541 U.S. at 174.', 'Before assessing whether the Journal presented any such evidence in this case, we pause to address the Journal’s contention that the standard presented in Favish, 541 U.S. at 174, is inapplicable to the case at hand. Specifically, it contends that this “governmental impropriety”', '- 10 - standard should apply only when the sole alleged public interest is government impropriety. See Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. United States Department of Justice, 746 F.3d 1082, 1095 & n.5 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (declining to apply the standard announced in Favish where no impropriety was alleged on the part of the FBI or the DOJ). It then asserts that it alleged two public interests in the case at hand:', '(i) discovering potential government impropriety; and (ii) disclosing to the public how the State Police investigated the Governor under the circumstances. For our purposes, however, this is a distinction without a difference: the Journal’s second alleged public interest amounts to nothing more than another way of describing the first. Put another way, the information that the Journal hopes to uncover under its second asserted public interest is, in fact, government impropriety. Thus, to accept the Journal’s argument that there are two public interests in the case at hand would allow parties to avoid the Favish standard merely by exercising creative semantics. We decline this invitation. We do not, however, foreclose the possibility that the Favish standard may be inapplicable where a party asserts an authentic secondary public interest. 6 6', 'The Journal also contends that the public interest was increased by (i) “the fact that the State Police were investigating a possible violation of such an important law [(the Social Host Law)]”; and (ii) “the close relationship under Rhode Island law between the State Police, the Governor, and his family * * *.” With regard to the public interest in viewing the implementation of the Social Host Law, the Journal’s argument is unavailing. Any information provided by the investigatory documents in this isolated incident would provide facts in relation to just that—a single incident. The documents would not provide the public with any indication of how this law is enforced generally. See Hunt v. Federal Bureau of Investigation, 972 F.2d 286, 288-89 (9th Cir. 1992) (contrasting a FOIA request for a single investigatory file with requests for numerous disciplinary files and concluding that “[t]he single file * * * will not shed any light on whether all such FBI investigations are comprehensive”). With regard to the close relationship between the Governor and the State Police, we note that this appears to be yet another circuitous way of describing the “government impropriety” public interest. That is, the public interest in the contents of the investigatory documents would flow from whether the State Police adequately investigated the then-Governor, or whether corners were cut. Further, such a relationship between the Governor and the State Police will be present in any investigation or interaction involving the two. Thus, if we were to allow this relationship to rise to the level of a significant', '- 11 -', 'We now turn our analysis to whether the Journal has presented evidence that “the information is necessary to show the investigative agency or other responsible officials acted negligently or otherwise improperly in the performance of their duties.” Favish, 541 U.S. at 173. In conducting our review, we remain mindful that “there is a presumption of legitimacy accorded to the Government’s official conduct * * * [and] where the presumption is applicable, clear evidence is usually required to displace it.” Id. at 174. Even without the disclosure of the contents of the sought after records, it is clear that the State Police performed a comprehensive investigation of Caleb’s violation of the Social Host Law.', 'Indeed, the volume of records requested under the APRA illustrates that a thorough investigation was performed. The Vaughn index (which was provided to the Journal) indicates that the investigation resulted in the compilation of 186 pages of documents, including at least eighteen witness statements, seven narrative documents from members of the State Police, incident reports, and land evidence records. In addition, the investigation resulted in charging Caleb under the Social Host Law. The Journal has not pointed to a shred of evidence to suggest that “the investigative agency or other responsible officials acted negligently or otherwise improperly,” id. at 173, other than to speculate as to the mere possibility that some venality or irregularity may have occurred in the investigation due to the then-Governor’s position.', 'When the release of sensitive personal information is at stake and the alleged public interest is rooted in government wrongdoing, we do not deal in potentialities—rather, the seeker of information must provide some evidence that government negligence or impropriety was afoot. Because the Journal failed to provide any such evidence, the public interest can, at best, be characterized merely as an uncorroborated public interest without proof of some impropriety, then nearly every investigation by the State Police involving the Governor would be subject to disclosure as a matter of course. We decline to give the mere presence of a relationship such a pervasive effect.', '- 12 - possibility of governmental negligence or impropriety. Such a tenuous “public interest” is insufficient to mandate disclosure under the Favish standard that we today adopt and thereby imbue upon the APRA.', 'While we conclude that the Journal failed to satisfy the Favish standard, we nonetheless continue our analysis (for the sake of completeness and to provide future guidance) to weigh the seemingly negligible public interests asserted by the Journal against the privacy interests at stake. The parties vigorously dispute the proper valuation of the privacy interests in this case. The Journal contends that (i) Caleb’s privacy interest was substantially diminished because of the publicity that the incident received in the media and because he pled nolo contendere to violating the Social Host Law; (ii) the then-Governor’s privacy interest was de minimis because his “status as a public official operates to reduce his cognizable interest in privacy” (quoting Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. United States Department of Justice, 846 F. Supp. 2d 63, 71 (D.D.C. 2012)); and (iii) the identities of third-persons who provided witness statements were “reasonably segregable” and, thus, could be redacted to prevent any invasion of privacy. 7', 'Turning first to Caleb, we place little stock in the Journal’s contention that his privacy interest was significantly diminished because of the publicity that his charge for violating the Social Host Law received. Notably, a copy of the summons and complaint were produced to the Journal, which confirmed the existence of a charge against him. While the media coverage may have made known to the public the existence of the charge, it certainly did not reveal the intimate details underlying the charge. The privacy interest at stake flows not from the widespread knowledge of the fact that Caleb was charged, but, instead, from the information and personal 7', 'Both parties agree that the third-party identities could be redacted and, thus, none of their privacy interests are implicated by disclosure of the records. Accordingly, we do not consider the third-party privacy interests for purposes of our analysis.', '- 13 - details that may have been discovered in the police investigation. Moreover, while the charge was, in fact, public, “the fact that ‘an event is not wholly private does not mean that an individual has no interest in limiting disclosure or dissemination of the information.’” United States Department of Justice v. Reporters Commission For Freedom of Press, 489 U.S. 749, 770 (1989) (quoting Rehnquist, Is an Expanded Right of Privacy Consistent with Fair and Effective Law Enforcement?, Nelson Timothy Stephens Lectures, University of Kansas Law School, pt. 1, p. 13 (Sept. 26-27, 1974)). Therefore, we find the Journal’s argument in this regard unconvincing.', 'Similarly, we see no merit with regard to the Journal’s contention that Caleb is entitled to lesser privacy because he pled nolo contendere to violating the Social Host Law. While the plea might lessen the privacy extended to the conviction, it does not do so with respect to the facts underlying it. Indeed, in American Civil Liberties Union v. United States Department of Justice, 655 F.3d 1, 7 (D.C. Cir. 2011), on which the Journal relies, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals provided “that the disclosure of convictions and public pleas is at the lower end of the privacy spectrum.” However, the court in that case was dealing with only the disclosure of the fact of conviction, not the facts underlying the conviction or information provided in the investigation of the crime. See id. at 8 (“It would disclose only information concerning a conviction or plea; it would not disclose mere charges or arrests. It would disclose only information that has already been the subject of a public proceeding (either a trial or public guilty plea), rather than actions (like arrests) that may not have taken place in public.”). Thus, the Journal’s argument that Caleb’s privacy interest in the police investigative documents was diminished because he pled nolo contendere also lacks force. 8 8', 'In addition, we note that the distinction between the existence of a plea and the facts underlying the charges that gave rise to such a plea is further supported by practicality: it is a common', '- 14 -', 'In the case of the documents developed by law enforcement in the investigation of a private individual, the privacy interest is considerable and should not be easily displaced absent a particularly noteworthy public interest. See Reporters Commission for Freedom of Press, 489 U.S. at 769, 771 (“We have * * * recognized the privacy interest in keeping personal facts away from the public eye. * * * The privacy interest in a rap sheet is substantial.”). As such, we are satisfied that Caleb’s privacy interest is significant, 9 and, consequently, we cannot allow the Journal’s unsubstantiated assertion—pointing to the mere possibility that government impropriety occurred in the investigation due to the then-Governor’s position—to mandate disclosure of sensitive information. 10 Accordingly, we cannot conclude “that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong,” Direct Action for Rights and Equality, 819 A.2d at 662, in his balancing of Caleb’s privacy interest against the public interests at issue.', 'At oral argument, the Journal posed the following question: “[I]s there a good reason the people shouldn’t see what the state police did?” We answer that question in the affirmative. Pursuant to the APRA, records need not be disclosed where such disclosure could create an unwarranted invasion of privacy—here, Caleb’s privacy interest created a barrier that the public interests in disclosure as asserted by the Journal could not overcome. tactical move for a defendant to plead guilty or nolo contendere rather than take his chances in court, to avoid the exposure of unfavorable facts during a public trial. 9', 'In view of Caleb’s considerable privacy interest that would be compromised if the investigative documents were released, we need not pin down the exact valuation of the privacy interest of the then-Governor. That is, a disclosure of the records would constitute an unwarranted invasion of Caleb’s privacy; thus, the records may be withheld under the APRA regardless of the privacy interests of the then-Governor. 10', 'We note that redaction would be ineffective to reduce Caleb’s privacy interest in this case. Given the media attention that the investigation of Caleb has received from its onset, the subject of any records would be abundantly clear, even if redacted.', '- 15 -', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

47,State : v. : Tony Gonzalez. :,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. The defendant, Tony Gonzalez, appeals from his conviction following a jury trial in Kent County Superior Court. The defendant was convicted of one count of murder in the first degree, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-23-1; one count of assault with intent to commit murder, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-1; one count of “discharg[ing] a firearm while committing a crime of violence, to wit, murder, resulting in the death of Carl Cunningham, Jr.,” in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-47-3.2; and one count of “discharg[ing] a firearm while committing a crime of violence, to wit, assault with intent to commit murder,” in violation of § 11-47-3.2. On appeal, Mr. Gonzalez contends that the trial justice erred in failing to grant his motion to suppress certain evidence that was obtained as a result of his warrantless arrest in his home.', 'He specifically posits that “neither exigent circumstances nor consent justified the failure of [the] * * * police to obtain a warrant * * *.” Mr. Gonzalez also argues on appeal that the trial justice erred in failing to “remove two biased jurors” from the jury or, in the alternative, grant a mistrial.', '-1-', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court and remand the case for a new trial.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On May 22, 2012, a Kent County grand jury indicted Mr. Gonzalez on the aforementioned four charges: one count of first-degree murder; one count of assault with an intent to commit murder; one count of discharging a firearm while committing a crime of violence, to wit, murder; and one count of discharging a firearm while committing a crime of violence, to wit, assault with an intent to commit murder. The charges against defendant arose out of a shooting which caused the death of Carl Cunningham, Jr. In order to provide some preliminary orientation with respect to the factual and legal matters that are addressed in the following pages, we begin by simply noting that it is undisputed that Mr. Cunningham was shot to death in January of 2012 in a home on Nausaucket Road in Warwick, Rhode Island, and that Patricia Dalomba and Matthew Chivers were also present in that home at the time of the shooting.1 The police quickly had ample reason to suspect that defendant, Tony Gonzalez, was the person who had shot Mr. Cunningham.', 'Immediately preceding the start of defendant’s jury trial, a hearing was held regarding defendant’s motion to suppress. On appeal, he alleges that the following should have been suppressed: (1) his statement regarding the location of the gun which the police were asking him about during the course of his arrest; and (2) certain evidence derived from the search of his 1', 'According to the testimony of Officer Stephen Major at trial, Mr. Cunningham died at 12:33 a.m. on January 22, 2012. Mr. Cunningham’s death was caused by a shooting which occurred shortly before midnight on January 21, 2012.', '-2- residence following his arrest.2 We relate below, in pertinent part, what occurred at the motion to suppress hearing.', 'A', 'The Hearing on Defendant’s Motion to Suppress', 'The basis of defendant’s motion to suppress was his contention that his arrest was unlawful because the police did not have a warrant to enter his home and arrest him. The parties do not dispute the fact that the police did not have either an arrest warrant or a search warrant when they entered defendant’s home and arrested him.', '1. The Testimony of Detective Thomas Digregorio', 'Detective Thomas Digregorio testified that he was employed by the Warwick Police Department on the date in question. He stated that his involvement with the instant case began when he was “called in on the investigation” in the early morning hours of January 22, 2012. He further testified that, shortly after being called in, he and Det. Timothy Grant interviewed Matthew Chivers, who was present during the shooting of Carl Cunningham, Jr., which shooting had occurred around midnight. The following is the information which Det. Digregorio stated was provided by Mr. Chivers:', '“He told us that he had been dating a woman who lives at that', 'house where the homicide occurred name Patricia Dalomba; that', 'he had been dating her approximately the past month, since', 'December of 2011. He stated that about three days prior he had', 'spoken with Patricia’s ex-boyfriend on the phone. According to', 'Mr. Chivers, Patricia was getting harassing phone calls and texts', 'from her ex-boyfriend who’s [sic] name was Tony. He didn’t know', 'Tony’s last name. He said that about three days prior to us', 'speaking to him he talked to Tony on the phone after he, Tony had 2', 'The specific items discovered during the search which defendant contends should have been suppressed are: “a black Taurus handgun case, a 9 mm magazine, receipt for a gun purchase from D&L gun store, a black bubble vest, [gray] Timberland boots, a black jacket, and a multi- colored scarf.”', '-3-', 'called Patricia, and he told Tony that in no uncertain terms to stop', 'calling and texting her and harassing her. * * * The afternoon prior', '[to the murder], Mr. Chivers received a phone call from Tony', 'Gonzalez stating that he was going to catch him sleeping, and he', 'took that as a threat. * * * [H]e also stated that Tony * * * had', 'come to the house to fight him at about midnight that night.” Detective Digregorio went on to state that the investigation quickly revealed that Tony Gonzalez had entered Ms. Dalomba’s house and fired several shots, striking Mr. Cunningham, who happened to be in the house along with Mr. Chivers and Ms. Dalomba. Mr. Cunningham was killed as a result of the shooting.', 'It was Det. Digregorio’s testimony that he and Det. Grant “went to a couple of locations in Providence in order to try to locate the defendant because he was on the run at that point and [they] were afraid of destruction of evidence, but also [they] were afraid that given the fact that he was armed and dangerous, that he might be a threat to others * * *.” He proceeded to state that, when defendant was eventually located at his home in Providence, he and Det. Grant met up with Providence police officers and other detectives from the Warwick Police Department at Providence Police Substation 7, from which location the group of law enforcement officers all proceeded to defendant’s apartment. Detective Digregorio then testified that, after defendant’s arrest in his apartment, defendant’s mother, Cira Gonzalez, gave written consent to a search of the apartment at 8:10 a.m. on January 22, 2012; he added that she was calm at the time she gave consent.', 'On cross-examination, Det. Digregorio was specifically asked why the police did not obtain an arrest warrant to arrest Mr. Gonzalez and he replied:', '“We went to Mr. Gonzalez’s house about seven hours after the', 'murder had occurred. Being involved in several homicides and', 'being the case agent on at least two of them, I know that things', 'evolve quickly and everybody doesn’t have full information * * *.', 'In this case we had a homicide that occurred in the city of', '-4-', 'Warwick where there’s a fugitive on the loose that’s armed. We try', 'to track that individual and ultimately did to prevent any further', 'loss of life, including his. Sometimes people that murder take their', 'own lives. We also try to prevent any destruction of evidence. All', 'those things happen very quickly, and given the facts and', 'circumstances I feel it was the right thing to do. There wasn’t time.', 'Time was of the essence at that point. * * * We were trying to', 'track down Mr. Gonzalez to try and prevent a violent fugitive who', 'was armed, who might be a danger to himself and others, and who', 'might be trying to get rid of evidence. To sit down at a desk and', 'type out a warrant at that point in time to me was a waste of', 'resources, in my opinion.”', '2. The Testimony of Detective Timothy Grant', 'Detective Timothy Grant was a detective in the Warwick Police Department on January 22, 2012. Detective Grant testified that, “shortly after one o’clock in the morning” on that date, he was “advised to come back to work to assist * * * in a homicide investigation.” According to his testimony, it had been shortly after midnight that the Warwick Police Department “got the call” about the homicide. Detective Grant then testified that, when he arrived at the station, he was told that a man named “Tony Gonzalez” had “shot and killed an individual named Carl Cunningham.” Detective Grant stated that, later that morning, he and Det. Digregorio were following some leads in Providence when they received a phone call from Detective Sergeant LeBlanc “indicating that the Defendant may be at his mother’s address [(where defendant was also living)] in the Chad Brown housing complex” in Providence. According to Det. Grant, Det. Sgt. LeBlanc indicated that he had come by that information “through a controlled phone call with the Defendant’s brother,” Juan Zachary Garcia.3 3', 'Detective Timothy Grant explained that the “controlled call” which he referenced was a phone call made by defendant’s brother to defendant with Det. Eric Johnson and another uniformed officer present. According to Det. Grant’s testimony, it was during that phone call that the officers learned that defendant was at his mother’s apartment. On redirect examination, Det. John McHale of the Warwick Police Department (see Part I.A.4 infra) testified with respect', '-5-', 'It was the further testimony of Det. Grant that he and Det. Digregorio arrived at Providence Police Substation 7 “shortly before 7:00 a.m.” on January 22. He added that they “waited for additional Warwick personnel to arrive * * *.” He next testified that Warwick and Providence officers subsequently “took a caravan”4 to 48 June Street, Apartment J in Providence—defendant’s mother’s apartment, where defendant was living; Det. Grant added that the officers set up a perimeter around the apartment.', 'It was subsequently Det. Grant’s testimony that, before the police set up the perimeter, they had received information from defendant’s brother that defendant “typically [slept] with a handgun under his pillow.” From Det. Grant’s perspective, that fact created a “huge officer safety issue;” he added that the police had additional concerns about officer safety due to the nature of the crime that defendant was suspected of having committed. Moreover, Det. Grant stated that the police were concerned about the destruction of evidence, and he also said that they had been told, by the mother of Patricia Dalomba, that in the latter’s conversations with defendant he had acknowledged that he owned a firearm, carried a firearm, and liked to shoot at the range.', 'Detective Grant’s testimony then returned to the arrest of defendant. He testified that he observed a woman answer the door to the apartment, which woman was “later identified as the Defendant’s mother, Cira Gonzalez;” he added that she “exchange[d] words” with an officer and “allowed an entrance into the house,” but Det. Grant acknowledged that he did not hear the “exact conversation.”', 'On cross-examination, Det. Grant stated that the time between Ms. to the timing of the “controlled call,” stating that it took place “in the area of 6, 6:15” in the morning. 4', 'Detective Grant testified on cross-examination that the caravan consisted of three “marked cruisers” and a “couple of detective units.”', '-6- Gonzalez opening the door of the apartment and the officers entering the apartment was “ten, fifteen seconds.”', 'It was Det. Grant’s further testimony that he then entered the house behind members of the Providence Police Department; he stated that about six officers entered before him. According to his testimony, he then proceeded to ascend the stairs and saw “Providence Police officers with a subject on the ground attempting to handcuff him.” He also testified that the officers arresting defendant were asking him, even before he was handcuffed and the arrest was effectuated, where his firearm was and that defendant stated in response: “‘It’s not here.’”', 'Detective Grant added that he was later informed that consent to search the premises had been granted by both defendant and defendant’s mother. He testified that he proceeded to search defendant’s bedroom, adding that that search resulted in the discovery of a black vest, a black jacket, and a black scarf—which items were consistent with “what [he] knew to be the items that Defendant wore on the previous evening of the shooting.”', '3. The Testimony of Officer Joseph Dosreis', 'Officer Joseph Dosreis testified that, as of the time of trial, he had been a patrol officer with the Providence Police Department for over seventeen years. He proceeded to testify that, on January 22, 2012, he met Warwick detectives at a Providence substation “in regards to an ongoing search for a wanted subject.” According to his testimony, he was told by other police officers that the suspect “should be” in possession of a weapon and “maybe [sic] in his bedroom sleeping with his weapon under his pillow.”', 'The further testimony of Officer Dosreis indicated that a little after 7:00 a.m. he drove to defendant’s residence in a marked police car, in uniform, wearing a bulletproof vest, and “assum[ed] [his] position[]” at the front door to the apartment; he added that a “couple of', '-7- officers” were behind him. He further testified that his firearm was holstered but that the other officers behind him had their firearms “displayed.” Officer Dosreis added that, in entering the apartment and effectuating the arrest of defendant, he used a “tactical shield,” which he described as a “protective shield similar to that of a riot type shield * * * extending your body armor.”', 'According to Officer Dosreis’s testimony, he proceeded to knock on the front door and was asked who it was, to which he responded “‘Providence Police;’” he stated that the door was subsequently opened by a middle-aged, Hispanic female.', 'Officer Dosreis testified that he identified himself again and twice asked for information regarding “where Tony was.” He testified that, out of concern for his own safety, it was a hurried conversation; he said, however, that, despite it being a hurried conversation, he and the woman “had eye contact.” He stated: “I asked for Tony, where is he, where is he. And I was under the impression that he would be up in the bedroom so I looked and she looked up toward the stairs * * *.” He further testified that the woman “indicated with her eyes and gestured toward the top of the stairs.” He added that he then entered the apartment and proceeded to “sprint” up the stairs while loudly identifying himself.', 'It was his testimony that once upstairs he saw a man fitting the description of defendant, whom he “shoved to the ground, with the use of the shield.” He added, on cross- examination, that he had his gun drawn at the time he “sprint[ed]” up the stairs.', 'Officer Dosreis’s testimony indicated that, once he had defendant on the ground and was attempting to handcuff him, he asked repeatedly where the gun was, to which defendant responded: “‘It’s not here. It’s not in the bedroom. I don’t have a gun.’”', '-8-', '4. The Testimony of Detective John McHale', 'Detective John McHale testified next. He stated that he was an officer in the Warwick Police Department. According to his testimony, on the morning of January 22, 2012, he and Detective Joseph Mee “spoke with” Patricia Dalomba for about an hour and a half, beginning at 1:30 a.m. He testified that she identified the shooter as Tony Gonzalez, her ex-boyfriend, whom she still saw on a regular basis; he added that she stated that Mr. Gonzalez was known to carry a black nine millimeter handgun “everywhere he goes.”', 'Detective McHale further testified that, after defendant was arrested, he and Patrolman Greg Johnson transported defendant from the apartment to the police station. He stated that, during that drive, they pulled the police cruiser over in a parking lot and Patrolman Johnson read a “consent to search form” to defendant through the open back door of the police cruiser. He further testified that Mr. Gonzalez was uncuffed and was “afforded the opportunity” to read the form. According to Det. McHale’s testimony, after reading the form, Mr. Gonzalez ultimately signed it. He added that defendant did not appear to be under the influence of any drugs or alcohol at the time he signed the consent to search form.', 'On cross-examination, Det. McHale testified that the police did not get a warrant to arrest defendant because they knew he had “shot Carl Cunningham several times, had a weapon that he carries all the time, and you don’t know what the person’s going to do once they leave with that weapon. They could have got rid of the weapon, hurt someone else, or [himself]. * * * Time is of the essence.” On redirect examination, he added that the police had to act quickly in arresting defendant because the controlled call “informed” defendant that the police were looking for him.', '-9-', '5. The Testimony of Detective Joseph Mee', 'Detective Joseph Mee testified that, at the time of trial, he had been with the Warwick Police Department for approximately ten years. He testified that, when he was called into work approximately sixteen minutes after midnight on the morning of January 22, 2012, he was told about the shooting death of Carl Cunningham, Jr. on Nausaucket Road in Warwick; he added the following:', '“What we were told was that the suspect, Tony Gonzalez, there', 'was some back and forth with text messaging and phone calls in', 'relation to him and Matt Chivers possibly getting into some type of', 'fight. Tony Gonzalez shows up at the house shortly before', 'midnight, wanted to fight with Matt Chivers. Matt Chivers was', 'inside the residence looking out the window. He saw a couple of', 'vehicles drive by, saw figures walking up the driveway. He', 'returned to the back bedroom where he met with Patricia Dalomba.', 'A short time later Cunningham, who was on the couch, had made', 'his way back to the rear bedroom and the three of them were in the', 'bedroom when Tony Gonzalez, the suspect, entered the residence,', 'made his way back to the back bedroom, obviously without', 'consent, and began shooting inside the residence in the back', 'bedroom.” It was Det. Mee’s testimony that he and Det. McHale then conducted an interview at the police station with Patricia Dalomba; he added that she told him that Mr. Gonzalez carried a gun “pretty much on an everyday basis.” It was also his testimony that Ms. Dalomba not only witnessed the shooting but also saw defendant leave her house after the shooting and enter a vehicle. On cross- examination, Det. Mee indicated that he had learned from other detectives that Mr. Chivers was in the closet at the time of the shooting, making Ms. Dalomba the only eyewitness.', 'It was Det. Mee’s further testimony that, after defendant was arrested, defendant’s mother brought clothes downstairs for him to wear while being taken to the police station and that the gray boots which she brought were “something that was described by Patricia Dalomba” as the footwear which defendant “had worn the previous evening.”', '- 10 -', 'The testimony of Det. Mee then addressed Ms. Gonzalez’s consent to search the apartment. He stated that he read the consent to search form to her and allowed her to read it herself. He added that she subsequently signed it and, after learning that Mr. Gonzalez’s consent had also been obtained, he proceeded to search Mr. Gonzalez’s bedroom. It was his testimony that that search uncovered “an open black gun case,” “miscellaneous gun parts,” “a magazine which was almost fully loaded,” and “a receipt from D & L Gun Store in Warwick, Rhode Island” that reflected the purchase of a “nine millimeter Taurus” (which, according to the detective’s testimony, was the type of gun that Ms. Dalomba told him Mr. Gonzalez customarily carried). Additionally, he stated that during the search of defendant’s bedroom the police seized “a bubble vest,” “a black and blue and white scarf,” and “a black jacket;” he stated that they also seized the gray boots Ms. Gonzalez had brought downstairs for her son to wear. According to Det. Mee, all of those items matched Ms. Dalomba’s description of what Mr. Gonzalez had been wearing during the shooting.', '6. The Testimony of Cira Gonzalez', 'Cira Gonzalez testified that she is defendant’s mother and that defendant was living with her at 48 June Street in Providence at the time of his arrest. She testified that, when she opened the door for the police on January 22, 2012, she “saw a whole bunch of cops with shields and guns;”5 she added that she “didn’t say [any]thing.” She answered in the affirmative when asked whether or not the officers’ guns were drawn. It was her testimony that, when she opened the door, the police “didn’t say nothing. They just all pushed me back and they all went upstairs. * * * [T]hey just walked in yelling ‘Where’s Tony? Where’s Tony?’” She stated that, 5', 'Ms. Gonzalez later clarified that the “whole bunch of cops” she initially saw at the door consisted of three officers.', '- 11 - when she indicated in the direction of the upstairs in response to their question, they were already upstairs.', 'On cross-examination, Ms. Gonzalez added that she did not hear the police identify themselves before she opened the door to the apartment. She was questioned regarding whether the officers pushed her out of the way when they entered the apartment, and she made the following statement: “I mean, they didn’t actually push, you know?” When she was then asked whether the police walked in gently she stated: “Not gently, They just pushed, you know. They walked in, and, you know, I had no other choice but to walk back because they were walking in.” She further testified that the police never physically put their hands on her. During the course of cross-examination, Ms. Gonzalez answered in the affirmative when asked if she “pointed” up the stairs in response to the officers asking her the location of her son.', '7. The Decision of the Trial Justice', 'Cira Gonzalez was the last witness to testify at the hearing on the motion to suppress. The attorneys were then given an opportunity to argue before the trial justice made his ruling.', 'The first issue addressed was the statement of defendant regarding the gun not being in the apartment, which he made during his arrest and before he was read his Miranda rights. The trial justice denied the motion to suppress that statement, finding that the question was “prudent” to ask without the “formal advisement of Miranda” given the concern for the police officers’ safety and the public safety. He specifically stated that the officer who made the arrest “had every reason to believe that [defendant] was armed.”', 'Defense counsel then addressed the voluntariness of the signing of the consent to search forms by defendant and his mother. With respect to both consents, the trial justice held that there was no evidence that they were coerced. Moreover, he stated that there was no basis for the', '- 12 - suggestion that Mr. Gonzalez’s consent was not “free and voluntary.” He therefore denied defendant’s motion to suppress the evidence on the grounds of lack of consent to search.', 'Defense counsel then proceeded to argue for suppression of the evidence due to the fact that the police did not have an arrest warrant or a search warrant. The trial justice held that there were exigent circumstances in the case that justified the failure of the police to obtain a warrant. The trial justice stated as follows:', '“It’s obvious the Warwick Police Department deployed their', 'resources in several directions. They had investigators work the', 'scene. They also had officers, it sounds to me from the testimony,', 'it’s pretty clear, Detective Mee and others were assigned to locate', 'the suspect, interview witnesses. Miss Dalomba and Mr. Chivers', 'were interviewed at the station within an hour after this incident', 'occurred; an hour or more, an hour or two. So, they just weren’t all', 'at the scene taking their time taking pictures. That’s not the picture', 'I got from the evidence.

They apprehended this fellow at six o’clock in the', 'morning, or seven o’clock in the morning.

If those aren’t exigent circumstances, I', 'don’t know what are.”', 'The trial justice made a further finding to the effect that the officers’ initial entrance into the apartment was made with Ms. Gonzalez’s consent. He stated that Ms. Gonzalez “maybe felt rushed” but that, despite the lack of verbal permission, she “allowed them to enter.” Consequently, he denied defendant’s motion to suppress evidence resulting from the arrest and the subsequent search of the apartment.', 'In due course, a jury trial was held over nine days in February of 2013. We summarize below the salient aspects of what transpired at that trial.', '- 13 -', 'B', 'The Trial', 'Seventeen witnesses testified at defendant’s trial. We note that the trial justice did not have the benefit of the testimony and evidence adduced at trial in making his ruling on defendant’s motion to suppress, but the testimony and evidence at trial are relevant to our eventual determination as to whether or not the doctrine of harmless error is applicable in the instant case. Accordingly, in reviewing the evidence and testimony admitted during the trial, we shall focus only on what is necessary for our resolution of the issue of the applicability of the harmless error doctrine.', '1. The 911 Call', 'At trial, a recording of the 911 call placed by Mr. Chivers and Ms. Dalomba was entered as an exhibit; a transcript of the call was similarly entered as an exhibit. The transcript of the 911 call reflects the fact that, during the course of the call, Mr. Chivers and Ms. Dalomba were asked a number of times who had committed the shooting. Ms. Dalomba identified the shooter as “Tony Gonzalez” several times. In addition, she was asked for and provided Mr. Gonzalez’s home address—“48 Jay June Street” in “Providence.” She provided that address three times. Moreover, she identified Mr. Gonzalez as being “Spanish,” “5 foot 5,” and twenty-four or twenty-five years old; and she provided Mr. Gonzalez’s date of birth more than once.', '2. The Testimony of Patricia Dalomba', 'Ms. Dalomba was one of the witnesses to testify at defendant’s trial. In the course of her testimony, she identified defendant as Tony Gonzalez and as the individual who shot Mr. Cunningham. She stated that she was “100 percent” positive and would “bet [her] life on it.”', '- 14 -', 'Ms. Dalomba testified that defendant was an ex-boyfriend whom she had dated for several years and had still been seeing on and off until shortly before the night of the shooting. She testified that he was jealous of her relationship with her present love interest, Mr. Chivers; she stated: “[H]e was jealous of me being in a relationship with anyone.” According to Ms. Dalomba’s testimony, earlier in the evening of January 21, 2012 (the date of the shooting) she and defendant were exchanging text messages, some of which pertained to their relationship and to her new relationship with Mr. Chivers; she added that defendant stated in one of those text messages that he was “thirsty for blood.” She also testified that Mr. Chivers and Mr. Gonzalez “traded insults” during a phone conversation around eight o’clock on the same evening. It was her further testimony that, after that phone call, defendant continued to text her, saying that he was “blood thirsty” and that Mr. Chivers is “going to be as heartless as I am.” We note that Mr. Chivers testified at trial that there were repeated text messages sent from Mr. Gonzalez to Ms. Dalomba over the course of the evening and that Mr. Gonzalez “didn’t like it” when Mr. Chivers told him to leave Ms. Dalomba alone. A redacted copy of the text messages which Ms. Dalomba exchanged with Mr. Gonzalez was admitted as an exhibit at trial, and Ms. Dalomba testified in great detail regarding what was in the text messages.', 'According to Ms. Dalomba’s testimony, the exchange of texts and phone calls among Mr. Gonzalez, Mr. Chivers, and herself culminated in Mr. Gonzalez stating that he was coming to her house (where she, Mr. Chivers, and Mr. Cunningham were located) in “ten to twelve minutes.” She further testified that, when Mr. Gonzalez arrived at her house, he was wearing “a black jacket like I think it was a bubble vest type jacket.” She added: “He had on a scarf that he had just recently bought, like a black and blue. I believe he had gray boots on.” She also testified that he was wearing “black jeans” and that she had seen the scarf he was wearing “a bunch of', '- 15 - times.” Later in her testimony, she stated that she went to the police station on January 22, after Mr. Gonzalez’s arrest, and identified the clothes seized from his apartment as the clothes he had been wearing during the shooting.', 'Ms. Dalomba stated that, when Mr. Gonzalez arrived at her house, she initially opened the front door and spoke to him; she added that she then shut the front door, retreating into the bedroom where Mr. Chivers and Mr. Cunningham were located. She further testified that Mr. Gonzalez then pushed his way into her bedroom with his gun drawn saying, “‘I got something for you. I got something for you’” and “laughing like a jeckyll [sic].” She stated that, at that point, Mr. Gonzalez had his scarf “wrapped around his mouth and over his head.” She described the gun he used as black with a six to seven inch barrel. It was also her testimony that, when Mr. Gonzalez entered the bedroom, he “pushed” her into a “pantry area” and she “started to hear gunshots.” She stated that she witnessed Mr. Gonzalez shooting in the bedroom; and she testified that, as he fled, he told her, “‘Your boys are dead.’”', '3. The Testimony of the Police', 'With the exception of Officer Dosreis, all of the police officers and detectives who testified at the hearing on the motion to suppress also testified at trial. During the course of Det. Grant’s testimony, the gun case which was seized from the foot of defendant’s bed was entered as an exhibit; according to Det. Grant’s testimony, the gun case contained “a magazine for a nine millimeter handgun, with bullets,” “grips for a handgun,” an “owner’s manual,” and “a receipt.” Detective Grant also testified that Mr. Gonzalez’s name was on the receipt, which referenced the sale of a “Taurus nine millimeter, black.”6 Detective Grant’s testimony also indicated that, in addition to the evidence which defendant argues on appeal should not have been admitted at his 6', 'The actual firearm used in the shooting was never located.', '- 16 - trial, a cell phone was also seized during the search of defendant’s bedroom. The cell phone, the vest, the scarf, and the jacket were admitted as exhibits, and Det. Grant testified that they were consistent with Ms. Dalomba’s “description of what * * * defendant wore the evening of the shooting.”', 'Detective Eric Johnson of the Warwick Police Department also testified. During his testimony, a redacted copy of the record of the incoming and outgoing calls on Mr. Gonzalez’s cell phone from the night in question was entered as an exhibit, and it reflected numerous calls between Mr. Gonzalez and Ms. Dalomba on the day of the shooting.', 'Later in the trial, Det. McHale testified that the police identified the gray boots which it was alleged Mr. Gonzalez wore at the time of the shooting while the boots were still at his house; and the boots were not entered as an exhibit. He also testified that Ms. Dalomba had identified the vest, jacket, jeans, and scarf as being items which Mr. Gonzalez was “wearing the night the incident occurred.”', '4. The Testimony of Michael Noth', 'Michael Noth testified at the trial that he knew Mr. Gonzalez from high school and had been friends with him “on and off” since high school. He further testified that, on the night of January 21, 2012, he picked up defendant “sometime around 11:30” p.m. and Mr. Gonzalez told him he needed to make a “quick” trip to Warwick in order to “sell [marijuana].” Mr. Noth testified that Mr. Gonzalez directed him to a house in Warwick; the description of the house which Mr. Noth provided in his testimony was consistent with Ms. Dalomba’s testimony regarding the fact that her home was situated behind another home. Mr. Noth proceeded to state that he dropped Mr. Gonzalez off, “drove up the street and did a U-turn,” and then came back and parked in front of the place where he had dropped off Mr. Gonzalez. He testified to “playing', '- 17 - with [his] phone for a little bit;” he said that then he observed Mr. Gonzalez “walking up * * * the driveway, and he hopped [into the car] and then [they] left.” Mr. Noth added that that took place around “11:50, 12 o’clock.” Mr. Noth further testified that, on the night in question, defendant was wearing a “black bubble vest.”', '5. The Testimony of Jimmie Lee Hutchins', 'Jimmie Lee Hutchins was the last witness to testify at the trial. He testified that he was an ex-boyfriend of Ms. Dalomba. He also stated that Mr. Cunningham was “one of [his] best friends.” It was also his testimony that he knew defendant.', 'Mr. Hutchins stated that, during the course of being transported from the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI) to court on Friday, February 1, 2013, he was in a “holding tank” at the ACI with Mr. Gonzalez. He testified that he asked Mr. Gonzalez why he had shot Mr. Cunningham. It was Mr. Hutchins’s testimony that Mr. Gonzalez “smiled” and “laughed” and that “all he would say was, ‘you know what that * * * b**** did to our heads.’” According to Mr. Hutchins, it was his understanding that Mr. Gonzalez was referring to Ms. Dalomba. Mr. Hutchins added that Mr. Gonzalez then asked how Mr. Cunningham’s parents “were doing;” Mr. Hutchins stated that he had responded: “‘How the f*** do you think they’re feeling? You killed their son.’” It was the further testimony of Mr. Hutchins that Mr. Gonzalez, referring to himself and Mr. Cunningham, responded: “‘You know how we were. We used to sit on the couch playing video games.’” Mr. Hutchins proceeded to testify that he asked Mr. Gonzalez why he continued shooting if he knew it was Mr. Cunningham that he was shooting. Mr. Hutchins stated that, in response, defendant “laughed, shook his head, and that was the point where he just didn’t say anything anymore. He just wouldn’t give me an answer. He just laughed about it.”', '- 18 -', '6. Closing Argument', 'Following Mr. Hutchins’s testimony, the state rested. The defense then rested without presenting any witnesses.', 'During the prosecutor’s closing argument, she discussed Ms. Dalomba’s credibility and stated that “her testimony, the accounts of what happened, that she gave on that stand is corroborated by the physical evidence that was obtained in this particular case.” She added that Ms. Dalomba told the jury “what the defendant was wearing” and specifically discussed the fact that Ms. Dalomba had identified the scarf which defendant was wearing the night of the shooting. She added that that same scarf was in a picture Ms. Dalomba took with defendant shortly before the shooting. The prosecutor also specifically referenced the gun box, the manual, the magazine, and the receipt for the gun purchase. Additionally, she noted that the only thing that defendant “[had to] say” when he was arrested at his residence the morning after the shooting was that the gun was not there. She referenced defendant’s statement that the gun was not at the apartment twice before concluding her argument by urging the jury to find defendant guilty of all of the counts on which he had been charged.', 'At the conclusion of the trial, the jury found defendant guilty on all counts, and he was sentenced as follows: (1) life on Count One—murder in the first degree; (2) twenty years, fifteen to serve, five years suspended and five years probation (to be served consecutively to the sentences on Counts One and Three) on Count Two—assault with intent to commit murder; (3) life (to be served consecutively to the sentence on Count One) on Count Three—discharge of a firearm while committing a murder; and (4) ten years suspended and ten years probation (to be served consecutively to the sentences on all of the other counts) on Count Four—discharge of a firearm while committing an assault with an intent to commit murder. The defendant filed a timely appeal of his conviction.', '- 19 -', 'II', 'Analysis', 'A', 'Motion to Suppress', '1. Standard of Review', 'We have previously stated that, in reviewing a trial justice’s denial of a defendant’s motion to suppress evidence, “we defer to the factual findings of the trial justice, applying a clearly erroneous standard.” State v. Patino, 93 A.3d 40, 50 (R.I. 2014), cert. denied, 135 S. Ct. 947 (2015) (mem.) (internal quotation marks omitted); see State v. Cosme, 57 A.3d 295, 299 (R.I. 2012); see also State v. Page, 709 A.2d 1042, 1044 (R.I. 1998). However, when this Court reviews “an alleged violation of a defendant’s constitutional rights, this Court must make an independent examination of the record to determine if [the defendant’s] rights have been violated.” State v. Harrison, 66 A.3d 432, 441 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Goulet, 21 A.3d 302, 311 (R.I. 2011)). Moreover, when performing this independent examination, this Court must “view the evidence in the record in the light most favorable to the state.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). As such, we will reverse a trial justice’s findings on a motion to suppress only if “(1) his or her findings concerning the challenged statements reveal clear error, and (2) our independent review of the conclusions drawn from the historical facts establishes that the defendant’s federal constitutional rights were denied.” State v. Grayhurst, 852 A.2d 491, 513 (R.I. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'When dealing with “questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact involving constitutional issues,” we conduct a “de novo review,” in accordance with Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690, 697-98 (1996). State v. Linde, 876 A.2d 1115, 1124 (R.I. 2005) (quoting', '- 20 - State v. Apalakis, 797 A.2d 440, 443 (R.I. 2002)); see State v.

An individual’s right to privacy in his home is rooted in the clear language of the Fourth Amendment: “The right of the people to be secure in their * * * houses * * * shall not be violated * * *.” U.S. Const. Amend. IV; see Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 589 (1980); see also Welsh v.

United States, 333 U.S. 10, 13-14 (1948) (footnotes omitted). In expounding on that principle, the Supreme Court has unequivocally stated that “[i]n terms that apply equally to seizures of * * * persons, the Fourth Amendment has drawn a firm line at the entrance to the house. Absent exigent circumstance, that threshold may not reasonably be crossed without a warrant.” Payton, 445 U.S. at 590. Therefore, “searches and seizures inside a home without a warrant are presumptively unreasonable.”8 Id. at 586. Moreover, this Court has recognized that fundamental principle, stating that “[t]he Fourth Amendment generally prohibits the warrantless entry of a person’s home, whether to make an arrest or to search for specific objects.” Linde, 876 A.2d at 1124 (quoting Illinois v. Rodriguez, 497 U.S. 177, 181 (1990)).', 'Since it is conceded in the instant case that the police entered defendant’s residence without a search warrant or an arrest warrant,9 in order for the arrest and the subsequent search to have been lawful, one of the few “narrowly defined and jealously guarded” exceptions to the warrant requirement must apply. State v. Beaumier, 480 A.2d 1367, 1373 (R.I. 1984).10 The 8', 'The same rules which apply to the seizure of property inside of a home also apply to the arrest of an individual inside his home; “the warrantless arrest of a person is a species of seizure required by the [Fourth] Amendment to be reasonable.” Payton v.

We shall address each of the invoked exceptions in turn.', 'a. Consent', 'It is important to note, initially, that defendant does not dispute the principle that a cohabitant, in this case defendant’s mother, may consent to the entry of police into the home they share. See State v. Hightower, 661 A.2d 948, 960 (R.I. 1995) (stating that “any coinhabitant could validly give consent to search premises shared by another person”) (citing United States v. Matlock, 415 U.S. 164, 171 (1974)).', 'Therefore, we must focus on whether or not Ms. Gonzalez’s conduct when the police came to her door on the morning of January 22, 2012 constituted legally sufficient consent to enter the apartment.', 'Consent is “[o]ne of the specifically established exceptions to the requirement[] of * * * a warrant * * *.” Linde, 876 A.2d at 1125 (internal quotation marks omitted). However, “[w]hen seeking to justify a search or seizure on consent grounds, the state must prove that the consent was ‘freely and voluntarily given.’” Bailey, 417 A.2d at 918 (quoting Bumper v. North Carolina, 391 U.S. 543, 548 (1968)). In the Fourth Amendment context, the state must prove by a “fair preponderance of the evidence” that there was free and voluntary consent. State v. O’Dell, 576 A.2d 425, 427 (R.I. 1990); see United States v. Diaz, 494 F.3d 221, 225 (1st Cir. 2007); Barkmeyer, 949 A.2d at 997. Moreover, we have followed established United States Supreme Court precedent in stating that “the question of whether consent was ‘in fact voluntary or was the product of duress or coercion, express or implied, is a question of fact to be determined from the', '- 23 - totality of all the circumstances.’” Palmigiano v. Mullen, 119 R.I. 363, 370, 377 A.2d 242, 246 (1977) (quoting Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 227 (1973)). Consequently, “[n]o single criterion is the determinative factor” in deciding whether or not there was free and voluntary consent. Beaumier, 480 A.2d at 1374.', 'Due to the fact that the determination of the voluntariness (vel non) of consent is a factual finding, it is “accorded deference and is disturbed only if it is clearly erroneous.” Barkmeyer, 949 A.2d at 995; see Patino, 93 A.3d at 50. In the past, we have adopted the language of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in stating that “[t]he operative inquiry is whether the evidence presented at the suppression hearing fairly supports the court’s finding with respect to voluntary consent.” Barkmeyer, 949 A.2d at 995 (quoting United States v. Romain, 393 F.3d 63, 69 (1st Cir. 2004)).', 'i. The Purported Consent of Ms. Gonzalez to the Entry of Officers into her Apartment', 'In the instant case, the trial justice found that Ms. Gonzalez consented to the entry of police into her home because he believed, based on the testimony at the suppression hearing, that Ms. Gonzalez allowed the police to enter. The defendant contends that that decision was in error because the consent exception to the warrant requirement did not apply in this case; he posits that the purported consent by his mother was not voluntarily and freely given, but was a “[m]ere acquiescence.” After a very thorough review of the testimony elicited at the motion to suppress hearing, and even after considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, we are unable to perceive sufficient evidence to permit us to uphold the trial justice’s conclusion that Ms. Gonzalez provided free and voluntary consent. See Harrison, 66 A.3d at 441.', 'The testimony of Officer Dosreis, who led the group of policemen who entered the apartment, reveals that he asked Ms. Gonzalez “where Tony was;” but his testimony did not', '- 24 - reflect that she said anything in response. He testified that she merely “indicated” with her eyes up the stairs. Officer Dosreis did also answer in the affirmative to a later question as to whether or not Ms. Gonzalez gestured towards the stairs. However, the just-summarized testimony simply is not sufficient evidence upon which to base a finding that Ms. Gonzalez made a free and voluntary choice to allow the police to enter the apartment; in truth, it would not even be a sufficient basis for concluding that her gesture and her indication with her eyes was anything more than a reflexive reaction to Officer Dosreis looking up the stairs. Consent is not voluntary when it is a “mere acquiescence in a show of authority.” United States v. Moreno, 701 F.3d 64, 76 (2d Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'We are well aware that consent to search can be conveyed nonverbally. See, e.g., United States v. Walls, 225 F.3d 858, 862-63 (7th Cir. 2000) (determining that there was implied consent when an individual opened the door and then stepped back to allow the police to enter); United States v. Gordon, 173 F.3d 761, 766 (10th Cir. 1999) (holding that there was consent to search when, in response to a request by police to open a bag, the defendant removed the key from his pocket and handed it to the police). However, implied consent must still meet the requirement of being free and voluntary. We have stated that, in making that determination, some of the factors that other courts have considered, and which are appropriately weighed in a review of the totality of the circumstances, include “the number of officers entering the home,” “the apprehension of a family member,” “the time of day,” and a “display of weaponry.” Beaumier, 480 A.2d at 1374; see 68 Am. Jur. 2d Searches and Seizures § 151 at 293 (2010) (“a display of weapons in the course of an arrest may be a significant indicator of a coerced consent”).', '- 25 -', 'It is very important to note that, in the instant case, it was not simply a single uniformed policeman who knocked on Ms. Gonzalez’s door—it was a group of at least three, possibly six, officers. The first officer was carrying a tactical shield held in front of him, and the officers directly behind him were standing at the door to Ms. Gonzalez’s apartment with their guns “displayed.” While those facts alone are not determinative, Officer Dosreis himself candidly acknowledged that the conversation between Ms. Gonzalez and him was hurried, and Det. Grant testified with similar candor that only ten or fifteen seconds elapsed between the door being opened by Ms. Gonzalez and the officers entering the apartment. Additionally, the officers were at the apartment at around seven o’clock on a Sunday morning, demanding the location of Ms. Gonzalez’s son, whom they subsequently arrested.', 'In our judgment, these are hardly circumstances conducive to a voluntary consent.', 'In State v. O’Dell, 576 A.2d 425, 427 (R.I. 1990), this Court held that Nancy O’Dell’s actions in offering the police the keys to a house which she owned and in which her son was hiding and explicitly authorizing them to enter and search for her son clearly established by a preponderance of the evidence that the consent was free and voluntary. When the instant case is juxtaposed with O’Dell, it becomes even clearer that here there was no free and voluntary consent. Indeed, we do not consider it plausible to contend that a woman who was faced with multiple officers with their weapons drawn—one of whom was holding a tactical shield—at around seven o’clock in the morning was totally communicating a free and voluntary decision to consent to an entry into her home when she, at most, glanced up the stairs and/or gestured towards the stairs in response to the officer’s question as to the location of her son; in our judgment, a reasonable person confronted with a similar situation would not believe that he or she had been given the opportunity to give free and voluntary consent.', '- 26 -', 'Accordingly, considering the totality of the circumstances, it is our opinion that there was insufficient evidence to support the finding that Ms. Gonzalez freely and voluntarily consented to the entry of the police into her apartment. See Barkmeyer, 949 A.2d at 995; Bailey, 417 A.2d at 918; Palmigiano, 119 R.I. at 370, 377 A.2d at 246. The state certainly did not meet its burden of so proving by a preponderance of the evidence. See O’Dell, 576 A.2d at 427. As a result, based on our review of the evidence and relevant case law, we hold that the trial justice’s determination that Ms. Gonzalez consented to the entry of the police into her apartment was clearly erroneous. See Patino, 93 A.3d at 50.', 'ii. Ms. Gonzalez’s Written Consent to Search the Apartment', 'We must also assess whether Ms. Gonzalez’s later written consent to the search of the apartment was free and voluntary. See Barkmeyer, 949 A.2d at 995. The trial justice held that there was no evidence that Ms. Gonzalez was coerced into giving her written consent to search and that there was no basis for a finding that that consent was other than free and voluntary. However, after careful reflection, we find ourselves unable to agree with that conclusion. It is our opinion that the trial justice clearly erred in so concluding—because we are unable to perceive enough evidence in the record on which to base a determination that the state met its burden of proving that Ms. Gonzalez’s consent was free and voluntary by a fair preponderance of the evidence. See O’Dell, 576 A.2d at 427.', 'In conducting our review of this issue, we have remained especially cognizant of the experience of Ms. Gonzalez from the time when she opened her door at around 7:00 a.m. and the time when she signed the written consent to search, which Det. Digregorio testified was at 8:10 a.m. On that morning, she opened the door to numerous police officers, one holding a tactical shield and the others with their guns drawn, and she was asked, repeatedly, where her son was.', '- 27 - According to the testimony of Officer Grant, it was only ten to fifteen seconds between the door opening and the officers’ entry into the home. The officers then proceeded to “sprint” up the stairs and arrest her son. Soon thereafter the police took her son from the house to the police station. She was then asked to give her consent to a search of the apartment. We emphasize the relatively short amount of time under these circumstances that elapsed between the initial opening of the door and the written consent.', 'It is also important to note that, when Ms. Gonzalez was asked to provide her written consent to search, there were still several officers in her home. Detective Digregorio did testify that Ms. Gonzalez was calm when she consented, but he also stated as follows:', '“[S]he did go through a range of emotions when we were [in her', 'home]. She was generally calm, welcoming of us, but she was also', 'at several points crying because of the fact that her son was being', 'accused of this crime.” Detective Mee testified that he read the consent form to Ms. Gonzalez and allowed her to read it herself before she signed it. However, importantly, he also stated the following with regard to his conversation with Ms. Gonzalez regarding the consent to search:', '“Just explained to her that, you know, based on the circumstances', 'how we would do it is we basically go out and apply for a search', 'warrant, which would mean that an officer or two would wind up', 'staying at the house to make sure that no evidence is, you know,', 'brought out or taken in. While that was done we’d probably', 'respond back to the Warwick Police Department, type out a search', 'warrant. We’d have to contact a judge or magistrate in the city of', 'Providence, have them review it, the search warrant signed, and', 'wind up coming back and searching the residence.” His testimony then reflected the fact that he offered signing the consent to search form to Ms. Gonzalez as a second “option[].” It is clear to us, after an independent examination of the record, that the evidence presented at the suppression hearing was not sufficient to show, by a fair preponderance of the evidence, that there was no duress, either express or implied, which', '- 28 - affected Ms. Gonzalez’s signing of the consent to search form in view of the events which preceded that consent. See Barkmeyer, 949 A.2d at 995; Palmigiano, 119 R.I. at 370, 377 A.2d at 246. Consequently, we hold that her consent to search the apartment was not free and voluntary and that the trial justice committed clear error in holding to the contrary.', 'See Barkmeyer, 949 A.2d at 995.', 'b. Exigent Circumstances', 'The defendant contends on appeal that exigent circumstances did not exist in this case because of the amount of time that had elapsed between the point when the police knew the identity of the individual who allegedly committed the shooting and the moment of his eventual arrest. The state responds that it could not be reasonably argued that, in an ongoing manhunt, the police should have interrupted their investigation in the field to attempt to obtain a warrant early on a Sunday morning.', 'As a result of the protections that the Fourth Amendment provides against warrantless searches and seizures in the home, “the police bear a heavy burden when attempting to demonstrate an urgent need that might justify warrantless searches or arrests;” “[b]efore agents of the government may invade the sanctity of the home, the burden is on the government to demonstrate exigent circumstances that overcome the presumption of unreasonableness that attaches to all warrantless home entries.” Welsh, 466 U.S. at 749-50, 750. When dealing with “mixed questions of law and fact involving constitutional issues,” such as whether or not there were exigent circumstances to justify a warrantless entry into a home, we conduct a de novo review in accordance with the dictates of the United States Supreme Court in Ornelas, 517 U.S. at 697-98. See Linde, 876 A.2d at 1124 (internal quotation marks omitted).', '- 29 -', 'For this Court to conclude there was an exigency, the “ultimate test is whether there is such a compelling necessity for immediate action as will not brook the delay of obtaining a warrant.” United States v. Adams, 621 F.2d 41, 44 (1st Cir. 1980); see also Hegarty v. Somerset County, 53 F.3d 1367, 1374 (1st Cir. 1995). Moreover, we are mindful of the admonition of the United States Supreme Court to the effect that “[w]hen an officer undertakes to act as his own magistrate, he ought to be in a position to justify it by pointing to some real immediate and serious consequences if he postponed action to get a warrant.” Welsh, 466 U.S. at 751 (quoting McDonald v. United States, 335 U.S. 451, 459-60 (1948) (Jackson, J. concurring)).', 'Such immediate and serious consequences may be present if any of the following exist: the potential of the destruction of evidence inside a residence before a warrant is obtained; a risk that a suspect may escape; or a threat “posed by a suspect, to the lives or safety of the public, the police officers, or [the suspect].” Hegarty, 53 F.3d at 1374; see also Minnesota v. Olson, 495 U.S. 91, 100 (1990). This Court has stated on numerous occasions that “[w]hether circumstances rise to the level of exigency is determined by referring to the facts known to the police at the time of the arrest. * * * ‘[T]he police [must] have an objective, reasonable belief that a crisis can only be avoided by swift and immediate action.’” State v. Gonsalves, 553 A.2d 1073, 1075 (R.I. 1989) (quoting Duquette, 471 A.2d at 1363); see State v. Werner, 831 A.2d 183, 196-97 (R.I. 2003); see also Hegarty, 53 F.3d at 1375-76 (“We must isolate all reasonably reliable information collectively known to the officers at the time their challenged conduct occurred, without indulging hindsight * * * to determine whether an objectively reasonable officer, with the identical information, could have concluded that there were exigent circumstances * * *.”) (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).', '- 30 -', 'We remain “mindful that police are in the emergency service business and they usually have little or no time to leisurely consider their options or engage in protracted evaluation.” Portes, 68 A.3d at 1137; see also State v. Morin, 68 A.3d 61, 67-68 (R.I. 2013). Police officers are often confronted with rapidly unfolding and often dangerous situations that must be evaluated in context and not with the eyes of the proverbial Monday morning quarterback. However, in the instant case, the police clearly knew the identity of the person who they believed was the shooter—Mr. Gonzalez—from almost the very beginning of their investigation.11 Detectives Digregorio and Grant testified that, upon arriving at the police station very early on the morning of January 22, 2012 to assist in the investigation, they were told that “Tony Gonzalez” had committed the crime. Detective Mee specifically testified that he arrived at the Warwick Police Station at approximately sixteen minutes after midnight and was told that Mr. Gonzalez had committed the shooting. It was approximately seven o’clock in the morning when the police proceeded to defendant’s apartment to effectuate his arrest. There is no requirement that an arrest warrant include the location of the individual to be arrested. See Rule 4(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. Consequently, a warrant could have been obtained, or at least an attempt could have been made to obtain a warrant, at any time in the approximately seven hours between the time when the police had ample reason to believe that defendant had committed the shooting and his eventual arrest. The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has stated that exigent circumstances require that there be a compelling need for immediate action and “no time to secure a warrant.” Adams, 621 F.2d at 45. 11', 'We note that, although the transcript of the 911 call in the instant case was not admitted at the suppression hearing, it is very clear from that transcript that a member of the Warwick Police Department was on the phone during the call and that Ms. Dalomba identified the shooter as Mr. Gonzalez several times, giving a description and his date of birth. She even went so far as to provide Mr. Gonzalez’s home address three times. The address she provided was the same address at which defendant was eventually located and arrested.', '- 31 -', 'When the officers were asked why no attempt was made to obtain a warrant, Det. McHale testified that the police knew that defendant was potentially armed since Ms. Dalomba had told Det. Mee and him that Mr. Gonzalez was known to carry a firearm “everywhere he goes.” Detective McHale added that there was a possibility of the destruction of evidence and that defendant could “hurt someone else.”', 'He also testified that time was “of the essence.” Detective Grant’s testimony reflected his concern with respect to the destruction of evidence. He also stated that the police were told by Ms. Dalomba’s mother that Mr. Gonzalez carried a firearm; he added that defendant’s brother told the police that defendant “typically [slept] with a handgun under his pillow.” Moreover, it was Det. Grant’s testimony that the severity of the crime concerning which defendant was a suspect influenced his concerns regarding safety, particularly officer safety. In his testimony, Det. Digregorio also referenced the fact that the officers had reason to believe that defendant was armed, that there were concerns about destruction of evidence, and that there was a possibility of harm to the public or to Mr. Gonzalez himself. In accordance with consistent precedent, these various concerns of the officers were legitimate and deserved to be taken into account when determining the existence of exigency vel non and were certainly appropriately considered by the trial justice in reaching his conclusion that exigent circumstances were present in the instant case. See Hegarty, 53 F.3d at 1374. We do not seek to downplay the critical nature of those factors. However, even given the officers’ testimony regarding the facts known to them at the time of the arrest, we cannot overlook the fact that there was a period of almost seven hours during which attempts could have been made to obtain a warrant. See Gonsalves, 533 A.2d at 1075.', 'Detective Digregorio testified that there “wasn’t time” to obtain a warrant; it was his testimony that, “[t]o sit down at a desk and type out a warrant at that point in time to me was a', '- 32 - waste of resources, in my opinion.” But, in our judgment, attempting to procure a warrant during an approximately seven hour investigation would definitely not have constituted a waste of resources. A court considering a defendant’s rights under the Fourth Amendment should not be concerned with efficiency: “[T]he mere fact that law enforcement may be made more efficient can never by itself justify disregard of the Fourth Amendment. * * * The investigation of crime would always be simplified if warrants were unnecessary. But the Fourth Amendment reflects the view of those who wrote the Bill of Rights that the privacy of a person’s home and property may not be totally sacrificed in the name of maximum simplicity in enforcement of the criminal law.” Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U.S. 385, 393 (1978); see Adams, 621 F.2d at 45 (noting that exigent circumstances did not exist in a situation where the evidence suggested that “no thought at all was given to obtaining a warrant because ‘[t]here would be no reason to’”) (quoting one of the federal agents who was involved in the case). Despite the legitimate concerns of the officers involved, there is no evidence that a need for swift and immediate action existed for the entire seven hour period during which the police knew the identity of the person who they clearly believed to be the shooter that would have justified the failure of the police to even attempt to obtain a warrant. See Gonsalves, 553 A.2d at 1075.', 'By way of comparison, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that a warrantless entry into a motel room was constitutional when the suspect may have been alerted that the “police had closed in on him,” the police could see through the window that the suspect was sitting on a bed with a sawed-off shotgun next to him, and there were two women and three children in the motel room; the court stated that the situation presented was one where “the police did not have enough time to get a warrant.” United States v. Hardy, 52 F.3d 147, 148, 149 (7th Cir. 1995). Additionally, as previously referenced, the United States Court of', '- 33 - Appeals for the First Circuit has stated that exigency requires a “compelling need for official action and no time to secure a warrant.” Adams, 621 F.2d at 45. The First Circuit in that case went on to hold that a warrantless entry into Ms. Adams’s apartment to arrest an escaped convict did not meet the standard and violated Ms. Adams’s Fourth Amendment rights even though the police had reason to believe the escaped convict was in the apartment at the time they entered. Id. at 43-45. The arrest took place approximately two weeks after the convict had escaped from custody, and, at the time the convict escaped it was known that she would likely make her way to Ms. Adams’s apartment. Id. Both of these cases are emblematic of judicial concern as to whether or not there was time under the particular circumstances of a given case to obtain a warrant. Our review of the instant case suggests that it more closely parallels the factual situation in Adams since there is scarcely any evidence of the same need for immediate action or lack of time to procure a warrant as existed in Hardy.', 'The state argues that the instant case involved an ongoing manhunt in the field which could not be interrupted to obtain a warrant. It is true that we have stated that “[a]s a result of an ongoing investigation in the field” when police located a suspect they deemed to be armed and dangerous and in a “highly emotional state” less than one hour after he committed a shooting, warrantless entry into an apartment to effectuate his arrest was not a violation of the Fourth Amendment. Gonsalves, 553 A.2d at 1075, 1076. However, in that case we articulated a distinction between “emergency situations,” which require prompt police action where the Court focuses on the “practicability” of obtaining a warrant, and “‘planned’ arrests,” which do not stem from “an ongoing investigation in the field;” and we then held that that case fell into the first category. Id. at 1076 (citing Steagald v. United States, 451 U.S. 204, 222 (1981)). The instant case did not involve an emergency situation. In Gonsalves, the arrest took place less than an', '- 34 - hour after the shooting, and the suspect was known to be in a highly emotional state. In the instant case, by contrast, approximately seven hours had elapsed after the shooting before the arrest was effectuated. The current situation is much more comparable to a planned arrest. After determining defendant’s location, some of the Providence and Warwick police officers involved met in Providence, waited for the remaining Warwick detectives to arrive, and then proceeded to defendant’s residence in a “caravan.” The police subsequently set up a perimeter around the apartment in which defendant resided. In addition to it clearly having been possible for the police to at least have attempted to procure an arrest warrant during the seven hours in which the police knew for whom they were searching, when the police actually located defendant and surrounded his home, they could at that point have simply maintained a perimeter and waited for him to step outside or for a warrant to be procured. We would also note that the testimony reflects the fact that there were many officers from both Warwick and Providence involved in this investigation and arrest, negating any argument that there were no means by which an attempt could have been made to obtain an arrest warrant simultaneously with the attempts to locate the suspect. At any time after defendant became the sole suspect, which was very shortly after the shooting, a single officer could have been dispatched to seek a warrant while the other officers continued their quest for Mr. Gonzalez. Consequently, it is clear to this Court that seeking to obtain a warrant was practicable in this case. Our review of the record and the parties’ arguments indicates that there was no compelling necessity for immediate action which existed for the entirety of the approximately seven hours leading up to the arrest; in other words, there was time for the police to have attempted to obtain a warrant for defendant’s arrest. See Adams, 621 F.2d at 44.', '- 35 -', 'For these reasons, it is our judgment that the state has not met its “heavy burden” of overcoming the presumptive unreasonableness of a warrantless entry into a home by establishing the existence of exigent circumstances to justify such an entry. See Welsh, 466 U.S. at 749-50. We have also determined that there was no consent to the entry of the police into the apartment where Mr. Gonzalez resided. Accordingly, we conclude that the entry into Mr. Gonzalez’s residence, without a warrant, violated his Fourth Amendment rights. See Payton, 445 U.S. at 590. The resulting arrest within his home was also “necessarily unlawful.” Bailey, 417 A.2d at 919. Consequently, under the exclusionary rule, “the fruits of such an arrest (evidence seized in the dwelling) should have been suppressed.”', 'Werner, 831 A.2d at 195; see also State v. Jennings, 461 A.2d 361, 368 (R.I. 1983) (“The exclusionary rule bars from introduction at trial evidence obtained either during or as a direct result of searches and seizures in violation of an individual’s Fourth Amendment rights.”). Accordingly, we hold that the trial justice erred in failing to exclude the following evidence obtained during or subsequent to defendant’s illegal arrest: his statement that the gun the police were asking him about was not in the apartment, as well as the following items defendant points to, “a black Taurus handgun case, a 9 mm magazine, receipt for a gun purchase from D&L gun store, a black bubble vest, [gray] Timberland boots, a black jacket, and a multi-colored scarf” (collectively, the tainted evidence).', 'However, our inquiry does not end there; we must also address the fact that defendant, after his arrest, signed a form consenting to the search of his bedroom. When determining whether the tainted evidence should have been admissible “we must ask whether ‘granting establishment of the primary illegality, the evidence to which instant objection is made has been come at by exploitation of that illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.’” Bailey, 417 A.2d at 919 (quoting Wong Sun v. United States, 371', '- 36 - U.S. 471, 488 (1963)). The consent of a defendant may be valid if it is “sufficiently attenuated from the illegal police action to dissipate the taint.” State v. Casas, 900 A.2d 1120, 1134 (R.I. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). Some of the factors which this Court takes into account when assessing whether the taint has dissipated include the “[t]emporal proximity of the arrest and the [consent to search], the presence of intervening circumstances, * * * and, particularly, the purpose and flagrancy of the official misconduct * * *.” Id. at 1134-35 (internal quotation marks omitted). However, the burden of proving that the primary taint has been purged falls on the state. State v. Parra, 941 A.2d 799, 805 (R.I. 2007). Moreover, particularly pertinent to this case is our statement that “consent [that] is obtained during the course of an illegal detention” is “presumptively * * * invalid.” Id. at 804; see also Casas, 900 A.2d at 1134.', 'In the instant case, Det. McHale testified that, after defendant was arrested and during the ride from the apartment to the police station, the police cruiser that was transporting defendant pulled over and the consent form was read to him. His handcuffs were then removed, and he was allowed to read the form himself. If we begin, as we must, with the presumption that defendant’s consent was invalid, our review of the evidence elicited at the motion to suppress hearing does not reveal the existence of sufficient evidence presented by the state to overcome that presumption. See Parra, 941 A.2d at 804. There was only a short period of time between defendant’s arrest, which occurred immediately upon the entry by the police into the apartment, and his signing of the consent to search form on the way to the police station. See Casas, 900 A.2d at 1134-35; see, e.g., United States v. Torres, 274 F. Supp. 2d 146, 158 (D.R.I. 2003) (holding that a consent to search was not sufficiently attenuated from an illegal arrest when the defendant was handcuffed immediately following the unlawful entry into his home and only approximately thirty minutes had elapsed between the arrest and the consent). In the case before', '- 37 - us, defendant’s handcuffs were removed before he signed the consent to search form; but he was still sitting in the back of the police cruiser, with two police officers in the vicinity of the cruiser, immediately after having experienced the illegal entry into his residence by several police officers, who immediately proceeded to arrest him on that Sunday morning. We have been unable to discern in the record any intervening circumstances that would lead to the determination that defendant’s consent was sufficiently attenuated from his illegal arrest so as to be untainted by the preceding illegal police activity.', 'See Casas, 900 A.2d at 1134-35. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial justice clearly erred in finding defendant’s consent to be voluntary. See Patino, 93 A.3d at 50.', 'As such, it is our holding that there was insufficient evidence to show: (1) that Ms. Gonzalez consented to the entry of police into her home; (2) that Ms. Gonzalez’s signing of the consent to search form was free and voluntary;12 (3) that sufficiently exigent circumstances were present so as to justify the warrantless arrest; and (4) that defendant’s signing of the consent to search form was sufficiently attenuated from his illegal arrest so as to be a valid consent. Accordingly, we conclude that the tainted evidence was obtained in violation of defendant’s Fourth Amendment rights and the trial justice erred in allowing it to be admitted into evidence at defendant’s trial.', 'c. Harmless Error', 'Our analysis does not cease with our conclusion that the evidence obtained as a result of the unlawful entry into defendant’s home should not have been admitted at trial. The state 12', 'In Part II.A.2.a.ii, supra, we concluded that Ms. Gonzalez’s written consent to search the apartment was not free and voluntary. We deem it worth noting that it could also be argued that her written consent was not sufficiently attenuated from the illegal entry into her home and the unlawful arrest of her son to hold that any taint had been dissipated sufficiently to make her consent valid. See State v. Casas, 900 A.2d 1120, 1134 (R.I. 2006).', '- 38 - contends that, even if the consent and exigent circumstances exceptions to the warrant requirement do not apply, any error resulting from the admission of evidence obtained as a result of the unlawful entry into defendant’s home was harmless due to the “truly overwhelming” evidence of defendant’s guilt.', 'It is important to begin our analysis of the applicability of the harmless error principle by noting that, while it does not apply to all constitutional errors, the United States Supreme Court has applied the harmless error principle to the admission of evidence obtained in violation of a defendant’s Fourth Amendment rights.', 'Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U.S. 42, 53 (1970). Moreover, this Court has acknowledged and followed that precedent.', 'See, e.g., State v. Danahey, 108 R.I. 291, 296, 274 A.2d 736, 739 (1971). Thus, the issue before us is whether or not the admission of the tainted evidence in the instant case was harmless.', 'The harmless error principle specifically requires “the beneficiary of a constitutional error to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.” Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24 (1967) (emphasis added). The same harmless error principle—requiring the “government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not influence the verdict”—has been utilized by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. United States v. Sasso, 695 F.3d 25, 29 (1st Cir. 2012); see United States v. Gray, 780 F.3d 458, 469 (1st Cir. 2015). Additionally, the same standard has been utilized by this Court; in fact, we have directly quoted the just-referenced language from Chapman on numerous occasions. See, e.g., State v. Watkins, 92 A.3d 172, 189 n.9 (R.I. 2014); State v. Mercurio, 89 A.3d 813, 822 (R.I. 2014); State v. Golembewski, 808 A.2d 622, 624 (R.I. 2002); State v. Smith, 446 A.2d 1035, 1036 (R.I. 1982); State v. Sherman, 113 R.I. 77, 83, 317 A.2d 445, 449 (1974). Furthermore, we have held that, when determining if an error is harmless, we', '- 39 - look at “various factors, including the relative degree of importance of the witness testimony to the prosecution’s case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and * * * the overall strength of the prosecution’s case.” State v. Bustamante, 756 A.2d 758, 766 (R.I. 2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). In some situations where there is an “overwhelming amount” of evidence indicative of a defendant’s guilt, this Court has declined to apply the harmless error principle. See State v. Perez, 882 A.2d 574, 590 (R.I. 2005); see also Harrington v. California, 395 U.S. 250, 254 (1969); State v. Ciresi, 45 A.3d 1201, 1215 (R.I. 2012); State v. Humphrey, 715 A.2d 1265, 1276 (R.I. 1998).', 'We acknowledge that there was substantial evidence of defendant’s guilt in this case, even when one does not take into account his statement about the gun which he made during his arrest and the tainted physical evidence recovered from his apartment. Ms. Dalomba testified that she saw Mr. Gonzalez shoot Mr. Cunningham. All of the text messages exchanged between Mr. Gonzalez, Ms. Dalomba, and Mr. Chivers leading up to the shooting were admitted into evidence; the content of some of those messages was very damaging to defendant’s case. Moreover, Mr. Noth testified to having dropped defendant off near the time of the shooting at a house whose description matched that of Ms. Dalomba’s house. Additionally, there was Mr. Hutchins’s testimony about the exchange he had with Mr. Gonzalez in a “holding tank” at the ACI. However, despite the ample evidence against defendant—prescinding from the tainted evidence from the unlawful entry into his home—we simply cannot say that the evidence is so overwhelming that the state has met its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the tainted evidence did not influence the verdict. Contra Clark v. Ellerthorpe, 552 A.2d 1186, 1188', '- 40 - (R.I. 1989) (holding that where “the undisputed facts establish that [the] petitioner entered [the victim’s] cell and brutally stabbed him to death” the evidence of guilt was “overwhelming”).', 'Ms. Dalomba was the only eyewitness to the shooting of Mr. Cunningham. As such, her credibility was of the utmost importance.', 'In the state’s closing argument to the jury, the prosecutor stated that she did not disagree that Ms. Dalomba was a “horrible person.” She added:', '“I told you all that at the beginning; you weren’t going to like her,', 'she’s going to be rude, obnoxious, defiant and disrespectful. And', 'she’s all of those things. She certainly delivered. But one thing she', 'didn’t do was lie to you. * * * [T]he accounts of what happened,', 'that she gave on th[e] stand [are] corroborated by the physical', 'evidence that was obtained in this particular case.” Likewise, defense counsel specifically told the jury during his opening statement that it could be argued that the case would “rise and fall on the testimony of Patricia Dalomba.” Defense counsel went on to state the following:', '“She’s the least credible person in this room right now. I’m going', 'to say it again. If her mouth is moving, she’s lying. She has no way', 'of dealing with people other than that. Her life is a game. It’s a', 'soap opera. People in her life mean nothing to her. They’re just', 'these pawns in her game where everything is about her. The most', 'self-centered person you’re ever going to meet.” Thus, it is abundantly clear that neither side considered Ms. Dalomba to be a particularly palatable witness.', 'Consequently, we find it determinative that the evidence from defendant’s apartment— most particularly, the clothes he was wearing the night of the shooting—not only served to point toward his guilt but also directly corroborated Ms. Dalomba’s testimony. See Bustamante, 756 A.2d at 766 (listing evidence that corroborates witness testimony as constituting one of the facts to be considered in determining harmless error). Ms. Dalomba testified at trial regarding what defendant was wearing at the time of the shooting and she identified the clothes seized from', '- 41 - defendant’s apartment at the police station as the same clothing he had been wearing, which fact was also testified to at trial. Moreover, the prosecutor referenced defendant’s clothing multiple times during both her opening statement and her closing argument, even specifically pointing out to the jury that the physical evidence corroborated Ms. Dalomba’s testimony. In our judgment, the fact that the testimony of Ms. Dalomba, the only eyewitness, was made more credible by the tainted physical evidence seized from defendant’s apartment makes it quite possible that it could have had an impact on a juror’s decision with respect to Ms. Dalomba’s credibility; a decision of vital significance in this case.13 See Mercurio, 89 A.3d at 822-23 (holding that error was not harmless where it affected witness credibility and credibility was “central to the case”); Smith, 446 A.2d at 1036 (stating that the “crucial issue” was one of credibility and further stating that the improper line of questioning “bore directly on the credibility”— resulting in a holding that the error was not harmless).', 'Additionally, the gun-related evidence found in defendant’s bedroom, which included a receipt for the purchase of a gun that the police were unable to locate, may have weighed on a juror’s decision about whether defendant had the means to access a firearm to commit the crime for which he was charged. Moreover, the gun-related evidence was also mentioned by the prosecutor in her closing argument. Thus, in the instant case, the tainted evidence had the definite potential of being quite damaging to defendant’s case; for that reason, we are unable to say that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See Bumper, 391 U.S. at 550 (holding that the admission of a rifle which was “plainly damaging evidence against the petitioner” was not harmless error). 13', 'It is worth noting that the tainted physical evidence also corroborated Michael Noth’s testimony that defendant was wearing a “black bubble vest” on the night of the shooting.', '- 42 -', 'No court can scrutinize the minds of jurors so as to be able to know with certainty what did or did not influence a particular verdict. But the Supreme Court has told us that the state must “prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error complained of [(the tainted evidence in this case)] did not contribute to the verdict obtained.” Chapman, 386 U.S. at 24 (emphasis added). After our exhaustive review of the record in this case, we are left with reasonable doubt as to whether or not the tainted evidence, at the very least, influenced the jury’s credibility determinations, and, at most, directly affected the jury’s determination of defendant’s guilt. As such, it is our opinion that the error in this case was not harmless.', 'B', 'Juror Bias', 'Given our holding with respect to the introduction of the evidence obtained as a result of the unconstitutional arrest and the subsequent search of the defendant’s home, we need not address the defendant’s further contention on appeal that two of the jurors in his case were biased and should have been dismissed or, in the alternative, his motion for a mistrial should have been granted. See Grady v. Narragansett Electric Co., 962 A.2d 34, 42 n.4 (R.I. 2009) (referencing “our usual policy of not opining with respect to issues about which we need not opine”).', 'III', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court and remand the case to that tribunal for a new trial.', 'Justice Goldberg, concurring. I concur in the judgment of the majority but nonetheless write separately. Of paramount importance in this case is the question of whether the warrantless', '- 43 - arrest of the defendant, Tony Gonzalez, in his home and the subsequent search of his bedroom violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. As the Supreme Court of the United States has repeatedly and unswervingly declared, any inquiry into the reasonableness of searches and seizures demands a highly fact-driven analysis. See, e.g., Missouri v. McNeeley, 133 S. Ct. 1552, 1559 (2013); Ohio v. Robinette, 519 U.S. 33, 39 (1996); Minnesota v. Olson, 495 U.S. 91, 100 (1990). Accordingly, I recount in detail the salient facts presented at the pretrial suppression hearing in the Superior Court.', 'The Warwick Police Department was alerted to the shooting at approximately five minutes past midnight on January 22, 2012. By 1 a.m., the police knew the name of the suspect—Tony Gonzalez, defendant in this case. At that time, the police captain gave officers assigned to the case a briefing—lasting about thirty minutes—concerning the details uncovered thus far. The police sergeant then departed for the crime scene while at least four detectives remained at the station to conduct witness interviews.', 'Detectives Joseph Mee (Det. Mee) and John McHale (Det. McHale) interviewed Patricia Dalomba (Dalomba), defendant’s ex-girlfriend, who had witnessed the shooting. From Dalomba they learned that defendant had fled the scene in a vehicle carrying multiple passengers, which she believed to be owned by defendant’s brother, Juan Zachary Garcia (Garcia). Dalomba also told the detectives that, in her experience, defendant carried a handgun at all times. The interview lasted between one-and-a-half and two hours. In a separate interview room, Dets. Thomas DiGregorio (Det. DiGregorio) and Timothy Grant (Det. Grant) interviewed Matthew Chivers, Dalomba’s new paramour, who also had been present at the shooting.', 'At approximately 3 a.m. or 3:30 a.m., a group of officers met to discuss the witnesses’ statements and “tried to * * * piece together some information” in order to locate defendant.', '- 44 - They searched for addresses in the computer system and made multiple telephone calls to defendant’s wireless service provider to determine the location of his mobile telephone. Sometime after 4 a.m., Dets. Grant and DiGregorio left for Providence to pursue a lead based on a telephone call placed from defendant’s telephone to another telephone traced to the Silver Lake neighborhood.', 'The record discloses that the officers learned that four months earlier, in September 2011, defendant had been involved in another altercation with one of Dalomba’s boyfriends and that defendant had surrendered voluntarily to the police. Warwick police dispatchers contacted defendant, who indicated that he intended to turn himself in.', 'At approximately 5:15 a.m., Dets. Mee and McHale visited the crime scene; they stayed for ten minutes and then returned to the police station. Meanwhile, multiple Warwick officers, accompanied by officers from the West Warwick Police Department and the Rhode Island State Police, visited Garcia at his home. At approximately 6:15 a.m.—six hours after the murder—the officers arranged for Garcia to make a “controlled” telephone call to his brother. During the call, Garcia informed defendant that the police had been at Garcia’s home and were searching for defendant. The defendant told Garcia that he had been asleep, in bed at the home he shared with his mother in the Chad Brown public housing complex in Providence.', 'Before the police departed, Garcia advised them that defendant often sleeps with a handgun under his pillow.', 'Shortly before 7 a.m., with a credible lead on defendant’s location, six Warwick officers reported to a Providence Police Department substation, where they assembled with at least six members of the Providence Police Department for approximately twenty minutes. Detectives DiGregorio and Grant briefed their Providence brethren. An assemblage of uniformed and plainclothes officers from both departments then departed in a “caravan” for defendant’s', '- 45 - residence. They traveled in “three marked units and a couple of detective units from Warwick.” At no time had police from either department obtained an arrest warrant or a search warrant, nor had anyone attempted to do so.', 'Upon arriving at the Chad Brown public housing complex, just after 7 a.m. on a Sunday morning, a phalanx of police officers surrounded the building and established a perimeter around the residence in order to prevent defendant from fleeing. Patrolman Joseph Dosreis (Ptlm. Dosreis) of the Providence Police Department knocked on the front door of defendant’s residence. He carried a tactical shield described as “a protective police shield similar to a riot shield, approximately four [feet] in length and maybe two feet wide.” With him stood two fellow Providence officers; all wore bulletproof vests, with protection helmets that masked their faces.', 'Patrolman Dosreis’s gun was holstered, whereas the other officers’ guns were “displayed.”', 'The defendant’s mother, Cira Gonzalez (Cira), was awakened by the knock on the door.14 She descended the staircase from her second-floor bedroom, still wearing her pajamas. When Cira opened the front door, Ptlm. Dosreis yelled, “Where’s Tony? Where’s Tony?” at least once or twice. She did not respond verbally. Rather, Ptlm. Dosreis described the encounter as follows:', '“We had eye contact. I asked for Tony, where is he, where is he.', 'And I was under the impression that he would be up in the', 'bedroom so I looked and she looked up toward the stairs and', 'looked like that. (Indicating).” From Ptlm. Dosreis’s experience as a patrolman, he knew that all bedrooms in the Chad Brown complex were located on the second floor, and he recalled that Garcia had indicated that 14', 'To distinguish her from defendant, I refer to Cira Gonzalez by her first name. I intend no disrespect.', '- 46 - defendant had been in his bedroom at the time of the controlled call. It is undisputed that Cira did not give oral consent to enter her home; at best, she glanced toward the staircase in response to the officer’s inquiry and made a gesture of some sort. It also is uncontested that Ptlm. Dosreis never asked for permission to enter the home, and, according to Cira, the officers simply pushed their way into the home. At least three officers bounded up the stairs to apprehend defendant.', 'The sequence of events was disputed by the parties. According to Ptlm. Dosreis, he first looked into the living room to his left and saw a man by the couch who, he determined, was too tall to fit the description of the five-foot-five-inch or five-foot-six-inch suspect. Patrolman Dosreis testified that his gaze returned to the top of the staircase, where he saw a man who fit the description. He then ran up the stairs, followed by other officers. According to Det. Grant, ten to fifteen seconds elapsed from the time that Cira opened the door to the entry into the residence. On the other hand, Cira testified that, by the time she glanced up, the officers already were climbing the staircase. According to Cira, three officers “walked in and * * * [she] had no other choice but to walk back because they were walking in.”', 'Upstairs, Ptlm. Dosreis and another uniformed Providence officer encountered defendant, wearing only his boxer shorts and a T-shirt, turning his back as if he were attempting to return to his bedroom. Announcing that he was with the “Providence Police,” Ptlm. Dosreis pushed defendant to the floor, face-down, in the area between defendant’s bedroom and the hallway. As he handcuffed defendant with the assistance of another officer, Ptlm. Dosreis asked about defendant’s firearm and where it was located.', 'The defendant responded, “It’s not here.” According to Det. Grant—who had reached the top of the staircase while defendant was being handcuffed—an open handgun case rested in plain view on a table in defendant’s bedroom. Inside was a loaded magazine and some paperwork, but no handgun.', '- 47 -', 'After the arrest, at approximately 7:40 a.m., the police escorted defendant downstairs to the living room and sat him on the couch. The record discloses that there were numerous members of law enforcement in the home at this time. The scene was described by one officer as “chaotic”; before defendant was taken into custody, there was “yelling and screaming,” and officers used profanity. Cira was described by the witnesses as being “in shock”—she was “crying,” “nervous[,] and scared.” Detective DiGregorio advised defendant of his Miranda rights, and then he and Det. Mee asked defendant about his whereabouts the previous night and the location of the handgun. The defendant repeated that the handgun was not there. Patrolman Dosreis testified that he remained at the home for about ten minutes, at which point the investigation was turned over to Warwick Police. Importantly, Ptlm. Dosreis testified that he not only saw the handgun case in defendant’s second-floor bedroom, “I saw the gun case being taken out of there.”', 'After defendant was situated on the couch in the living room, Cira went upstairs to find warm clothes for defendant; she was accompanied by an officer. When she returned with a pair of gray boots—the same color boots that Dalomba had reported that defendant had worn at the time of the shooting—Det. Mee instructed her to retrieve another pair of shoes, which she did. Warwick officers then escorted defendant out of the house and into the back of a marked police cruiser.', 'As Det. McHale and another officer transported defendant to the Warwick police station, having driven less than one-half mile, they detoured into a nearby parking lot in order for defendant to execute a form consenting to a search of his bedroom. According to Det. McHale, he received a call from the sergeant directing him to inquire if defendant would consent to a search of his bedroom. According to Det. McHale, defendant agreed, and the officers stopped', '- 48 - the vehicle; both officers exited the car and opened the rear doors of the cruiser. The other officer read the standard form aloud to defendant, filled out the form, and presented it to defendant, whose handcuffs were removed for ease of reading and signing. This event occurred at 8:06 a.m., within moments of his departure from the home.', 'Meanwhile, at 8:10 a.m., Cira also executed a consent-to-search form at the request of the police. Detectives Grant and Mee then searched defendant’s bedroom, where they seized a vest, a jacket, a scarf, and a mobile telephone. The handgun case with the loaded magazine, a receipt for a 9-millimeter Taurus handgun, and the gray boots retrieved by Cira also were seized, although exactly when this occurred was not established. It is undisputed that all items were seized from defendant’s bedroom.', 'The Warrantless Arrest in the Home', 'When this Court undertakes review of the constitutionality of a warrantless arrest in the home and the subsequent search and seizure of items from the accused’s bedroom, we do not venture into new constitutional territory. Our task is to look to the holdings of the United States Supreme Court, particularly its longstanding recognition that “[a]t the very core [of the Fourth Amendment] stands ‘the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from unreasonable government intrusion.’”', 'Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 589-90 (1980) (quoting Silverman v. United States, 365 U.S. 505, 511 (1961)). The specter of police officers “thrust[ing] themselves into a home is * * * a grave concern, not only to the individual but to a society which chooses to dwell in reasonable security and freedom from surveillance.” Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S. 10, 14 (1948). To protect the public against “zealous” “officer[s] engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime,” the Fourth Amendment requires that a “neutral and detached magistrate” review the evidence against a suspect and make', '- 49 - a “disinterested” determination whether to issue a warrant. Id. at 13, 14. Any evidence seized as a result of a nonconsensual warrantless entry into the home will not withstand constitutional scrutiny unless a recognized exception to the warrant requirement applies. See Payton, 445 U.S. at 583, 590.', 'The state argues that the warrantless entry into defendant’s home was supported by both consent and exigent circumstances. A review of the facts in this case demonstrate that there is no set of conceivable circumstances in which Cira provided the officers with consent to enter the apartment. The question of whether there was valid consent is reviewed by this Court de novo. State v. Linde, 876 A.2d 1115, 1124 (R.I. 2005). Awakened by a loud bang on her front door at approximately seven o’clock in the morning, Cira discovered numerous police officers—arrayed in riot gear with masks and shields and weapons drawn—surrounding her home at the Chad Brown public housing complex. Upon opening the door, she found herself face-to-face with a masked officer, equipped with a four-foot-long shield, who demanded to know the whereabouts of her son. Behind him, more officers stood with their guns drawn. When Ptlm. Dosreis demanded to know where her son was, a speechless Cira glanced or gestured toward the stairs, and several officers ran up the stairs and apprehended defendant, who was standing there in his underwear.', 'The trial justice concluded that this interaction constituted a consensual entry into the home. He found that the officers entered the apartment “quickly” because they were looking for a person suspected of murder with a firearm within hours of its commission.', 'Thus, he concluded, the police were “not going to waste time spending a lot of time explaining, you know, the background [of why they were there]. ‘Where’s Tony?’ ‘We’re looking for Tony.’ He’s upstairs, and they went upstairs.” Even the most generous reading of this finding does not', '- 50 - constitute consent. “The Fourth Amendment prohibition against the warrantless entry into a person’s home does not apply ‘to situations in which voluntary consent has been obtained * * *.’” State v. Barkmeyer, 949 A.2d 984, 996 (R.I. 2008) (quoting Illinois v. Rodriguez, 497 U.S. 177, 181 (1990)). The state bears the burden of proving, “by a fair preponderance of the evidence,” that the lawful occupant of the home voluntarily consented to the police entering his or her home. Id. at 997 (quoting State v. O’Dell, 576 A.2d 425, 427 (R.I. 1990)). “[T]he state must prove that the consent was ‘freely and voluntarily given.’” State v. Bailey, 417 A.2d 915, 918 (R.I. 1980) (quoting Bumper v. North Carolina, 391 U.S. 543, 548 (1968) and citing Palmigiano v. Mullen, 119 R.I. 363, 370, 377 A.2d 242, 246 (1977)). This Court has recognized that the state’s burden of proof to establish valid consent “cannot be discharged by showing no more than acquiescence to a claim of lawful authority.” State v. Beaumier, 480 A.2d 1367, 1374 (R.I. 1984), overruled on other grounds, State v. Rios, 702 A.2d 889, 889-90 (R.I. 1997) (quoting Bumper, 391 U.S. at 548-49). In Beaumier, this Court recognized that “various barometers” have been established “to determine whether the consent was truly voluntary,” including “the number of police officers entering the home, * * * the apprehension of a family member, * * * the time of day, * * * and an outlandish display of weaponry.” Id. Many of those factors are present in this case. First, Cira was not the reason the police awakened her family that morning. She was confronted with numerous armed officers, in riot gear, with masks and shields; no one asked permission to enter, yet several officers rushed up the stairs to apprehend her son, who also may have been sleeping. An allegation that an occupant who is not the person sought by police voluntarily consented in the face of a number of armed officers demands scrutiny. See Lowery v. State, 499 S.W.2d 160, 168 (Tex. Crim. App. 1973). “The display of weapons is a coercive factor that sharply reduces the likelihood of freely given consent.” Id. The evidence in this case', '- 51 - does not substantiate the burden of proving that the entry into the home in order to arrest defendant was consensual. Accordingly, I am satisfied that in finding a consensual entry; the trial justice clearly erred.', 'The state’s next argument, that the exigency of the situation justified the warrantless entry, is equally flawed. The exigent-circumstances exception to the warrant requirement applies when “there is compelling need for official action and no time to secure a warrant.” McNeeley, 133 S. Ct. at 1559 (quoting Michigan v. Tyler, 436 U.S. 499, 509 (1978)). Examples of circumstances recognized as exigent include “law enforcement’s need to provide emergency assistance to an occupant of a home, * * * engage in ‘hot pursuit’ of a fleeing suspect, * * * enter a burning building to put out a fire and investigate its cause, * * * [and] prevent the imminent destruction of evidence.” Id. at 1558-59; see also State v. Jennings, 461 A.2d 361, 366 (R.I. 1983).', '“Any warrantless entry based on exigent circumstances must * * * be supported by a genuine exigency.” Kentucky v. King, 563 U.S. 452, 470 (2011) (emphasis added). Mere inconvenience to the police does not provide a reasonable basis for forgoing a warrant, Johnson, 333 U.S. at 15, nor does the desire to lead a more “efficient” investigation, Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U.S. 385, 393 (1978) (“[T]he privacy of a person’s home and property may not be totally sacrificed in the name of maximum simplicity in enforcement of the criminal law.”). Significantly, the gravity of the offense alone fails to create a genuine exigency. Mincey, 437 U.S. at 394.', 'Here, the police knew the name of the suspect within the first hour of the investigation, yet more than six hours had elapsed without any effort to obtain an arrest warrant. At the suppression hearing, Det. DiGregorio explained that no warrant was sought because, with an', '- 52 - armed murder suspect at large, “time was of the essence” and “[t]o sit down at a desk and type out a warrant at that point in time * * * was a waste of resources.” Detective DiGregorio also indicated that there was concern that defendant might attempt to destroy evidence, although this fear appeared to be rooted in generalized conjecture rather than specific facts gleaned during the investigation. Extended to its logical conclusion, such reasoning would negate the need for warrants in any murder investigation in which an armed suspect has not been apprehended. Allowing the police to enter the home of every murder suspect without first obtaining the approval of a disinterested judicial officer, in effect, “would reduce the [Fourth] Amendment to a nullity and leave the people’s homes secure only in the discretion of police officers.” Johnson, 333 U.S. at 14. It is for the judicial officer to determine that probable cause exists for an arrest, not the police who already are entrenched in the investigation and have developed the understandably single-minded focus of bringing their presumed suspect into custody. See id. These factors are further highlighted by the fact that on a previous occasion when the police were seeking to arrest defendant—certainly not for a brutal homicide—and defendant, upon receiving a telephone call from police dispatch, notified the police of his intended surrender. Although the Warwick detectives were aware of this prior incident, no effort was made to attempt such surrender in this case.', 'Even the most generous reading of the candid and, indeed, credible testimony of the police officers in this case, reveals that there is no evidentiary support for the hypothesis that defendant intended to harm himself or take more victims. The only evidence as to defendant’s whereabouts was the telephone call made by his brother that revealed he was at home in bed. Additionally, over seven hours elapsed from the time of the homicide until defendant was apprehended. No effort was made to secure a warrant for his arrest, yet there were at least four', '- 53 - law enforcement agencies involved in this case with sufficient time to assemble a convoy of heavily-armed officers to surround the home.', 'The facts of this case are in stark contrast with this Court’s holding in State v. Gonsalves, 553 A.2d 1073 (R.I. 1989), in which we affirmed a decision denying the defendant’s motion to suppress evidence seized after a warrantless arrest of the defendant in the home of his girlfriend. Id. at 1074, 1076. Less than an hour after he murdered his brother, following “a bitter argument” in a barroom, members of the East Providence Police Department responded to the home of the defendant’s parents, where they learned the defendant might be at his girlfriend’s apartment in Pawtucket. Id. at 1074. The defendant’s father accompanied the police to the residence. Id. They knocked on the wrong door. Id. A woman emerged from the adjacent unit and was ordered back inside by the officers. Id. They knocked again, and she exited once more, at which point the police asked her if she was the defendant’s girlfriend, and “she responded affirmatively.” Id. When the officers approached her apartment, they observed the defendant sitting on a couch in the living room. Id. After the defendant failed to respond to their repeated entreaties, the officers entered the apartment and arrested the defendant. Id. He struggled with the officers and was less than cooperative. Id. at 1074-75. Bullets from a .38-caliber weapon were seized and introduced into evidence as were the incriminating remarks the defendant made while resisting arrest. Id.', 'This Court affirmed the decision denying the motion to suppress the evidence in Gonsalves on the ground that an exigent circumstance justifying a warrantless entry and search for evidence may arise when “police believe a person within [the residence] requires immediate assistance or other victims or intruders may still be present.” Gonsalves, 553 A.2d at 1075, 1076 (quoting Jennings, 461 A.2d at 366). We concluded that “[t]he need to protect or preserve life or', '- 54 - avoid serious injury is justification for what would be otherwise illegal absent an exigency or emergency.” Id. at 1075 (quoting Jennings, 461 A.2d at 366).', 'The determination of exigency or emergency turns on “the facts known to the police at the time of the arrest.” Gonsalves, 553 A.2d at 1075 (citing United States v. Williams, 612 F.2d 735, 739 (3d Cir. 1979)). The police must “have an objective, reasonable belief that a crisis can only be avoided by swift and immediate action.” Duquette v. Godbout, 471 A.2d 1359, 1363 (R.I. 1984). None of these considerations is present in this case, particularly where more than seven hours elapsed from the time of the murder to the warrantless arrest. The subjective, generalized statements of the police—about their concern for destruction of evidence and the possibility that defendant could harm himself or others or escape arrest—are neither sufficient nor fact-based. “The proper line of inquiry is whether the police reasonably believed, relying upon facts known by them at the time of arrest, that the warrantless intrusion was necessary to preserve life or avoid serious injury.” Gonsalves, 553 A.2d at 1075-76. I deem this multi- department police action to be more akin to a planned arrest than an emergent pursuit in the field.', 'In an attempt to persuade us that a police-emergency situation justified the arrest in this case, the state points to previous decisions of this Court. These cases are distinguishable. State v. Portes, 840 A.2d 1131, 1134-35 (R.I. 2004), dealt with evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant after the police were called to an apartment in response to an emergency 9-1-1 call that was hampered by a language barrier. Although no one answered the knock on the door, the police heard running footsteps and a door banging inside. Id. at 1134. A neighbor informed them that the home’s occupant had fled in a taxi with her child. Id. Upon entry, the police observed a firearm on the nightstand and a bag of cocaine on the kitchen counter. Id. at 1134-35. They obtained a search warrant and seized a significant quantity of cocaine under the mattress.', '- 55 - Id. at 1135. This Court concluded the police were justified in entering the premises and that, based on the totality of the circumstances, “it would have been unreasonable for the officers to simply walk away from the unanswered door given the 9-1-1 call and other facts known to them.” Id. at 1136, 1137.', 'Likewise, in State v. Shelton, 990 A.2d 191, 193, 194, 195 (R.I. 2010), within moments of a double shooting and homicide, the police discovered the name and address of the perpetrator, and, in less than an hour, they were at the home of Brenda Alvarez, with whom the defendant had “an on-and-off romantic relationship.” They found the door to the building unlocked and the door to the apartment “slightly open.” Id. at 195. They discovered three teenagers and a baby asleep inside, as well as masks, ammunition, and an unlocked safe in one bedroom. Id. They left the apartment at the request of Ms. Alvarez and waited outside until she arrived home—sometime later—and obtained her written consent to search. Id. This Court concluded that there were exigent circumstances that justified the initial warrantless entry into the home for a security sweep and that the subsequent search was conducted pursuant to a valid consent. Id. at 200. We noted, however, that the extent of the initial entry that was permissible under the circumstances was dictated by the exigency; “[w]hen the security check has been completed, the area is secured, and there is no longer any danger of the loss or destruction of evidence, the search must cease.” Id. (quoting Jennings, 461 A.2d at 367).', 'Finally, although State v. Morin, 68 A.3d 61, 64 (R.I. 2013), involved a warrantless arrest in the defendant’s home, it was hardly the result of a planned police foray.', 'Rather, an investigator from the Department of Children, Youth, and Families, lawfully on the premises, called the police after the defendant admitted to molesting his stepdaughter. Id. This Court concluded that the statement he gave to police—after receiving the appropriate Miranda', '- 56 - warnings, id.—was admissible because the arrest was lawful, based on probable cause and exigent circumstances, that included an enraged wife who was the mother of the child, such that it was reasonable for the officer to believe that his assistance was required at the home, id. at 67.', 'Consent to Search', 'Having concluded that there were no exigent circumstances justifying the warrantless arrest in this case, the exclusionary rule dictates that the evidence be suppressed. However, it also is necessary to determine whether the search was conducted pursuant to a valid consent executed by defendant or his mother. I conclude that there was no valid consent to search in the circumstances of this case. “The Fourth Amendment test for a valid consent to search is that the consent be voluntary, and ‘[v]oluntariness is a question of fact to be determined from all the circumstances.’” Robinette, 519 U.S. at 40 (quoting Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 248-49 (1973)).', 'Where the validity of a search hinges upon consent, the state must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the consent indeed was “freely and voluntarily given.” State v. Casas, 900 A.2d 1120, 1134 (R.I. 2006) (quoting O’Dell, 576 A.2d at 427). “Consent given during an illegal detention is presumptively invalid.” Id. (quoting United States v. Cellitti, 387 F.3d 618, 622 (7th Cir. 2004)).', 'Consent may be deemed valid only if it is “sufficiently attenuated from the illegal police action ‘to dissipate the taint.’” Id. (quoting Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 487 (1963)). Under these circumstances, it is incumbent upon the state to “demonstrat[e] that the causal connection between the [consent to search] and the illegal arrest was broken so as to dispel the primary taint of the illegal seizure.” Id. (quoting State v. Burns, 431 A.2d 1199, 1205 (R.I. 1981)). Courts first must consider how much time elapsed from the illegal arrest to the time of consent, whether there were any actual, valid intervening', '- 57 - circumstances separating the arrest from the consent and then must take a hard look at the “purpose and flagrancy of the official misconduct.” Id. at 1135 (quoting Brown v. Illinois, 422 U.S. 590, 604 (1975)). “When there is a close causal connection between the illegal seizure and the [consent], not only is exclusion of the evidence more likely to deter similar police misconduct in the future, but use of the evidence is more likely to compromise the integrity of the courts.” Dunaway v. New York, 442 U.S. 200, 218 (1979).', 'In this case, the consent to search obtained from defendant was executed in a parking lot, four-tenths of a mile from his home, while he was seated in the back of a police cruiser. There was no intervening event whatsoever. Further, at least one police officer testified that, although he departed the scene within ten minutes of the arrest, he observed the handgun case being removed from the home. This evidence suggests that defendant was asked to consent to a search and seizure that already had occurred.15 With respect to the final factor—the purpose of the official misconduct, a warrantless arrest in the home—there is no question that there was probable cause to arrest defendant for a brutal homicide. This factor, however, fails to establish that the consent to search was sufficiently attenuated from his illegal arrest. Cf. O’Dell, 576 A.2d at 427 (search did not violate Fourth Amendment where the defendant’s mother consented to the search of a vacant home and the defendant was arrested pursuant to an arrest warrant).', 'The same can be said with respect to Cira. It should be noted that there is no claim before us that Cira was without authority to consent to a search of her son’s bedroom. Although 15', 'It cannot be said that the seizure of the handgun case falls within the ambit of the plain-view doctrine, because the warrantless entry by the police into defendant’s home was constitutionally impermissible. See Horton v. California, 496 U.S. 128, 136 (1990) (“It is, of course, an essential predicate to any valid warrantless seizure of incriminating evidence that the officer did not violate the Fourth Amendment in arriving at the place from which the evidence could be plainly viewed.”); State v. Hockenhull, 525 A.2d 926, 932 (R.I. 1987) (“The plain[-]view doctrine is not applicable unless the items seized are evidence of a crime that came into view of an officer lawfully present on the premises searched.”).', '- 58 - Det. Mee testified that defendant was asked to consent to a search of his bedroom “[b]ecause he ha[d] a reasonable expectation of privacy in his bedroom,” the question of whether his mother also could provide valid consent to search that bedroom has not been raised. See Linde, 876 A.2d at 1125 (Although one who has common authority over the premises to be searched may give valid consent to search, this doctrine “must be applied cautiously to prevent erosion of Fourth Amendment protections.” (quoting State v. Farrell, 443 A.2d 438, 442 (R.I. 1982))). Nonetheless, it is incumbent upon the Court to weigh all of the circumstances surrounding a consent to search by a “careful sifting of the unique facts and circumstances of each case * * * involving consent searches.” Schneckloth, 412 U.S. at 233.', 'The facts in this record fail to demonstrate that the state overcame the presumptive invalidity of the consent to search executed by defendant’s mother. This is so because of the temporal proximity of the consent—within moments of her son’s departure in police custody— with several police officers remaining in her home; Cira was described by various witnesses as “crying,” “in shock,” and “nervous.” In addition to the immediacy of the request to consent to the search, there are no intervening circumstances on this record to establish that the consent to search was sufficiently attenuated from the illegal entry into the home as to dissipate the primary taint of the illegal entry. See State v. Parra, 941 A.2d 799, 805 (R.I. 2007); Casas, 900 A.2d at 1135.', 'Accordingly, the motion to suppress the evidence seized from the defendant’s bedroom should have been granted.', 'Conclusion', 'This is a decision that is not lightly undertaken.

48,: v. : Rhode Island Department of : Transportation.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court.', 'This case came before the Supreme Court on January 21, 2016, after a justice of the Superior Court entered a judgment in favor of the defendant, the Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT). The plaintiff, the Estate of Richard J. Deeble (plaintiff or estate), appealed the trial justice’s determination that the estate is not entitled to a right of first refusal to repurchase land condemned for highway purposes under article 6, section 19 of the Rhode Island Constitution. On appeal, the plaintiff contends that the trial justice erred in failing to conclude that the preemptive right passed to the estate of the original condemnee, Richard J. Deeble (Richard),1 upon his death. After careful consideration of the parties’ arguments, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'The facts underlying this action are not in dispute. In January 2001, RIDOT acquired a 31,502-square-foot parcel of real property located at 480 Benefit Street in Providence, Rhode Island (condemned property) through eminent domain in connection with the relocation of 1', 'To distinguish Richard Deeble from his wife, Virginia, we refer to the Deebles by their first names. We intend no disrespect.', '-1- Interstate Route 195. At the time of the acquisition, the condemned property was owned by Richard and his wife, Virginia (the Deebles), as tenants by the entirety. Virginia passed away on April 16, 2006. Richard died three years later, on July 7, 2009, and his will was admitted to probate in Coventry, Rhode Island.', 'RIDOT utilized a portion of the condemned property in furtherance of the relocation of Interstate Route 195. Upon completion of the project, approximately 24,601 square feet of the condemned property remained (surplus property). However, in accordance with G.L. 1956 § 37- 5-8(b), RIDOT was “directed, authorized[,] and empowered to sell, transfer[,] and convey” the surplus property to the State of Rhode Island I-195 Redevelopment District Commission.2', 'On February 5, 2013, plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief against RIDOT in the Providence County Superior Court, asserting that, should RIDOT seek to sell or lease the condemned property, the estate must be offered the opportunity to repurchase or lease the land in accordance with article 6, section 19 of the Rhode Island Constitution. The estate contended that, when Richard died, the right of first refusal that was vested in him by virtue of article 6, section 19 passed to his heirs, successors, and assigns. RIDOT countered that the preemptive right was personal to Richard and died with him. On April 26, 2013, the parties entered into a consent order, in which RIDOT agreed to refrain from selling or encumbering the surplus property pending resolution of this litigation.', 'On June 16, 2014, the Superior Court justice issued a written opinion in which he found that the clear and unambiguous language of article 6, section 19 restricted rights set forth in the provision to the original condemnee. Consequently, the Superior Court justice held that the 2', 'The State of Rhode Island I-195 Redevelopment District Commission “oversee[s], plan[s], implement[s], and administer[s] the development” of surplus land made available as a result of the relocation of Interstate Route 195.

A judgment entered on July 1, 2014, and the estate filed this timely appeal.', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court applies a deferential standard of review in passing on the grant or denial of declaratory relief. See Town of North Kingstown v. International Association of Firefighters, Local 1651 AFL-CIO, 107 A.3d 304, 312 (R.I. 2015). The decision will withstand appellate review “unless the record demonstrates a clear abuse of discretion or the trial justice committed an error of law.” Id. (quoting Hagenberg v. Avedisian, 879 A.2d 436, 441 (R.I. 2005)). However, this Court considers questions of constitutional construction on a de novo basis. State v. Matthews, 88 A.3d 375, 384 (R.I. 2014).', 'Analysis', 'In this case of first impression, we are called upon to decide whether the rights set forth in article 6, section 19 of the Rhode Island Constitution terminate upon the death of the original condemnee. Article 6, section 19 reads:', '“The general assembly may authorize the acquiring or taking in fee', 'by the state, or by any cities or towns, of more land and property', 'than is needed for actual construction in the establishing, laying', 'out, widening, extending or relocating of public highways, streets,', 'places, parks or parkways; provided, however, that the additional', 'land and property so authorized to be acquired or taken shall be no', 'more in extent than would be sufficient to form suitable building', 'sites abutting on such public highway, street, place, park or', 'parkway. After so much of the land and property has been', 'appropriated for such public highway, street, place, park or', 'parkway as is needed therefor, the remainder may be held and', 'improved for any public purpose or purposes, or may be sold or', 'leased for value with or without suitable restrictions, and in case of', 'any such sale or lease, the person or persons from whom such', 'remainder was taken shall have the first right to purchase or lease', 'the same upon such terms as the state or city or town is willing to', 'sell or lease the same.” (Emphasis added.)', '-3- Our focus in this case centers on the phrase “the person or persons from whom such remainder was taken” and requires us to determine whether article 6, section 19 may encompass the heirs, successors, and assigns of the condemnee after his or her death.', 'When words within a constitutional provision are clear and unambiguous, this Court will not look beyond their “plain, ordinary, and usually accepted meaning.” Woonsocket School Committee v. Chafee, 89 A.3d 778, 788 (R.I. 2014) (quoting Viveiros v. Town of Middletown, 973 A.2d 607, 610 (R.I. 2009)). Words are clear and unambiguous if, read within the context in which they appear, they give rise to but a single rational interpretation. Cf. State v. Hazard, 68 A.3d 479, 485 (R.I. 2013) (“[A]mbiguity exists when a word or phrase in a statute is susceptible of more than one reasonable meaning.” (quoting Drs. Pass and Bertherman, Inc. v.

So long as the plain language of a constitutional provision lacks ambiguity and does not lend itself to an “absurd result,” this Court need not assume the arduous task of delving into the thought processes of the legislators who drafted the amendment or the voters who enacted it. McKenna v. Williams, 874 A.2d 217, 232 (R.I. 2005).', '“In construing a constitutional provision, this [C]ourt properly consults extrinsic sources, including the proceedings of constitutional conventions and any legislation related to the constitutional provision that was enacted at or near the time of the adoption of the constitutional amendment.” City of Pawtucket v. Sundlun, 662 A.2d 40, 45 (R.I. 1995). The Court “must look to the history of the times and examine the state of affairs as they existed when the constitution was framed and adopted.” Id.', '-4-', 'Article 6, section 19 has been with us for a century and harkens back to a period when vehicles and the highways over which they traveled were markedly different. The amendment traces its origins to a time when the law so narrowly interpreted the term “public use” that municipalities were liable in trespass if, in the course of constructing a highway or railroad, its agents caused entry upon the property of an abutting landowner. Griffin v. Bendick, 463 A.2d 1340, 1347-48 (R.I. 1983). To avoid liability, public-works activities were restricted to the roadbed, a practice that impeded the quality and efficiency of the construction process. Id. at 1348. To resolve the issue, the General Assembly proposed a constitutional amendment that is now article 6, section 19 of the Rhode Island Constitution,3 Griffin, 463 A.2d at 1348, which the Rhode Island electorate adopted in 1916 by a margin of 31,709 to 6,786.4 The constitutional provision thus allowed public agencies to seize, by eminent domain, surplus land necessary for purposes of construction but excess upon completion of the project. See Wood v. City of East Providence, 811 F.2d 677, 680 (1st Cir. 1987) (citing Griffin, 463 A.2d at 1347-48). Once the land was no longer needed, the property owner at the time of the condemnation had the constitutionally-protected right to repurchase or lease any remaining land in accordance with article 6, section 19. Wood, 811 F.2d at 680.', 'This Court has previously had the occasion to interpret the meaning of the term “place” within article 6, section 19. See Wood v. City of East Providence, 504 A.2d 441, 443 (R.I. 1986); Lapre v. Flanders, 465 A.2d 214, 216 (R.I. 1983); Griffin, 463 A.2d at 1347-48.

It became article 6, section 19 following the 1986 Constitutional Convention, although the text itself remained unaltered. See id. at 23-24. 4', 'Annotated Constitution of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, 24.', '-5- Griffin, 463 A.2d at 1347, we were faced with the question of whether a port facility qualified as a “place” in the context of the application of article 6, section 19 to “public highways, streets, places, parks or parkways.” We held that it did not, and we narrowly construed the term to signify “a court or square or short street.” Griffin, 463 A.2d at 1347. We concluded that the General Assembly, “if it had so desired, could have expressly included a reference to port facilities in the language of the amendment,” and that such omission “consequently evidences an intent not to include such facilities within its ambit.” Id. at 1348. Subsequently, we have held that the term “place” does not encompass an airport, Lapre, 465 A.2d at 216, or a school, Wood, 504 A.2d at 443.', 'We turn to the language of article 6, section 19 that is the subject of the present dispute— “the person or persons from whom such remainder was taken.” The estate argues that this language merely identifies those in whom the preemptive right is vested and that, by its plain and ordinary meaning, should not be construed as terminating upon the death of the original condemnee. We disagree. Had the General Assembly intended for the right of first refusal to transcend the death of the original condemnee, it would have expressly included such language within article 6, section 19. It did not. The contention that the right is vested not only in “the person or persons from whom such remainder was taken” but also in their heirs, successors, and assigns is inconsistent with the plain language of the provision. To hold otherwise would add language to the constitution, an exercise in which we will not engage.', 'The estate argues that the predecessor to article 6, section 19 would not have passed with “such widespread support from voters * * * if the General Assembly intended, and the voters understood,” that the right of first refusal would be extinguished upon the death of the original condemnee. As we previously have stated, “[w]hat matters in the end is what the amendment', '-6- says.” McKenna, 874 A.2d at 232 n.14. Here, article 6, section 19 simply does not include language that the right of first refusal passes to the heirs, successors, and assigns of the original condemnee upon death. Since the Deebles were the owners of the property at the time of the taking, only they had the power to exercise the preemptive right. When the Deebles died, the right of first refusal under article 6, section 19 was extinguished.', 'Since this Court is satisfied that the plain language of article 6, section 19 is unambiguous, we need not address the estate’s alternative arguments that a comparison between G.L. 1956 § 37-7-4—which tracks the language of article 6, section 19—and other statutes demonstrates that the framers of the constitutional provision intended for the preemptive right to pass to the heirs, successors, and assigns of the original condemnee.5', 'Accordingly, we conclude that the rights guaranteed by article 6, section 19 of the Rhode Island Constitution do not extend beyond the original condemnee’s lifetime. The term “the person or persons from whom such remainder was taken” connotes the original condemnee only, and not his or her heirs, successors, and assigns upon death.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm.

Kimberly Bagdis, a self-represented appellant, seeks to vacate a Superior Court order that required the disposition of funds held in trust for her be used to pay attorneys’ fees. Before this Court, she argues that the trial justice made several reversible errors.', 'First, she argues that the trial justice erred when he approved the first and final accounting of the trustee and appellee, Lynne Wilson and when he approved the payment of the settlor’s final debts and expenses, as well as administration costs, from the trust. Second, she argues that the trial justice erred when he discharged and released Wilson from her fiduciary duty because Wilson had breached that duty by administering the trust’s assets in an imprudent manner. Third, she contends that her due process rights were violated by the Superior Court. In this regard, she maintains that the trial justice erred because Wilson was allowed to testify at “an unscheduled, impromptu hearing” when Kimberly was not present and that she did not have an', '-1- opportunity to cross-examine her. She also argues that the trial justice violated her right to due process when he limited her time for argument during a subsequent hearing.', 'This matter came before us on December 9, 2015, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised by the appeal should not summarily be decided. After considering the parties’ oral and written arguments and examining the record, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that this case can be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons given below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'The Trust', 'Janet Bagdis died on January 17, 2010. Before her death, she established an inter vivos trust, the Janet S. Bagdis Living Trust. That trust, as amended, provided for three shares that were to be apportioned among her children and grandchildren. Specifically, her daughter and successor trustee, Lynne Wilson, was to receive 50 percent; her son, Neil, was to receive 30 percent; and the remaining 20 percent was to go to Wilson to hold in trust for the benefit of Janet’s grandchildren, Kimberly and Jeffrey. 1 There was a provision that the 20 percent share was to be distributed at Wilson’s discretion for the care of Jeffrey and Kimberly until March 13, 2014, when the younger of the two, Kimberly, reached the age of twenty-five. At that time, whatever remained of the 20 percent share was to be distributed to the two grandchildren in equal shares. Because neither of the grandchildren had attained the age of twenty-five at the time of the settlor’s death, the trustee, Wilson, elected to establish a second trust to administer 1', 'Because several individuals share the same last name, we will refer to them by their first names. No disrespect is intended. Kimberly and Jeffrey are the children of Janet’s son, Jay. That son was not a beneficiary of the living trust.', '-2- the 20 percent share. This second trust was denominated the Janet S. Bagdis Continuing Trust (the Trust) and the corpus was held in a cash account at Fidelity Investments.', 'Under her discretionary powers, Wilson apparently intended to distribute all the remaining assets in equal shares to Jeffrey and Kimberly before the automatic termination date of March 13, 2014. Wilson asked both Jeffrey and Kimberly to sign a release discharging her of her duties and releasing her of any liability. As is common in trust administration, in return for a release, Wilson would then make the distribution of that beneficiary’s share of the Trust. Kimberly did not sign the release in exchange for the distribution of her $37,565.75 share. 2', 'Epistolary Episodes', 'The record indicates that between September 2010 and December 2012, Wilson attempted on numerous occasions to contact Kimberly to discuss the distribution of the Trust assets that were being held for her benefit. After she sent Kimberly four letters, via certified or priority mail, to her home in Pennsylvania, and after speaking with both Kimberly’s brother and mother, Wilson finally heard from Kimberly in December 2011. Kimberly explained to her aunt that she had received both the letter informing her of her share and the accompanying release, but that she had not yet gone to the bank to set up the necessary account to deposit the funds and that she needed a new copy of the release. Wilson obliged, and followed up in January 2012 by sending Kimberly a text message to ensure that the release had arrived. Kimberly informed her aunt that the materials had arrived, but that she still had yet to go to the bank.', 'When, after the passage of ten more months, Wilson had no further response from Kimberly, she decided to make two last attempts at contacting her niece. First, Wilson sent Kimberly yet another letter, again asking that she sign the release and requesting that she call if 2', 'Kimberly was the only beneficiary who did not sign a release. After Wilson received a release from her brother Neil and her nephew Jeffrey, she immediately distributed their shares.', '-3- she had any questions about the process. Also, Wilson both telephoned Kimberly and sent her a text message to follow up on this latest correspondence. Once again, Wilson did not receive a response. Finally, by March 2013, it became apparent to Wilson that Kimberly would not be signing the release.', 'With Kimberly’s twenty-fifth birthday—and, therefore, the Trust’s termination—looming in the near future, Wilson retained the services of an attorney to advise her about the winding down of the Trust.', 'The attorney sent Kimberly a letter explaining that the distribution of $37,565.75 to her was one of the final tasks necessary to complete the administration of her grandmother’s estate. Wilson’s attorney also informed Kimberly that her failure to return the executed release would result in a further delay in administering the estate and waste Kimberly’s portion of the Trust proceeds. Again, the letter asked Kimberly to call if she had any questions.', 'Kimberly did not respond to Wilson or her attorney for four months.', 'At long last, Kimberly responded in August 2013. In her letter to Wilson, Kimberly acknowledged that she had received the letter from Wilson’s attorney and she requested a full accounting of the Trust account. Additionally, Kimberly instructed Wilson that in terminating the Trust, “no funds to which I am entitled should be spent to pay for an attorney for this purpose. If you need to have an attorney guide you in how a trustee should conduct herself, then it is your responsibility to pay for that attorney personally.” Kimberly replied separately to Wilson’s attorney, repeating her request for an accounting and informing him of her refusal to sign the release, in part based on her belief that Rhode Island law does not require that a beneficiary sign a release before receiving her share of the Trust assets.', 'Wilson acquiesced to Kimberly’s request two weeks later. In her response, Wilson included a detailed explanation and accounting of the Janet S. Bagdis Living Trust and the Janet', '-4- S. Bagdis Continuing Trust. The explanatory letter included copies of all documents regarding expenses paid from the Trust, tax filings, as well as an accounting of the remaining available Trust assets, totaling $36,559. Wilson followed up with a phone call and text message to Kimberly several days later.', 'She again received no reply.', 'Wilson then reached out to Kimberly’s brother, Jeffrey, in hopes of resolving the situation.', 'When she spoke with Jeffrey in mid-September, she explained that she had been trying to close the estate for the previous three years but had been unable to do so because of Kimberly’s reluctance. 3', 'Several days later, Wilson received a letter from Kimberly, restating her refusal to sign the release because she believed it required a “fraudulent attestation,” and that it was “illegal.” Kimberly then requested that Wilson immediately disburse her share of the Trust to her, without a release. Wilson forwarded this letter to her attorney who, in turn, responded to Kimberly, informing her that although there was no law requiring her to sign the release, doing so is standard procedure in trust administration and that there was nothing fraudulent about asking her to sign it. Included in the letter was an updated release for the amount of $32,500, which sum reflected the legal fees that had been incurred by the Trust. The letter requested that Kimberly respond by October 25, 2013.', 'By January 2014, there was still no response from Kimberly. Wilson’s attorney sent Kimberly yet another letter, by certified mail, informing her of Wilson’s intention to file a miscellaneous petition in the Providence County Superior Court seeking permission to deposit Kimberly’s funds in the court registry so Wilson could wind down the administration of the Trust, terminate it, and be released from her fiduciary duties.', 'Wilson also requested that Kimberly respond by the end of January to claim the remaining $32,500 so as to avoid any 3', 'She also forwarded Jeffrey the most recent correspondence between herself and Kimberly. Jeffrey reached out to his sister, who again stated that she would refuse to sign the release.', '-5- further expenses and delays associated with filing in the Superior Court. The certified letter’s return receipt was returned during the first week of February, signed by “P. Bagdis.” 4 Wilson again sought out Jeffrey in hopes of getting in touch with Kimberly. He reported back a week later, saying that he had spoken to Kimberly but that she still refused to execute the release.', 'Finally, on February 27, 2014, Wilson filed a miscellaneous petition in the Superior Court. Several days later, Wilson received a letter from Kimberly on March 1, 2014. In it, Kimberly accused Wilson of breaching her fiduciary duty by failing to prudently manage the Trust assets and by her “appalling” decision to hire an attorney and use Trust assets that had been “frittered away on unnecessary legal expenses.”', 'Kimberly again demanded that Wilson immediately distribute the remaining Trust assets without requiring that she sign the release. The Superior Court scheduled a hearing for March 19, 2014, to hear Wilson’s petitions. According to Wilson, she received a call on March 9, 2014, from Kimberly’s mother, Pamela, who discouraged her from going forward with the court proceedings.', 'However, an undaunted Wilson telephoned Kimberly to explain that she would be going forward with her petitions in Superior Court. When Kimberly did not return her call, Wilson sent Kimberly a text message informing her of the same. Kimberly responded to her aunt’s text message with another letter, dated March 11, 2014, reiterating her refusal to sign the release and challenging the accuracy of the accounting that Wilson had provided to her.', 'The Hearings', 'Kimberly did not appear at the scheduled hearing on March 19, 2014. Nonetheless, the trial justice ordered that the remaining Trust assets be deposited into the court registry. Wilson filed several other miscellaneous petitions including petitions for (1) approval of the first and 4', 'Kimberly’s mother is Pamela Bagdis. Apparently, she is a graduate of Drexel University’s School of Law.', '-6- final accountings; (2) termination of the Trust; and (3) approval of attorneys’ fees. Those matters were scheduled for a hearing on July 16, 2014.', 'The acrimonious correspondence finally ended when Kimberly attended the July hearing. The trial justice expressed concern about the payment of legal fees from Kimberly’s share of the trust. Specifically, the trial justice asked what, if any, case law Wilson had to support the payment of attorneys’ fees from a beneficiary’s share of the Trust, in light of the fact that the release benefited only the fiduciary, Wilson, and not the beneficiary, Kimberly. After asking Kimberly what concerns she had about her aunt’s administration and accounting of the Trust assets, the trial justice continued the matter until August 21, 2014. In the meantime, Wilson was instructed to provide the court with a memorandum outlining Wilson’s ability to charge reasonable and necessary attorneys’ fees against Kimberly’s share of the Trust and to provide Kimberly with more information regarding certain expenses that had been incurred during the administration of the Trust.', 'Just before the new hearing date, Wilson’s attorney received a call from Pamela, Kimberly’s mother, advising him that Kimberly would be unable to attend the hearing and requesting that the matter be rescheduled to September 17, 2014. Wilson’s attorney complied with that request. That day, Wilson’s attorney received an email from Kimberly at 12:45 a.m., confirming that the hearing would take place at 2 p.m. 5 When Kimberly failed to appear, the trial justice heard argument from Wilson’s attorney and granted her motion to approve the accounting and the motion for attorneys’ fees. He also ordered that Wilson be released from her duties as trustee. 5', 'When Wilson’s attorney appeared for the hearing he was informed that, because the trial justice was presiding over a trial, the matter would be heard before a different justice of the Superior Court.', '-7-', 'Around 10:30 p.m. that evening, Wilson’s attorney received an email from Kimberly stating that the matter was going to be heard the next day, September 18, 2014, at 9:30 a.m. The following morning, citing a scheduling error in the clerk’s communication with Kimberly, the Superior Court vacated its prior rulings and allowed Kimberly to be heard on the record. After hearing Kimberly’s concerns about the $3,663.89 in reimbursements to Wilson and the attorneys’ fees, the trial justice granted both motions. The trial justice found that the claimed attorneys’ fees of $5,777.44 were fair and reasonable and ordered that they be paid from Kimberly’s share of the Trust. Kimberly timely appealed those decisions.', 'Analysis', '1', 'Did the Superior Court Err In', 'Approving The First and Final Accounting?', 'Before this Court, Kimberly argues that the Superior Court erred when it approved the first and final accounting and when it approved the payment of the final debts and expenses, as well as administration costs, from the corpus of the Trust. She maintains that Wilson breached her fiduciary duty by not using funds she alleges were available outside the Trust to pay those costs. 6 However, it is apparent to us that Kimberly overlooks the language set forth in paragraph second of the Trust that says that “the Trustee shall pay from the Trust as a whole or any part of the Settlor’s debts, the expenses of the Settlor’s funeral and of settling the Settlor’s estate, legacies provided in the Settlor’s will, and estate, inheritance and other death taxes * * *.” (Emphasis added.) It is clear to this Court that the Trust not only authorized Wilson to pay all or 6', 'Kimberly cites to a homeowner’s policy in Janet’s name. However, that policy related to Wilson’s home, where Janet was the sole occupant. Kimberly also points to miscellaneous furniture and a vehicle that Janet owned. The record reveals that Wilson disposed of the furniture and vehicle and the $500 in proceeds were deposited into the Trust account.', '-8- part of these expenses from the Trust, but indeed, it mandated that she do so. We have held that when “the language of a trust or a will ‘expressly states the [settlor or] testator’s intention, resort to the rules of * * * construction is without warrant * * *.’” Steinhof v. Murphy, 991 A.2d 1028, 1033 (R.I. 2010) (quoting In re DiBiasio, 705 A.2d 972, 973–74 (R.I. 1998)). Because the Trust expressly authorized Wilson to use the Trust assets to pay these costs, the trial justice committed no error when he approved the first and final accounting.', '2', 'Did the Superior Court Err In', 'Discharging Wilson From Her Fiduciary Duties?', 'Kimberly further argues that the Superior Court erred when it discharged and released Wilson from her fiduciary duty because, she contends, Wilson breached that duty by acting in an imprudent manner because she placed Kimberly’s share of the Trust in a cash account after Janet’s death. Moreover, Kimberly argues that Wilson’s actions violated G. L. 1956 § 18-15-1, which holds trustees to a standard of care under the “Prudent [I]nvestor [R]ule.” Section 18-15-2(b) requires a review of “[a] trustee’s investment and management decisions respecting individual assets * * * not in isolation but in the context of the trust portfolio as a whole and as part of an overall investment strategy having risk and return objectives reasonably suited to the trust.” In devising an overall investment strategy, § 18-15- 2(c) requires that a trustee consider, among other things, “(1) [g]eneral economic conditions; (2) [t]he possible effect of inflation or deflation; * * * (5) [t]he expected total return from income and the appreciation of capital; [and] * * * (7) [n]eeds for liquidity, regularity of income, and preservation or appreciation of capital[.]” Importantly, under the Prudent Investor Rule, “the prudence of a trustee’s conduct is to be judged on the basis of circumstances at the time of that conduct, not with the benefit of', '-9- hindsight or by taking account of developments that occur after the time of the action or decision.” Restatement (Third) Trusts § 77 cmt. a at 82 (2007).', 'Kimberly argues that placing the Trust assets in a cash account was imprudent because the funds earned “a meager $59.66” in interest over four years. However, even hindsight is of no help to Kimberly. First, the record is clear that Wilson did not intend to hold the assets for Kimberly’s benefit until the Trust terminated by court order on October 1, 2014. Rather, she intended to distribute Kimberly’s share almost immediately after Janet’s death in 2010. It was because of Kimberly’s delay and obstruction that Wilson was forced to defer the distribution of the Trust assets. Even with that consideration, given the relatively short and finite period between Janet’s death and the termination of the Trust, we cannot say that Wilson breached her fiduciary duty. We agree with Wilson that she did not breach her fiduciary duty by placing the entirety of the funds into a cash account to insulate the assets from the risk of market volatility and preserve the assets over a relatively short time horizon.', '3', 'Did the Superior Court Err In Ordering That', 'Attorneys’ Fees Be Paid Out Of Kimberly’s Share?', 'Kimberly argues that the Superior Court erred when it ordered that the fiduciary’s attorneys’ fees be paid from her share of the Trust assets. We disagree. Kimberly is correct in pointing out that there is no statutory requirement that she sign a release before funds from the estate are disbursed to her. However, it is significant that, until the Trust’s original termination date of March 13, 2014, Wilson was under no obligation to disburse anything to her because Wilson was vested with complete discretion about when and in what amount to disburse them. With respect to the attorneys’ fees, we have recently affirmed the proposition that “we typically adhere steadfastly to the American Rule that, in the absence of a statute providing otherwise,', '- 10 - each litigant is responsible for the litigant’s own legal expenses.” Shine v. Moreau, 119 A.3d 1, 9 (R.I. 2015). However, exceptions exist to that rule; specifically, a judge may appropriately award attorneys’ fees to the prevailing party where contractual or statutory authorization exists. See Insurance Company of North America v. Kayser-Roth Corp., 770 A.2d 403, 419 (R.I. 2001). For a statutory basis to exist, “our precedent indicates that a statute must explicitly include attorneys’ fees in order for a court to award attorneys’ fees pursuant to that statute.” Shine, 119 A.3d at 10 (citing Eleazer v. Ted Reed Thermal Inc., 576 A.2d 1217, 1221 (R.I. 1990)). But once it has been established that “there is such a basis, then this Court will review a motion justice’s actual award of attorneys’ fees for an abuse of discretion.” Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island v. Najarian, 911 A.2d 706, 709 (R.I. 2006). Here, it is our opinion that there is such statutory authorization. General Laws 1956 § 18-6-2 says in relevant part:', '“(a) Whenever a trustee holds any sum of money * * *', 'payable or deliverable to, or the property of, another, and the', 'person entitled to it cannot, for any reason, give proper receipt or', 'discharge for it, and the trustee holding the money or property', 'desires to free himself or herself from further liability for it, the', 'trustee may pay or deliver the money or property into the registry', 'of the [S]uperior [C]ourt, presenting with it his or her petition', 'praying to be discharged, and setting out, under oath, to the best of', 'the knowledge, information, and belief of the affiant, the', 'circumstances under which the trustee holds the money or', 'property, and how the other person or persons is or are entitled to', 'it, and why the trustee or they cannot give proper receipt or', 'discharge for the money or property; and upon the filing of the', 'petition, notice of it shall be given in the manner that the court', 'shall direct.', '“* * *', '“(c) The costs and expenses, including expenses and', 'counsel fees of the trustee, as between solicitor and client, as', 'allowed by the court or by one of the justices of the court, shall be', 'paid or retained accordingly out of the money or property.”', '(Emphases added.)', '- 11 - In interpreting the language of § 18-6-2, we are very much aware of the fundamental principle that “when the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, this Court must interpret the statute literally and must give the words of the statute their plain and ordinary meanings.” State v. Diamante, 83 A.3d 546, 548 (R.I. 2014) (quoting Accent Store Design, Inc. v. Marathon House, Inc., 674 A.2d 1223, 1226 (R.I. 1996)). However, “[w]ith respect to statutes providing for an award of attorneys’ fees, we have stated that such statutes ‘are in derogation of the common law’ and, consequently, must be strictly construed.” Shine, 119 A.3d at 10 (quoting Moore v. Ballard, 914 A.2d 487, 489 n.3 (R.I. 2007)).', 'Although we have not yet construed § 18-6-2 in this context, it is clear that the statute expressly provides that when a beneficiary for any reason cannot discharge a trustee of his or her fiduciary duty, the trustee may deposit the funds into the court’s registry. We are of the considered opinion that, despite the necessity for strict construction, the phrase “for any reason” creates a broad standard that includes a beneficiary’s outright refusal to release a fiduciary of personal liability in exchange for receiving her share of the trust assets. By allowing a trustee to deposit the trust’s remaining assets into the court’s registry when such an occasion arises, § 18-6-2 strikes an appropriate balance between incentivizing an individual to serve as trustee, by ensuring that that individual does not face the specter of future personal liability, while also providing the beneficiary with the opportunity to demonstrate the trustee’s liability for any potential breach that may have occurred before the assets were deposited in the court’s registry.', 'Moreover, the language in § 18-6-2(c) providing that attorneys’ fees be paid out of trust assets “as allowed by the court or by one of the justices of the court” also strikes a balance between the American Rule and our courts’ equitable authority to award attorneys’ fees. See Najarian, 911 A.2d at 711 n.5 (acknowledging this Court’s ability to award attorneys’ fees “as an', '- 12 - exercise of its inherent power to fashion an appropriate remedy that would serve the ends of justice”) (quoting Vincent v. Musone, 574 A.2d 1234, 1235 (R.I. 1990)). This, of course, is not to say that simply because § 18-6-2 provides for an exception to the American Rule, it opens the door for attorneys’ fees in every case that falls within its ambit.', 'Rather, when awarding attorneys’ fees, the discretion exercised by a trial justice should be “in the light of reason as applied to all the facts and with a view to the rights of all the parties to the action while having regard for what is right and equitable under the circumstances and the law.” Dauray v. Mee, 109 A.3d 832, 846 (R.I. 2015) (quoting Hartman v. Carter, 121 R.I. 1, 4-5, 393 A.2d 1102, 1105 (1978)). It is to the application of that discretion that we now turn.', 'After a review of the record, we cannot say that the trial justice abused his discretion when he ordered that attorneys’ fees be paid from Kimberly’s share of the Trust assets. The record is clear that any delay in the distribution of Kimberly’s share was the result of her own recalcitrance, her refusal to respond to notices, her requests for continuances, and her refusal to sign the release after Wilson’s continued efforts to make contact with her in attempt to distribute the funds to Kimberly. In short, Kimberly led the trustee on a wild goose chase while the trustee made every reasonable effort to conclude the matter. It is also clear from the record that Kimberly’s stubborn lack of cooperation made it necessary for Wilson to petition the court to accept the deposit of the remaining Trust assets into the court registry. Importantly, Kimberly argued before the trial justice that she refused to sign the release because it would have discharged Wilson in her individual capacity. However, when asked by the trial justice if she had any claims against Wilson personally, Kimberly conceded that she had none. Absent any legitimate reason why Kimberly would refuse to sign the release, which would have rendered', '- 13 - this litigation unnecessary, it is our opinion that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion when he concluded that the attorneys’ fees should be satisfied from Kimberly’s share of the Trust.', '4', 'The Due Process Issues', 'Kimberly argues that she did not receive proper notice of the September 17, 2014 hearing and that her due process rights were violated because she was unable to cross-examine Wilson while she was under oath. 7 These arguments are without merit because Kimberly has failed to demonstrate that any specific due process right was violated in the proceedings below. First, it is clear from the record that Kimberly did in fact receive notice of the September 17, 2014, hearing date. The record reveals that the hearing was originally scheduled for August 21, 2014, and that it was Kimberly, through her mother, who requested that the hearing be rescheduled to September 17, 2014. The record further demonstrates that Kimberly sent an email to Wilson’s counsel at 12:54 a.m., the morning of the September 17, 2014, hearing to confirm that the hearing was scheduled for later that day. Second, the scheduling confusion aside, the record further reveals that the very next day the trial justice vacated the ruling that he had made the previous day and that Kimberly was fully heard on her objections to the accounting and payment of legal fees. Importantly, Kimberly did not raise the issue of her inability to question Wilson at the September 18, 2014, hearing and, therefore, she waived the issue and may not now raise it on appeal. See Heritage Healthcare Services, Inc. v. Beacon Mutual Insurance Co., 109 A.3d 373, 377 n.9 (R.I. 2015) (“[I]ssues not properly presented before the trial court may not be raised for 7', 'Kimberly also argues that Wilson violated her brother Jeffrey’s due process rights by failing to give proper notice. However, Jeffrey is not before this Court challenging the notice and Kimberly does not have standing to assert her brother’s right to notice. See Cruz v. Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., 108 A.3d 992, 996 (R.I. 2015) (noting “standing is generally limited to those plaintiffs asserting their own rights, not the rights of others”) (quoting Mruk v.

This case came before the Supreme Court on January 21, 2016, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised by this appeal should not summarily be decided. The plaintiffs, Mark and Pamela Van Hoesen, appeal from the grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant, Certain Underwriters at Lloyd’s of London, after Mr. Van Hoesen was injured in a fall after a deck railing gave way and he plummeted to the ground below. 1', 'On appeal, plaintiffs argue that the hearing justice erred when she (1) failed to find that, as a matter of public policy, the terms of the contract insured the work of the building contractor who built the deck; and (2) failed to determine whether the terms of the insurance contract violated the statutory minimum for coverage requirements.

After considering counsels’ oral and written arguments, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that this case can be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons given below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'The plaintiff, Mark Van Hoesen, was seriously injured when he fell from a deck on July 23, 2012. Two years later, Mr. Van Hoesen, along with his wife, Pamela, filed a complaint in Washington County Superior Court, alleging that a contractor, Brian Leonard, negligently constructed the deck. 2 When the constable returned the summons marked non est inventus, plaintiffs moved to substitute Leonard’s insurer, Lloyd’s of London. 3', 'The Superior Court granted the motion to substitute and plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, removing Leonard and naming Lloyd’s as defendant.', 'Lloyd’s filed an answer, admitting that it had issued the insurance policy in question and that the policy provided coverage to Leonard from March 8, 2007 until the policy was canceled on August 29, 2007. However, the carrier denied that the policy afforded coverage for plaintiffs’ injuries because, even had it not been canceled, the policy, by its unambiguous terms, had expired long before the injuries alleged in plaintiffs’ complaint occurred. Soon afterwards, defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that it did not insure Leonard “for Plaintiff’s alleged accident and injuries, because [the policy] applies to bodily injury only if the 2', 'The complaint also asserted a claim of loss of consortium on behalf of Mrs. Van Hoesen. 3', 'General Laws 1956 § 27-7-2 says that “[a]n injured party * * * in his or her suit against the insured, shall not join the insurer as a defendant.

Although G.L. 1956 § 27-7-2 allows an injured party to proceed directly against an insurer when the constable returns process non est inventus, defendant maintained that substitution was not proper in this case because plaintiffs failed to make a good faith effort to serve Leonard in that they made only a “single attempt at service at a vacant house by a constable who provide[d] no explanation as to why he believed Leonard resided at the vacant house.”', 'The trial justice granted defendant’s motion because “the undisputed evidence of the record indicates that there [was] no insurance policy that covers this particular claim * * *.” Specifically, she said that she was “not at all persuaded that the General Assembly intended or requires that the insurance company be responsible for something beyond what it contracted for” and that the court could not “require or interpret an insurance company as providing more than what has been contractually entered into between the parties.” As to defendant’s alternative basis for summary judgment, based on plaintiffs’ alleged meager efforts to locate and serve process upon the original defendant, she found that this was within the province of the jury and therefore not appropriate for summary judgment.

They assert that she failed to account for public policy considerations when she granted summary judgment because the terms of the insurance policy inadequately insured Leonard’s construction of the deck. In its cross-appeal, defendant challenges the denial of its motion for summary judgment on the alternative basis that plaintiffs did not make reasonable efforts to locate Leonard as required by § 27-7-2.', 'Because we are of the opinion that it is dispositive, we will address plaintiffs’ public policy argument first. The plaintiffs argue that, notwithstanding the plain language in the policy that would exclude any claim arising from Leonard’s negligence from coverage, the policy, if enforced as written, would contravene “both the letter and the spirit” of G.L. 1956 § 5-65-7(a), which requires that', '“Throughout the period of registration, the contractor shall have in', 'effect public liability and property damage insurance covering the', 'work of that contractor which shall be subject to this chapter in not', 'less than the following amount: five hundred thousand dollars', '($500,000) combined single limit, bodily injury and property', 'damage.” The plaintiffs argue that, because the policy issued to Leonard covered only injuries that occurred while the policy was in force, and because Lloyd’s canceled the policy a few weeks after Leonard finished constructing the deck, the net result was that the policy provided almost no coverage at all, and certainly none to them. The statutorily mandated coverage is rendered a nullity, they argue, if coverage can be terminated in the immediate aftermath of the work. Creative as this argument may be, we are unconvinced as to its merits.', 'By its plain language, § 5-65-7 provides that the contractor is required to carry insurance “[t]hroughout the period of registration.” The statute imposes no duty whatsoever on any insurer', '-5- to provide continuing coverage after the policy period has expired. Indeed, chapter 65 of title 5 provides for penalties against contractors who fail to maintain insurance, but not against an insurer who cancels policy coverage.', 'For example, § 5-65-7(c) provides that “[f]ailure to maintain insurance shall invalidate registration and may result in a fine to the registrant;” § 5-65-10(a)(2) provides that the Contractors’ Registration and Licensing Board “may revoke, suspend, or refuse to issue, reinstate, or reissue a certificate of registration if the board or commission determines * * * [t]hat the insurance required by § 5-65-7 is not currently in effect;” and, both § 5-65-10(b) and § 5-65-10(c) provide that a contractor who fails to maintain insurance may be subject to an injunction or fine. We see nothing in either the letter or the spirit of the law that would require an insurer to provide coverage after the contractual period has expired, or, as is the case here, when a contractor fails to honor his obligations under the policy.', 'The plaintiffs’ efforts to draw analogies to statutes and case law regarding uninsured motorists coverage under automobile insurance policies is also unpersuasive. In short, plaintiffs argue that their predicament is akin to that of a victim in an accident involving an uninsured motorist, because Mr. Van Hoesen’s injuries were caused by an uninsured tortfeasor. However, unlike the uninsured motorist statute, § 27-7-2.1, which mandates the uninsured motorist coverage be offered to an insured, the insurance mandate in § 5-65-7 requires that the contractor procure insurance as a means of providing protection to the public. It is clear to us that the uninsured motorist statute imposes a duty on a policy holder’s own insurer to provide coverage for injuries caused by an uninsured motorist. Indeed, we have noted that the uninsured motorist provision “provides coverage where the tortfeasor causing the accident does not have liability insurance, and thus the insured who has been injured is compensated by his or her own insurance company.” VanMarter v. Royal Indemnity Co., 556 A.2d 41, 43 (R.I. 1989) (emphasis added).', '-6- When it enacted that legislation, the General Assembly “deemed it advisable in the public interest to require insurance carriers authorized to do business in this state to provide protection against the negligent operation of uninsured automobiles in favor of those motorists who voluntarily contract with licensed carriers for liability coverage in the interests of the public generally.” Allstate Insurance Co. v. Fusco, 110 R.I. 350, 355-56, 223 A.2d 447, 450 (1966).', 'By contrast, § 5-65-7 requires only that contractors maintain certain insurance; it imposes no duty on the insurance company to provide coverage for bodily injuries that might happen outside the policy period. If this Court were to hold as plaintiffs ask, the result would be that insurers would have ongoing liability for injuries to third parties long after the contractual relationship with the insured has ended. The General Assembly has enacted no such scheme.', 'The insurance contract at issue here required that Lloyd’s provide insurance coverage and that Leonard would pay a premium for that coverage. When he failed to do so, Lloyd’s, exercising its contractual rights, canceled the policy. And, even if that cancellation had not occurred, the relevant portion of the policy pertaining to coverage for bodily injury and property damage liability, says that', '“1. Insuring Agreement', '“a. We will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated', 'to pay as damages because of ‘bodily injury’ or ‘property damage’ to', 'which this insurance applies.', '“* * *', '“b. This insurance applies to ‘bodily injury’ and ‘property damage’', 'only if:', '“* * *', '“(2) The ‘bodily injury’ or ‘property damage’ occurs during the', 'policy period.” (Emphasis added.)', '-7- The plaintiffs argue that in order to carry out the aims of § 5-65-7, the policy should cover their claims because the triggering event that caused Mr. Van Hoesen’s bodily injury was Leonard’s faulty workmanship, which occurred during the policy period. However, we conclude from the terms of the contract, that for the plaintiffs’ claims to be covered, the “bodily injury” must also have occurred during the policy period. We have said that, “[w]hen a court is called upon to interpret the terms of an insurance policy, which is essentially a contract between the insurance company and its insured, effect must be given to the plain, ordinary meaning of the language employed.” Mullins v. Federal Dairy Co., 568 A.2d 759, 762 (R.I. 1990). For that reason, the Superior Court correctly granted the defendant’s motion for summary judgment. Because the Superior Court was correct in granting summary judgment, that disposes of this case.

The lease also provided that: “[n]otwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Exhibit 2', 'White rice was not listed in the permitted Japan Café menu that was incorporated within the lease.', ""-3- ‘I’[,] Landlord warrants that Tenant's incidental sale or use of Basmati Rice as a side dish or ingredient shall not be deemed a violation of the prohibition of the sale of rice.” Gourmet India began serving food-court customers in June 2005."", 'On October 14, 2005, plaintiffs brought this action against Rouse, Gourmet India, and Japan Café in the Providence County Superior Court. The plaintiffs sought to enjoin Gourmet India and Japan Café from selling the foods to which they alleged having exclusive rights. They also requested that the court order Rouse to enforce its lease agreements with Cathay Cathay and Surf & Turf against Gourmet India and Japan Café. In addition to injunctive relief, plaintiffs sought compensatory damages for which they requested a jury trial. The plaintiffs subsequently filed an amended complaint, which also included counts for tortious interference against both Gourmet India and Japan Café, and they sought an injunction to enforce the provisions of the lease agreement between Gourmet India and Rouse, alleging a third-party contractual interest in the lease.', 'The Superior Court commenced its hearing for a preliminary injunction on November 30, 2005. After a full day of witness testimony, the trial justice stated that he was “inclined to direct that the matter be consolidated for a trial on the merits” in accordance with Rule 65 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.3 He stated:', '“We can get everything that can reasonably be tried, tried now.

He instructed the parties to consider the issue of consolidation overnight. Returning to the issue the next day, December 1, 2005, counsel for plaintiffs told the trial justice that his clients may seek to add another count against Rouse depending on the outcome of the present proceeding. The trial justice responded, “I can only deal with what is in front of me now.” Without objection, the trial justice ordered from the bench that he was “consolidating the present hearing, the preliminary injunction[,] with any final claim for permanent injunction.” No written order was issued.', 'At the conclusion of the proceeding on January 13, 2006, the trial justice granted Gourmet India’s motion for judgment on partial findings, in accordance with Rule 52(c) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.4 The court entered partial final judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure on January 27, 2006. The plaintiffs appealed that judgment to this Court; neither Rouse nor Japan Café were parties to that appeal, and the claims against these defendants remained pending in the Superior Court.', 'On May 4, 2006, while plaintiffs’ appeal of the Gourmet India judgment was pending, the trial justice issued another bench decision (May 4, 2006 decision). In the words of the trial justice: “For the purposes of this decision I consider the application of the plaintiffs, Cathay 4', 'Rule 52(c) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure provides, in relevant part:', '“If during a trial without a jury a party has been fully heard on an', 'issue and the court finds against the party on that issue, the court', 'may enter judgment as a matter of law against that party with', 'respect to a claim or defense that cannot under the controlling law', 'be maintained or defeated without a favorable finding on that', 'issue, or the court may decline to render any judgment until the', 'close of all the evidence.”', '-5- [Cathay] * * * and Surf & Turf * * *, for injunctive relief against defendants, Japan Café of Providence Place, Inc., Rouse Providence, LLC [sic].” (Emphasis added.) The trial justice focused his findings on whether Japan Café violated its lease agreement by selling white rice and other prohibited foods. He found such a breach and granted plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief against Japan Café.', 'The bench decision was almost exclusively limited to the liability of Japan Café. Although the trial justice noted in passing that Rouse owed plaintiffs a duty of good faith and fair dealing, he did not address whether Rouse breached that duty by permitting Japan Café to violate the provisions of its lease with Rouse; he made no findings of fact on that issue. On May 17, 2006, the Superior Court issued a written order granting plaintiffs’ prayer for an injunction against Japan Café. The order does not grant plaintiffs relief against Rouse, nor does it purport to resolve plaintiffs’ claims for injunctive relief against Rouse in any way. Japan Café later closed its business.', 'On January 9, 2009, this Court issued its decision in Cathay Cathay I, 962 A.2d at 742, with regard to plaintiffs’ appeal of the judgment entered in favor of Gourmet India. We affirmed the judgment on plaintiffs’ contractual claims against Gourmet India, albeit on different grounds. Id. at 747. We vacated the ruling on plaintiffs’ claim of tortious interference and remanded the matter for a new trial on that count. Id. at 747-48.', 'On remand, the case was assigned to a second Superior Court justice, who, upon review of the papers, suggested that Rouse seek entry of partial final judgment in accordance with Rule 54(b). Rouse did so, and the motion was granted, over plaintiffs’ objection. The plaintiffs subsequently filed a motion for clarification and reconsideration, arguing that issues remained', '-6- outstanding that required further litigation, including the question of money damages relating to whether Rouse owed plaintiffs a reduction in rent pursuant to their respective lease agreements.5', 'When the Superior Court heard the motion on July 25, 2012, the trial justice admonished plaintiffs that they had not raised the issue of rent reduction in the original or first amended complaint or at trial.', 'She advised plaintiffs either to file a new complaint or amend the operative complaint if they sought to litigate the issue.', 'The court denied the motion for clarification or reconsideration.

Notably, the proposed second amended complaint added a claim for damages pursuant to the rent- reduction clause of their respective lease agreements and also included a new claim against Rouse for “bad faith.” At a September 27, 2012 hearing, the Superior Court justice denied plaintiffs’ motion to amend on the grounds of res judicata, futility, and judicial estoppel.', 'In these consolidated appeals, plaintiffs challenge (1) the entry of partial final judgment in favor of Rouse and (2) the denial of their second motion to amend the complaint. 5', 'Article 1, section 1.04(b) of Cathay Cathay’s lease agreement provides:', '“In the event that Landlord violates the terms of [Cathay', 'Cathay’s exclusive rights under] this Lease, Tenant’s sole and', 'exclusive remedy shall be a reduction of Tenant’s Fixed Annual', 'Minimum Rent then in effect by forty percent (40%) and a', 'proportionate adjustment of Annual Minimum Gross Receipts for', 'the period during which there continues to exist a violation of [the', 'exclusive rights under] this Lease.” Surf & Turf’s lease agreement contains a similar provision under its article 1, section 1.04(b). 6', 'Counts 1 and 2 of the amended complaint included every count against Rouse.', '-7-', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court reviews the entry of final judgment for an abuse of discretion.', 'Metro Properties, Inc. v.

Ocean State Jobbers, Inc., 18 A.3d 554, 558 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Harvey v. Town of Tiverton, 764 A.2d 141, 143 (R.I. 2001)).', 'Analysis', 'I. Partial Final Judgment', 'We begin with plaintiffs’ appeal from the entry of partial final judgment in favor of Rouse. Rule 54(b) provides, in relevant part:', '“When * * * multiple parties are involved, the court may direct the', 'entry of a final judgment as to one (1) or more but fewer than all of', 'the claims or parties only upon an express determination that there', 'is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the', 'entry of judgment.” In reviewing a Rule 54(b) certification of the entry of final judgment, this Court employs a two- part inquiry. See Metro Properties, Inc., 934 A.2d at 207. First, we assess “whether the [trial] justice properly determined that the action below involved either multiple parties or multiple claims and whether the lower court’s disposition adjudicated one or more but fewer than all of the claims before it.” Id. Adjudication requires the final, deliberate resolution of a dispute. See, e.g., Black’s Law Dictionary 50 (10th ed. 2014) (defining “adjudication” as “[t]he legal process of resolving a dispute; the process of judicially deciding a case”); see also Kalven v. City of', '-8- Chicago, 7 N.E.3d 741, 745 (Ill. App. Ct. 2014) (“‘Adjudication’ is generally understood to involve a formalized legal process that results in a final and enforceable decision.”). If such determinations were proper, we next ask “whether the [trial] justice ‘properly determined that there was no just reason for delay.’”', 'Metro Properties, Inc., 934 A.2d at 207 (quoting Westinghouse Broadcasting Co. v. Dial Media, Inc., 122 R.I. 571, 577, 410 A.2d 986, 989 (1980)).', 'Before embarking on this inquiry, however, we review the minimum requirements under the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure for a judicial determination to constitute a partial final judgment in a nonjury trial. In accordance with Rule 52(a) and (c), the decision must “find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law thereon.” Rule 52(a); see also Rule 52(c) (stating that a judgment on partial findings “shall be supported by findings of fact and conclusions of law as required by subdivision (a) of this rule”). While the decision need not include “extensive analysis and discussion of all the evidence presented in a bench trial,” Broadley v. State, 939 A.2d 1016, 1021 (R.I. 2008), it must contain, at the very minimum, a factual finding and a conclusion of law on each cause of action adjudicated, see, e.g., Cathay Cathay I, 962 A.2d at 747-48. Significantly, this Court vacated the judgment in Cathay Cathay I based on that very failure. See id. A decision fails to comply with the strictures of Rule 52(a) and (c) if it does not “yield a full understanding and resolution of the controlling and essential factual and legal issues.” Nardone v. Ritacco, 936 A.2d 200, 206 (R.I. 2007) (concluding that language from a Superior Court decision that “[i]t might be pointed out that for many years the defendants utilized the 10-12 foot way at the suggestion of the original grantor, but I believe [it] deliberately misstates the grantor’s language to justify their position at this time” was insufficient, on its own, to constitute an adjudication of the issue of whether the defendants had', '-9- established a prescriptive easement) (quoting Town of Charlestown v.

(quoting Beattie, 422 A.2d at 1251).', 'It is within this context that we commence with the first step of our two-part inquiry. As there is no dispute that the action involved multiple claims and parties, the threshold question is whether the claims against Rouse were adjudicated during the course of the hearing on injunctive relief. The second trial justice concluded that the May 4, 2006 decision, in which the first trial justice found that Japan Café had violated the terms of its lease with Rouse, also included a decision denying plaintiffs’ breach-of-contract claims against Rouse and as a third-party beneficiary of Japan Café’s contract. We disagree.', 'We are mindful that the language pertaining to the consolidation of the trial and the May 4, 2006 decision lacks clarity. We also note that the first trial justice’s statements from the bench on November 30, 2005, when he first broached the possibility of consolidation, are inconsistent with his subsequent rulings. However, following our careful scrutiny of the record, we are of the view that the first trial justice adjudicated only the claims for injunctive relief and not plaintiffs’ contractual claims against Rouse. His order from the bench on December 1, 2005, in which he indicated that he was “consolidating the present hearing, the preliminary injunction[,] with any final claim for permanent injunction,” demonstrates his intention to bifurcate the trial into separate proceedings on the claims for injunctive relief and the contractual claims—the latter of which are jury matters. (Emphasis added.) Moreover, in issuing the May 4, 2006 decision, the trial justice stated that “[f]or the purposes of this decision I consider the application of the plaintiffs * * * for injunctive relief against defendants.” (Emphasis added.) The first trial justice’s intention to try the breach-of-contract claims separately is further', '- 10 - evidenced by the May 17, 2006 order, which expressly granted plaintiffs relief against Japan Café but not Rouse. Although Rule 65 certainly gave the first trial justice the authority to consolidate the trial on both the prayers for injunctive relief and the contractual claims— assuming there was a jury waiver—it is clear from the record that he did not do so and addressed only the requests for the preliminary and permanent injunctive relief.', 'There is no record indication that the trial justice intended to simultaneously adjudicate the contractual claims against Rouse, nor did he.7', 'The May 4, 2006 decision contains but a single passing reference to the law related to Rouse:', '“Mr. Chu and Peter Steingraber, the vice president and the landlord', 'at the time, signed both leases and both clearly knew that David', 'Chu was the principal of both Surf & Turf and Cathay Cathay. No', 'one has suggested nor could they legitimately suggest that the', 'landlord was somehow violating the exclusive rights of the original', '[lease] of Cathay Cathay.” It is our conclusion that the second trial justice accorded undue weight to the latter sentence and overlooked the first when she found that the May 4, 2006 decision disposed of the contractual claims against Rouse. We deem this error. It is plain that the first trial justice was specifically referring to the lease agreement Rouse entered into with Surf & Turf—an entity also owned by Chu—not the landlord’s agreements with Gourmet India and Japan Café that were the subject of the dispute. The trial justice merely observed that Rouse did not violate the restrictive covenant with Cathay Cathay when it entered into a nearly identical restrictive covenant with Surf & Turf 7', 'We further note that Rouse represented in a memorandum to the Superior Court, submitted on May 10, 2007, in opposition to an unrelated motion by plaintiffs to adjudge Rouse in contempt of the May 17, 2006 order, that the first trial justice “consolidated the hearing on [Cathay] Cathay’s request for preliminary injunction with the trial on the merits of [Cathay] Cathay’s claim for injunctive relief.” (Emphasis added.) Rouse did not contend in 2007, as it does now, that the contractual claims were consolidated as well.', '- 11 - because Cathay Cathay and Surf & Turf shared common ownership under Chu. Because this statement by the first trial justice was the sole conclusion of law made with respect to Rouse— and it did not involve a matter in controversy—there simply was no basis for the second trial justice to conclude that the May 4, 2006 decision resolved the claims against Rouse. Indeed, if that were the case, that judgment would not withstand appellate scrutiny under Rule 52. See, e.g., Cathay Cathay I, 962 A.2d at 747-48.', 'Disregarding the absence of any conclusion of law with respect to plaintiffs’ breach-of- contract claims against Rouse within the May 4, 2006 decision, Rouse claims that “the lack of a damage award resulted from the fact that [plaintiffs] repeatedly and consistently disavowed the availability of a remedy at law before, during, and after trial.” Indeed, plaintiffs represented multiple times before the first trial justice that injunctive relief was the only adequate remedy to right the ship.8 It is not entirely clear from the record whether plaintiffs were referring only to their claims against Gourmet India and Japan Café, or if they intended to aver that injunctive relief was the lone remedy available against Rouse as well. Regardless, it is of no moment in the context of this appeal.', 'There simply is no evidence that the first trial justice made any determination as to Rouse’s contractual liability. To reach the issue of damages, he first would have had to rule on the breach-of-contract claims, which he did not.', 'Accordingly, the second trial justice abused her discretion in determining that there was an adjudication on the merits of plaintiffs’ contractual claims against Rouse.', 'Because we conclude that the first trial justice did not decide plaintiffs’ claims against Rouse, we need not 8', 'It was suggested at oral argument that plaintiffs did not seek injunctive relief against Rouse. However, a plain reading of the original and first amended complaints belies this assertion.', '- 12 - tread through the second step of the two-part inquiry as to whether Rule 54(b) certification was proper.', 'Nonetheless, we pause to note our strong preference for “avoid[ing] piecemeal appellate review by delaying entry of judgment until all claims involving all parties are ripe for disposition and entering judgment as to all only when that time arrives.” Metro Properties, Inc., 934 A.2d at 207 (quoting Robert B. Kent, et al., Rhode Island Civil Procedure, § 54:3 (West 2006)). In fact, we have observed that the very “purpose of [Rule 54(b)] is to avoid piecemeal appeals.” Astro- Med, Inc. v. R.

The plaintiffs, Henry and Mary Tarbox (plaintiffs), have appealed from a Superior Court decision that denied their request for reasonable litigation expenses pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice for Small Businesses and Individuals Act (act), see G.L. 1956 chapter 92 of title 42, which was made after the plaintiffs prevailed in their appeal from the denial of a dimensional variance by the defendant, the Zoning Board of Review of the Town of Jamestown (board). The plaintiffs contend that the trial justice misinterpreted the act. Having carefully reviewed the memoranda submitted by the parties and the arguments of counsel, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the appeal at this time. For the reasons set forth below, we quash the judgment and remand this case to the Superior Court.1 1', 'As we explain below, we elect to treat plaintiffs’ appeal as the equivalent of a petition for a writ of certiorari.', '-1-', 'Facts and Travel', 'The plaintiffs own a single-family home in Jamestown, Rhode Island. In September 2010, plaintiffs desired to construct an addition to their home so that Henry Tarbox’s mother could live in a small apartment connected to the dwelling; the planned construction would convert the Tarbox home from a single-family home into a duplex—a permitted use in the zoning district. However, the lot size of plaintiffs’ parcel was less than that required by the town’s zoning ordinance (ordinance) for a duplex in the zoning district, causing plaintiffs to seek dimensional relief from the board. The board held a hearing on the variance application, at which plaintiffs were represented by counsel.', 'Henry Tarbox testified in support of the application, and he and his attorney were peppered with questions from board members.2 Although no objectors appeared to oppose plaintiffs’ variance application and no evidence was taken in opposition, the board members were divided, with three voting in favor of the application and two voting against it. Even though a majority of the board voted in favor of the application, the application was denied because it failed to garner the requisite number of votes, as mandated by the state’s Zoning Enabling Act. See G.L. 1956 § 45-24-57(2)(iii) (requiring that a zoning ordinance must provide that “[t]he concurring vote of four (4) of the five (5) members of the zoning board of review sitting at a hearing is required to decide in favor of an applicant on any matter within the discretion of the board upon which it is required to pass under the ordinance, including variances and special-use permits”). 2', 'The proceeding was transcribed.', '-2-', 'The plaintiffs appealed the board’s decision to the Superior Court3 in accordance with § 45-24-69, and, in a written decision, a justice of the Superior Court reversed the decision and granted plaintiffs’ variance application. Emboldened by this victory, plaintiffs filed a motion for an award of reasonable litigation expenses under the act; the board opposed the motion.4 A second Superior Court justice5 denied plaintiffs’ motion, reasoning that the board was not an “agency” within the purview of the act and that the hearing before the board was not an “adjudicatory proceeding” as that term is defined in the act. Shortly thereafter, the trial justice entered final judgment vacating the board’s decision, granting plaintiffs’ variance application, and denying plaintiffs’ motion for reasonable litigation expenses. The plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal from the entry of final judgment.', 'Analysis', 'Procedural Hurdle: Appeal or Certiorari', 'On appeal, plaintiffs argue that the trial justice misinterpreted the act in concluding that the board is not an “agency” and that the hearing on plaintiffs’ variance application was not an “adjudicatory proceeding” under the act. Before tackling the merits of this argument, however, we must first address whether plaintiffs, by filing a notice of appeal rather than a petition for a writ of certiorari, proceeded under the proper procedural vehicle for obtaining this Court’s review of the denial of their motion for reasonable litigation expenses under the act. This 3', 'Pursuant to Rule 80(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, plaintiffs filed a complaint to initiate this agency appeal. 4', 'The plaintiffs later successfully moved to amend their complaint to reflect their motion for reasonable litigation expenses. 5', 'We shall refer to this justice as “the trial justice.”', '-3- requires us to carefully examine the provisions of the act in light of the parties’ contentions, an exercise that is multifaceted based on the pertinent provisions of the act.', 'The board claims that plaintiffs were required to petition this Court for a writ of certiorari. To support this argument, the board points to language from the act that declares that the act is intended to supplement the provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), G.L. 1956 chapter 35 of title 42, and that, in the event of any conflict between the APA and the act, the provisions of the APA control. See § 42-92-7.6 According to the board, because the act does not explicitly provide for the method of seeking this Court’s review of a decision under the act, and because the APA provides for review in this Court by certiorari, that provision of the APA controls. See § 42-35-16.7 However, the APA does not encompass zoning appeals; by its terms, § 42-35-16 of the APA applies only to “proceedings brought under § 42-35-15.” See Fox v. Norberg, 110 R.I. 418, 422, 293 A.2d 520, 523 (1972). Because this case was brought under § 45-24-69 of the state’s Zoning Enabling Act, the provisions of the APA do not apply. See Caran v. Freda, 108 R.I. 748, 751, 279 A.2d 405, 407 (1971) (“[T]he [APA] * * * relates only to state agencies and not municipal zoning boards * * *.”); Robert B. Kent et al., Rhode Island Civil Procedure § 80:1 at 639 (West 2015) (“The [APA] does not apply to review of administrative action by municipal agencies. An aggrieved party pursuant to * * * § 45-24-69 6', 'General Laws 1956 § 42-92-7 provides that “[t]his chapter is intended to supplement the provisions of chapter 35 of this title. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this chapter and those of chapter 35 of this title, the provisions of chapter 35 of this title shall control.” 7', 'General Laws 1956 § 42-35-16 provides, in pertinent part, that:', '“Any party in interest, if aggrieved by a final judgment of the superior, family, or', 'district court rendered in proceedings brought under § 42-35-15, may, within', 'twenty (20) days from the date of entry of the judgment, petition the supreme', 'court of the state of Rhode Island for a writ of certiorari to review any questions', 'of law involved.”', '-4- may appeal a decision of a Zoning Board of Review to the Superior Court sitting in the county in which the city or town is situated. Where municipal agency action is by statute reviewable in the Superior Court, again the [APA] does not apply.”). This observation, however, does not end our analysis.', 'Although we reject the board’s primary argument that the APA controls appellate review in this case, we nonetheless agree, for the reasons explained below, that plaintiffs were required to seek review by petition for a writ of certiorari. Nonetheless, because we have not heretofore addressed this precise procedural issue in a case such as this, we shall treat this appeal as the equivalent of a petition for a writ of certiorari.', 'Because this case began in Superior Court as an appeal from the decision of a zoning board in accordance with § 45-24-69, it was only after plaintiffs prevailed in their zoning appeal in Superior Court that a motion for an award of reasonable litigation expenses under the act could be brought and decided. After the motion was denied, the final judgment entered, from which an appeal to this Court was taken. The final judgment encompassed both the decision on the merits of the zoning appeal and the denial of plaintiffs’ motion for reasonable litigation expenses. Under these circumstances, we are of the opinion that the case before us involves review of “a judgment of the Superior Court on appeal from a decision of a zoning board.” Lupo v. Community Works Rhode Island, Inc., 57 A.3d 667, 667 (R.I. 2012) (mem.) (quoting Northern Trust Co. v. Zoning Board of Review of Westerly, 899 A.2d 517, 519 (R.I. 2006) (mem.)). It is well settled that the proper procedure for obtaining review of such a judgment is to petition this Court for a writ of certiorari.', 'See id.; Bassi v. Zoning Board of Review of Providence, 107 R.I. 702, 706, 271 A.2d 210, 213 (1970).', '-5-', 'The plaintiffs dispute this conclusion and point to provisions of the act that they suggest support their contention that an appeal is proper. They first emphasize that their appeal to this Court is not from the decision of the Superior Court reversing the board’s denial of their variance application but is from only the denial of their motion for reasonable litigation expenses. The plaintiffs also claim that the act contains a provision that explicitly authorizes an appeal to this Court from a Superior Court ruling on a request for reasonable litigation expenses. Finally, plaintiffs note that this Court recently entertained an appeal from the denial of relief under the act in Campbell v. Tiverton Zoning Board, 15 A.3d 1015 (R.I. 2011).8', 'With respect to the act, plaintiffs argue that an appeal to this Court is authorized by § 42- 92-5 of the act, which provides, in pertinent part, that “[a]ny party dissatisfied with the fee determination by the adjudicatory officer may appeal to the court having jurisdiction to review the merits of the underlying decision of the agency adversary adjudication.”9 (Emphasis added.) Clearly, § 42-92-5 references an appeal from a determination by the “adjudicatory officer,” and not a justice of the Superior Court. In an effort to show that the adjudicatory officer and the trial justice are one and the same in this case, plaintiffs propose a creative interpretation. First, plaintiffs point out that § 42-92-3(a) sets forth the circumstances under which an “adjudicative 8', 'We reject plaintiffs’ reliance on Campbell v. Tiverton Zoning Board, 15 A.3d 1015 (R.I. 2011), out of hand.

Wall, 831 A.2d 817, 820 (R.I. 2003). 9', 'In its entirety, § 42-92-5 provides that:', '“Any party dissatisfied with the fee determination by the adjudicatory officer may', 'appeal to the court having jurisdiction to review the merits of the underlying', 'decision of the agency adversary adjudication.

Bowen Court Condominium, 44 A.3d 736, 740 (R.I. 2012))). It is clear that §§ 42-92-3(b) and 42-92-5 of the act set forth separate and independent avenues for judicial review of agency decisions where reasonable litigation expenses are at stake. On the one hand, § 42-92-3(b) authorizes a court “review[ing] the underlying decision of the adversary adjudication” to award reasonable litigation expenses under the act. This route is available in cases where, as here, the litigant was unsuccessful before the agency and immediately obtained judicial review of the agency decision, was successful, and then sought reasonable litigation expenses under the act. See, e.g., Taft v. Pare, 536 A.2d 888, 889 (R.I. 1988) (after denial of hearing at agency level regarding license-suspension notice, litigant successfully appealed to District Court and then requested reasonable litigation expenses under the act); see also Krikorian v. Rhode Island Department of Human Services, 606 A.2d 671, 672-73 (R.I. 1992) (after denials of benefits were unsuccessfully challenged at agency level, litigants appealed to Superior Court under the APA and, after prevailing in Superior Court, sought reasonable litigation expenses under the act). In these circumstances, because of the denial of relief at the agency level, the request for reasonable litigation expenses under the act generally is made for the first time to the court authorized to review the underlying agency decision.12', 'On the other hand, § 42-92-5 provides that “[a]ny party dissatisfied with the fee determination by the adjudicatory officer may appeal to the court having jurisdiction to review the merits of the underlying decision of the agency adversary adjudication.” This avenue for judicial review would be available to one who prevails at the agency level in cases where the 12', 'We note that judicial review of a zoning board’s denial of a variance application without the requirement of further agency review before an appeal to the Superior Court is not unique in administrative law in Rhode Island.

In these circumstances, the request for reasonable litigation expenses under the act has already been made to an adjudicative officer who passes on the underlying agency decision. In this situation, the agency has an administrative hearing officer or an internal-review procedure in place. See, e.g., Newport Yacht Management, Inc. v. Clark, 567 A.2d 364, 365-66 (R.I. 1989) (after taxpayer’s challenge to tax assessment was somewhat successful at agency level but hearing officer denied taxpayer’s request for reasonable litigation expenses, taxpayer appealed fee determination to District Court).', 'The plaintiffs’ argument that § 42-92-5 authorizes an appeal to this Court when a trial justice rules, under § 42-92-3(b), on a request for reasonable litigation expenses under the act because the trial justice “steps into the shoes, or takes the place of, the ‘adjudicative officer’ in awarding litigation expenses” fails to appreciate the dichotomy envisioned by the act. Because this case falls under § 42-92-3(b), the provisions of § 42-92-5 are inapplicable.', 'Additionally, a trial justice acting under § 42-92-3(b) is not an adjudicatory officer for purposes of § 42-92-5 because the act’s definition of adjudicative officer—“the deciding official, without regard to whether the official is designated as an administrative law judge, a hearing officer or examiner, or otherwise, who presided at the adversary adjudication,” § 42-92-2(1)— does not include a trial justice reviewing the underlying agency decision. A trial justice does not “preside[] at the adversary adjudication,” id., because the adversary adjudication occurs at the agency level. Cf. Campbell, 15 A.3d at 1025 (explaining, in the course of holding that a declaratory-judgment action in Superior Court cannot qualify as an “adjudicatory proceeding” under the act, that “[t]he act clearly provides that the contemplated ‘adjudicatory proceeding’ is', '-9- one that occurs at the agency level either administratively or quasi-judicially, not an adjudicatory proceeding in Superior Court”). Moreover, an appeal to this Court from a trial justice’s decision under § 42-92-3(b) is plainly not authorized by § 42-92-5 because, in such a scenario, this Court is not “the court having jurisdiction to review the merits of the underlying decision of the agency adversary adjudication,” § 42-92-5; rather, in that circumstance, the Superior Court would be the court with jurisdiction to review the agency decision, see § 42-92-3(b), and that review is statutorily prescribed, see, e.g., § 42-35-15 (providing for Superior Court judicial review of decisions of agencies within the APA); § 45-24-69 (providing for Superior Court judicial review of decisions of municipal zoning boards).', 'The plaintiffs’ argument that an appeal is proper because they are not appealing the Superior Court’s reversal of the board’s decision, but only the denial of the motion for reasonable litigation expenses under the act, similarly is meritless because any appeal from the grant or denial of a request for reasonable litigation expenses is necessarily intertwined with the agency decision. The act explicitly tethers an award of reasonable litigation expenses to success in challenging the agency’s position, either at the agency level or before a reviewing court. See § 42-92-3(a) (authorizing an award of reasonable litigation expenses to a prevailing party in agency adjudicatory proceedings where the agency was not “substantially justified in actions leading to the proceedings and in the proceeding itself”). Likewise, the reference to courts set forth in §§ 42-92-3(b) and 42-92-5 speak to judicial review of the underlying agency decision (§ 42-92-3(b)) or the fee determination of the adjudicative officer (§ 42-92-5). There is no indication that the act creates a cause of action independent of the proceedings before the agency and the judicial review thereof. Cf. Thomas v. Paulson, 507 F. Supp. 2d 59, 62 n.2 (D.D.C. 2007) (“[T]he [Federal Equal Access to Justice Act] does not provide an independent', '- 10 - cause of action for litigants in federal court; instead, it simply ‘authorizes the payment of fees to [a] prevailing party in an action against the United States.’” (quoting Scarborough v. Principi, 541 U.S. 401, 405 (2004))).13', 'Our decision in Campbell, 15 A.3d at 1025, supports the conclusion that a request for reasonable litigation expenses cannot be divorced from the underlying agency action. In that case, in the course of affirming a trial justice’s denial of a motion for relief under the act in a declaratory-judgment action, we explained that, “[a]lthough the act provides that a court reviewing the ‘underlying decision of the adversary adjudication’ may make ‘an award for fees and other expenses,’ here, the Superior Court was not reviewing such a decision and correctly declined to grant the [plaintiffs] relief under the act.” Id. (quoting § 42-92-3(b)).', 'Indeed, this case readily demonstrates why any attempt to separate a request for reasonable litigation expenses under the act from review of the underlying agency decision is wholly artificial. This case was initiated in Superior Court as an appeal from an agency decision when plaintiffs appealed the board’s decision pursuant to § 45-24-69. As plaintiffs acknowledged at oral argument, they were not even entitled to seek reasonable litigation expenses under the act until they received a favorable decision from the Superior Court in the appeal from the board’s decision.', 'Additionally, the final judgment encompasses both the Superior Court’s reversal of the board’s decision and the denial of relief under the act. Because plaintiffs’ appeal to this Court seeks review of a judgment of the Superior Court on appeal from 13', 'The act “is modeled on the Federal Equal Access to Justice Act.” Krikorian v.

However, because we have never before parsed this statutory scheme with two separate avenues for review of decisions relating to the act, we shall treat plaintiffs’ notice of appeal as the equivalent of a petition for a writ of certiorari and turn to the merits of the case. See, e.g., Kirby v. Planning Board of Middletown, 634 A.2d 285, 289 (R.I. 1993); Schiavulli v. School Committee of North Providence, 114 R.I. 443, 445-46, 334 A.2d 416, 417 (1975); Simmons v.

Zoning Board of Review of Westerly, 899 A.2d 517, 518-19 (R.I. 2006) (mem.). In that case, the remonstrants before the zoning board appealed from the board’s rejection of their challenge to the construction of a motel in Westerly to Superior Court under G.L. 1956 § 45-24- 69. Northern Trust Co., 899 A.2d at 518. The plaintiffs then amended their complaint to add a count for a declaratory judgment on the validity of a subdivision created in Westerly in 1981. Id. at 519. Following the Superior Court’s dismissal of their claim as moot, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal in this Court. Id. We parsed the plaintiffs’ appeal, concluding that “the purported appeal from the zoning aspects of the Superior Court’s decision * * * [was] not properly before us” because a petition for a writ of certiorari was required, but that, “[i]n view of the fact that the second amended complaint contained * * * a declaratory[-]judgment count, that aspect of [the] plaintiffs’ appeal from the Superior Court’s decision * * * would appear to be properly before us.” Id. However, “declaratory orders and judgments are reviewable on appeal as are any other judgments.” Gomes, 831 A.2d at 820; see also § 9-30-7. In this case, by contrast, we cannot separate the zoning aspects of the zoning appeal to the Superior Court from plaintiffs’ request for reasonable litigation expenses under the act that was made as a result of their success in that appeal, and the mere fact that plaintiffs amended their complaint to add allegations reflecting their request for relief under the act does nothing to change this conclusion.', '- 12 - reasonable litigation expenses under § 42-92-3(b)—a petition for a writ of certiorari is a prerequisite for review in this Court.', 'The Merits', 'On the merits, plaintiffs argue that, in denying their request for reasonable litigation expenses, the trial justice misinterpreted the act. Questions of statutory interpretation precipitate de novo review in this Court.

The act is designed to address government abuse and agency decisions made without substantial justification; to that end, the act “encourage[s] individuals and small businesses to contest unjust actions by the state and/or municipal agencies,” § 42-92-1(b), by allowing an award of reasonable litigation expenses from state or municipal agencies in appropriate circumstances.', 'The act provides that a prevailing “[p]arty” (§ 42-92-2(5)) may be awarded “[r]easonable litigation expenses” (§ 42-92-2(6)) where the “[a]gency” (§ 42-92-2(3)) was without “[s]ubstantial justification” (§ 42-92-2(7)) in actions that led to an “[a]djudicatory proceeding[]” (§ 42-92-2(2)) or taken in the proceeding itself. See § 42-92-3. In this case, the trial justice denied relief under the act on the grounds that the board is not an agency and that the hearing on the variance application was not an adjudicatory proceeding under the act. We disagree on both points.', '- 14 -', 'First, we are of the opinion that a municipal zoning board is an agency under the act. We note that, initially, the act applied only to state agencies. See P.L. 1985, ch. 215, § 1. In 1994, the General Assembly “expand[ed] the [act] to include actions against municipalities and municipal agencies or departments.” Explanation by the Legislative Council of An Act Relating to the Equal Access to Justice Act for Small Businesses and Individuals, 94-H 8724 (Feb. 16, 1994), subsequently enacted as P.L. 1994, ch. 201; see P.L. 1994, ch. 376, § 1; P.L. 1994, ch. 201, § 1. To that end, the definition of agency was amended to encompass municipal entities. See P.L. 1994, ch. 376, § 1; P.L. 1994, ch. 201, § 1. In its current iteration, the act defines the term “agency” as', '“any state and/or municipal board, commission, council, department, or officer,', 'other than the legislature or the courts, authorized by law [1] to make rules or to', 'determine contested cases, [2] to bring any action at law or in equity, including,', 'but not limited to, injunctive and other relief, or [3] to initiate criminal', 'proceedings. This shall include contract boards of appeal, tax proceedings, and', 'employment security administrative proceedings.” Section 42-92-2(3).', 'Before this Court, the board argues that it is not an agency under the act because plaintiffs’ variance application was not a contested case, the board is not authorized to bring civil actions or initiate criminal proceedings, and it has no power to seek review of a decision of the Superior Court in a zoning appeal reversing a decision of the board. These contentions are unavailing. The board’s insistence that this hearing was not a contested case overlooks that the act requires only that the entity be “authorized by law * * * to determine contested cases,” § 42- 92-2(3), not that it do so in a particular case or in every case. Unquestionably, zoning boards are authorized by law to make rules and determine contested cases. See § 45-24-56(a) (“The [zoning] board [of review] shall establish written rules of procedure * * *.”); § 45-24-57(1) (setting forth types of cases zoning boards may hear); see, e.g., Hillside Associates v. Stravato, 642 A.2d 664, 669-70 (R.I. 1994) (involving a contested case before a zoning board). Therefore,', '- 15 - a zoning board qualifies as an agency under the act. This is so even though, as the board points out, zoning boards lack some of the other powers enumerated in the act’s definition of agency. That definition is phrased in the disjunctive, such that the authorization by law to exercise any one of three enumerated categories of authority—(1) “to make rules or to determine contested cases,” (2) “to bring any action at law or in equity, including, but not limited to, injunctive and other relief, or” (3) “to initiate criminal proceedings,” § 42-92-2(3) (emphasis added)— suffices.15', 'Second, we conclude that the hearing before the board on plaintiffs’ variance application qualified as an adjudicatory proceeding under the act. Section 42-92-2(2) defines, in pertinent part, the term “adjudicatory proceeding” as', '“any proceeding conducted by or on behalf of the state administratively or quasi-', 'judicially which may result in the loss of benefits, the imposition of a fine, the', 'adjustment of a tax assessment, the denial, suspension, or revocation of a license', 'or permit, or which may result in the compulsion or restriction of the activities of', 'a party.” (Emphases added.) In this case, there is no dispute that the hearing on the variance application, unlike the action of the building official in Campbell, which we held did not constitute an adjudicatory proceeding, involved “notice and an opportunity to be heard.” Campbell, 15 A.3d at 1025 (quoting Black’s Law Dictionary 725 (7th ed. 1999)). The board and plaintiffs were represented by counsel at the hearing, which was transcribed. Both Henry Tarbox and plaintiffs’ attorney were questioned by 15', 'During the hearing in Superior Court on plaintiffs’ motion for relief under the act, the trial justice expressed his belief that a zoning board could not be an agency under the act because of uncertainty over who the adjudicative officer of a zoning board would be. In our opinion, concluding that an entity that meets the act’s definition of agency nonetheless is not an agency merely because of difficulty in identifying the adjudicative officer of that putative agency is erroneous. Indeed, in cases where, as here, the request for reasonable litigation expenses is not made until after a party obtains favorable judicial review of the underlying agency decision, the adjudicative officer plays no role. See § 42-92-3(b).', '- 16 - board members and notice was given to abutters, who could have, but did not, object. Therefore, the hearing unquestionably was a quasi-judicial proceeding before an agency.', 'The question still remains whether the proceeding in this case was an adjudicatory proceeding under the act. The plaintiffs contend that the denial of their variance application “result[ed] in the * * * restriction of the activities of a party” under § 42-92-2(2). However, the restriction of plaintiffs’ activities—the inability to build a duplex on an undersized parcel— stemmed not from the denial of the variance application but from the ordinance itself, which prohibited the construction of a duplex on a lot the size of plaintiffs’ parcel, and which therefore necessitated an application for dimensional relief. Nonetheless, we are of the opinion that the denial of a dimensional variance is akin to “the denial * * * of a license or permit.” Section 42- 92-2(2). Section 45-24-31(65) defines the term “[v]ariance” as “[p]ermission to depart from the literal requirements of a zoning ordinance.” See also § 45-24-31(65)(ii) (defining “[d]imensional [v]ariance” as “[p]ermission to depart from the dimensional requirements of a zoning ordinance”).', 'Similarly, our late colleague, Justice Thomas Paolino, one of the foremost authorities on Rhode Island zoning law, explained that “a variance is a permit to the landowner to use his property in a manner forbidden by the zoning ordinance.” Thomas J. Paolino, Zoning: Its Growth & Development in Rhode Island 100 (1970); see id. at 90 (“A permit for a variance is directly related to zoning in that it permits a non-conforming use in special circumstances to prevent hardship.”). Like a request for a permit or license, an application for a variance— whether a use variance or a dimensional variance—seeks permission to do something that would otherwise not be permissible. See Kent v. Zoning Board of Review of Barrington, 74 R.I. 89, 91, 58 A.2d 623, 624 (1948) (“An application for a variance in a specific case presupposes that the applicant, under the literal requirements of the ordinance, has no right to use his land in the', '- 17 - manner he desires, and thus invokes the authority of the board to permit that use.”); Black’s Law Dictionary 1322 (10th ed. 2014) (defining “permit” as “[a] certificate evidencing permission; an official written statement that someone has the right to do something”); see also id. at 1059 (defining “license” as “[a] privilege granted by a state or city upon the payment of a fee, the recipient of the privilege then being authorized to do some act or series of acts that would otherwise be impermissible”). Therefore, we hold that the denial of an application for a variance is, for purposes of the act, analogous to the denial of a license or permit.16 Accordingly, under the circumstances of this case, the hearing on the variance application qualifies as an adjudicatory proceeding under the act.17', 'For these reasons, we declare both that the board is an agency and that the hearing on the plaintiffs’ variance application was an adjudicatory proceeding under the act. However, this holding, standing alone, does not entitle the plaintiffs to an award of reasonable litigation expenses. The trial justice did not address the other prerequisites for relief, including whether the plaintiffs are qualifying parties under the act and whether the board’s position was without 16', 'In reaching this conclusion, we by no means imply an overlap between a variance and a special-use permit, which “are designed to meet two entirely different needs.” Roland F. Chase, Rhode Island Zoning Handbook § 149 at 213 (2d ed. 2006). 17', 'The board argues that the hearing on plaintiffs’ variance application was not an “adversary adjudication”—an undefined term used in a few places in the act but not in the definition of adjudicatory proceeding—because it was not a hearing involving a dispute between opposing parties. We note that other cases under the act in which reasonable litigation expenses were awarded did not involve disputes between opposing parties but involved only a dispute, similar to the one in this case, between the party and the agency that rendered the adverse decision. See, e.g., McHugh v. Harrington, 655 A.2d 690, 690 (R.I. 1995) (mem.); Krikorian, 606 A.2d at 672- 73; Newport Yacht Management, Inc. v. Clark, 567 A.2d 364, 365-66 (R.I. 1989); Taft v.

53,State : v. : Curtis M. Isom. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court.', 'This case came before the Supreme Court on December 1, 2015, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. The defendant, Curtis M. Isom (Isom or defendant), appeals from a judgment of conviction after a jury trial of one count of breaking and entering. Before this Court, the defendant argues that the trial justice erred in: (1) denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal; (2) limiting the scope of his cross-examination of the state’s fingerprint expert; and (3) denying his motion for a new trial. Having carefully considered the memoranda submitted by the parties and the arguments of counsel, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown, and the appeal may be decided at this time. We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'Antoinette Bryant (Bryant) initially did not notice that anything was amiss in her home. When she returned from work on the afternoon of March 28, 2011, the front door of her family’s two-story condominium in Johnston, Rhode Island was unlocked, but Bryant assumed that her', '-1- daughter Essence had been careless when leaving their home that morning.1 The house looked as Bryant had left it; save for the unlocked door, nothing seemed out of place. It was not until Bryant’s son Jarell returned home from school and noticed that his Nintendo Wii gaming console was missing that Bryant realized that something was wrong. Upon further inspection, Bryant discovered that the dresser drawers in her second-floor bedroom were open; her jewelry boxes and a teapot in which she stashed coins were empty; a diamond necklace and other jewelry were missing from her bedroom closet; and a computer and digital coin bank were nowhere to be found. Essence, now home from school, noticed that her brother Oginga’s bedroom door was ajar, even though the door usually remained closed when he was away at college. Looking inside Oginga’s bedroom, located at the ground level, Essence found the window open and the bed pushed out from its usual spot against the window. Bryant called 9-1-1 and reported a break-in.', 'Several officers from the Johnston police department responded to the dispatch. Detective Raymond Peters (Det. Peters) of the department’s forensic unit took photographs and dusted the scene for fingerprints. The detective recovered fingerprint evidence from the window in Oginga’s bedroom, Bryant’s jewelry box, the door handle to her bedroom closet, and from other areas throughout the home. For the purpose of determining which fingerprints belonged to persons rightfully on the premises—and to eliminate them from the investigation—Det. Peters also obtained fingerprints from Bryant and her daughter Imani. Photographs of fingerprint evidence were sent to the State of Rhode Island Crime Laboratory at the University of Rhode 1', 'For the purpose of clarity, we refer to Bryant’s children by their first names. We intend no disrespect.', '-2- Island (crime lab) where they were analyzed by Edward Downing, Jr. (Downing), a fingerprint expert and fifteen-year veteran of the crime lab.', 'Downing determined that four of the twenty images were clear enough to warrant greater attention. After concluding that certain fingerprints extracted from Oginga’s bedroom window came from an unknown source, he searched a database known as the Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) to identify a potential match. From the three and a half million fingerprints contained in the database, Downing’s search returned the name “Curtis M. Isom,” born on January 4, 1959, as the closest potential match.2 Downing then manually compared the left index fingerprint exemplar displayed on a fingerprint card attributed to “Curtis M. Isom” side-by-side with the photograph of the fingerprint from the window.', 'By way of expert testimony, Downing opined that the exemplar and the latent fingerprint from the window originated from a common source. He also concluded that another latent fingerprint—a left thumbprint—extracted from Bryant’s jewelry box matched another exemplar on the AFIS- generated fingerprint card ascribed to “Curtis M. Isom.”3 2', 'In addition to listing “Curtis M. Isom” as the number-one possible match, AFIS also returned forty-nine other exemplars from fingerprint cards, taken from other individuals, as possible matches. 3', 'Detective Peters testified at trial that he did not record which of the four fingerprints were recovered from which item. But based on his recollection, Det. Peters testified that the photograph he marked as “35”—which contained an image of a fingerprint that Downing identified as a likely match to defendant’s left thumbprint—came from the jewelry box. He further recalled that the image labeled “52” was a photograph of the fingerprint he found on the window, and Downing testified that that fingerprint was consistent with defendant’s left index fingerprint. As for the remaining two fingerprints prompting further inspection by Downing, Det. Peters testified at trial that they came from the door handle to Bryant’s bedroom closet and the television in the living room. Downing determined that one fingerprint belonged to Imani and the other originated from an unknown source. Neither he nor Det. Peters indicated at trial which fingerprint came from which item.', '-3-', 'Johnston police detectives shared the results with Bryant and asked her if she knew a “Curtis Isom.” Indeed, she did. A man with that name—defendant—is the father of Bryant’s nephew, Marcus. The defendant also has the same date of birth as that listed on the fingerprint card: January 4, 1959.4 Four months earlier, in December 2010, defendant and Marcus had visited Bryant’s home. Although defendant had visited Bryant and her family in their previous apartment, it was the first time he had been to this particular residence. The visit lasted no more than fifteen minutes, during which defendant remained in the foyer and in the living room. To Bryant’s knowledge, defendant had not returned since.', 'The defendant subsequently was charged with breaking and entering in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-8-2. Trial was held in the Providence County Superior Court on January 13 and 15, 2014. The state presented several witnesses, including Oginga, Bryant, Det. Peters, and Downing. Because Downing was the state’s key witness and because defendant argues on appeal that the trial justice erred by restricting the scope of his cross-examination of Downing, we recount his testimony in some detail.', 'During the state’s direct examination of Downing, the fingerprint expert explained the methodology he employed when comparing known and latent prints.5 Downing testified that his practice is to inspect the fingerprints initially for “basically similar shapes[ and] the general flow of [the] lines,” and then focus on “the more minute details,” such as “ending ridges, bifurcations, or small dots.” He explained that ending ridges are noncontinuous lines within a fingerprint that break or end abruptly. Downing further described bifurcation on cross-examination as “one 4', 'The defendant’s birthdate was not in dispute at trial. 5', 'A latent fingerprint is a fingerprint found at the crime scene. See, e.g., State v. Crawford, 441 So. 2d 813, 816 n.3 (La. Ct. App. 1983).', '-4- ridge that’s running for a short time [and] then splits into two separate lines or two separate ridges.”', 'On cross-examination, defense counsel asked the fingerprint expert several questions about the general reliability of fingerprint identification and the procedures he employed in making his identification.', 'Counsel then directed Downing’s attention to an image of the fingerprint found on the jewelry box—specifically, a copy of the photograph on which Downing had based his identification. Downing testified that a mark within that fingerprint “appears to be a bifurcation or an ending ridge. You can’t always tell which is which.” The following exchange ensued:', '“Q', '* * * [I]s it possible that in one [fingerprint] impression, * * * what', 'appears as a bifurcation or ridge ending may actually be something', 'else in an inked print?', '“A', 'Yes, sir.', '“Q', '* * * [A]nd it’s important when you’re looking at a latent or partial', 'print to know whether you are looking at a bifurcation or ridge', 'ending, correct?', '“A', 'It would be of assistance, yes.', '“* * *', '“Q', 'But if you * * * can’t tell whether a characteristic is a ridge ending', 'or a bifurcation in the latent, there is a chance of making a mistake,', 'right?” The court sustained the state’s objection to the question. Defense counsel then asked: “Is it possible you could make a mistake because you can’t tell whether or not something is a ridge ending or a bifurcation?” After the court again sustained the state’s objection, defense counsel pursued a new line of questioning. At another point during cross-examination, the defense sought to ask Downing about the impact of a recent high-profile investigation conducted by the', '-5- Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on the field of fingerprint analysis. Sustaining the state’s objection, the trial justice disallowed the question.', 'Also on cross-examination, Downing acknowledged that his analysis was limited to comparing the AFIS card attributed to “Curtis M. Isom” with the photograph of the latent fingerprint found in the Bryant home. He had not been provided with fingerprints obtained from defendant after his arrest.', 'The state also presented former Det. Mary Ann Pimental (Det. Pimental) of the Johnston police department, who testified that she had arraigned a man named Curtis Isom in the District Court on July 13, 2011, for the crime on trial and that his birthdate was January 4, 1959.6 Detective Pimental indicated that she had ordered that personnel from the Bureau of Criminal Identification take defendant’s fingerprints after the arraignment, but she had no personal knowledge as to whether this task was completed.', 'At trial, the state did not introduce fingerprints taken from defendant after his arrest in July 2011, nor did any witness with personal knowledge testify that the fingerprints attributed to “Curtis M. Isom” belonged to defendant.7', 'After the state rested, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal, which the trial justice denied. The defendant did not present a case. The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and the trial justice subsequently denied defendant’s motion for a new trial. The defendant was sentenced to fifteen years at the Adult Correctional Institutions, with five years to serve and ten years suspended, with probation.', 'Based on the conviction in this case, the defendant also was adjudged to be a habitual offender in accordance with G.L. 1956 § 12-19-21. Consequently, the 6', 'When asked if that “Curtis Isom” was in the courtroom, Det. Pimental testified that “[t]here is a gentleman in the courtroom that is familiar to me * * *. Yes. He is sitting there at the defense table with a turtleneck on.” 7', 'Evidence of defendant’s middle initial was not offered at trial, and the jury verdict form identified him as “Curtis Isom.”', '-6- trial justice sentenced defendant to fifteen years, with five nonparolable years to serve and ten years suspended with probation, to be served consecutively to the sentence for the breaking-and- entering conviction. This timely appeal followed.', 'Discussion', 'I. Denial of Motion for a Judgment of Acquittal', ""On appeal, defendant first claims that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal. Our review of the denial of a motion for a judgment of acquittal is governed by the same standard applied by the trial justice. State v. Rodriguez, 996 A.2d 145, 148 (R.I. 2010). Accordingly, this Court “must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, * * * giving full credibility to the state's witnesses, and draw therefrom all reasonable inferences consistent with guilt.” Id. (quoting State v. Ros, 973 A.2d 1148, 1159 (R.I. 2009)). The defendant may prevail on a motion for a judgment of acquittal “only if the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, is insufficient to establish the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” State v. Armour, 110 A.3d 1195, 1203 (R.I. 2015) (quoting State v. Long, 61 A.3d 439, 445 (R.I. 2013)). The case against the defendant will survive, however, upon the determination that “a reasonable juror could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.”"", 'Id. (quoting Long, 61 A.3d at 445).', 'As we previously have held, “circumstantial evidence, including fingerprint evidence, may be sufficient to support a conviction * * * ‘as long as the totality of the circumstantial evidence presented to the finder of fact constitutes proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.’” State v. Rodriguez, 798 A.2d 435, 437 (R.I. 2002) (quoting State v. Otero, 788 A.2d 469, 473 (R.I. 2002)).', 'The gravamen of defendant’s appeal from the denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal is his contention that the state failed to establish “that the AFIS-generated exemplars to', '-7- which the [latent fingerprints] were matched[] actually belonged to * * * Isom” and that the absence of such evidence amounts to a “gap in proof.” In support of this claim, defendant points to cross-examination testimony from Downing, the fingerprint expert, that he lacked personal knowledge of whether the fingerprints on the fingerprint card returned from AFIS were in fact defendant’s fingerprints. The defendant further cites the acknowledgment by Downing that neither he nor the police had obtained fingerprints from defendant during the course of the investigation.', 'These arguments do not help defendant, however, because they relate to the weight of the evidence and not its legal sufficiency.', 'In Sansom v. State, 562 N.E.2d 58 (Ind. Ct. App. 1990), a similar issue arose when the defendant in that case argued that there was insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction of burglary because the police had matched latent fingerprints recovered from the crime scene only to a fingerprint card on file that was attributed to a man with the same name and birthdate as the defendant. Id. at 59, 60. The prosecution did not present direct evidence that the fingerprints on the card had belonged to the defendant. Id. at 59. Other information contained on the card, including hair and eye color, height, place of birth, and distinctive marks, also closely matched the defendant. Id. The court concluded that, based on the similarities, the jury could reasonably infer that the exemplars on the fingerprint card belonged to the defendant. Id. at 60.', 'In this case, there was evidence that latent fingerprints found both on the window—the suspected point of entry—and the jewelry box from which items were missing matched an exemplar attributed to one “Curtis M. Isom” with a birthdate of January 4, 1959. The defendant in this case was named Curtis Isom, and the state introduced evidence that he had the same date of birth. Further, unlike in Sansom, there was testimony that defendant was known to Bryant and her family and that he previously had been in the home, but not in the area where the latent', '-8- fingerprints were found.', 'From the facts that defendant, Curtis Isom, was known to the complainant in this case, had been in the home on a previous occasion, and had the same date of birth as the “Curtis M. Isom” whose fingerprints matched those recovered at the scene, a reasonable jury could conclude that defendant was the perpetrator of the crime on trial.', 'Although the investigation by the Johnston police department could have been more comprehensive—including the establishment of a link between defendant’s fingerprints and the latent fingerprints—we cannot conclude that the evidence was legally insufficient to give rise to a judgment of acquittal. Viewing the evidence—the identical date of birth and defendant’s connection to the home—in the light most favorable to the state, we are satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to connect the exemplars from the fingerprint card to defendant.', 'II. Cross-Examination of Fingerprint Expert', 'The defendant also argues on appeal that the court deprived him of his right to a full and fair cross-examination of Downing. The right of a criminal defendant to be confronted by witnesses against him is ingrained both within the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution8 and the Declaration of Rights, article 1, section 10 of the Rhode Island Constitution.', '“Embodied in this guarantee is a defendant’s right to cross-examine the prosecution’s witnesses * * *.” State v. Parillo, 480 A.2d 1349, 1356 (R.I. 1984) (quoting State v. Freeman, 473 A.2d 1149, 1153 (R.I. 1984)). However, “the right to cross-examination is not unlimited and does not include an absolute right to ask any and every question that the defendant may desire.” State v. Werner, 831 A.2d 183, 209 (R.I. 2003). “Once there has been ‘sufficient cross-examination to satisfy a defendant’s constitutional confrontation rights,’” State v. Manning, 973 A.2d 524, 531 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. Brown, 709 A.2d 465, 473 (R.I. 8', 'See Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400, 403 (1965) (incorporating the Sixth Amendment to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment).', '-9- 1998)), the trial justice may, in the exercise of sound discretion, “limit cross-examination on the basis of concerns of witness harassment, jury prejudice, confusion of the issues, the witness’s safety, or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.” State v. Wiley, 676 A.2d 321, 324 (R.I. 1996); see also Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 679 (1986). This Court will not “disturb such a limitation absent a clear abuse of discretion ‘and then only when such abuse constitutes prejudicial error.’” Brown, 709 A.2d at 473 (quoting State v. Anthony, 422 A.2d 921, 924 (R.I. 1980)).', 'The defendant attacks the restriction of his cross-examination of Downing on two fronts. First, he argues that the trial justice erroneously prevented him from asking the fingerprint expert about possible inaccuracies that could arise from misidentifying ridge endings and bifurcations. Specifically, the court did not permit him to ask about the “chance of making a mistake” or whether it is possible “you could make a mistake.” The trial justice sustained the state’s question because it called for speculation, and it was within his sound discretion to do so. See, e.g., State v. Rivera, 987 A.2d 887, 906 (R.I. 2010) (finding no abuse of discretion when trial court limited question that called for speculation).', 'The defendant wages a second line of attack on the refusal of the trial justice to allow a question about the impact of a recent high-profile FBI investigation on procedures employed in the fingerprint-analysis field. Defense counsel had asked Downing, “Are you familiar with what is known as the Mayfield case?,” and the fingerprint expert answered affirmatively. The trial justice sustained the state’s objection to the next question: “And evaluating and guarding against', '- 10 - the errors that the FBI made in the Mayfield case * * * [h]as been a driving force in the fingerprint community for years, right?”9', 'According to defendant, because of Mayfield, there have been major reforms in the field of fingerprint analysis, to the extent that he should have been entitled to inquire whether Downing followed post-Mayfield procedures.', 'However, the impact of a particular FBI investigation on the entire field of fingerprint analysis was irrelevant to the prosecution in this case. Neither the errors made by the FBI nor the historical evolution of the fingerprint-analysis field had bearing on the methodology followed in this particular case or on Downing’s conclusion that the latent and known fingerprints originated from the same source. See, e.g., Werner, 831 A.2d at 209, 210 (affirming trial justice’s decision to preclude, on the grounds of relevance, the defendant’s questions on cross-examination regarding procedures employed by the police department when booking another individual).', 'We further reject defendant’s assertion that the preclusion of this line of questioning interfered with his attempts to impeach the state’s star witness. To the contrary, defendant was afforded substantial leeway to question Downing about the overall reliability of fingerprint evidence and the procedures he followed. The defendant elicited testimony from Downing on cross-examination that fingerprint analysis is not foolproof and that “[e]rrors have occurred in 9', 'The “Mayfield case” arose in 2004 when Spanish investigators recovered latent fingerprints from a bag containing explosive detonators, which was found near the site of a bombing in Madrid, Spain. Mayfield v. United States, 599 F.3d 964, 966 (9th Cir. 2010). A search of the FBI’s fingerprint database returned the fingerprints of Brandon Mayfield, an American Muslim attorney, and nineteen other individuals as possible matches. Id. Multiple fingerprint specialists concluded that a latent fingerprint matched an exemplar originating from Mayfield, which led FBI agents to assert in an affidavit that they had made a “100% positive identification.” Id. at 966, 967. However, the Spanish investigation revealed that the FBI had been incorrect; the fingerprints instead came from an Algerian national. Id. at 967.', '- 11 - the past.” Accordingly, the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in restricting defendant’s line of questioning.', 'III. Denial of Motion for a New Trial', 'The defendant’s final assignment of error is the denial of his motion for a new trial.10 In support of his argument on appeal, defendant points to the lack of direct evidence tying the exemplars found on the fingerprint card to him, purportedly inconsistent testimony between Bryant and Oginga, and the likelihood that a man of his age could climb through the basement window in the manner the perpetrator purportedly had. The defendant also attacks the quality of the latent fingerprints, the failure of the police to document the items from which they were obtained, and the overall reliability of fingerprint evidence.', 'When passing on a motion for a new trial based on the weight of the evidence, the trial justice “sits as the legendary thirteenth juror[,] and, in light of the charge to the jury, must exercise his or her independent judgment in weighing the evidence and assessing the credibility of the witnesses.” State v. Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 569 (R.I. 2009). The motion must be denied “[i]f the trial justice agrees with the jury’s verdict or finds that the evidence is such that reasonable minds could differ as to the outcome * * *.” Id. This Court will give “great weight” 10', 'We note that defense counsel twice unequivocally stated at the hearing on the motion for a new trial that he based the motion on a sufficiency-of-the-evidence argument. On appeal, defendant contends that his attorney was mistaken and should have stated that he was moving for a new trial based both on the weight of the evidence and its sufficiency. The defendant asserts that, notwithstanding his attorney’s error, he argued both legal sufficiency and weight in the court below, and that the trial justice addressed both in his decision. Because the trial justice indeed did discuss the weight of the evidence among his findings in denying the motion for a new trial and because the state had adequate opportunity to respond to the weight-of-the- evidence argument at the time it was presented below, we are satisfied that this issue was preserved for our review. Cf. State v. Burke, 522 A.2d 725, 731 (R.I. 1987) (noting that the reason for deeming issues unpreserved is to “serve judicial economy by encouraging resolution of issues at the trial level * * * [and to] promote[] fairer and more efficient trial proceedings by providing opposing counsel with an opportunity to respond appropriately to claims raised”).', '- 12 - to the ruling as long as the trial justice sufficiently explained his or her rationale for denying the motion. Id.', 'In ruling on the motion, the trial justice set forth his reasons for denying the new trial. He credited the testimony of Bryant, Oginga, Downing, and Det. Peters, and, unlike the defendant, found Bryant’s and Oginga’s testimony to be mutually corroborative.', 'After painstakingly recounting the evidence adduced at trial, the trial justice stated that the open window and position of the bed in Oginga’s bedroom led to the “inescapable conclusion” that the perpetrator had gained entry through that ground-floor window. The trial justice indicated that he was “satisfied” that the latent fingerprints on the jewelry box belonged to the defendant, and he concluded that the existence of such fingerprints “establish beyond a reasonable doubt that it was the defendant who was the individual who broke into her apartment on March 28, 2011.” We are of the opinion that the trial justice performed the requisite analysis and provided an adequate rationale for denying the defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'We discern no grounds for disturbing that decision.', 'Conclusion', 'Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of conviction of the Superior Court and return the papers to the Superior Court.', '- 13 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S', 'OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'State v.

54,"Richard Bisbano, Sr. : v. : Strine Printing Company, Inc. et al. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. This case is before the Court on appeal by the plaintiff, Richard Bisbano, Sr., from a decision of the Superior Court granting summary judgment in favor of his former employer, Strine Printing Company, and Menasha Packaging Company, LLC, the defendants, on the plaintiff’s complaint for unpaid commissions. The plaintiff contends that the hearing justice erred in granting summary judgment on res judicata grounds because a prior suit in Federal District Court was based on factually distinct circumstances and because the defendants had agreed to, or at least acquiesced in, the splitting of claims into a separate lawsuit. The parties further dispute whether the trial justice erred when he decided that the second suit was time-barred by the three-year statute of limitations contained in Rhode Island’s Payment of Wages Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 14 of title 28. This matter came before us on January 21, 2016, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised by this appeal should not summarily be decided. After considering counsels’ oral and written arguments, and after a thorough review of the record, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and', '-1- that this case should be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons given below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '1', 'Facts and Travel', 'This controversy arises out of an employment relationship between Richard Bisbano, Sr. and Strine Printing that took a short time to sour and a long time to resolve. Strine hired Bisbano in December 2006 as a sales representative.', 'Under the terms of the parties’ agreement, Bisbano’s wages were commission-based and depended on the printing jobs that Bisbano was able to secure on behalf of Strine. Bisbano alleges that he procured several printing jobs during his time as a Strine sales representative, but the primary business that he brought in was printing work for CVS Pharmacy, Inc.', 'Bisbano had had a relationship with CVS that spanned approximately twenty years, predating his association with Strine. Indeed, Bisbano believed that to be the principal reason that Strine hired him as a sales representative.', 'In June 2010, Strine terminated Bisbano’s employment after an internal investigation by CVS revealed that Bisbano had inappropriately provided money to a CVS employee with whom he dealt in the course of his employment. Because of this discovery, CVS informed Strine that it no longer wanted Bisbano to service its account. With the CVS relationship no longer in his book of business, Bisbano was, in Strine’s opinion, no longer able to generate sufficient business to justify his continued employment. Even after it separated Bisbano from its employment, however, Strine continued to cultivate its contractual relationship with CVS and it performed many more printing jobs for CVS related to the specific work that Bisbano had solicited on Strine’s behalf.', 'Bisbano filed an eight count complaint against Strine Printing and its president in the Superior Court in July 2010, claiming age discrimination, unjust enrichment, intentional', '-2- interference with prospective contractual relations, breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, intentional and negligent misrepresentations, and quantum meruit. The claims were predicated on factual allegations related to his wrongful termination by Strine. The lawsuit was soon removed to the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island.', 'During the pendency of that lawsuit, the parties, through counsel, regularly communicated about outstanding commissions that Bisbano asserted he had earned during the time he was employed by Strine. In essence, the correspondence revolved around the parties’ disagreement about the exact amount of commissions that Strine owed Bisbano. Counsel for Bisbano informed Strine that—in addition to $65,000 that Bisbano believed he was owed for outstanding work-related expenses and commissions—Bisbano sought a commission in connection with a “Flu Promotion” job for CVS that had not been completed at the time that Bisbano was terminated. Bisbano believed that a commission was owed to him on the complete printing job because he had landed the contract during his employment.', 'Strine’s attorney responded that Strine’s business practice was to pay commissions after the bill was paid by its customer and that it paid “commissions earned in excess of a salesman’s draw at the end of the month.” However, he continued, “Mr. Bisbano always requested his excess commission to be paid at the end of the year. Once Strine Printing is paid by its customers, they will send me a commission check for Mr. Bisbano along with an explanation of the amount.” Strine’s counsel specifically disagreed with the amount claimed, remarking that “[i]f we have a dispute as to the amount, we can cross that bridge when we get to it.”', 'In a letter dated November 15, 2010, Strine’s counsel informed Bisbano’s attorney that Strine had just received payment from its client, CVS, and that “Strine believe[d] that the total', '-3- amount due to Mr. Bisbano for jobs sold in 2010 concerning CVS [was] $38,275.” Strine noted some deductions that it believed were applicable in reaching the final amount including that it did not incorporate the so-called “flu” contract because Strine was not awarded that contract until after Bisbano had left its employment. Bisbano’s counsel responded in writing to Strine’s counsel, objecting to Strine’s stated limitations on the commission calculations.', 'The parties agreed that Strine would issue a check in the amount of $38,275 and that Bisbano’s acceptance of the check would “not bar his right to seek additional commissions.” Therefore, on April 15, 2011, counsel for Strine sent the following letter to Bisbano’s counsel:', '“As we discussed yesterday, [Bisbano] no longer desires to', 'have a written agreement in place regarding the commissions that', '[Strine] has been trying to pay him. Therefore, enclosed is Strine’s', 'check in the amount of $38,275 representing the amount of', 'commissions that Strine believes it owes to Bisbano. By accepting', 'this check, Bisbano is not waiving any right to claim that he is', 'entitled to additional commissions. By sending this check, Strine', 'is not waiving any defenses that it has to Bisbano’s claim for', 'additional commissions. Please contact me if you wish to discuss', 'this matter further.” The parties also communicated about settlement of Bisbano’s wrongful termination claims. On October 2, 2011, Bisbano’s attorney sent a letter discussing the possibility of further mediation and addressed concerns that Strine had regarding the viability of Bisbano’s contract claims. The letter also raised the issue of outstanding commissions, wherein Bisbano’s counsel wrote, “I have taken the position that, if a settlement is reached, this issue will be rolled into any settlement. * * * Barring a dialogue or offer or agreement to mediate, I fully expect that Mr. Bisbano will initiate formal legal action to pursue this claim.”', 'Strine’s counsel sent a responsive letter, relaying that his client had no interest in future mediation attempts and that they instead intended to file a motion for summary judgment in the Federal District Court.', 'Strine’s attorney also responded to counsel about the issue of', '-4- commissions, saying, “Strine Printing has factored your client’s commission claim into its settlement valuation for this case. If your client wishes to file another lawsuit, please be advised that I am authorized to accept service of process.”', 'In the lawsuit that was pending in Federal District Court, the Chief Judge of the District Court granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment on all counts. Several of Bisbano’s claims were predicated on the same operative facts—that Bisbano had a long-standing relationship with CVS, that he cultivated that relationship for the benefit of Strine, and that Strine made promises to Bisbano that he would remain employed so long as he continued to procure printing jobs for Strine from CVS.', 'Moreover, the Chief Judge identified several important factual matters that were undisputed by Bisbano. The most important undisputed facts were that in April 2010, CVS conducted an internal investigation into its printing department regarding a disclosure from Bisbano “that, while in another company’s employ several years earlier, he had contributed $10,300 to assist an employee in CVS’s printing department [to] pay for her lease of a luxury vehicle.” A vice president within CVS decided that she did “not feel comfortable with [Bisbano] as our account rep on the Strine account or any other account,” and requested that other employees in CVS’s printing department notify Strine to remove Bisbano from their account. Strine terminated Bisbano in June, “based on CVS’s instruction that Bisbano must be removed from the CVS account and the fact that Bisbano did not have other sufficient business accounts to support the continuation of his employment.”', 'Pursuant to the statement of undisputed facts submitted by the parties in the federal court action, the Chief Judge dismissed Bisbano’s claim of unjust enrichment because Bisbano was unable to prove that any of the efforts he made to enrich his business relationship with CVS', '-5- while he was employed at Strine were beyond the scope of his employment as a sales representative. She also found that he had not put forth any evidence “that his efforts were responsible for sales to CVS after the termination of his employment.” His claim of intentional interference with prospective contractual relations was dismissed because it was undisputed that CVS had unilaterally ended its relationship with Bisbano and that there was nothing to support Bisbano’s contention that Strine’s decision to terminate him had any effect on his relationship with CVS. Furthermore, the cessation of CVS’s relationship with Bisbano, the Chief Judge found, was of Bisbano’s own doing when he inappropriately contributed $10,300 to a CVS employee in the printing department.', 'The Federal District Court dismissed Bisbano’s two counts related to breach of contract because it found that Bisbano was an at-will employee with no employment contract, as evidenced by the acknowledgement signed by Bisbano when he began working for Strine, which clearly stated that he was an at-will employee and that only the president and vice president of finance and administration had the authority to change an at-will employee’s status. Furthermore, the judge found that there was no evidence that Strine’s president intended to change his at-will employment status. The judge was particularly unconvinced by Bisbano’s contention that Strine created an implied-in-fact contract through encouraging comments to Bisbano that it would do whatever it took to get business from CVS and that he would remain employed at Strine as long as it was doing printing jobs for CVS. She found that Strine merely expressed appreciation for Bisbano’s efforts and a desire to bring in as much business as possible, an attitude that both benefited Strine and increased Bisbano’s compensation as the sales representative. The judge found that because there was no evidence to support a finding that Strine intended to create a binding employment contract with Bisbano, his claims for breach of', '-6- contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing both failed as a matter of law.', 'Similarly, Bisbano’s claims of intentional and negligent misrepresentation, which were predicated on the same alleged promises of continued employment, were found to be unsupported by the undisputed evidence. The judge found that the communications from Strine were neither false nor “intended to induce Bisbano to do anything beyond performing his work as a sales representative.” The District Court dismissed Bisbano’s final claim for quantum meruit for failure to present the court with any argument with respect to that claim. 1', 'Then, in June 2014, Bisbano filed another lawsuit against Strine Printing and Menasha in Superior Court. 2 Bisbano’s first amended complaint included only two counts, one for breach of contract and the other for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The complaint alleged that Strine’s final payment to Bisbano in April 2011 did not fully compensate him for the “Flu Promotion” printing job that Bisbano had procured before his termination and that it improperly had deducted $19,277 from the commission payment pursuant to a rebate agreement that Strine entered into with CVS after Bisbano was terminated.', 'In due course, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. The defendants argued that plaintiff’s claims were barred by the principle of res judicata as well as the three-year statute of limitations provided in § 28-14-19.2 of the Payment of Wages Act. 3 The plaintiff objected to 1', 'Bisbano appealed the Chief Judge’s decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, which affirmed the Chief Judge’s decision on all grounds. See Bisbano v. Strine Printing Co., 737 F.3d 104 (1st Cir. 2013). 2', 'Bisbano filed an amended complaint in August 2014 to include Menasha Packaging Company, LLC as a defendant because he believed that Menasha had purchased Strine in March of that year and assumed all legal rights, liabilities and obligations of Strine. 3', 'The defendants’ motion for summary judgment and supporting memorandum are not in the lower court file or entered on the electronic docket. The arguments presented here in support of', '-7- defendants’ motion, arguing that there was no identity of issues because the federal action covered claims related to his improper termination, and this lawsuit was about a breach of a “commission compensation agreement.” The plaintiff also argued that, even if the elements of res judicata were present, an exception to the doctrine applied because plaintiff believed that he was justified in concluding that defendants had agreed to, or at least acquiesced to, splitting the claims for unpaid commissions from the claims raised in the federal litigation. To support his argument on such an agreement or acquiescence, plaintiff submitted the correspondence between counsel for each party.', 'The defendants vociferously disagreed, maintaining at the hearing that the judgment in the federal litigation put to rest any potential claims that plaintiff could bring against them and that there was no evidence of any agreement to separate or sever the claims. The defendants also argued that the correspondence between counsel was inadmissible under Rule 408 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence as settlement negotiations and that the court was precluded from relying on inadmissible evidence to deny a motion for summary judgment. The defendants further pressed an argument that any claim for the payment of commissions was controlled by the Payment of Wages Act, which provided for a three-year statute of limitations period.', 'However, it is noteworthy that plaintiff neither responded to defendants’ statute of limitations arguments in its written submissions to the trial justice, nor did he argue the issue when the motion was heard. When the trial justice asked Bisbano’s attorney whether he was “adopting the relation back position,” 4 plaintiff’s counsel responded, “Yes. The sole claim in this litigation that’s currently before you is a breach of contract claim that there was a breach of defendants’ motion were derived from plaintiff’s memorandum in support of his objection, defendants’ reply memorandum, plaintiff’s sur-reply memorandum, and the transcript. 4', 'The trial justice was making an obvious reference to the “relation back” provision of Rule 15(c) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.', '-8- the—.” The trial justice interrupted counsel and asked, “Wasn’t there a breach of contract claim in the federal litigation?”', 'The plaintiff conceded that the claim for unpaid commissions could have been brought in the previous lawsuit. However, he argued that the correspondence between the parties proved that defendants’ counsel agreed to split the claims when he said, “If your client wishes to file another lawsuit, please be advised that I am authorized to accept service of process.” The trial justice remarked that “[o]ne can characterize that as, I’ll see you in court.” The plaintiff then argued that the exception to res judicata should apply because “they didn’t object to adding the claim, and they certainly didn’t object to filing another lawsuit; in fact, they said they would accept service of another lawsuit.” With respect to Rule 408, plaintiff maintained that the rule did not prevent the court from considering the correspondence because it was not being offered to prove liability about the amount of the claim, but to show that the correspondence between the parties “established that there could be a splitting of the claims.”', 'Unconvinced, the trial justice ruled in favor of defendants, holding that the correspondence between the parties’ attorneys did not amount to an agreement as to the separation of the claims and that the three-year statute of limitations barred the claim, noting that the statute defined commissions as wages. 5 The plaintiff timely appealed.', '2', 'Issues on Appeal', 'Before this Court, plaintiff argues that the trial justice erred in granting defendants’ motion for summary judgment on the issue of timeliness because plaintiff’s lawsuit for unpaid 5', 'The trial justice did not specifically rule on defendants’ argument that Rule 408 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence prohibited admissibility of the parties’ correspondence.', '-9- commissions was brought under a common law theory of breach of contract and not under the Payment of Wages Act.', 'The plaintiff also argues that the trial justice erred in granting defendants’ motion for summary judgment on res judicata grounds because the contract claims in this lawsuit were separate and distinct from the contract claims in the federal court action. The plaintiff further argues that, even if the claims here were part of the same transaction of occurrences, defendants agreed to, or at least acquiesced in, severing the claims into a separate lawsuit.', '3', 'Standard of Review', '“This Court reviews de novo a trial justice’s decision granting summary judgment.” Sola v.

Therefore, Bisbano is puzzled as to why Appellees continue to address', '- 10 - a non-claim.” 6 The defendants respond that, despite plaintiff’s attempt to plead his grievance as breach of contract, the action seeks the recovery of unpaid commissions, which is governed by the Payment of Wages Act. Therefore, the defendants argue, the statute’s three-year statute of limitations period is controlling.', 'Unlike plaintiff, this Court does not find itself in a quandary about defendants’ persistence in pressing that this action is time-barred, because that was one of the bases upon which the trial justice granted the motion for summary judgment. At the hearing, the trial justice ruled clearly and succinctly that, “to the extent that the claim is a claim for wages under the Rhode Island Wage Claim Act [sic], it is abundantly clear that commissions are included. The Court here must find that the claim also is barred by the statute of limitations.” We agree.', 'The Payment of Wages Act provides that “[a]ny employee or former employee, or any organization representing such an employee or former employee aggrieved by the failure to pay wages and/or benefits or misclassification in violation of chapters 28-12 and/or 28-14 may file a civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction to obtain relief.” Section 28-14-19.2(a). Significantly, the statute defines “[w]ages” as “all amounts at which the labor or service rendered is recompensed, whether the amount is fixed or ascertained on a time, task, piece, commission basis, or other method of calculating the amount.” Section 28-14-1(4) (emphases added). The statute also provides that “[a]ny claim hereunder shall be forever barred unless commenced within three (3) years after the cause of action accrued.” Section 28-14-19.2(g).', 'The plaintiff’s insistence that the lawsuit was filed pursuant to a claim of breach of contract is unavailing. General Laws 1956 § 9-1-13(a) provides that “[e]xcept as otherwise 6', 'Once again, plaintiff did not address the statute of limitations issue in his Rule 12A filing with this Court. His only argument about the issue is found in his supplemental statement, in response to defendants’ Rule 12A counter-statement reiterating that Bisbano’s claims were time-barred.', '- 11 - specially provided, all civil actions shall be commenced within ten (10) years next after the cause of action shall accrue, and not after.” (Emphasis added.) Ordinarily, this provision applies to contract claims, as plaintiff asserts; however, because defendants brought to this Court’s attention a “specially provided” provision for actions for the collection of unpaid wages, we must determine whether provisions of the Payment of Wages Act displace the generally applicable ten-year statute of limitations. Thus, even though plaintiff’s complaint is pled in the form of a breach of contract, we look to the substance of a claim, rather than the pleading’s nomenclature. See Martin v. Howard, 784 A.2d 291, 301 (R.I. 2001); see also Grim v. Eastern Electric, LLC, 767 S.E.2d 267, 275 (W. Va. 2014) (“The determination of what statute of limitations applies turns on the nature of the injuries generally identified with the specific cause of action.”).', 'In Martin, 784 A.2d at 301, we were asked to determine what limitations period applied to the plaintiff’s breach of contract, bad faith, violation of fiduciary duty, and fraud claims. Rather than looking at the causes of action specified in the complaint, this Court evaluated the specific allegations of injury in the complaint, which included “severe emotional distress, anxiety, depression, humiliation, embarrassment, loss of self-esteem, and related medical and counseling expenses—all allegedly suffered because of Howard’s ‘unwelcome’ sexual conduct.” Id. at 302. Therefore, we held that:', '“notwithstanding Martin’s attempts to create a contract out of [the]', 'defendants’ alleged promise to mediate her personal-injury claims,', 'such an alleged contract wholly derived from and depended upon', 'the prior existence of the personal-injury claims themselves. In', 'addition, the asserted breach of this contract generated no new or', 'different injuries other than the personal injuries for which Martin', 'already was seeking damages. The same is also true for her bad', 'faith, fraud, and violation-of-fiduciary-duty claims.

In September 2010, Strine’s counsel explained that its business practice was to pay commissions after it had been paid by its customer and that, although it typically paid commissions at the end of the month, Bisbano requested to be paid at the end of the year. In a later letter, dated November 15, 2010, Strine notified Bisbano, through counsel, that it had just received payment from its client, CVS, and intended to pay Bisbano the undisputed amount of $38,275. Thus, we conclude that Bisbano was entitled to receive payment of his earned commissions as of the end of 2010. At that time, Bisbano was aware that there was a dispute about the total commissions owed and that Strine had received payment from CVS, triggering any obligation it had to remit further payment to him. Bisbano was therefore required to file suit for unpaid commissions by December 31, 2013.

We summarize below the salient aspects of that trial.', '-1-', 'A', 'The Testimony of Jami Ouellette', 'Jami Ouellette, the sister of the murder victim, Stacie Dorego, testified that, in 2012, Ms. Dorego lived at 16 Pershing Road in Johnston. Ms. Ouellette further testified that she spoke to defendant when he telephoned her a few weeks before Ms. Dorego’s death. She stated that, at the time of that phone call, it had been “rare” for him to call her; she said that he did so approximately once every four months.', 'She testified that defendant told her that he was concerned about his children and that he was unable to enter the home where they resided because of a restraining order. She stated that it was “very difficult to understand” defendant in the course of that phone call; she added that defendant was “kind of going on and on, repeating himself.” She further stated that she offered to call the Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF), but that defendant told her not to do so. Ms. Ouellette testified that defendant said that he could not contact DCYF, in spite of her suggestion that he do so. It was her further testimony that defendant told her “not to worry because [his] mom had money and was able to take care of the kids * * * and the kids would be fine.”', 'B', 'The Testimony of Francis O’Brien', 'Francis O’Brien, a friend of defendant, testified that, on the morning of January 22, 2012, defendant left him a “vague” message, indicating that he had the “best news in the world” for him and that he needed his help.

It was her testimony that it was not uncommon for defendant to come to her house and “ask to use things.” She testified that, on January 22, 2012, defendant came to her house several times during the day.', 'Ms. Scarcella testified that, upon returning home from doing an errand on the evening of January 22, she smelled smoke and saw that the kitchen of 16 Pershing Road was filled with smoke. She stated that she went into the 16 Pershing Road house because she knew that children were inside and she wanted them to get out. She stated that, once she was in the house, defendant told her that he was burning wood because the children were cold and that he had “everything under control.” It was her testimony that defendant’s demeanor was “odd” and “nervous” during their conversation; she added that he seemed “[a]ngry that [she] was in the house.”', 'Ms. Scarcella stated that she then left the 16 Pershing Road house and her cousin called the Fire Department.', 'She testified that, when the police officers and firefighters arrived, defendant was “very mad” and said: “‘Why did you call the cops?’” She noted that he looked “panicked” and was pacing. She said that defendant told the firefighters that there were no children in the house, although she knew that two children were there. She stated that, when defendant was speaking to the firefighters about the children not being in the house, they were attempting to enter; she testified that defendant was blocking them with his body by standing in', '-3- the middle of the doorway.

Chief Castelli testified that, upon arriving at that address, he observed smoke filling one of the rooms. He stated that he went to the side door, which defendant opened. He testified that defendant told him that there was smoke in the house due to the fact that he had been lighting the fireplace while the flue was not fully open. Chief Castelli testified that he told defendant that he wanted to get the children out of the house and then help him ventilate the home. Chief Castelli stated that defendant was “very adamant” that he did not want help. Chief Castelli testified that he had to put defendant “up against the refrigerator” and that he told him that they were going to help him in spite of his protests. He testified that, after this confrontation with defendant, he exited the house. He further testified that he later saw his fellow firefighter, Lieutenant Paul Brazenor, escort defendant out of the house. Chief Castelli added that defendant’s demeanor was “angry” and that he was insistent about wanting to stay in the house.', 'E', 'The Testimony of Lieutenant Paul Brazenor', 'Lieutenant Paul Brazenor of the Johnston Fire Department testified that, after arriving at 16 Pershing Road, he first encountered defendant when he opened the door to the basement and', '-4- saw him coming up the cellar stairs. He testified that that first encounter was “uneventful;” he added that he escorted defendant out of the home and said: “‘Let us do our job. I’ll take you outside, get you some help. Let us do what we do.’” Lieutenant Brazenor further testified that he made his way to the cellar door again and, when he opened it, he was met by defendant at the top of the stairs. He stated that he began yelling at defendant, telling him that he was in the way of the firefighters and saying: “‘I told you to get out of the house. What are you doing here? You need to leave now.’” He testified that he spun defendant around, forcibly escorting him down the hallway while screaming at him and forcibly bringing him outside. Lieutenant Brazenor further testified that defendant said: “‘It’s not a problem. Why are you guys doing this to me? I don’t see the problem.’” He characterized defendant as “very despondent” and said that he did not come with him willingly and was “dragging his feet a little bit.”', 'Upon returning to the basement, Lieutenant Brazenor discovered what were later confirmed to be the remains of Stacie Dorego.', 'F', 'The Testimony of Kevin Brady', 'Kevin Brady, a police officer in the Johnston Police Department, testified that, as Lieutenant Brazenor of the Johnston Fire Department was escorting defendant out of the house, he said: “‘Would somebody please detain this guy?

Officer Brady stated that he then detained defendant by standing in front of him and keeping him in a “confined area.” He testified that defendant looked at the house and said several times in an “aggressive” tone: “‘Get out of my f* * *ing house. I’m a good father.’” Officer Brady characterized defendant as having been “belligerent.”', '-5-', 'G', 'The Testimony of Alex Boisclair', 'Alex Boisclair, who was detained with defendant at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI), testified that defendant had shared the details of the murder with him.1 He testified that defendant told him that, around Christmastime of 2011, he had seen an e-mail from Ms. Dorego to one of her friends in which she stated that she had been unfaithful to defendant for the previous two years. Mr. Boisclair further testified that defendant told him that he had spoken to Ms. Dorego’s sister “about if anything happened to him or her, meaning Stacie [Dorego], that the kids would be all set with her, she’d take care of them.” Mr. Boisclair testified that defendant said that, since Christmastime, he had been planning for the care of his children in the event that he and Ms. Dorego could no longer care for them.', 'Mr. Boisclair said that defendant told him that, at the time when the crimes at issue were committed, Ms. Dorego had been on the bed and had asked defendant to “join her in bed.” He said that defendant told him that he had said to Ms. Dorego, “No, it’s not going to happen” and she responded: “Why not?” He testified that defendant said that Ms. Dorego then sat up and moved off the bed towards him.

An example of the information of that nature that Mr. Boisclair said was conveyed to him by defendant would be the fact that, in the kitchen at 16 Pershing Road, defendant had left a phone book open to a page containing truck rental listings. Detective Joshua Haywood testified that a still photograph of the kitchen, which was taken by investigators and eventually entered into evidence at trial, revealed a phone book lying open to a page containing truck rental listings.', '-6-', 'Mr. Boisclair testified that, during their time together at the ACI, defendant displayed no remorse and that it was “almost as if [Ms. Dorego’s death] was weight off his shoulders;” he characterized defendant’s emotional state as “excited.”', 'H', 'The Testimony of Dr. Christina Stanley', 'Doctor Christina Stanley, the Chief Medical Examiner for the State of Rhode Island, testified that she performed an examination of the remains found at 16 Pershing Road.

In providing his or her rationale, the trial justice is not required to “refer to all the evidence supporting the decision; rather, he or she need only cite evidence sufficient to allow this [C]ourt to discern whether the justice has applied the appropriate standards.” Robat, 49 A.3d at 71 (internal quotation marks omitted); see Hie, 93 A.3d at 975; Gonzalez, 56 A.3d at 102.', 'When we review a trial justice’s denial of a motion for a new trial, “[i]f the trial justice has complied with [the above-summarized] procedure and articulated adequate reasons for denying the motion, his or her decision will be given great weight and left undisturbed unless the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence or otherwise was clearly wrong.” Garrett, 91 A.3d at 800; see Hie, 93 A.3d at 975; Robat, 49 A.3d at 71. This Court is deferential to the trial justice’s ruling because “a trial justice, being present during all phases of the trial, is in an especially good position to evaluate the facts and to judge the credibility of the witnesses.” Gonzalez, 56 A.3d at 103 (internal quotation marks omitted); see Robat, 49 A.3d at 71. In the same vein, we have stated that “[t]his Court affords a great deal of respect to the factual determinations and credibility assessments made by the judicial officer who has actually observed the human drama that is part and parcel of every trial and who has had an opportunity to appraise witness demeanor and to take into account other realities that cannot be grasped from a reading of a cold record.” Hie, 93 A.3d at 975 (internal quotation marks omitted).', '-9-', 'III', 'Analysis', 'On appeal, defendant contends that the trial justice erred when she conducted a review of the weight of the evidence and concluded that it was adequate to support the conviction for first- degree murder and obstruction of a firefighter while in the execution of his duty.3 Specifically, defendant argues that the “[s]tate failed to present evidence of premeditation sufficient to justify a conviction for first degree murder.” Furthermore, with respect to the obstruction charge, defendant argues that he had not been told that he could not reenter his home when he encountered Lieutenant Brazenor on the basement stairs for a second time, and he points to the fact that he did not reenter the home once he had been instructed not to go back inside.', 'In the instant case, the trial justice adhered to the requisite three-step analysis, to which she explicitly alluded at the outset of her ruling on defendant’s motion for a new trial. See generally Gonzalez, 56 A.3d at 102; Adefusika, 989 A.2d at 480.', 'The trial justice began by summarizing the testimony and evidence presented at trial. Next, the trial justice engaged in the first step of the three-step analysis by considering the evidence in light of the jury charge. See Hie, 93 A.3d at 974; Gonzalez, 56 A.3d at 102; Adefusika, 989 A.2d at 480. With respect to the charge of first-degree murder, the trial justice recognized that premeditation is the critical differentiating factor between murder in the first 3', 'As we have frequently indicated, a motion for a new trial may be predicated on one of two different grounds. State v. Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 569-70 (R.I. 2009); see State v. Fleck, 81 A.3d 1129, 1133 (R.I. 2014). A defendant may argue that the “weight of the evidence was not adequate to convict him, or, in the alternative, he may argue that the evidence was legally insufficient to support a conviction.” Fleck, 81 A.3d at 1133. In the instant case, defendant states that there was “insufficient evidence presented to the jury to withstand a conviction for first degree murder or obstruction of a firefighter while in the execution of his duty.” However, defendant has opted to provide this Court exclusively with authorities relative to the standard of review pertaining to the weight of the evidence. Accordingly, we shall consider defendant to have based his appeal solely on a challenge to the weight of the evidence.', '- 10 - degree and murder in the second degree. See State v. Gillespie, 960 A.2d 969, 976-77 (R.I. 2008) (stating that “the distinction between first-degree and momentary-intent-based second- degree murder is the duration of the defendant’s intent to kill”) (emphasis in original). Accordingly, the trial justice noted that, before the time of the murder, defendant had called Ms. Ouellette and discussed “what would happen to the children” and indicated that “they would be taken care of.” Additionally, the trial justice noted that Mr. Boisclair testified that defendant had shared the details of Ms. Dorego’s murder with him and indicated that he had been planning her murder since concluding around Christmastime that she had been unfaithful to him. The trial justice also noted that Mr. Boisclair testified that defendant discussed with him his phone call to Ms. Ouellette. The trial justice further noted that Mr. O’Brien said that defendant had discussed with him the possibility of Mr. O’Brien moving into the 16 Pershing Road home when he saw him on January 22 and also indicated to Mr. O’Brien that Ms. Dorego had left with a boyfriend. The trial justice observed that such behavior lacked the “volatility [or] passion as to what had happened,” which is sometimes seen in second-degree murder or manslaughter. The trial justice concluded that, after examining the evidence in light of the charge to the jury, the evidence was sufficient to support the jury’s finding that Stacie Dorego was the victim of first-degree murder.', 'With respect to the charge of obstruction of a firefighter, the trial justice noted that, after Lieutenant Brazenor encountered defendant for the first time, he escorted him out of the house and asked him to let the firefighters do their job, but that when Lieutenant Brazenor attempted to enter the basement a second time, defendant was again at the top of the stairs. The trial justice noted that Lieutenant Brazenor became angry with defendant, forcibly removed him from the home, and asked other officers to detain defendant because he was obstructing him. The trial justice also noted that defendant’s “manner of interaction” with the firefighters was reflected in', '- 11 - Chief Castelli’s testimony that he had to move defendant out of the way so that a firefighter could remove the children from the home. In the trial justice’s view, that evidence was sufficient to support the charge of obstructing the firefighters.', 'The trial justice completed the second step of the required analysis by independently assessing the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence. See Hie, 93 A.3d at 974; Gonzalez, 56 A.3d at 102; Adefusika, 989 A.2d at 480. She said that she found all the witnesses to be credible.', 'Notably, the trial justice indicated that she believed Lieutenant Brazenor and Chief Castelli and concluded that they were “credible as to their observations on that evening.” She also determined that Ms. Ouellette was credible and was “telling the truth.” The trial justice noted that Mr. Boisclair was the only witness whose credibility was called into question by defendant at trial. Nevertheless, the trial justice found Mr. Boisclair to be “credible” and “truthful;” she added that, although Mr. Boisclair had initially sought to use the information shared with him by defendant as a “get-out-of-jail card,” he stated that he decided to testify, even though he did not gain anything by doing so, because it was “the right thing to do.” The trial justice further noted that, at the time Mr. Boisclair disclosed the information to the Johnston Police, some of it was not publicly known, so that he could have learned of it only from defendant.', 'Next, the trial justice completed the third step of the analysis by determining whether she would have reached a different result from that reached by the jury. See Hie, 93 A.3d at 974; Gonzalez, 56 A.3d at 102; Adefusika, 989 A.2d at 480. The trial justice explicitly stated that she agreed with the jury’s verdict and “would have found the defendant guilty of all these four charges that [were] submitted to the jury.”', '- 12 -', 'Accordingly, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial. We do not perceive any error in the trial justice’s application of the three-step analysis or in her agreement with the jury’s verdict.', 'Although the trial justice addressed and dealt with the motion for a new trial in a completely proper manner, we have chosen in this instance to opine further about two specific contentions raised on appeal by defendant. He argues that the “[s]tate failed to present evidence of premeditation sufficient to justify a conviction for first degree murder.”', 'See State v. Rodriguez, 822 A.2d 894, 909 (R.I. 2003) (noting that the “distinction between first- and second- degree murder is whether the evidence indicates that premeditation existed for some appreciable length of time before the murder occurred or whether the evidence shows that premeditation, if it existed at all, occurred for just a mere moment before the murder”). The defendant contends that the trial justice placed great weight on his actions subsequent to Ms. Dorego’s death, whereas, in his view, the trial transcript shows that he was “not acting in his right mind,” which would indicate that premeditation was lacking.', 'In fact, however, the trial justice looked to Mr. Boisclair’s testimony about what defendant said to him as evidence of premeditation. She observed that “[o]n his testimony alone, we certainly have enough information for a jury to consider the charge of * * * first degree murder.” The trial justice also looked to the timing of defendant’s phone call to Ms. Ouellette as evidence of premeditation. That phone call was made around Christmastime, and Mr. Boisclair testified that defendant had told him about discovering what he deemed to be evidence of Ms. Dorego’s infidelity. Although defendant argues that his actions after Ms. Dorego’s death show that he “was not acting in his right mind,” the trial justice found that his actions did not show the “volatility [or] passion as to what had happened” that is characteristic of second-degree murder; and we see no basis for rejecting that finding.', '- 13 - Consequently, we are satisfied that the trial justice placed adequate weight on defendant’s actions prior to Ms. Dorego’s death in determining that her murder was premeditated.', 'The defendant further contends that Mr. Boisclair’s testimony establishes “a fleeting intent” on defendant’s part that was “contemporaneous with the act of stabbing Ms. Dorego,” rather than premeditation. It should be recalled, however, that the trial justice did not rely solely on Mr. Boisclair’s testimony regarding the murder itself, but rather looked to the timing of the discovery of Ms. Dorego’s purported infidelity, which coincided with defendant’s phone call to Ms. Ouellette.', 'The defendant also contends that his phone conversation with Ms. Ouellette could not establish premeditation because it was merely an expression of his concern for his children. However, the trial justice looked not only to the content of the conversation, but also the timing of the phone call as evidence that he had planned the murder with premeditation. Accordingly, it is our view that the trial justice did not err when she determined that the evidence was adequate to support a conviction for first-degree murder.', 'With respect to the conviction for obstruction of a firefighter, defendant argues that he was not explicitly told that he could not return inside the house when Lieutenant Brazenor first encountered him on the basement stairs and escorted him out of the home. On that basis, he argues that he was not obstructing the firefighters by returning to the basement. The defendant points to the fact that, after being removed from the home a second time, he complied with Lieutenant Brazenor’s instruction not to go back inside, and he also notes that there was no testimony that the firefighters were “actually hindered in any way.” In defendant’s view, his being “merely present” inside the house at 16 Pershing Road is insufficient evidence to support a conviction for obstruction. The trial justice reasoned that defendant’s presence on the basement', '- 14 - stairs during his first encounter with Lieutenant Brazenor was sufficient to support the obstruction conviction. She stated that, unless “[Lieutenant Brazenor could] somehow walk through defendant, [defendant’s presence there was] an obstruction.” The trial justice found defendant’s return to the basement stairs after having already been removed to be of even greater significance because Lieutenant Brazenor was again distracted from his duties as a firefighter in order to remove defendant from the house for a second time. The trial justice further noted that defendant’s “whole manner of interaction with the firefighters [was] also shown by Chief Castelli, who had moved him out of the way to even let the firefighter in to get the children out of the house.”', 'Moreover, although the trial justice did not specifically address whether defendant “hindered” the firefighters, defendant’s return to the basement stairs after being removed from the home certainly impeded Lieutenant Brazenor in the execution of his official duty.', 'See DeFusco v. Brophy, 112 R.I. 461, 464, 311 A.2d 286, 288 (1973) (defining “obstruction” in the context of § 11-32-1 as meaning “to interpose obstacles or impediments, to hinder, impede, or in any manner intrude or prevent, and this term does not necessarily imply the employment of direct force or the exercise of direct means”) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'Based on our review of the record and the trial justice’s application of the three-step analysis and after consideration of the defendant’s several contentions, it is clear to us that the trial justice performed the requisite analysis completely and more than adequately explained her reasoning. We perceive no basis for concluding that the trial justice was either clearly wrong or that she misconceived or overlooked material evidence when she denied the defendant’s motion for a new trial. Accordingly, we uphold the trial justice’s denial of the defendant’s motion for a new trial.', '- 15 -', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

56,"Melissa E. Goddard : v. : APG Security-RI, LLC, alias John Doe : Corporation et al.",non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. Which period of limitation applies to a civil action alleging a violation of the employer drug testing statute (EDTS) 1—ten years as provided in G.L. 1956 § 9-1-13(a) 2 or three years as provided in § 9-1-14(b) 3—is the central question of this appeal. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issue raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further 1', 'The statute governing drug testing by employers is set forth in G.L. 1956 § 28-6.5-1(a) and provides, in pertinent part, that:', '“(a) No employer or agent of any employer shall, either orally', 'or in writing, request, require, or subject any employee to submit a', 'sample of his or her urine, blood, or other bodily fluid or tissue for', 'testing as a condition of continued employment unless that test is', 'administered in accordance with the provisions of this section.” 2', 'General Laws 1956 § 9-1-13(a) provides that “[e]xcept as otherwise specially provided, all civil actions shall be commenced within ten (10) years next after the cause of action shall accrue, and not after.” 3', 'Section 9-1-14(b) provides, in pertinent part, that “[a]ctions for injuries to the person shall be commenced and sued within three (3) years next after the cause of action shall accrue, and not after * * *.”', '-1- briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On March 27, 2014, Melissa Goddard (plaintiff) filed a complaint against APG Security- RI, LLC, as well as against Scott Hemingway and Anna Vidiri in their capacities as employees/agents of APG Security-RI, LLC (collectively, defendants). The complaint alleged that, in January 2010, when plaintiff was employed as a security guard by APG Security-RI, LLC, defendants violated G.L. 1956 § 28-6.5-1 when they required her to submit to a drug test without the reasonable grounds set forth by the statute and subsequently terminated her employment based on the result of that test. The plaintiff sought damages pursuant to both the EDTS and § 9-1-2. 4 The defendants responded to plaintiff’s complaint with a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, in which they asserted that the complaint was not timely filed. A hearing justice of the Superior Court held a hearing on June 9, 2014, at which defendants argued that the three-year statute of limitations in § 9-1-14(b) applied to civil actions arising out of alleged violations of the EDTS, and plaintiff argued that the ten-year statute of limitations in § 9-1-13(a) applied instead. The hearing justice agreed with 4', 'Section 9-1-2 provides that:', '“Whenever any person shall suffer any injury to his or her', 'person, reputation, or estate by reason of the commission of any', 'crime or offense, he or she may recover his or her damages for the', 'injury in a civil action against the offender, and it shall not be any', 'defense to such action that no criminal complaint for the crime or', 'offense has been made; and whenever any person shall be guilty of', 'larceny, he or she shall be liable to the owner of the money or', 'articles taken for twice the value thereof, unless the money or', 'articles are restored, and for the value thereof in case of', 'restoration.”', '-2- defendants and found that the three-year statute of limitations in § 9-1-14(b) governed plaintiff’s cause of action. The hearing justice also found that the statute of limitations began to run from the date that the drug test was administered, and that plaintiff’s complaint had been filed more than three years after the administration of the drug test. Accordingly, the hearing justice granted defendants’ motion and dismissed plaintiff’s complaint. The plaintiff filed a premature notice of appeal, which we nevertheless deem to be timely. See Miller v. Saunders, 80 A.3d 44, 47 n.8 (R.I. 2013). 5', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“In reviewing the grant of a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), this Court applies the same standard as the hearing justice.” Ho-Rath v. Rhode Island Hospital, 115 A.3d 938, 942 (R.I. 2015) (quoting Woonsocket School Committee v. Chafee, 89 A.3d 778, 787 (R.I. 2014)). “Because the sole function of a motion to dismiss is to test the sufficiency of the complaint, our review is confined to the four corners of that pleading.” Id. (quoting Chafee, 89 A.3d at 787). “We will ‘assume[] the allegations contained in the complaint to be true and view[] the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.’” Id. (quoting Chafee, 89 A.3d at 787). “A motion to dismiss is properly granted when it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the plaintiff would not be entitled to relief from the defendant under any set of facts that could be proven in support of the plaintiff’s claim.” Id. (quoting Chafee, 89 A.3d at 787).', 'This appeal also presents us with a question of law regarding which of two general civil action statutes of limitations will apply to causes of action arising from alleged violations of the EDTS. It is well settled that ‘“[t]he question of whether a statute of limitations has run against a 5', 'The order granting defendants’ motion to dismiss entered on June 12, 2014; the final judgment entered “nunc pro tunc” on October 20, 2014.', '-3- plaintiff[’]s claim is * * * a question of law,’ which this Court reviews de novo.” Ho-Rath, 115 A.3d at 942-43 (quoting Balletta v.

Capital Properties, Inc., 88 A.3d 1150, 1156 (R.I. 2014)).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'The plaintiff argues that the ten-year statute of limitations in § 9-1-13(a) should apply to alleged violations of the EDTS because § 9-1-13(a) specifically states that the ten-year statute of limitations applies “[e]xcept as otherwise specially provided,” the EDTS does not indicate the applicable statute of limitations, and none of the other established statutes of limitations apply. The plaintiff also argues that actions brought pursuant to the EDTS do not meet this Court’s common law definition of § 9-1-14(b)’s “injuries to the person” because “the legislature intended the rights created in the [EDTS] to accrue to an individual by reason of a peculiar status and not as rights to which one is entitled by reason of being a person in the eyes of the law.” The plaintiff asserts that § 9-1-14(b) does not apply, therefore, because “the right to be free from unreasonable drug testing is a right that accrues to an individual by reason of a peculiar status * * *.” The plaintiff contends that the “peculiar statuses” in question are created by the separate sections within the EDTS that delineate different drug testing rules for employees as opposed to job applicants.', 'The defendants counterargue that the three-year statute of limitations in § 9-1-14(b) applies because a violation of the rights protected by the EDTS results in an injury to the person as defined by this Court and because plaintiff’s rights do not arise from any peculiar status. The defendants assert that “the rights conferred and protected by the [EDTS] are * * * analogous” to', '-4- civil rights even though the EDTS rights are not ‘“civil right[s]’ in the classical sense of th[e] term.” The defendants also argue that the application of the three-year limit on causes of action arising out of alleged violations of the EDTS is “consistent with the General Assembly’s use of short limitations periods in other employment-related statutes” and supports the policy considerations in favor of short statutes of limitations in the employment context.', 'The EDTS provides employees with a right to be free from drug tests that are not administered in accordance with the process set forth within the statute. See § 28-6.5-1(a). The EDTS sets out several conditions under which an employer may request, require, or subject an employee to a drug test using a sample of the employee’s blood, urine, or other bodily fluids. Id. A violation of the EDTS can lead to a misdemeanor conviction of the employer as well as to an award of punitive damages, attorney’s fees, costs, and injunctive relief in favor of an employee- plaintiff in a civil action against the employer. Section 28-6.5-1(b), (c). The EDTS does not, however, provide a limitation on the time in which an employee has to bring a civil action. See § 28-6.5-1.', 'When a statute creates a civil remedy for its violation but is silent regarding the applicable limitations period, we have often decided between one of two residual statutes of limitations provided in chapter 1 of title 9: either the three years provided in § 9-1-14(b) or the ten years provided in § 9-1-13(a). See Paul v. City of Woonsocket, 745 A.2d 169, 169, 172 (R.I. 2000) (holding that § 9-1-14(b) applied to a cause of action filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to recover payment of an allegedly improper water tapping fee); Lyons v. Town of Scituate, 554 A.2d 1034, 1035, 1036 (R.I. 1989) (holding that the statute of limitations in § 9-1-14(b) applied to recovery sought pursuant to § 9-1-2). Section 9-1-14(b) provides, in relevant part, that “[a]ctions for injuries to the person” must be initiated within three years from the date that the', '-5- cause of action accrued. We have previously held that the phrase ‘“injuries to the person’ * * * is to be construed comprehensively and as contemplating its application to actions involving injuries that are other than physical.” Commerce Oil Refining Corp. v. Miner, 98 R.I. 14, 20, 22, 199 A.2d 606, 610 (1964) (Commerce Oil) (determining that an action for malicious prosecution was to be considered an injury to the person and therefore subject to the statute of limitations in § 9-1-14). In Commerce Oil, we commented that the purpose of the phrase “injuries to the person” is:', '“to include within that period of limitation actions brought for', 'injuries resulting from invasions of rights that inhere in man as a', 'rational being, that is, rights to which one is entitled by reason of', 'being a person in the eyes of the law. Such rights, of course, are to', 'be distinguished from those which accrue to an individual by', 'reason of some peculiar status or by virtue of an interest created by', 'contract or property.” Id. at 20-21, 199 A.2d at 610. We have repeatedly applied the framework established in Commerce Oil to determine which statute of limitations applies to various causes of action. See, e.g., Paul, 745 A.2d at 172; McBurney v. Roszkowski, 687 A.2d 447, 448-49 (R.I. 1997) (holding that an action for intentional interference with a contract was subject to the ten-year statute of limitations); Church v. McBurney, 513 A.2d 22, 23, 24, 26 (R.I. 1986) (holding that actions for legal malpractice were essentially claims for negligent breach of contract and were therefore subject to the statute of limitations in § 9-1-13); Mikaelian v. Drug Abuse Unit, 501 A.2d 721, 724 (R.I. 1985) (holding that the statute of limitations in § 9-1-14(b) applied to actions for libel because “the right * * * to be free from defamatory statements [was] among those rights to which one is entitled by reason of being a person, as opposed to a right arising out of contract or property”). Clearly plaintiff has not alleged the invasion of a right or an interest created by contract or property. Her ability to avail herself of the ten-year statute of limitations, therefore, turns on her', '-6- claim that her right to recovery for a violation of the EDTS accrues to her “by reason of some peculiar status”—the peculiar status being that of an employee.', 'Thus, she contends that violations of the EDTS are an exception to the definition of “injuries to the person” that this Court has applied since Commerce Oil.', 'Since our pronouncement in Commerce Oil, we have not had an occasion to either define or apply the “peculiar status” exception to the comprehensive construction that we have afforded the language “injuries to the person” under § 9-1-14(b).', 'We have, however, consistently emphasized that “it is the nature of the right invaded and not the elements of damage resulting therefrom that determines its character as an injury to the person.” Nappi v. John Deere & Co., 717 A.2d 650, 651 (R.I. 1998) (mem.) (quoting Pirri v. Toledo Scale Corp., 619 A.2d 429, 431 (R.I. 1993)); Lyons, 554 A.2d at 1036 (quoting Commerce Oil, 98 R.I. at 21, 199 A.2d at 610); Church, 513 A.2d at 24 (quoting Commerce Oil, 98 R.I. at 21, 199 A.2d at 610).', 'The plaintiff has essentially alleged a violation of her right to be free from drug testing that is not conducted in accordance with the mandates set forth in the EDTS. See § 28-6.5-1. We agree with plaintiff that the EDTS creates a right for employees to be free from drug testing policies and procedures that do not comply with the statute. When we consider our previous applications of § 9-1-14(b)’s “injuries to the person” pursuant to the definition expounded in Commerce Oil, however, we conclude that the nature of the right created by the EDTS is analogous to an invasion of privacy and thus one to which plaintiff was “entitled by reason of being a person in the eyes of the law” and not by virtue of any “peculiar status” or by reason of “an interest created by contract or property.” Commerce Oil, 98 R.I. at 20-21, 199 A.2d at 610; see also Mikaelian, 501 A.2d at 724. As in our previous cases involving the Commerce Oil framework, the injuries sustained from a violation of the EDTS are not necessarily physical and', '-7- indeed need not be physical in order for § 9-1-14(b) to apply. See, e.g., Mikaelian, 501 A.2d at 724. We hold, therefore, that violations of the EDTS result in “injuries to the person” as contemplated by § 9-1-14(b) and, accordingly, are subject to this three-year statute of limitations and not to the ten-year period provided in § 9-1-13(a).', 'We note that our conclusion is consistent with statutes of limitations that the General Assembly has promulgated for other employment-related claims.', 'For example, the Fair Employment Practices Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 5 of title 28, provides only one year to file a charge with the commission for human rights, and thereafter the commission has two years to issue a complaint. Section 28-5-17(a); § 28-5-18(b).', 'The Whistleblowers’ Protection Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 50 of title 28, provides an explicit three-year statute of limitations, § 28-50- 4(a), and the Civil Rights Act of 1990, G.L. 1956 chapter 112 of title 42, also limits civil litigation to three years after the alleged violation of the statute. Section 42-112-2. As a matter of public policy, these statutes demonstrate the General Assembly’s preference for applying relatively short statutes of limitations to employment-related claims. 6', 'The plaintiff also sought damages pursuant to § 9-1-2. While the EDTS is silent with respect to the applicable statute of limitations, we have previously held that § 9-1-2—the statute providing civil liability for the victims of criminal offenses—was subject to the limitations period set forth in § 9-1-14(b) because “[t]here is no peculiar status or contractual relationship between the parties creating an alternative right upon which plaintiff might sue.” Lyons, 554 A.3d at 1036. Since we have previously held that actions for civil liability enabled by § 9-1-2 for the victims of criminal offenses—which would include the misdemeanor offense created by the 6', 'We also note that the statute of limitations for the misdemeanor offense created by § 28-6.5- 1(b) is three years. See G.L. 1956 § 12-12-17(c) (providing that the statute of limitations for any criminal offense not enumerated in paragraphs (a) or (b) is three years “unless a longer statute of limitations is otherwise provided for in the general laws”).', '-8- EDTS—are subject to the three-year statute of limitations, we also hold that actions brought pursuant to § 9-1-2 for an alleged violation of § 28-6.5-1 are subject to the three-year statute of limitations provided in § 9-1-14(b). See Lyons, 554 A.2d at 1036.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'Because the plaintiff filed her complaint more than three years after the alleged violation of the EDTS, her claims pursuant to both the EDTS and § 9-1-2 are time-barred.

57,Jo-Ann Albanese : v. : Town of Narragansett et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court.', 'This case came before the Supreme Court on October 28, 2015, pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. The plaintiff, Jo-Ann Albanese (plaintiff or Albanese), appeals pro se from grants of summary judgment by the Washington County Superior Court in favor of the defendants, the Town of Narragansett, David Krugman in his official capacity as Treasurer for the Town, the Narragansett Police Department, and Sgt. Gerald Favreau (Sgt. Favreau) and then-Patrolman (now Lieutenant) Matthew Sutton (Lt. Sutton) in their official capacities as police officers with the Narragansett Police Department (collectively, defendants). Albanese further appeals from the denial of multiple pretrial motions. After examining the memoranda filed by the parties,1 we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the appeal at this time. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand to the Superior Court. 1', 'The parties elected to waive oral argument and rest on their pre-briefing statements.', '-1-', 'Facts and Travel', 'Many of the underlying facts of this action stem from an incident recounted by this Court in State v. Albanese, 970 A.2d 1215 (R.I. 2009). On November 11, 2003, Sgt. Favreau and Lt. Sutton were called to the Driftwood Apartment Complex (Driftwood), where Albanese resides in Narragansett, after receiving a report that Albanese had physically assaulted a Driftwood maintenance worker, Thomas Arrico (Arrico). Id. at 1217-18. The officers arrested Albanese, and she subsequently was charged with one count of assault and/or battery upon Arrico and one count of resisting arrest. Id. at 1217, 1218. A District Court judge found Albanese not guilty of resisting arrest but guilty on the other count. Id. at 1217. Albanese appealed her conviction to the Washington County Superior Court. Id. In a jury-waived trial, Albanese centered her defense on her allegation that mold existed at Driftwood; defense counsel questioned Arrico about the mold on cross-examination and called a former Driftwood tenant and a Rhode Island Department of Health official as witnesses to testify on the subject.2 Id. at 1217-19. The Superior Court trial justice found Albanese guilty of battery but not guilty of assault. Id. at 1219. This Court affirmed the conviction. Id. at 1225.', 'The circumstances of the 2003 arrest and Albanese’s allegations about the presence of mold at Driftwood are the subject of this action. On November 10, 2006, Albanese, acting pro se, filed a multi-count complaint against defendants in the Washington County Superior Court. She alleged assault and battery (count 3) stemming from the purported use of excessive force by Sgt. Favreau and Lt. Sutton. Specifically, she claimed that Sgt. Favreau and Lt. Sutton had injured her when they “drag[ged] her [out] of her car and * * * dragged her with her jacket over 2', 'The official from the health department testified that Albanese had filed a complaint with his office regarding mold in the housing complex. State v. Albanese, 970 A.2d 1215, 1218-19 (R.I. 2009). He testified that the mold has since been remediated. Id. at 1219.', '-2- her head, * * * 200 [feet] (approximately) or so to her apartment in order to put her dog inside her apartment” just before arresting her. She also alleged false arrest (count 2).', 'Albanese further claimed that defendants had engaged in “gross negligence and/or misconduct” (count 1) by “failing to act in a professional manner, * * * effectively be[coming] [Driftwood’s] agents[,] and abus[ing] their power and position” in the ongoing landlord-tenant dispute over the purported mold. She alleged that defendants had intimidated and harassed her in an attempt to dissuade her from making additional complaints about mold. Albanese charged that defendants’ alleged failure to address reports of mold constituted “negligence per se” (count 4). Albanese included an additional claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress (count 5), and she sought to recover punitive damages (count 6).', 'In addition to the case at bar, Albanese previously had brought suit against Driftwood’s property management company in 2005, in which she alleged multiple causes of action on account of the mold in her apartment (Driftwood case). The suit subsequently settled. In 2009, the attorney who had represented Albanese in the Driftwood case entered his appearance in the Superior Court on Albanese’s behalf in the case before us.', 'However, the case remained dormant in the Washington County Superior Court for a number of years, until May 2, 2013, when a Superior Court justice imposed a deadline of July 17, 2013 for the close of discovery.', 'On August 29, counsel for Albanese moved to withdraw his representation, citing a breakdown of the attorney-client relationship. The trial justice heard the motion on September 6, at which time Albanese confirmed that she wished to terminate the relationship and intended to represent herself. The court scheduled December 10 for trial, ordered defendants to file any dispositive motions no later than October 11, and gave Albanese until November 8 to file her objection with supporting memorandum to defendants’', '-3- dispositive motions (September 6 order). On September 20, Albanese, by letter to the court, alleged that she recently had been diagnosed with a medical condition and that surgery was imminent; she requested a continuance until after the surgery. One week later, at a status hearing on September 27, Albanese informed the court that her surgery had not yet been scheduled. The trial justice denied Albanese’s request to postpone the November 8 filing deadline but agreed to revisit the issue at the next status hearing.', 'On October 10, 2013, in accordance with the September 6 order, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. In support of the motion, defendants provided the initial police report and Albanese’s responses to defendants’ interrogatories.3 The parties reconvened on October 18 for a status hearing. Albanese told the court that her surgery still had not been scheduled but that she intended to meet with her surgeon on November 8.', 'The trial justice slated November 15 as the date for the next status hearing and extended the deadline for Albanese’s response to the motion for summary judgment to November 29.', 'At the status hearing on November 15, 2013, Albanese notified the court that the surgery had been performed on November 4. She requested an extension of the November 29 filing deadline because, she contended, that she had been too ill to work on her objection. Although the trial justice stressed the need for the nearly eight-year-old case to proceed, she granted Albanese a new deadline of December 13. The trial justice cautioned, “There will be no further continuances.”', 'On December 6, Albanese filed a written objection to the motion for summary judgment which indicated that a memorandum and supporting documentation were forthcoming. With her objection, she filed an “Emergency Motion for an Extension of Time/Continuance in which to 3', 'Albanese answered the interrogatories while she still was represented by counsel.', '-4- Complete [Plaintiff’s] Answer to Summary Judgment and a Continuance for Hearing on Summary Judgment.” Albanese stated that she needed more time because she had learned that “no discovery[] [was] even asked for by her previous attorney, no [depositions], no affidavits, no interrogatories[,] absolutely nothing was done.” Notwithstanding the order that had cut off discovery six months earlier, Albanese averred that she had attempted to request discovery materials from defendants but that they had refused because the deadline had passed.', 'The trial justice denied the request to reopen discovery but granted another extension to January 17, 2014 for Albanese to file her objection.4 In so doing, she cautioned Albanese: “[Y]ou have one last opportunity to file your objection to the motion for summary judgment. One last opportunity. I absolutely am not even going to entertain anything more on the record until the date of the hearing.” Albanese did not comply; she peppered the court with a series of filings, including a letter addressed to the trial justice, seeking more time. The January 17 deadline passed without Albanese filing additional materials in objection to defendants’ motion for summary judgment.', 'The parties reassembled in Superior Court on January 31, 2014. The trial justice denied the multiple motions Albanese had filed since the previous hearing and indicated that she would hear the parties on the issue of summary judgment. She explained that, although Albanese had not provided written documentation in support of her opposition to the motion, the pro se litigant still had the opportunity to provide an oral response. After hearing from both parties, the trial justice granted summary judgment on all counts. This timely appeal followed. 4', 'We note that the parties have not provided the Court with a transcript of this hearing, which took place on December 12, 2013. Although the transcript is not before the Court, the Superior Court justice referenced the hearing in detail at a subsequent hearing on January 31, 2014. It is from the trial justice’s recitation on January 31 that we base our retelling of the events that transpired at the hearing on December 12, 2013.', '-5-', 'Before this Court, Albanese assigns error to the denial of her motions to reopen discovery, the denial of her motions for an extension in time to file a memorandum in opposition to summary judgment, the denial of her motion to recuse, and the grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants.', 'Discussion', 'I. Denial of Motions to Reopen Discovery', 'We first address Albanese’s claim that the court erred by denying her multiple motions to request additional materials from defendants long after the discovery phase had passed. This Court consistently has held that “[t]he Superior Court has broad discretion to regulate how and when discovery occurs.” Shelter Harbor Conservation Society, Inc. v. Rogers, 21 A.3d 337, 343 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Giuliano v. Pastina, 793 A.2d 1035, 1037 (R.I. 2002)). This Court will not disturb a decision granting or denying discovery, except upon a showing that the lower court abused its discretion. Id. We previously have remarked that, “[o]nce the court enter[s] [a] scheduling order, the parties [become] bound to comply with the sequence and timing for discovery set forth in that scheduling order and subsequent court orders.” Malinou v. Miriam Hospital, 24 A.3d 497, 506 (R.I. 2011).', 'Here, more than six and a half years had elapsed between the time Albanese brought suit in 2006 and July 17, 2013, the court-ordered discovery deadline. The plaintiff had ample time to request materials throughout this period and was represented by counsel at the time discovery closed. She claims that her desire to reopen discovery is because her former attorney had failed to seek allegedly pertinent documents.5 Nonetheless, Albanese did not move to reopen discovery 5', 'We do not mean to suggest that Albanese’s previous attorney erred or that we would have reached a different conclusion regarding any issue raised on appeal had additional discovery materials been requested.', '-6- until several months after she assumed self-representation. Under the circumstances, we are satisfied that the Superior Court justice did not abuse her discretion when she denied Albanese’s motions to resurrect a discovery period that had ended months before.6', 'II. Denial of Motions for Continuance', 'Albanese next claims that the Superior Court justice erred in denying her motions to push back the deadline for filing her opposition to defendants’ motion for summary judgment. This Court recognizes that “manag[ing] [the] trial calendar is among the most difficult of all judicial assignments.” Boucher v. Galvin, 571 A.2d 35, 37 (R.I. 1990). Accordingly, we afford justices “the widest discretion” in carrying out the demanding task and will upset the denial of a motion for a continuance only upon a showing that the lower court abused such discretion. Id.', 'This Court was confronted with a fact pattern similar to the case at bar in DeMascole v. Tatro, 673 A.2d 57 (R.I. 1996). In DeMascole, the action had been pending in the Superior Court for more than eight years at the time the trial justice set a date certain. Id. at 60. When the trial originally was scheduled to begin, the court granted the plaintiff’s motion for a three-month 6', 'Albanese contends on appeal that, on October 18, 2013, the trial justice vacated the entire May 2, 2013 order, including the part pertaining to the July 2013 date marking the end of discovery. The October 18, 2013 hearing transcript belies this claim:', '“THE COURT:', '* * * I am going to vacate at this time the', 'December 10 trial date * * *.', '“MS. ALBANESE: [T]he pretrial orders will be changed', 'accordingly?', '“THE COURT:', 'I have just vacated the trial date. * * *', '“MS. ALBANESE: Okay. So no pretrial orders go along with', 'that?', '“THE COURT:', 'Correct.” Further, unlike the looming deadline for filing the objection to defendants’ motion for summary judgment, the period allotted for discovery had ended months earlier. There was no reason for the court to retroactively rescind the July 2013 deadline on account of Albanese’s impending surgery.', '-7- continuance for the purpose of securing the attendance of a witness. Id. When the case again was reached for trial, the court granted a second motion to continue the case because the witness still was not available. Id. When the plaintiff moved for a third continuance based upon the witness’s unavailability, the trial justice denied the motion in light of the length of time the case had been pending, the previous grants of continuances, and the fact that the original trial date had been set three months earlier. Id. at 60-61. We concluded that the trial justice acted within his discretion. Id. at 61.', 'In the case before us, the Superior Court initially set November 8, 2013 as a deadline for Albanese to file materials in opposition to defendants’ motion for summary judgment. Her September 20, 2013 request to continue the case until after her surgery was premature, because the surgery had not been scheduled and defendants’ dispositive motion was not due until October. However, the court granted her an extension at the next status hearing. Albanese attests that she had the surgery on November 4, 2013, meaning that she had twenty-five days to work on the memorandum and compile her supporting materials before the surgery—only three days less time than the twenty-eight days initially allotted by the court. After the surgery, the court twice more extended the deadline at Albanese’s request.', 'Like the action in DeMascole, this case had been languishing in the Superior Court for a number of years and the trial justice had granted multiple extensions. By the final due date of January 17, 2014, Albanese had had defendants’ summary-judgment motion in hand for nearly 100 days—three times longer than the amount of time originally allocated for her to file her objection. Based on these facts, the trial justice acted within the bounds of her discretion.', '-8-', 'III. Denial of Motion to Recuse', 'Albanese next assails the denial of her motion for the trial justice to recuse herself from the case. In support of the motion to recuse, Albanese argued before the Superior Court that the trial justice had failed to take her seriously as a self-represented litigant. In particular, Albanese attributed to her pro se status the denial of her motions to reopen discovery and the court’s refusal, on December 12, 2013, to consider additional motions for extensions in time. Albanese further contended before the Superior Court that the trial justice had encouraged defendants to file a dispositive motion when none had been filed.', 'We afford the trial justice “considerable discretion” in deciding whether to step away from a case. State v. Romano, 456 A.2d 746, 754 (R.I. 1983). A party moving for recusal must show “that the trial justice had personal bias or prejudice by reason of a preconceived or settled opinion of a character calculated to impair his [or her] impartiality seriously and to sway his [or her] judgment.”', 'In re Jermaine H., 9 A.3d 1227, 1230 (R.I. 2010).', 'The party carries a “substantial burden” to demonstrate that “facts present such that it would be ‘reasonable for members of the public or a litigant or counsel to question the trial justice’s impartiality.’” Id. (quoting In re Antonio, 612 A.2d 650, 653 (R.I. 1992)).', 'We note that, irrespective of her pro se status, Albanese was a recalcitrant litigant whose disruptive behavior ultimately led to her removal from the courtroom by a court deputy. The trial justice tolerated multiple interruptions by Albanese that never would have been allowed from a member of the bar. Contrary to Albanese’s assertion of discriminatory treatment, our review of the transcripts before us reveals that the trial justice exercised commendable courtesy and patience in her interactions with Albanese. The trial justice went to great lengths to make exceptions for Albanese’s behavior, to elucidate the litigation process, and to help Albanese', '-9- clarify her arguments before the court. In so doing, the trial justice expressed concern about the admitted challenges that pro se litigants face when trying cases that even seasoned attorneys may struggle with and urged Albanese to retain new counsel. We are satisfied that these comments did not evidence discrimination. To the extent that Albanese suggests her pro se status entitles her to anything more than fairness and courtesy, she is mistaken.', 'Albanese has failed to support her allegation that the trial justice ordered defendants to move for summary judgment and that this in turn revealed personal prejudice or bias. Albanese did not submit a copy of the transcript in which the trial justice first broached the issue of summary judgment, and a bare, unsupported allegation is insufficient to meet the heavy burden imposed on a party seeking appellate review on this issue. Moreover, when the trial justice denied the motion to recuse, she set forth on the record that she had not ordered defendants to move for summary judgment but rather had set a timeline for defendants to file dispositive motions in an effort to move forward this long-stagnant civil action. See, e.g., Boucher, 571 A.2d at 37 (The court must “maintain a firm schedule * * * in order to keep the flow of trials moving in such manner as to * * * make certain that the cases on the calendar move smoothly toward resolution either by trial or settlement.”). There simply is no evidence to support Albanese’s claims before the Superior Court that the trial justice was anything but patiently appropriate and abundantly fair with the pro se litigant. The motion to recuse is wholly without merit.', 'On appeal before this Court, Albanese further contends that, after submitting her written motion to the Superior Court on January 13, 2014, but before the January 31 hearing, she learned that the trial justice’s husband allegedly works in law enforcement; thus, Albanese concludes he may interact with Sgt. Favreau during the course of his employment. Based on this allegation,', '- 10 - according to Albanese, the trial justice should have recused herself. Albanese claims that she had not had this purported information available to her before filing, but that she would have raised the issue had the trial justice allowed her to address the court before ruling on the recusal motion. However, because such a decision rests squarely within the Superior Court justice’s discretion, the court is not obliged to permit oral argument. See Ryan v. Roman Catholic Bishop of Providence, 941 A.2d 174, 188 (R.I. 2008). And even if Albanese had the opportunity to address the court on the subject, oral argument is not an appropriate forum for raising new issues not previously briefed. See Zinniel v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 883 F.2d 1350, 1356 n.8 (7th Cir. 1989).', 'Nonetheless, Albanese’s claim of a conflict based on the trial justice’s husband’s employment is without merit. Albanese relies on mere conjecture to suggest that Sgt. Favreau may have interacted with the trial justice’s husband, and the asserted connection between Sgt. Favreau and the trial justice is so attenuated that any inference of impartiality is fantastical. We live in an era in which both partners to a marriage frequently pursue separate careers. The notion that, standing alone, a trial justice’s allegiance rests with her husband’s occupation rather than the responsibilities and duties of her position reeks of a bygone age.', 'IV. Grants of Summary Judgment', 'Lastly, Albanese contends that the trial justice erred by granting summary judgment in favor of defendants. This Court views summary judgment as an “extreme remedy” that “should be granted only when ‘the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.’” Stewart v. Sheppard, 885', '- 11 - A.2d 715, 719 (R.I. 2005) (quoting Plunkett v. State, 869 A.2d 1185, 1187 (R.I. 2005)). Accordingly, the Court has noted that:', '“The function of the motion justice considering a proposed', 'summary-judgment motion is not to cull out the weak cases from', 'the herd of lawsuits waiting to be tried. Rather, only if the case is', 'legally dead on arrival should the court take the drastic step of', 'administering last rites by granting summary judgment.” Mitchell', 'v. Mitchell, 756 A.2d 179, 185 (R.I. 2000).', 'Still, this extraordinary remedy is appropriate when the nonmoving party relies only on “mere allegations or denials in the pleadings, conclusory statements, or legal opinions” to sustain the action. O’Brien v. Laroche, 711 A.2d 1125, 1127 (R.I. 1998). To ward off summary judgment, the nonmoving party must “set forth specific facts.” Lynch v. Spirit Rent-A-Car, Inc., 965 A.2d 417, 424 (R.I. 2009) (quoting Providence Journal Co. v. Convention Center Authority, 774 A.2d 40, 46 (R.I. 2001)).', 'Reviewing the grant of summary judgment de novo, this Court “appl[ies] the same standards as those used by the trial court.” Kinder v. Westcott, 107 A.3d 321, 324 (R.I. 2015) (quoting Hazard v. East Hills, Inc., 45 A.3d 1262, 1268 (R.I. 2012)). Like the trial court, we construe “the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,” id. (quoting Long v. Dell, Inc., 93 A.3d 988, 995 (R.I. 2014)), and do not “pass[] upon the weight or credibility of the evidence,” Reniere v. Gerlach, 752 A.2d 480, 482 (R.I. 2000).', 'Because Albanese challenges the grants of summary judgment on each of the six counts of the complaint, we address them seriatim. We first consider her dual claim for assault and battery, which alleges the use of excessive force during an arrest by defendant police officers. We analyze this claim through the lens of excessive-force jurisprudence under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. See Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 395 (1989).', '- 12 -', 'The Fourth Amendment guarantees “[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons * * * against unreasonable * * * seizures.” A police officer’s application of excessive force during an arrest violates that right, regardless of whether the force was exercised in good faith. See Graham, 490 U.S. at 396-97. The determination of whether the level of force used by an arresting officer was objectively reasonable—and thus not impermissibly excessive—under the Fourth Amendment demands “a careful balancing of the ‘nature and quality of the intrusion on the individual’s Fourth Amendment interests’ against the countervailing governmental interests at stake.” Id. at 396 (quoting Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.S. 1, 8 (1985)).', 'The balancing test of objective reasonableness is inherently “fact-intensive,” because it “depends on ‘the facts and circumstances of each particular case.’” Newman v. Guedry, 703 F.3d 757, 761 (5th Cir. 2012) (quoting Graham, 490 U.S. at 396). Factors to consider “includ[e] the severity of the crime at issue, whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others, and whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.” Graham, 490 U.S. at 396. “In other words, the factfinder must determine whether, in light of the totality of the circumstances faced by the arresting officer, the amount of force used was objectively reasonable at the time.” Amnesty America v. Town of West Hartford, 361 F.3d 113, 123 (2d Cir. 2004) (Sotomayor, J.) (emphasis added). Therefore, “[g]iven the fact-specific nature of the inquiry, granting summary judgment against a plaintiff on an excessive[-]force claim is not appropriate unless no reasonable factfinder could conclude that the officers’ conduct was objectively unreasonable.” Id.; see also Gregory v. County of Maui, 523 F.3d 1103, 1106 (9th Cir. 2008) (“[S]ummary judgment * * * ‘should be granted sparingly’ in cases involving claims of excessive force.” quoting Drummond v. City of Anaheim, 343 F.3d 1052, 1056 (9th Cir. 2003)).', '- 13 -', 'Turning to the case at bar, we note that the evidence before the Superior Court on summary judgment was sparse. Because Albanese had failed to produce any materials in support of her objection to the motion for summary judgment before the hearing on January 31, 2014,7 the material before the Superior Court was limited to the documents submitted by defendants— the police report and Albanese’s interrogatory responses. Our careful review of the allegations in Albanese’s pleading and her answers to the interrogatories reveals that Albanese focuses her excessive-force claim only on the events that transpired from the time she exited her vehicle to when she arrived with Sgt. Favreau and Lt. Sutton at her apartment. Lieutenant Sutton, who recounted this interaction in a narrative contained in the police report, indicated that Albanese had been sitting in her car with her dog at the officers’ direction just before the events in question occurred. According to Lt. Sutton:', '“[Sergeant] Favreau * * * advised Albanese that she was going to', 'be arrested * * *. Albanese continued to yell and became more', 'agitated. [Sergeant] Favreau asked [Albanese] if she would like to', 'put the dog in the apartment or leave it in the car for the time', 'being. She continued to shout and after being asked a second time', 'she grabbed the dog by the collar and began to walk toward the', 'apartment. [Sergeant] Favreau and I followed her to her apartment', 'door. She opened the door and began to walk inside.”', 'Albanese tells a different tale. According to the answers Albanese provided to defendants’ interrogatories, Sgt. Favreau “yank[ed] [her] out of the car and put [her] jacket overhead. The other officer raised [her] other arm and dragged [her] to [her] apartment.” The differences in the accounts are substantial, since Lt. Sutton’s narrative does not mention that he 7', 'After summary judgment was granted in this case, Albanese filed with the court her own sworn affidavit and two letters from physicians, along with a handwritten note. Since these materials were not properly before the Superior Court at the time of summary judgment, we decline to consider them.', '- 14 - and Sgt. Favreau physically escorted Albanese from her car to her apartment—the allegation giving rise to the crux of Albanese’s claim of excessive force.', 'Viewing these competing narratives in the light most favorable to Albanese, we now apply the fact-specific balancing test required for determining whether Sgt. Favreau and Lt. Sutton’s actions were objectively reasonable under the circumstances. Here, Albanese was under arrest for simple assault for having “charged” into Arrico. Albanese, 970 A.2d at 1217 n.2. Neither Arrico nor the other witnesses interviewed at the scene by the officers had suggested that Albanese had used a weapon or any other deadly force. There is no evidence that the car was running or that Albanese was attempting to flee at the time of the arrest. Thus, when viewed in the light most favorable to Albanese, the officers had no objective reason to believe that Albanese’s presence in the car posed an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or the public or that she was trying to flee the scene. Although Lt. Sutton asserts that Albanese was “agitated” and “shout[ing],” nothing on the summary-judgment record implies that she was trying to resist arrest or threatening physical violence.', 'Although scant, the evidence in this case raised a genuine dispute as to the propriety of the officers’ use of force, if such force in fact was used. These are jury questions. A reasonable jury could accept Albanese’s account over the contradictory narrative provided by Lt. Sutton and infer that the level of force applied by the officers was excessive in light of the circumstances. Accordingly, the assault-and-battery claim was not fit for resolution by summary judgment.', 'None of Albanese’s other claims withstand summary judgment. Her false-arrest claim fails because “[t]he existence of probable cause is a complete defense.” Horton v. Portsmouth Police Department, 22 A.3d 1115, 1122 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Henshaw v. Doherty, 881 A.2d 909, 919 (R.I. 2005)).', 'An officer has probable cause to arrest a suspect “when the facts and', '- 15 - circumstances within the police officer’s knowledge and of which he has reasonably trustworthy information are sufficient to warrant a reasonable person’s belief that a crime has been committed and that the person to be arrested has committed the crime.” Id. (quoting State v. Girard, 799 A.2d 238, 249 (R.I. 2002)).', 'According to Lt. Sutton’s narrative, the officers were dispatched to Driftwood after receiving a report that Albanese had assaulted Arrico and fled the scene. Upon their locating Albanese on a nearby street, Albanese immediately approached Lt. Sutton and asked, “Did he call the cops on me? All we did was bump into each other * * *.” Shortly thereafter, she changed her story and said it was Arrico who had “‘banged’ into her.” Once back at Driftwood, officers spoke to Arrico and another witness who confirmed Arrico’s account that Albanese, unprovoked, had “‘rushed past’ him, got about three feet in front of him[,] * * * turned and looked at him[,] * * * ‘lifted her hand and lunged [her] body [and] shoulders at [him] to knock [him] down.’” As the officers attempted to question the witnesses, Albanese repeatedly yelled and exited her car, despite having been ordered by the officers “to stay by her vehicle.”8 The consistent statements of Arrico and the other witnesses, Albanese’s admission—before even being questioned by the officers—that a physical contact between Arrico and herself had occurred, and her erratic behavior all demonstrated the existence of probable cause to arrest Albanese for simple assault. Summary judgment therefore was appropriate.', 'Albanese’s claims of gross negligence and misconduct also fail. She alleges that defendants harassed and intimidated her. However, there is no evidence on the summary- judgment record to back this contention, except her general allegations in the complaint and the 8', 'Albanese later returned to the vehicle, where she was sitting just before the interaction giving rise to the assault-and-battery claim allegedly occurred.', '- 16 - conclusory statement in her answer to defendants’ interrogatories that the civilian defendants “constantly belittled [her] and made fun of [her] handicaps and [her] efforts on behalf of the other tenants who were suffering [as a result of] the mold caused by the management.” She identifies no specific instances of harassment or intimidation, nor does she name or describe the persons who allegedly harassed her. There was no triable issue of fact with respect to this count.9', 'The negligence per se claim for defendants’ purported failure to uphold and enforce state and municipal codes related to mold fares no better. Albanese’s claim is doomed by her own assertions in her pleading and interrogatory answers, in which she assails defendants for condemning her apartment as a result of the mold. This admission, combined with the absence of any evidence beyond her conclusory allegations that defendants failed to respond to her complaints, defeats her claim on summary judgment. Since Albanese’s claim for the intentional infliction of emotional distress is predicated on the alleged failure of defendants to respond to her complaints of mold, this claim suffers the same fate.', 'Albanese’s claim for punitive damages similarly fails. Punitive damages are available to a plaintiff “only when a defendant’s conduct requires deterrence and punishment over and above that provided in an award of compensatory damages, such as when a defendant ‘act[s] with malice or in bad faith.’” Pier House Inn, Inc. v. 421 Corp., 812 A.2d 799, 803 (R.I. 2002) (quoting Palmisano v. Toth, 624 A.2d 314, 318 (R.I. 1993)). Even on her reinstated claim for 9', 'In her response to defendants’ interrogatories, Albanese averred that reports by the building inspector and the Narragansett Police Department constituted the only evidence aside from her interrogatory answers to support her allegation of harassment and intimidation by defendants. Albanese declared that the reports “indicate an obsessive concern with the activities of the handicapped and elderly tenants of the Driftwood Apartments.” The reports were not on the record before the Superior Court or even before this Court on appeal. Nonetheless, based on Albanese’s description, it is unlikely that they would have furthered her claim even had they properly been before the Superior Court on summary judgment.', '- 17 - assault and battery for excessive police force, Albanese has failed to make such a showing. The arrest was proper. Albanese has alleged only that Sgt. Favreau and Lt. Sutton “yank[ed]” her out of her car, pulled her jacket over her head, and “dragged” her to her apartment. Even when viewed in the light most favorable to Albanese, the actions alleged are insufficient to support an award of punitive damages.', 'Conclusion', 'In conclusion, for the reasons set forth herein, the plaintiff’s appeal is sustained in part and denied in part. We vacate the judgment of the Superior Court with respect to its grant of summary judgment on the plaintiff’s claim of assault and battery and affirm the judgment in all other respects.

58,"Power Test Realty Company Limited : Partnership v. : Janet Coit, in her official capacity as : Director of the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management.",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. The discovery of petroleum in groundwater has led to a dispute that has brought the parties before this Court. This case comes before us pursuant to a writ of certiorari filed by Power Test Realty Company Limited Partnership (Power Test), whereby it sought relief from a Superior Court judgment that affirmed the final decision of the Department of Environmental Management (DEM or department) in a contested enforcement action. Power Test contends that the Superior Court erred in imposing liability upon it because: (1) there was no evidence that it caused the discharge of petroleum; (2) the evidence demonstrating that it had knowledge of the leaching petroleum was insufficient to cloak it with liability; and (3) it owns only a portion of the contaminated site and there was no evidence that the petroleum on a nearby parcel originated from the Power Test property. For the reasons set 1', 'Since the origination of this case, Janet Coit replaced W. Michael Sullivan as director of the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management. Thus, she has been substituted as a party and the case caption has been modified to reflect this change.', '-1- forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court and quash the writ of certiorari heretofore issued.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The facts of this case are largely undisputed, gleaned predominantly from the stipulation of facts before the DEM hearing officer. Power Test is the owner of property located at the intersection of Dunellen Road and Dexter Road in East Providence, Rhode Island, more precisely identified as East Providence Assessor’s Map No. 204, Block No. 1, Parcels No. 9 and 11 (the Power Test property). There are four pipelines installed in and below the Power Test property, which are owned by Getty Properties Corporation (GPC) 2 and operated by Getty Petroleum Marketing, Inc. (GPM). 3 Power Test neither owns nor operates any of the pipelines. In 1975, two of the four pipelines were shut down, capped off, and filled with “slurry,” rendering them inactive. The two remaining pipelines (the active pipelines) were operated by GPC from 1975 until March 1997, when GPM took over operation until April 2003. The active pipelines were used to transport unleaded refined gasoline, No. 2 home heating fuel oil, and diesel fuel.', 'Groundwater monitoring well OW-0102A is positioned in Dunellen Road, which is located between Parcel No. 15 to the north and Power Test’s Parcel No. 11 to the south. Parcel No. 15 is owned by Capital Terminal Company, Inc. (CTC).', 'On March 22, 2002, Pare Engineering Corporation, a consultant to CTC, observed a petroleum substance, known as Light Non-Aqueous Phase Liquid (LNAPL), in groundwater monitoring well OW-0102A. 2', 'Notably, GPC is the general partner of Power Test. 3', 'GPC operated these active pipelines from 1985 to 1997, when their operation was taken over by GPM. GPM shut down operation of the active pipelines in 2003.', '-2-', 'As a result of this detection, in early April 2002, GPM hired Tyree Organization Ltd. (Tyree) to conduct excavation activities along the pipeline easement in Parcel No. 11 to investigate the potential for a release of LNAPL from its pipelines. During these excavation activities, all pipelines were found to be in excellent condition, with no visible signs of corrosion or pitting. In addition, there was no staining and no olfactory or visible evidence of any release found beneath the exposed portions of the active pipelines. The active pipelines were also subjected to pressure tests and, after the pipelines passed these tests, DEM granted GPM the approval to recommence use of the pipelines. In addition, a set of tests were conducted by two separate environmental entities, whereby samples of LNAPL from monitoring well OW-0102A were collected and compared to gasoline samples from the GPM bulk storage tank that fed the active pipelines. The results from both entities demonstrated that the samples collected from monitoring well OW-0102A were “distinctly different” from the gasoline samples collected from the GPM storage tank.', 'However, GPM was not the only party performing tests as a result of the LNAPL discovery. Vanasse Hangen Brustlin (VHB), another consultant hired by CTC, also tested a sample of petroleum product taken from monitoring well OW-0102A and compiled a report 4 (the VHB report) which it submitted to DEM in September 2002. The appendix to this report indicated that laboratory analysis of the petroleum sample taken from monitoring well OW- 0102A indicated that the substance was a weathered leaded automotive gasoline.', 'Following DEM’s receipt of the VHB report, it issued a “Letter of Responsibility” to GPC in December 2002, 5 which indicated that the VHB report identified the GPC pipelines as 4', 'This report was a public filing to which all parties had access. 5', 'Power Test conceded at oral argument that GPM, GPC, and Power Test are all interrelated and that notice to one entity may be construed as notice to all entities.', '-3- the “likely source” of the petroleum in the groundwater, classified GPC as a “Responsible Party,” and directed GPC to comply with certain remediation regulations. In response, GPC issued a letter to DEM denying liability for the LNAPL pollution, stating that because the active pipelines had been tested and determined to not be the source of the release, it was not in violation of any Oil Pollution Control (OPC) Regulations. 6 On that basis, GPC stated that DEM did not have the authority at that time to require it to engage in the remediation conduct outlined in the letter of responsibility. Thereafter, on July 21, 2003, DEM sent a “Notice of Intent to Enforce” to Power Test, GPC, and GPM. This notice stated that the property remained out of compliance, that the parties were required to comply with certain remediation regulations, and that the failure to comply with such regulations would result in the issuance of a formal enforcement action and the assessment of an administrative penalty. 7', 'On July 28, 2005, DEM’s Office of Compliance and Inspection issued a “Notice of Violation” (NOV) to Power Test, GPC, and GPM for the detection of LNAPL in the groundwater at the Power Test Property (Parcels No. 9 and 11) and the CTC property (Parcel No. 15), referred to by the NOV as “the Site.” The NOV asserted that the parties were in violation of certain provisions of the Rhode Island Water Pollution Control Act (WPA), DEM regulations promulgated thereunder, and DEM Remediation Regulations. The NOV also stated that the parties were in violation of G.L. 1956 § 46-12.5.1-3 of the Oil Pollution Control Act (OPCA) and Sections 6(a) and 12(b) of the OPC regulations. Based upon these violations, DEM ordered Power Test, GPC, and GPM to investigate and remediate the LNAPL detected at the site, and they were assessed a $50,000 administrative penalty. 6', 'This letter also stated that Power Test was the owner of the pipeline property and that GPM was the operator of the pipelines. The letter did, however, identify Power Test as an affiliate of GPC. 7', 'A letter sent to DEM on behalf of GPC and Power Test stated that the parties expected GPM to take primary responsibility for responding to the notice of intent to enforce.', '-4-', 'The parties timely appealed the NOV to DEM’s Administrative Adjudication Division. After some discovery was conducted and an evidentiary hearing was held, the DEM hearing officer issued a recommended decision that was affirmed as a final decision by the Director of DEM. 8 In his decision, the hearing officer found that there was no evidence that there had been a discharge or release of petroleum from the active pipelines on the site and that the parties did not cause the initial release of the petroleum onto the premises. The hearing officer further found that the petroleum product was “leaching” through a deep aquifer in and below the Power Test property. In addition, the hearing officer found that “[t]he presence of the petroleum product in the groundwater was made known to [Power Test, GPC, and GPM] on or after March 22, 2002.” Based upon these findings, among others, the hearing officer dismissed the violations cited under the WPA and the remediation regulations as to all of the parties. In addition, the hearing officer concluded that GPC and GPM were not in violation of the OPCA and OPC regulations.', 'The same did not hold true for Power Test.', 'According to DEM, the failure of a landowner to remediate oil contamination upon notice of its discovery renders the landowner liable under the OPCA for a continuing discharge regardless of whether the petroleum was released by a prior owner of the property. Accordingly, DEM ordered Power Test to remediate the site—including both the Power Test property and the CTC property—and imposed a $50,000 administrative penalty.', 'On January 20, 2010, Power Test appealed the DEM decision to the Providence County Superior Court pursuant to the Rhode Island Administrative Procedures Act (APA), G.L. 1956 § 42-35-15(g). After briefing and oral argument, the hearing justice issued a decision in which he 8', 'An amended recommended decision was affirmed by the Director of DEM on December 23, 2009, which contained a recalculation of the administrative penalty.', '-5- determined that the DEM decision was supported by “reliable, probative, and substantial evidence” and was not clearly erroneous, arbitrary, or capricious. In addition, the hearing justice found that the substantial rights of Power Test were not prejudiced. Accordingly, the hearing justice affirmed the decision of DEM. Power Test sought relief from the Superior Court’s judgment through a writ of certiorari, which this Court granted on February 12, 2014.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'The dispute comes before us as a result of our issuance of a writ of certiorari pursuant to § 42-35-16 of the APA, whereby Power Test claims to be aggrieved by a final judgment of the Superior Court in an administrative agency appeal. In accordance with § 42-35-16, our review of the judgment of the Superior Court in administrative proceedings is limited to questions of law. Iselin v.

First, it claims that the DEM’s interpretation of the OPCA is clearly erroneous because—according to Power Test— causation is required under the statute. Second, Power Test asserts that DEM’s finding that it had knowledge of petroleum leaching under its property was not supported by the evidence. Last, Power Test claims that it should not be liable for the petroleum under the CTC property because there was no evidence that the petroleum originated from the Power Test property. We address each of these arguments seriatim.', 'A', 'Causation', '1. Statutory Interpretation', 'Power Test asserts that the OPCA does not impose liability upon a landowner that did not cause the initial discharge of contaminants and, thus, DEM’s interpretation of the OPCA is clearly erroneous. In support, it contends that the definition of “discharge” requires an entry of oil “into the environment,” and that the term “into” can be understood only in the context of an', '-7- initial point of contact between the oil and the environment. In addition, Power Test argues that DEM’s interpretation would render the Rhode Island Industrial Property Remediation and Reuse Act (IPRRA) meaningless. Resting on its own interpretation that it must have caused the initial discharge to be liable, Power Test claims that the determination that it violated the OPCA and OPC regulations was improper based on DEM’s factual findings that (i) there was no evidence of a discharge or release of petroleum from the active pipelines on the site, and (ii) Power Test did not cause the initial release of the petroleum onto the premises.', 'Before scrutinizing the OPCA’s prohibition against oil pollution as it might apply to passive conduct, we pause to paint the backdrop against which we conduct our review. In prohibiting oil pollution via the OPCA, the General Assembly specifically provided that, “[t]he citizens of this state should not have to bear the burdens of the cleanup and the losses of economic livelihood that result from the discharge of oil in any degree[.]” Section 46-12.5.1- 6(a)(2). The pronouncement of such a policy stems from the Rhode Island Constitution, which provides, in pertinent part, that:', '“[I]t shall be the duty of the general assembly to provide for the conservation of', 'the air, land, water, plant, animal, mineral and other natural resources of the state,', 'and to adopt all means necessary and proper by law to protect the natural', 'environment of the people of the state by providing adequate resource planning', 'for the control and regulation of the use of the natural resources of the state and', 'for the preservation, regeneration and restoration of the natural environment of the', 'state.” R.I. Const. art. 1, sec. 17. Emanating from this constitutional provision, the OPCA’s prohibition against oil pollution combines the need to conserve natural resources and protect the environment with the desire to protect the citizens of this state.', 'With the stage now set, we begin our analysis of the specific statutory provision at issue. In conducting our review of an administrative agency’s interpretation of a statute, we must first', '-8- determine whether the statutory provision at issue is clear and unambiguous. Where a statute is clear and unambiguous, the agency is not being called upon to interpret the statute in any respect; thus, our review is de novo. In re Proposed Town of New Shoreham Project, 25 A.3d 482, 504- 05 (R.I. 2011). Conversely, “[i]f a statute’s requirements ‘are unclear or subject to more than one reasonable interpretation, the construction given by the agency charged with its enforcement is entitled to weight and deference as long as that construction is not clearly erroneous or unauthorized.’” Duffy v. Powell, 18 A.3d 487, 490 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Swindell, 895 A.2d 100, 105 (R.I. 2006)). At the outset, we note that our review of the statutory framework at issue in this case reveals that one provision is clear and unambiguous, while another is ambiguous; therefore, DEM’s interpretation of the ambiguous provision is entitled to deference. We discuss each provision in turn.', 'The OPCA provides that “[n]o person shall discharge, cause to be discharged, or permit the discharge of oil into, or upon the waters or land of the state except by regulation or by permit from the director.” Section 46-12.5.1-3(a). Any person who violates this provision is held strictly liable to the state for such violation. Section 46-12.5.1-3(b). In reading this prohibition, we do not ignore the fact that the Legislature thought it appropriate to prohibit a person from permitting a discharge in addition to prohibiting a person from causing a discharge. We note that “[t]his court has long applied a canon of statutory interpretation which gives effect to all of a statute’s provisions, with no sentence, clause or word construed as unmeaning or surplusage.” Rhode Island Department of Mental Health, Retardation & Hospitals v. R.B., 549 A.2d 1028, 1030 (R.I. 1988). Because the term “cause” is already explicitly included within the statute, it would be illogical to interpret the term “permit” to also include an element of causation. Rather, contrary to Power Test’s assertion, we find it clear and unambiguous that the term “permit” can', '-9- be understood to convey a meaning of passive conduct in which a person allows the discharge of oil to occur. 9', 'However, the Legislature’s use of the passive term “permit” does not end the matter: for liability to follow, the statute also requires the landowner to “permit the discharge of oil.” Section 46-12.5.1-3(a) (emphasis added). The OPCA defines discharge as “any spilling, leaking, pumping, pouring, emitting, emptying, releasing, injecting, escaping, leaching, dumping, or disposing into the environment[.]” Section 46-12.5.1-1(9). As we explain below, the OPCA’s definition of discharge is ambiguous, in that it is unclear whether the phrase “leaching * * * into the environment” can apply to passive conduct on the part of a landowner.', 'The hearing justice defined “leaching,” in pertinent part, as “the migration of contaminating materials, by rain or groundwater, from a fixed source, such as a landfill.” Power Test Realty Co., No. PC 10-404, 2011 WL3957619, at *5 (R.I. Super. Sept. 1, 2011) (quoting Black’s Law Dictionary 969 (9th ed. 2009)). Importantly, this definition does not require any conduct by the landowner. Indeed, contaminants can migrate by rain or groundwater without any involvement by the landowner. We also note that the definition presented requires that the contamination migrate “from a fixed source.”', 'Notably, the “fixed source” from which a contaminant flows need not be some man-made structure, such as a pipeline or storage tank. Instead, the landowner’s property itself may be the fixed source from which a contaminant migrates, thus “leaching” into another’s property. 9', 'Indeed, the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language defines the term “permit” (in the pertinent definitional category) as “[t]o allow the doing of (something); consent to[.]” The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 1309 (4th ed. 2009). Consequently, the term “permit” encompasses the passive allowance of the discharge of oil. By like token, this definition cannot be interpreted to include an element of causation.', '- 10 -', 'Concluding, as we do, that this statutory provision is ambiguous, we follow the well- settled rule that the construction given by the administrative agency charged with its enforcement—here, DEM—“is entitled to weight and deference;” thus, we will overturn its construction only if “clearly erroneous or unauthorized.”', 'Duffy, 18 A.3d at 490 (quoting Swindell, 895 A.2d at 105). The hearing justice, like the DEM hearing officer, interpreted the word “leaching” within the definition of “discharge” to carry a meaning of passiveness, so as to include contaminants moving within and throughout the soil. See Power Test Realty Co., 2011 WL3957619, at *6. The definition of “leaching” upon which the hearing justice relied defined the term as the “process by which moving fluid separates the soluble components of a material * * * [and] is sometimes used to describe the migration of contaminating materials, by rain or groundwater, from a fixed source, such as a landfill.” Id. at *5 (quoting Black’s Law Dictionary at 969). The hearing justice then found that “contaminants ‘leach into’—or ‘to the inside of’— the land when they ‘passively migrate’ within it.” Id. at *6. Likewise, the hearing justice determined that leaching into the environment could include passive migration through the soil, regardless of whether that migration originated from within the soil or from some other source of the landowner. Id. In our opinion, the hearing justice’s explication of the DEM hearing officer’s construction of the statute is sound; thus, we cannot conclude that such construction by the agency is clearly erroneous.', 'Nevertheless, because the definition of discharge under the OPCA requires that it be “into the environment,” Power Test contends that the term “discharge” includes only the initial point of contact between the contaminant and the environment. However, Power Test’s narrow view of the phrase “into the environment” forces it to misconstrue the provision as a whole. It is a well-settled principle of statutory interpretation that an isolated part of a particular statute cannot', '- 11 - be viewed in a vacuum; rather, each word and phrase must be considered in the context of the entire statutory provision. See In re Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights, 472 A.2d 1211, 1212 (R.I. 1984) (“[I]n situations in which a particular statutory provision is part of a single statutory scheme, the legislative intent must be gathered from an examination of the entire statute rather than from one part only.”). As such, the phrase “into the environment” cannot be interpreted without considering the list of preceding verbs—namely, “spilling, leaking, pumping, pouring, emitting, emptying, releasing, injecting, escaping, leaching, dumping, or disposing * * *.” Section 46-12.5.1-1(9). In effect, what we are left to interpret is whether a contaminant can “leach[] * * * into the environment,” id., when that contaminant has already escaped its original source and is now present within the soil. While a contaminant that has escaped its original source has moved “into the environment,” subsequent movement of the contaminant throughout the soil would also result in the contaminant migrating “into the environment.” Thus, we conclude that, within our statutory framework, a contaminant that is present within the soil and continues to migrate throughout the soil is “leaching * * * into the environment.” 10 Accordingly, we hold that the Superior Court did not err in determining that Power Test permitted a discharge when a contaminant in and below its property “leach[ed] * * * into the environment.”', '2. The Industrial Property Remediation and Reuse Act (IPRRA)', 'Power Test also asserts that the Superior Court’s interpretation of the OPCA imposing liability without causation was clearly erroneous because it renders the IPRRA’s petroleum exclusion meaningless. In support, Power Test contends that the IPRRA imposes strict liability 10', 'Power Test makes a similar argument with regard to the OPC regulations. Specifically, Power Test claims that Section 5 and Section 6(a) of the OPC regulations prohibit conduct that causes or creates a risk of oil being introduced into the environment. However, as we pointed out in our discussion of the OPCA, we conclude that a contaminant that continues to migrate throughout the soil is progressing “into the environment” and, thus, we find this argument unconvincing.', '- 12 - for a release of hazardous materials, but specifically excludes virgin or unused petroleum from the definition of hazardous materials. According to Power Test, such an exception illustrates a legislative intent to subject nonvirgin or used petroleum releases to liability without proof of causation, while exempting virgin or unused petroleum releases from such a scheme.', 'The IPRRA holds “responsible parties * * * strictly, jointly and severally liable for the actual or threatened release of any hazardous material * * *.” G.L. 1956 § 23-19.14-6(a). In defining “hazardous material,” the IPRRA provides: “Hazardous material does not include petroleum for the purposes of this chapter.” Section 23-19.14-3(c). Petroleum is defined as “any virgin petroleum product” including, inter alia, “[u]nused distillate and residual oil.” Section 23- 19.14-3(i).', ""“It is presumed that the General Assembly knows the ‘state of existing relevant law when it enacts or amends a statute.’” Retirement Board of Employees' Retirement System of Rhode Island v. DiPrete, 845 A.2d 270, 287 (R.I. 2004) (quoting Smith v. Retirement Board of the Employees' Retirement System, 656 A.2d 186, 189 (R.I. 1995)). Thus, we presume that, when the General Assembly enacted the OPCA in 1997 (P.L. 1997, ch. 32, §2), it was fully aware that the IPRRA (enacted in 1995 by P.L. 1995, ch. 187, §1), included a provision exempting certain petroleum products from liability. However, rather than implying an element of causation as Power Test suggests, the General Assembly’s awareness of the IPRRA merely illustrates that, if it intended to exempt virgin or unused petroleum products from liability without proof of causation in the OPCA, then it would have expressed it as it did in the IPRRA."", 'Moreover, we note that the Superior Court’s interpretation of the OPCA imposing liability without causation does not render the IPRRA’s petroleum exclusion meaningless.', '- 13 - Indeed, in enacting the IPRRA, the General Assembly included the following language within the statutory framework:', '“Responsible parties for releases of petroleum are defined as all parties who are', 'otherwise liable for an actual or threatened release of petroleum under any other', 'applicable statute, rule, or common law. This section shall neither be construed as', 'establishing new liabilities or obligations for parties responsible for releases of', 'petroleum that do not otherwise exist under statute, rule, or common law, nor as', 'diminishing any liabilities or obligations that may be established by those', 'provisions. Accordingly, the obligations of the responsible parties for releases of', 'petroleum shall be the same as those provided for under any other application,', 'provisions or rules of law.” Section 23-19.14-6.1 (emphasis added). Thus, the General Assembly’s intent in enacting the IPRRA was clear: it intended to exclude virgin and unused petroleum products from the IPRRA, while not allowing such a limitation to have an effect on liability under other statutory schemes. Accordingly, we find Power Test’s argument to the contrary unpersuasive.', '3. Persuasive Authority', 'Finally, Power Test claims that this Court should require proof of causation because other jurisdictions have so held based on their own environmental liability statutes, which Power Test claims are similar to Rhode Island’s OPCA. However, after careful review of these statutes, we conclude that they are inapposite to the OPCA. We explain briefly.', 'The statutory framework upon which Power Test most heavily relies is a West Virginia environmental liability statute that prohibits contamination in excess of certain groundwater quality standards. W. Va. Code R. § 47-57-4 (effective May 1, 1994). The West Virginia statute requires that remediation be undertaken by “[a]ny person who owns or operates a source subject to the Act which has caused, in whole or in part, the concentration of any constituent to exceed any applicable groundwater quality standard subject to the Act * * *.” W. Va. Code R. § 47-57- 4.1.

Va. Code R. § 47-57-2.13.', 'In construing these provisions, the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals noted that the “crucial question is whether [a] pre-existing contamination produced by a party unrelated to the landowner may be deemed a ‘source’ under the regulations.” Cookman Realty Group, Inc. v.

In assessing this question, the court recognized that “a landowner, in order to be deemed the owner of a ‘source,’ must be in control of a ‘facility’ or otherwise engaged in an ‘activity’ that causes such a release.” Id. at 299. Accordingly, the court concluded that “a landowner may not be deemed the owner of a ‘source’ of groundwater contamination * * * where it is demonstrate[d] that neither the landowner nor its predecessors in title were involved in originating such pollution.” Id. at 299-300.', 'Unlike West Virginia’s statutory framework, the Rhode Island OPCA does not require that the liable party be the same type of “source” that is required under the West Virginia statute. Instead, the OPCA prohibits contamination by any “person,” which it defines as “an individual, trust, firm, joint stock company, corporation (including a quasi government corporation), municipality, municipal or state agency, fire district, club, nonprofit agency, or country[.]” Section 46-12.5.1-1(8). Notably, this list of entities upon which liability may be imposed does not include the same requirement as the West Virginia statute, which requires that the “facility or activity * * * has caused a release or is reasonably likely to cause a release.” See W. Va. Code R. § 47-57-2.13 (emphasis added). While the plain language of the West Virginia statute unambiguously includes an element of causation, Cookman Realty Group, Inc., 566 S.E.2d at', '- 15 - 299-300, the OPCA contains no such requirement. 11 Therefore, the OPCA is distinguishable from the West Virginia statutory framework.', ""In addition, Power Test cites to a number of other jurisdictions that have determined that their environmental liability statutes do not include passive migration of contaminants already present in the environment. However, the statutory schemes in these jurisdictions are also distinguishable 12 from the OPCA in that those statutes explicitly require some nexus between the use of the substance by the responsible party and the resultant contamination. See, e.g., New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection v. Dimant, 14 A.3d 780, 788 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2011), aff'd as modified, 51 A.3d 816 (N.J. 2012) (determining that, under the New Jersey Spill Act, the definition of “discharge” which “explicitly refers to resultant ‘damage[s]’” makes plain that “some nexus between the use or discharge of a substance and its contamination of the surrounding area is needed to support a finding of Spill Act liability”). 11"", 'Moreover, while not the basis for the West Virginia Supreme Court’s decision in Cookman Realty Group, Inc. v. Taylor, 566 S.E.2d 294 (W. Va. 2002), the West Virginia environmental liability statute requires the person who owns or operates a “source” to have “caused, in whole or in part, the concentration of any constituent to exceed any applicable groundwater quality standard subject to the Act * * *.” W. Va. Code R. § 47-57-4.1. The OPCA contains no such requirement. Instead, the OPCA merely requires the “person” to “discharge, cause to be discharged, or permit the discharge” of a contaminant. G.L. 1956 § 46-12.5.1-3. 12', 'Admittedly, the statutory scheme in California to which Power Test draws our attention presents some level of semblance to the Rhode Island OPCA—yet, the California Court of Appeals has interpreted it to not include passive migration through the soil. See Consumer Advocacy Group, Inc. v. Exxon Mobil Corp., 128 Cal. Rptr. 2d 454, 459 (Cal. Ct. App. 2002) (“The[] definitions [of ‘discharge’ or ‘release’] * * * all convey movement out of a confined space such as a container, not, as plaintiff suggests, simply movement from one point to another—the concept implicit in its claim that ‘passive migration’ or ‘continued presence’ are embraced within the meanings of ‘discharge’ and ‘release’ * * *.”). Notwithstanding the construction injected upon the California statutory scheme by its courts, we decline to adopt a similar construction to the Rhode Island OPCA.', '- 16 -', 'In sum, despite Power Test’s vigorous and multifaceted argument to the contrary, we conclude that the Rhode Island OPCA is sufficiently broad as to prohibit the passive migration of a contaminant in and below a landowner’s property.', 'B', 'Power Test’s Knowledge of the Contamination', 'Power Test next contends that the Superior Court improperly affirmed DEM’s finding that it had knowledge of petroleum leaching under its property. Specifically, Power Test asserts that there was no evidence that it had knowledge of the petroleum on its property. Instead, it claims that the statement in the letter of responsibility that indicated that the pipelines were the “likely source of the petroleum” was too speculative to put it on notice of the petroleum leach. In addition, Power Test contends that any other evidence pointed to by the DEM hearing officer and the Superior Court to demonstrate notice merely showed that it had knowledge that there was petroleum in the groundwater of neighboring properties.', 'To be found in violation of the OPCA, DEM was required to prove that Power Test “permit[ted] the discharge of oil.” Section 46-12.5.1-3(a). In order to “permit” such a discharge, one must have knowledge of its occurrence and fail to take measures to remediate it. Importantly, Power Test’s knowledge of the contamination is a factual finding made by the DEM hearing officer and, as such, we afford such a finding great deference. Laprade, 94 A.3d at 513. In conducting our review, “[w]e do not weigh the evidence but merely ascertain whether the court was justified in rendering its judgment.”', ""Rhode Island Public Telecommunications Authority, 650 A.2d at 485. “Legally competent evidence is indicated by the presence of ‘some’ or ‘any’ evidence supporting the agency's findings.” Id.

Specifically, a letter of responsibility dated December 2, 2002, notified GPC, a general partner of Power Test, that there was petroleum found on an abutting property owned by CTC and that the pipelines on the Power Test property were the “likely source of the petroleum.” In addition, a notice of intent to enforce was issued to Power Test by DEM on July 21, 2003, in which DEM sought to compel Power Test to undertake a site investigation. Both of these documents cited to the VHB report—which Power Test had access to—as DEM’s basis for reaching this conclusion. In addition, DEM’s hearing officer made a finding of fact, that “[t]he presence of the petroleum product in the groundwater was made know[n] to [Power Test] on or after March 22, 2002.” Presumably, this finding was based upon the discovery of LNAPL in groundwater monitoring well OW-0102A and GPM’s investigation after notification of such discovery. Notably, the Power Test property was required to be excavated in order for GPM to perform this investigation. These facts represent “some” or “any” evidence to support the agency’s findings.', 'Nevertheless, Power Test complains that this evidence was too speculative. Distilled to their essence, Power Test’s arguments with regard to its knowledge of petroleum contamination are that none of the evidence conclusively proved to Power Test that the pipelines on its property were the source of the petroleum.', 'Instead, the notices indicated that the petroleum was discovered on neighboring property and that the pipelines were the “likely” or “probable” source', '- 18 - of the petroleum. According to Power Test, any other evidence presented to it merely proved that there was petroleum on neighboring property.', 'For Power Test to be aware that it was permitting a discharge, it need not be shown that Power Test knew to a certainty that a discharge was occurring beneath its property. Through two separate correspondences preceding the NOV, Power Test was informed by DEM that there was a contaminant discovered nearby and that its pipelines were the likely source of this contamination.', 'In addition, these correspondences indicated that DEM’s basis for such a conclusion was the VHB report that had been transmitted to it by CTC. An examination of the VHB report reveals that DEM’s conclusion that Power Test was the likely source was predicated upon the fact that the pipelines are upgradient of the LNAPL discovery and that the discovered LNAPL was found to have contained lead and that, based upon the age of the pipelines, it was probable that leaded gasoline was transported through them.', 'In light of this information, it is clear that Power Test had knowledge that it was permitting a discharge on its property. To say otherwise would enable Power Test to turn a blind eye to the probability of contamination merely because DEM had not informed Power Test that it was the definitive source of the contamination. We decline to allow such a result. Accordingly, we conclude that DEM’s finding that Power Test had knowledge that it was permitting a discharge of oil contaminants was supported by substantial evidence on the record. See, e.g., Rocha v. State Public Utilities Commission, 694 A.2d 722, 727 (R.I. 1997).', 'C', 'Evidence of Leaching onto the CTC Property', 'Similarly, Power Test contends that there was no evidence that the petroleum was leaching from the groundwater under the Power Test property into the groundwater under the', '- 19 - CTC property. Based upon this lack of evidence, Power Test contends that it should not be held liable for remediating the CTC property in addition to its own.', 'Power Test’s assertion is belied by the record. The VHB report provides evidence to support the DEM hearing officer’s conclusion that the Power Test property was the likely source of the petroleum contamination on the CTC property. The hearing officer’s basis for such a determination was twofold. First, the fact that the pipelines are upgradient of the LNAPL discovery suggests that the LNAPL traveled downslope to the CTC property. Second, the LNAPL that was sampled from the CTC property was found to have contained lead and, based upon the age of the pipelines, it was probable that leaded gasoline had been transported in the pipelines. This evidence alone is more than plentiful to satisfy the “some” or “any” evidence standard applied to the factual determinations of an administrative agency. See Rhode Island Public Telecommunications Authority, 650 A.2d at 485 (“Legally competent evidence is indicated by the presence of ‘some’ or ‘any’ evidence supporting the agency’s findings.” (quoting Strafach, 635 A.2d at 280)). Accordingly, we conclude that the Superior Court properly determined that DEM did not err in holding Power Test liable for remediating both its own property and the CTC property. 13 See Environmental Scientific Corp., 621 A.2d at 208 (“[A]n 13', 'Power Test also seems to indirectly suggest that it should not be held liable for the cleanup of land which it does not own. However, the OPCA prohibits “the discharge of oil into, or upon the waters or land of the state.” Section 46-12.5.1-3(a). Further, in enacting the OPCA, the Legislature recognized that, “[t]he citizens of this state should not have to bear the burdens of the cleanup and the losses of economic livelihood that result from the discharge of oil in any degree[.]” Section 46-12.5.1-6(a)(2). Based upon the language of the prohibition and the purpose of the statute, it is clear that the burden of cleanup should not fall upon the landowner to which the oil may have leached. Instead, the person who causes the discharge or permits the discharge of oil—here, Power Test—is liable for the remediation.', '- 20 - administrative decision can be vacated if it is clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence contained in the whole record.” (quoting Costa, 543 A.2d at 1309)).', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court and quash the writ of certiorari heretofore issued.

59,State : v. : Craig Van Dongen.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The defendant, Craig Van Dongen, was found guilty of domestic simple assault and domestic disorderly conduct by a Superior Court justice sitting without a jury. He now appeals from the judgment of conviction, arguing that the trial justice erred by: (1) overlooking and misconceiving material evidence; (2) failing to apply the correct burden of proof with respect to his claim of self-defense; (3) barring evidence and cross- examination as to motive and bias and abusing her discretion concerning a number of evidentiary rulings; and (4) denying his motion for a new trial. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided.', 'After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'A criminal information filed on June 20, 2012, charged defendant with assaulting Kristine Andrew with a dangerous weapon, to wit, a foot, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2 1 and G.L. 1956 § 12-29-5 2 (count 1) and “intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly” engaging in fighting, threatening, violent, or tumultuous behavior, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-45-1 3 and § 12-29-5 (count 2). The defendant waived his right to a jury trial, and a trial before a justice of the Superior Court commenced on April 23, 2013.', 'As in any case involving allegations of domestic assault, it is perhaps not surprising that the only percipient witnesses to the altercation were defendant and the complaining witness. Although both Ms. Andrew and defendant testified that an emotionally charged, physical altercation did in fact occur, they offered very differing versions of how it started and what exactly transpired.', 'Accordingly, the trial justice’s decision is largely predicated upon her credibility assessments. We deem it necessary, therefore, to summarize in some detail the unfortunate events as recounted by both Ms. Andrew and defendant—omitting, however, much of the expletive-laced epithets that each party claims the other copiously employed.', 'Ms. Andrew testified that she met defendant at the Kent County courthouse in 2006 when they were both involved in separate divorce proceedings. Shortly thereafter, the two began dating and saw each other four to five times a week. The relationship progressed and Ms. 1', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-5-2(a) reads, in pertinent part: “Every person who shall make an assault or battery, or both, with a dangerous weapon * * * or an assault or battery which results in serious bodily injury, shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than twenty (20) years.” 2', 'General Laws 1956 § 12-29-5 governs the disposition of domestic violence cases. 3', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-45-1(a)(1) reads, in part: “A person commits disorderly conduct if he or she intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly: * * *[e]ngages in fighting or threatening, or in violent or tumultuous behavior.”', '-2- Andrew, along with her two children, moved into defendant’s house. They lived together for two years, until Ms. Andrew and her children moved out in 2008 because, as described in Ms. Andrew’s testimony, there was “[d]ifficulty with the relationship.” Ms. Andrew further testified that she and defendant remained amicable and that they continued to date two to three times a month. In August 2009, however, their relationship ended for a period of approximately six months.', 'Ms. Andrew testified that the couple resumed dating when defendant visited Ms. Andrew at her parents’ house and proclaimed that “he couldn’t live without [her]. He said that he wanted to marry [her], and that he had changed, and he had sought counseling, and he * * * wanted to be together and enjoy [their lives] together and buy a home together and travel together.” On February 14, 2010, defendant proposed to Ms. Andrew and she accepted. In November of 2010, they moved into a house in North Kingstown, which defendant had purchased.', 'On January 13, 2012, the couple had an argument that led to the underlying charges against defendant. The facts of the altercation were very much in dispute at trial. Ms. Andrew testified that she and defendant had returned home from dinner and were watching television in the living room, when defendant “instigated an argument.” She explained that they “were watching TV, and [defendant] was packing for his [weekend] trip. And he started to complain about the house, and that it was a mess and complained that it was [her] fault and [her] children’s fault and yelled at [her].” Ms. Andrew testified that she refused to engage defendant and told defendant that she was going to bed. At approximately 11 or 11:30 p.m., she took out her contact lenses, went to bed, and fell asleep. Ms. Andrew described that sometime thereafter she was awakened when defendant “came to bed yelling.” She testified that defendant was yelling that the house was a mess and that it was her fault. Ms. Andrew asked defendant not to yell, but', '-3- he did not respond. He then said, “[h]ow much f’ng money is it going to take me to get rid of you?” Ms. Andrew testified that she told defendant, “I love you” and “[i]t’s not about the money.” Ms. Andrew stated that defendant then called her “a fucking whore” and exposed himself to her. She said that she was “afraid” and “shocked.”', 'Ms. Andrew testified that she got out of bed, picked up the suitcase defendant had packed for the weekend, and walked “toward the [bedroom] door to ask him to go sleep down in the basement [bedroom], because he was scaring [her],” but that defendant “jumped out of the bed and grabbed the bag.” Ms. Andrew added that defendant pushed her in her abdomen. She attempted to “slap [defendant] to make him stop,” but defendant “grabbed [her] and screamed, ‘I hate you * * *’ [and he] threw [her] down on the floor.” Ms. Andrew further testified that she landed on her left side and covered her face with her hands to protect herself while defendant held her down and punched her head, ear, and neck. Ms. Andrew also testified that defendant “was kicking [her] in the back, in the buttocks, [her] legs, [and her] ankle. He stomped on [her] hips. Then he punched [her] head some more.” She added that, while she was on the ground, defendant had been screaming, “I wish you were dead * * * I hate you.” She said she told defendant that “[she] was bleeding from [her] head and that [she] needed help,” but he responded, “[y]ou’re not hurt you fucking drama queen,” and he kicked her in the back “three, four more times” before it stopped. Thereafter, defendant left the room and Ms. Andrew crawled to her phone on the bureau and called 911.', 'Conversely, defendant testified that, around 11 p.m. on January 13, 2012, he and Ms. Andrew decided to watch a television program. He stated that Ms. Andrew had fallen asleep on the couch when he got up to pack his bags for the weekend because he was going to play tennis early the next morning and then travel to see his sister in Maine. After he packed his bags, he', '-4- woke Ms. Andrew to tell her “it was time for bed.” He said that he went to bed and then she came into the room and started arguing with him. He testified that he did not “recall how it actually got started, but [he] kn[ew] she was upset that [he] was going up to Maine by [him]self * * *.” The defendant said that, at approximately 1:30 a.m., he told Ms. Andrew that he “had to get up in the morning and [he] wanted some sleep. * * * [He] picked up [his] bags to leave the room, and she got up and just blocked the door.” He described Ms. Andrew’s stance as that of a “linebacker” who would not let him leave. He said Ms. Andrew told him, “we’re going to finish this,” so he put his bags down and got back into bed, while they continued to argue. According to defendant, they argued for a “couple of hours” primarily about his family, her drinking, and financial matters. The defendant testified that Ms. Andrew referred to his daughter and his former wife in derogatory terminology.', 'The defendant testified that, after arguing for another forty-five minutes, he got out of bed a second time and told Ms. Andrew that he had to go to sleep, but that she again blocked the door. He continued: “I was going to go downstairs. Um, I got out of bed, picked my bags up, * * * and that’s when she kind of came right up to me.” The defendant described Ms. Andrew as having “kind of a crazed look in her eye,” stating that “it was kind of a scary look that she gets.” He testified that she swung at him “with a closed fist.” He added:', '“She hit me with her right hand in my left eye. And she hit me so', 'hard that, um, I, I kind of blacked out momentarily. * * * I came', 'to, and she was swinging at me with her left hand, and at that point', 'I must have dropped the bags because I was able to deflect her', 'swing a little bit. And she didn’t hit me as hard with her left hand', 'as she did with the right.” The defendant continued: “I was pretty frightened at that point, and I punched her back with my right hand. I hit her above her left eye in the forehead. * * * I hit her hard.” He described punching her as a “reflex.” He stated that they continued to fight, describing it as a “wrestling', '-5- match.” He remembered that he “pushed her across the bed” and “she was wailing” on the floor. Thereafter, he left the room as he saw Ms. Andrew making a phone call.', 'A compact disc containing a recording of Ms. Andrew’s call to 911 was admitted into evidence at trial. During the call, Ms. Andrew acknowledged that she slapped defendant after he called her a “fucking whore.” She stated that, subsequently, defendant threw her to the floor. Throughout the call, Ms. Andrew reiterated that she was in pain.', 'Detective Jesse Jarvis 4 of the Town of North Kingstown Police Department and Lieutenant Ernest Robin, a paramedic for the Town of North Kingstown, were part of the team who responded to Ms. Andrew’s 911 call. At trial, Det. Jarvis stated that, when he arrived at the house, Ms. Andrew opened the door and was “hysterical.” “She was crying, bleeding, * * * seemed pretty out of it.” Detective Jarvis observed blood “[o]n the right side of her head,” describing that “she ha[d] light-colored blond hair, * * * it looked pretty bad.” He testified that Ms. Andrew told him that “her fianc[é] had beat her and kicked her, punched her, stomped on her.” Thereafter, Det. Jarvis searched the house for defendant and found him in a basement bedroom. Detective Jarvis testified that defendant told him, “I’m sorry, I hit her. I lost control. * * * She slapped me, so I hit her.”', 'Lieutenant Robin testified that, when he arrived at the scene, he noticed Ms. Andrew “was visibly upset, crying * * * she had some bleeding in * * * one of her ears.” He also observed that her right hand “was swollen and bruised distal from her wrist and then encompassed her thumb and forefinger.” He stated that he took Ms. Andrew to Rhode Island Hospital in an ambulance. 4', 'Detective Jarvis was a patrolman at the time he responded to the 911 call.', '-6-', 'Doctor Elizabeth Nestor, an attending physician at Rhode Island Hospital, testified at trial based on the medical records. She stated that she treated Ms. Andrew for “an ear contusion and lacerations, hand contusion, and ankle abrasion * * * and a leg contusion and a blow to the head.” Four days later, Ms. Andrew returned to the hospital complaining of blood in her urine. Doctor Francesca Lynne Beaudoin, an emergency physician at Rhode Island Hospital, testified that she treated Ms. Andrew for complaints of “hematuria, which is blood in the urine, and bruising to her flank, which is basically the side of her abdomen.” Doctor Beaudoin explained that Ms. Andrew “probably had suffered some minor bruising to her kidney,” and she believed that “the report of hematuria was related to trauma.”', 'Ms. Andrew’s therapist, Terry Giblin, and the couple’s therapist, Peter Olivieri, also testified at trial. However, the trial justice denied defendant’s request to question these witnesses on whether Ms. Andrew argued with defendant about his family during therapy sessions, stating that it was not relevant to whether the assault had happened.', 'After the state rested its case, defendant made a motion to dismiss count 1, assault with a dangerous weapon.', 'The trial justice granted defendant’s motion to dismiss the count as originally styled, i.e., “assault with a dangerous weapon, to wit, a foot,” and the charge was amended to simple assault, a misdemeanor. 5 After the trial concluded, the trial justice issued a written decision on April 1, 2014, finding defendant guilty of simple assault and domestic disorderly conduct.', 'In her decision, the trial justice accepted Ms. Andrew’s testimony as “wholly credible,” stating that her “in-court testimony [was] compellingly reinforced by the 911 5', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-5-3(a) reads: “Except as otherwise provided in § 11-5-2, every person who shall make an assault or battery or both shall be imprisoned not exceeding one year or fined not exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000), or both.”', '-7- recording, [Det.] Jarvis, the photographic evidence of her injuries and the expert testimony of the physicians who cared for her.”', 'Subsequently, defendant made a motion for reconsideration of his motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, to grant a new trial pursuant to Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. The trial justice denied both motions. The defendant was sentenced to a one-year suspended sentence with probation on count 1 and six months probation on count 2. The defendant timely appealed from the judgment of conviction.', 'II', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, defendant raises four issues. First, defendant contends that the trial justice overlooked and misconceived material evidence when considering the credibility of the witnesses. Second, he asserts that the trial justice failed to apply the correct burden of proof with respect to his claim of self-defense. Third, he asserts that the trial justice abused her discretion “by barring evidence and cross-examination as to motive and bias” and “allowing evidence that purportedly supported the prosecution and disallowing similar evidence that supported the defense.” Fourth, defendant argues that the trial justice overlooked and misconceived material evidence when considering his motion for a new trial.', 'A', 'Credibility Determinations', '1.

Credibility of Ms. Andrew’s Testimony', 'As defendant acknowledges in his papers, “the standard for overturning factual findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury is quite high”; nevertheless, he maintains that “[t]his [case] is the rare outlier which exceeds that bar.” He recites a number of purported inconsistencies between Ms. Andrew’s testimony at trial and statements she made to medical personnel and the police. He claims that her “accounts of a vicious beating with repeated kicks to her lower back” were belied by photographs and medical records documenting only minor injuries.', 'The defendant also asserts that the trial justice’s finding that Ms. Andrew was “wholly credible” was “impossible to reconcile with irrefutable objective evidence,” and that the trial justice abused her discretion by disregarding counseling records that contradicted Ms. Andrew’s testimony', '-9- concerning her relationship with defendant. Moreover, defendant contends that the trial justice erred by failing to explain why she rejected evidence that Ms. Andrew struck the first blow, injured her ear by hitting it on furniture or the floor, sought monetary damages from defendant after the incident, and had made false assertions in sworn court documents about being sexually assaulted by defendant.', 'Even if we were to conclude that Ms. Andrew’s testimony as to the extent of her injuries was exaggerated or that her account of the incident was indeed embellished or that the trial justice’s characterization of her testimony as “wholly credible” was somewhat hyperbolic, we are nevertheless satisfied that competent evidence existed on the record to support the convictions.', 'Neither the purported inconsistencies in Ms. Andrew’s testimony nor any contradictory evidence undermines the ultimate finding of the trial justice that the state proved that defendant had committed both the offenses of simple assault and domestic disorderly conduct.', '“We have defined simple assault as an ‘unlawful attempt or offer, with force or violence, to do a corporal hurt to another, whether from malice or wantonness.’” State v.

The 911 recording provides a contemporaneous audio account of the immediate aftermath of the incident', '- 10 - in which Ms. Andrew’s distress is palpable. To be sure, she explains to the operator that she slapped defendant before he threw her to the floor, yet there can be little doubt that she had just endured a very distressing and tumultuous episode.', 'Detective Jarvis testified that, when he responded to the house, Ms. Andrew was hysterical, “[s]he was crying, bleeding, * * * seemed pretty out of it. * * * It looked pretty bad.” She told him that “her fianc[é] had beat her and kicked her, punched her, stomped on her.” He observed bruises on her forehead, face, and chin area. He also noticed blood on her right ear, but he testified that she told him she had hit her head on a piece of furniture when defendant had pushed her down. After searching for defendant and announcing himself as “North Kingstown Police” in a loud voice approximately twenty times, Det. Jarvis located defendant in a basement bedroom. Significantly, defendant admitted to Det. Jarvis that he had hit Ms. Andrew after she had slapped him, stating, “I’m sorry, I hit her. I lost control.” Detective Jarvis also testified that defendant said, “I punched her” and made a punching motion with his hands.', 'Lieutenant Robin also responded to defendant’s house that morning in his capacity as a paramedic. He described Ms. Andrew as bleeding from a minor laceration and having a swollen right hand. Lieutenant Robin testified that Ms. Andrew told him that the physical altercation had started when defendant had called her a whore, then she slapped him in the face and he pushed her to the floor and “started to punch and kick her, and he wouldn’t stop when she cried.”', 'The court also heard testimony from Drs. Nestor and Beaudoin, the two emergency room physicians who treated Ms. Andrew. Doctor Nestor testified that, on January 14, 2012, Ms. Andrew presented with “an ear contusion and lacerations, hand contusion, and ankle abrasion * * * and a blow to the head.” Her primary complaint was the head injury. No lab tests were ordered, however, and she was discharged after receiving ten sutures. Doctor Beaudoin, who', '- 11 - was qualified as an expert witness in emergency medicine, was on duty in the Rhode Island Hospital Emergency Room on January 18, 2012, when Ms. Andrew presented with complaints of blood in the urine, and bruising to the side of her abdomen. The doctor stated that she examined Ms. Andrew and observed “significant bruising” to her right flank. Although a urine test did not reveal the presence of blood, Dr. Beaudoin indicated that she assumed the hematuria was temporary, and she did not change her diagnostic impression. She further testified that, in her opinion, Ms. Andrew’s complaint of hematuria was related to trauma to the kidney.', 'The defendant contends that the trial justice was “obligated to clarify why she rejected” evidence contrary to Ms. Andrew’s testimony.', 'We have stated that “[t]he failure to refer to other evidence contradictory to that on which the trial justice relied * * * does not constitute misconceiving or overlooking material evidence, if the trial justice refers to the evidence on which he [or she] did rely and in so doing clearly indicates that evidence to the contrary is rejected by him [or her].” DiMaio v. Del Sesto, 102 R.I. 116, 122, 228 A.2d 861, 864 (1967). “It is well settled that where the testimony of two witnesses is conflicting and the trier of facts expressly accepts the testimony of one of the witnesses, he implicitly rejects that of the other.” Blecha v. Wells Fargo Guard-Company Service, 610 A.2d 98, 102 (R.I. 1992) (quoting Turgeon v. Davis, 120 R.I. 586, 592, 388 A.2d 1172, 1175 (1978)). Thus, the trial justice impliedly rejected defendant’s testimony by her express acceptance of Ms. Andrew’s conflicting testimony. See id.', 'Accordingly, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive any evidence.', 'We are of the opinion, therefore, that sufficient competent and credible evidence exists in the record to support the trial justice’s finding beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant committed the offenses of simple assault and domestic disorderly conduct. The trial justice, an', '- 12 - experienced justice who observed the demeanor and conduct of the two principal witnesses, emphatically accepted the testimony of Ms. Andrew. The defendant’s arguments on appeal provide inadequate cause to reject her credibility determinations.', 'B', 'Self-Defense', 'The defendant contends that he presented “sufficient evidence to raise a self-defense claim,” and that the trial justice erred by failing to require the state to disprove self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt.', 'The defendant maintains that the trial justice “erroneously overlooked significant evidence of self-defense,” specifically, his testimony that Ms. Andrew struck the first two blows, and his facial injuries. The defendant also asserts that Ms. Andrew “admitted to the 911 operator, investigating police officer, paramedic, and emergency room nurse that she initiated the physical attack.” 6', '“It is well settled that ‘[u]nder the law relating to self-defense, one may defend oneself whenever one reasonably believes that he or she is in imminent danger of bodily harm at the hands of another.’” State v. Urena, 899 A.2d 1281, 1288 (R.I. 2006) (quoting State v. D’Amario, 568 A.2d 1383, 1385 (R.I. 1990)). Although “[o]ne ‘need not wait for the other to strike the first blow[,] * * * such a person must use only such force as is reasonably necessary for his [or her] own protection.’” Id. (quoting D’Amario, 568 A.2d at 1385). “The permissible degree of force used in defense of oneself varies with the particular set of circumstances in which he or she acts, but in no set of circumstances may one apply more than that degree of force necessary to prevent bodily injury.” State v. Linde, 876 A.2d 1115, 1129 (R.I. 2005) (quoting D’Amario, 568 A.2d at 6', 'Although Ms. Andrew admitted to slapping defendant, the record is devoid of any evidence that she admitted to initiating the attack, and defendant fails to point to specific evidence in the record to support his allegations that Ms. Andrew made these admissions.', '- 13 - 1385). “In addition, a defendant who was the initial aggressor of the combative confrontation is generally not entitled to rely on self-defense.” Urena, 899 A.2d at 1288.', 'In the case under review, the trial justice credited Ms. Andrew’s testimony that defendant was the initial aggressor by “jump[ing] toward her and push[ing] her in the abdomen.” Moreover, the trial justice specifically rejected defendant’s contention that the state failed to carry its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant’s use of force was unreasonable in the exercise of self-defense. Based upon our review of the record, we are satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to support the trial justice’s conclusions. In addition to Ms. Andrew’s testimony that defendant had punched and kicked her after throwing her to the floor, defendant testified that he had punched her “hard” and admitted to Det. Jarvis that he had “lost control.” Also, photographic exhibits and medical evidence demonstrate that Ms. Andrew did in fact sustain injuries and that her reported hematuria was related to trauma.', 'The pith of defendant’s argument concerning self-defense is again a challenge to the credibility determinations and factual findings of the trial justice. It is a most difficult hurdle to overcome in a jury-waived trial. As we have often stated: “[F]actual findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury are granted an extremely deferential standard of review.” State v. Gianquitti, 22 A.3d 1161, 1165 (R.I. 2011).', 'C', 'Evidentiary Rulings and Cross-Examination', 'The defendant also takes issue with a number of evidentiary rulings that the trial justice made during the course of the trial. He maintains that he “unsuccessfully sought to introduce evidence and elicit cross-examination to prove that Ms. Andrew, fueled by his rejection and her', '- 14 - precarious financial position, was vengeful and motivated to instigate the incident, fabricate her claims, and extract money from him.”', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice violated his constitutional rights and committed an abuse of discretion “by barring evidence and cross-examination as to motive and bias,” and “by allowing evidence that purportedly supported the prosecution and disallowing similar evidence that supported the defense.” Specifically, defendant contends that the trial justice erred by barring him from cross-examining Ms. Andrew as to her finances and by refusing to admit counseling records that referenced Ms. Andrew’s financial conflicts with defendant, “her fear of being on her own,” her conflicts with his family members, her alcohol use, and a “showdown” over setting a wedding date. He contends that the trial justice either prevented him from introducing such evidence or “failed to appreciate its significance” and that she barred impeachment evidence that “exposed Ms. Andrew’s lack of candor and credibility.” Moreover, defendant maintains that the trial justice erred by admitting only those portions of counseling records that purportedly supported Ms. Andrew’s account of the altercation.', '1. Standard of Review', 'Pursuant to the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution, and article 1, section 10 of the Rhode Island Constitution, this Court has held that “it is axiomatic that ‘the trial justice may not totally prevent the defendant from exploring the issues of motive, bias, or prejudice in the testimony of the state’s chief witness.’” State v. Oliveira, 882 A.2d 1097, 1122 (R.I. 2005) (quoting State v. Parillo, 480 A.2d 1349, 1357 (R.I. 1984) (emphasis omitted)). As such, the “trial justice has no discretion at all under the confrontation clause to completely prohibit defense counsel from attempting to elicit testimony from a crucial witness to demonstrate bias upon his part.” Id. (quoting Parillo, 480 A.2d at 1357 (emphasis omitted)). “For cross-examination to', '- 15 - satisfy constitutional guarantees, the trial justice is required to afford the accused ‘reasonable latitude’ to establish or reveal bias, prejudice, or ulterior motives as they may relate to the case being tried.” Id. at 1122-23 (quoting State v. Hazard, 745 A.2d 748, 756 (R.I. 2000)).', '“[O]nce sufficient cross-examination has been allowed, the constitutional safeguards are satisfied, and any further cross-examination is left within the sound discretion of the trial justice.” Oliveira, 882 A.2d at 1123 (quoting Hazard, 745 A.2d at 756). Thus, when “the trial justice does not totally prevent or completely prohibit the defendant from exploring the issues of motive, bias, or prejudice of the witness, we employ an abuse-of-discretion standard on review.” Id. at 1122. “It is well settled that this Court will not disturb a trial justice’s ruling on an evidentiary issue unless that ruling constitutes an abuse of the justice’s discretion that prejudices the complaining party.” Thomas v. Proctor, 63 A.3d 881, 884 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Tetreault, 31 A.3d 777, 782 (R.I. 2011)).', '2. Analysis', 'In this case, defendant conducted an extensive cross-examination of Ms. Andrew, which included questioning Ms. Andrew on her finances, the engagement, and setting a wedding date. Thus, defendant was not barred from “exploring the issues of motive, bias, or prejudice” in Ms. Andrew’s testimony. See Oliveira, 882 A.2d at 1122 (quoting Parillo, 480 A.2d at 1357). Nor do we perceive any abuse of discretion in her rulings limiting cross-examination.', 'The record further reflects that, at the conclusion of the testimonial evidence, defendant moved to admit into evidence many of the counseling records from Ms. Andrew’s individual therapist and the couple’s therapist. He argued that “the records are probative of her increasing anger towards him for rejecting her and her bias against him, which apparently flowed from his expressed intent to terminate their lifestyle arrangement, and as a motive to pick a fight and a', '- 16 - motive to exaggerate her injuries in this case.” The trial justice admitted eight such records and ruled six as inadmissible. In excluding the evidence, the trial justice stated that evidence of the couple’s past arguments and disagreements at therapy sessions was not relevant, and would not help determine factually what happened on the night of the alleged assault. Moreover, the trial justice allowed testimony as to the couple’s (as she characterized it) “sometimes tempestuous[] relationship,” and their disagreements over families, household work, and finances, which the couple worked on at therapy. We agree with the trial justice that there was sufficient evidence presented concerning the night of the altercation and the relationship of the parties. Thus, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not abuse her considerable discretion or prejudice defendant by excluding certain counseling records.', 'D', 'Motion for New Trial', 'Finally, defendant avers that the trial justice erred by overlooking and misconceiving material evidence in denying his motion for a new trial. Specifically, defendant contends that the trial justice overlooked that Ms. Andrew’s testimony was not supported by her 911 call and the evidence presented at trial describing her injuries, and he also contends that Ms. Andrew varied her accounts of the incident and evaded answers about the state of her relationship with defendant. The defendant maintains that the trial justice erred by ignoring his testimony about self-defense and refusing to consider or admit evidence of Ms. Andrew’s bias and motive, including counseling records. We see no merit to these contentions.', '1. Standard of Review', 'Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure provides in part: “On motion of the defendant the court may grant a new trial to the defendant if required in the interest of', '- 17 - justice. If trial was by the court without a jury, the court * * * may vacate the judgment, take additional testimony, and direct the entry of a new judgment.” In reviewing the denial of a Rule 33 motion in a jury-waived trial, this Court “appl[ies] the same deferential standard of review as would be applied to the Superior Court justice’s factual findings on the merits.” State v. DiPetrillo, 922 A.2d 124, 131 (R.I. 2007). “Such determinations are entitled to great weight and will not be disturbed unless the trial justice has overlooked or misconceived relevant and material evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.” Id. (quoting State v. Champagne, 668 A.2d 311, 313 (R.I. 1995)).', '2. Analysis', 'In denying the defendant’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice incorporated her written decision in which she found the defendant guilty of both charges. As we stated above, there is competent evidence in the record to support the trial justice’s findings. See South County Post & Beam, Inc., 116 A.3d at 210 (stating that this Court will not substitute a trial justice’s findings when there is “competent” evidence on record to support that trial justice’s findings). Accordingly, we hold that the defendant has failed to demonstrate that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived evidence or otherwise clearly erred.', 'III', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

60,State : v. : Francisco Maria.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The defendant, Francisco Maria, was found guilty by a jury of possession of cocaine with intent to deliver. He now appeals from the judgment of conviction sentencing him to a term of fifteen years’ incarceration, with five years to serve and ten years suspended, with probation. He argues that the trial justice erred by denying his motion for judgment of acquittal as well as by not instructing the jury on the lesser-included offense of simple possession. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On February 7, 2012, defendant was charged with one count of possessing cocaine with the intent to deliver it. The defendant was tried by a jury over three consecutive days in March', '-1- and April 2014 in the Providence County Superior Court. The state presented six witnesses; their pertinent testimony and the evidence admitted at trial are summarized below.', 'In June 2011, Michael Naylor was a detective with a local Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) task force. Sergeant Naylor 1 testified that, during May and June 2011, he conducted surveillance of an apartment building located on First Avenue in East Greenwich. Sergeant Naylor testified that, on June 1, 2011, he observed a “Hispanic male arrive in a gold Acura,” enter the specific apartment under surveillance, “stay[] for awhile,” and then exit the apartment with a female who had been the target of the surveillance at that apartment. Sergeant Naylor identified defendant as the Hispanic male whom he had seen at the apartment building on First Avenue on June 1, 2011. However, Sgt. Naylor also testified that, on June 1, 2011, he had not known defendant’s identity. To ascertain the identity of the Hispanic male he had observed at the East Greenwich apartment building, Sgt. Naylor testified, he had “requested that one of the East Greenwich police officers stop the vehicle and identify the driver.” Sergeant Naylor admitted that defendant’s vehicle was subsequently pulled over using a “pretext stop” for the sole purpose of ascertaining defendant’s identity. He further testified that he subsequently confirmed that the gold Acura was registered to defendant and that defendant owned residential property located on Montgomery Avenue in Providence (the target property). Sergeant Naylor also testified that, from May 18, 2011, through June 2011, he observed defendant at the East Greenwich property approximately fifteen times and that he was in contact with detectives from the Cranston Police Department during the surveillance operations conducted in June 2011. Sergeant Naylor also testified that the female target of the East Greenwich apartment’s surveillance drove a Nissan Maxima. 1', 'At the time of the trial, Sgt. Naylor was working as a police sergeant with the patrol division of the Newport Police Department.', '-2-', 'Warren Henseler, a detective in the special investigations unit of the Cranston Police Department and a member of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s “Safe Streets Violent Crimes Task Force,” testified that, in June 2011, he was investigating the distribution of cocaine in the city of Providence.', 'On June 3, 2011, based on information received from a confidential informant (CI), Det. Henseler conducted undercover surveillance of the target property. Detective Henseler testified that, during the surveillance, he saw an individual known to him as Michael White exit a vehicle that was driven by the CI and parked near the target property. Detective Henseler saw White meet with defendant in front of the house, walk up the driveway towards the house, then disappear from his view for approximately five minutes before both men returned to the detective’s line of vision. Detective Henseler further testified that he then saw White depart in the vehicle driven by the CI and defendant remain at the target property. Detective Henseler testified that he had seen defendant and White walk and talk only, and that he had not observed an actual transaction for the sale of drugs. When the vehicle with the CI and White drove away from the target property, Det. Henseler followed it to the City of Warwick. Detective Henseler testified that White was dropped off at a residence and that he continued following the CI’s vehicle to the DEA’s office in Providence.', 'Ronald Fuoroli, a detective in the narcotics unit of the Cranston Police Department, testified regarding his undercover surveillance of the target property on June 23, 2011. Detective Fuoroli testified that he saw defendant arrive at the target property in a gold Acura, park across the street, and walk up the driveway towards the house with a cooler on his shoulder. Detective Fuoroli further testified that he saw defendant leave the target property half an hour later in the same vehicle, then return to the target property approximately five minutes later. Detective Fuoroli then saw defendant exit the gold Acura and meet up with White—who had arrived in a', '-3- vehicle driven by a CI shortly before defendant returned. The two men met on the street, then proceeded to walk together up the driveway of the target property towards the house. Detective Fuoroli lost sight of the two men for “two to three minutes” before White reappeared into his view and White and the CI drove away. After White and the CI drove away, Det. Fuoroli observed defendant departing in the gold Acura. Detective Fuoroli further testified that he followed the gold Acura and he saw the vehicle pull over to the side of a road where he met with someone in “either a green or gray Maxima.”', 'Kevin Antonucci, a detective sergeant and commanding officer of the narcotics unit with the Cranston Police Department, testified about the execution of a search warrant for the target property on June 29, 2011. Detective Antonucci testified that he was one of the law-enforcement officers who had conducted the search of the master bedroom in the residence. From the master bedroom, Det. Antonucci seized a passport issued by the Dominican Republic to defendant, bank statements with defendant’s name and address, and a digital scale. From a dresser drawer, Det. Antonucci seized “nine clear plastic bags containing what [he] believed to be cocaine” as well as “some empty bags.” Detective Antonucci also seized a “large machete-type knife” from under the bed. He further testified that he turned over all of the items seized to Det. Juan Robles of the Providence Police Department, who, according to Det. Antonucci, served as the “evidence custodian” during the execution of the search warrant. Although Det. Antonucci testified that he had searched for physical evidence or records of sale, he stated that he had not found any evidence of the actual sale of illegal substances such as ledgers or receipts.', 'Juan Robles, a police officer with the Providence Police Department’s narcotics unit and part-time member of the DEA’s task force, testified that he was also present on June 29, 2011, during the execution of the search warrant at the target property. Officer Robles testified that his', '-4- role during the execution of the search warrant was to “keep[] an eye on everybody while the search was being done, and at the same time try[] to speak with [defendant].” Officer Robles further testified that he observed a detective conduct a search of defendant’s person and seize narcotics from defendant’s pocket. One of the bags seized from defendant’s pocket contained a straw within it. Officer Robles also testified that he performed a chemical field test on the narcotics seized from defendant’s pocket and that the test result was positive for cocaine.', 'Michael Liberto, a principal forensic chemist at the Rhode Island Department of Health Forensic Drug Chemistry Laboratory, was the last witness to testify. Mr. Liberto was qualified to testify as an expert witness in the field of narcotics analysis and identification. He testified that the Providence Police Department had submitted a total of fourteen bags of suspected narcotics in July 2011 and that the suspected narcotics had tested positive for cocaine salts. Mr. Liberto further testified that the combined weight of the cocaine salts that he received from the Providence Police Department for testing totaled 33.43 grams.', 'At the close of the state’s evidence, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on the basis that there was insufficient evidence of defendant’s intent to deliver. After the trial justice summarized the evidence presented by the state for each of the elements required to prove the charge of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion, concluding that there was “sufficient evidence which a jury could find the [s]tate proved the four elements of this offense.” The trial justice then heard defendant’s objection to the state’s previously submitted request to include “simple possession of cocaine” as a lesser-included offense in the instructions to the jury. The defendant objected to instructing the jury on this lesser-included offense because he had not anticipated the state’s request during his preparation for trial and had focused his defense strategy on the sufficiency of the evidence', '-5- regarding the intent element of the offense charged. The trial justice acknowledged defendant’s chosen trial strategy and denied the state’s request.', 'The jury returned a guilty verdict on April 2, 2014, on the one charge of possession of cocaine with the intent to deliver it. On May 22, 2014, the trial justice sentenced defendant to fifteen years’ imprisonment with five years to serve and ten years suspended, with probation, as well as drug abuse treatment, 200 hours of community service and a $5,000 fine. The defendant filed his notice of appeal on June 10, 2014. The judgment of conviction and commitment was entered on June 16, 2014. 2', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'A', 'Motion for Judgment of Acquittal', '1. Standard of Review', 'Rule 29(a)(1) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that the trial justice shall order the entry of judgment of acquittal when “the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction” of one or more of the offenses charged. “In reviewing the denial of a motion for a judgment of acquittal, we apply the same standard as that applied by the trial justice; namely, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, * * * giv[e] full credibility to the state’s witnesses, and draw therefrom all reasonable inferences consistent with guilt.” State v. Gomez, 116 A.3d 216, 224-25 (R.I. 2015) (quoting State v. Rolon, 45 A.3d 518, 523 (R.I. 2012)). The trial justice’s denial of the motion should be upheld when “the totality of the 2', '“Although defendant’s notice[] of appeal [was] filed before the entry of judgment, ‘this Court treats [it] as if [it] had been filed after the entry of judgment.’” State v.

Snow, 670 A.2d 239, 243 (R.I. 1996)); see also State v. Cipriano, 21 A.3d 408, 420 (R.I. 2011).', '2. Discussion', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice erred by denying his motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of the state’s evidence because the state failed to present sufficient evidence of defendant’s intent to deliver. The defendant was convicted of violating G.L. 1956 § 21-28- 4.01(a)(1), which states in pertinent part that “it shall be unlawful for any person to * * * possess with intent to * * * deliver a controlled substance.” We have previously stated that, pursuant to this statute, an individual is guilty of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver when the state proves beyond a reasonable doubt that “a defendant was in possession of drugs, had the requisite control over them, and intended to deliver the drugs to others.” State v. Oliveira, 882 A.2d 1097, 1112 (R.I. 2005) (quoting State v. Williams, 656 A.2d 975, 978 (R.I. 1995)). Since defendant’s appeal from the denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal is based solely on his assertion that the state provided insufficient evidence of the intent element of the crime charged, we will limit our review of the evidence to that from which a jury could have inferred that defendant intended to deliver the cocaine found in his possession. See Rolon, 45 A.3d at 524.', 'With respect to the intent element of defendant’s charge, we have previously held that a jury may “infer an intent to deliver illegal narcotics solely on the basis of the amount of the drugs found.” State v. Rodriguez, 10 A.3d 431, 435 (R.I. 2010) (quoting Williams, 656 A.2d at 978). Nevertheless, we have also deemed 34.5 grams of cocaine, without any other evidence of intent to deliver, such as scales or packaging materials, to be insufficient to sustain a conviction for', '-7- possession with intent to deliver. State v. Eiseman, 461 A.2d 369, 381, 383 (R.I. 1983), abrogated on other grounds by, Horton v. California, 496 U.S. 128 (1990). “By so holding, however, we in no way intimate[d] that possession of a large amount of a controlled substance may not suffice to justify an inference of intent to deliver beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id. at 383.', 'We also bear in mind that “circumstantial and direct evidence should be given equal weight.” State v. Brown, 9 A.3d 1232, 1237 (R.I. 2010) (quoting State v. Wilshire, 509 A.2d 444, 452 (R.I. 1986)). Accordingly, we have held that, when “police conducted surveillance of [a] defendant and observed individuals arriving at [the] defendant’s apartment, staying for a few moments, and then leaving,” “were aware that neighbors had complained about visitors coming and going from the apartment at all hours,” and had “two confidential informants [telling them] that [the] defendant was selling crack cocaine at his apartment,” “combined with [thirty-seven] individually wrapped cocaine packets seized from the defendant’s apartment,” there was sufficient evidence to withstand a motion to dismiss for lack of probable cause on a charge for possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver. State v. Reed, 764 A.2d 144, 147 (R.I. 2001).', 'Here, five law enforcement officers who were directly involved in the investigation of defendant and one expert in the field of narcotics analysis and identification testified during the trial. Two of the law enforcement officers testified to observing defendant meeting with the same individual on two separate days outside of defendant’s residence and then disappearing from view for only a few minutes before that individual departed. One of the law enforcement officers testified that, on approximately fifteen occasions in less than a two-month period, he had observed defendant visiting an apartment in East Greenwich that had been under investigation for selling narcotics. In addition, the exhibits presented at trial included a digital scale, nine clear', '-8- plastic bags containing cocaine and some empty clear plastic bags that had been seized from defendant’s bedroom during the execution of the search warrant at defendant’s residence. The state also presented a bag of cocaine with a straw inside that had been seized from defendant’s pocket during the search of his house as an exhibit. The expert witness testified that the substances submitted to the state laboratory all tested positive for cocaine salts. Based on the expert witness’s testimony regarding the weight of cocaine that had been seized from both defendant’s person and from his dresser drawer during the execution of the search warrant and subsequently submitted for testing, the total weight of cocaine seized during the search on June 29, 2011 was 33.43 grams. According to testimony from Det. Antonucci that one gram of cocaine had an estimated street value of $100, approximately $3,300 worth of cocaine was seized from defendant and his residence during the search.', 'Reviewing all of the testimony and considering the direct and circumstantial evidence in the light most favorable to the state, giving full credibility to the state’s witnesses, and drawing all reasonable inferences consistent with guilt, we conclude that the state presented sufficient evidence from which a reasonable juror could find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant intended to deliver the cocaine. See Gomez, 116 A.3d at 225. We therefore discern no error in the trial justice’s denial of defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal.', 'B', 'Jury Instructions', 'Notwithstanding defendant’s objection during trial to the state’s request to instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of possession of cocaine, defendant also argues before us that the trial justice erred by failing to instruct the jury on this lesser-included offense. The state replies that this issue is waived because defendant objected to this instruction during trial and the', '-9- trial justice accordingly denied the state’s request. According to Rule 30 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, “[n]o party may assign as error any portion of the [jury instructions] or omission therefrom unless the party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds of the party’s objection.” We have previously commented that “[t]he purpose of Rule 30 is to notify the trial justice, with clarity and specificity, of any deficiencies in the [jury instructions] so that the alleged error may be cured before the jury retires for deliberations.” State v. Gautier, 950 A.2d 400, 415 (R.I. 2008) (quoting State v.

61,"Bank of America, N.A. : v. : P.T.A. Realty, LLC, et al. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. The petitioners, NMLM Realty, LLC (NMLM) and Liberty Title & Escrow Company (Liberty), appeal from a final judgment entered in this receivership action. The dispute centers on the receiver’s sale of commercial property owned by P.T.A. Realty, LLC (P.T.A.) to NMLM, in which NMLM’s agent, Liberty, mistakenly failed to list all the municipal taxes owed on the property, resulting in an overpayment of funds to Bank of America, N.A. (the bank). This matter came before the Supreme Court on January 26, 2016, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised should not be summarily decided.', 'After hearing the arguments of counsel and reviewing the memoranda submitted on behalf of the parties, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown. Accordingly, we shall decide the matters at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The facts underlying the hassle between the parties are largely undisputed. In November 2012, at the bank’s request, P.T.A. was placed under receivership by the Providence County', '-1- Superior Court. The receiver took possession of P.T.A.’s real property located at 10 Rosario Drive, Providence, Rhode Island, along with another “contiguous” parcel located in Cranston (collectively, the property).', 'At that time, the bank had a properly recorded first-position mortgage on the property to secure a loan in excess of $492,000.', 'On December 5, 2012, the bank filed a motion in the receivership action to approve its secured claim, listing the claim against P.T.A. for the loan on the property and asking “the [r]eceiver to turn over to [the b]ank * * * all monies collected * * * by the [r]eceiver which constitute a part of and/or proceeds of [the b]ank’s collateral * * *” less reasonable fees and expenses, which were attributable to the sale of the property. In exchange for the proceeds of the sale, which amount was uncertain at the time, the bank agreed to discharge its mortgage on the property and write off its losses on its secured claim.', 'On September 30, 2013, the Superior Court entered an order approving the sale of the property to NMLM for $400,000. Per the purchase and sales agreement, the receiver was required to convey his title to the property free and clear of all liens and “claims for municipal real estate or tangible property taxes.” NMLM, as purchaser, was required to pay all municipal taxes from the purchase price. The order approving the purchase and sales agreement also stated, “[a]ll claims, interests, liens, mortgages, and encumbrances asserted against the [p]roperty are released and discharged” upon the sale of the property.', 'NMLM hired Liberty to, among other things, prepare the settlement statement, calculate outstanding taxes, disburse funds from the closing, pay any taxes due on the property, and purchase title insurance. Following the sale on October 17, 2013, and, importantly, based on the settlement statement prepared by Liberty, the receiver collected proceeds amounting to', '-2- approximately $293,982. 1 A receiver’s deed reflecting the transaction was recorded on October 18, 2013. In accordance with its agreement, the bank had discharged its mortgage on the property on October 11, 2013. The bank initially received $255,000 in proceeds from the sale of the property. Two months later, in December 2013, it received an additional $4,418, for a total of $259,418, to offset its secured claim on the property. Ultimately, the bank wrote off the balance of its claim, an amount in excess of $188,000.', 'It appears, however, that Liberty improperly prepared the settlement statement and failed to list substantial taxes—approximately $80,000—that were due and owing on that portion of the property located in Providence. Thus, in response to the receiver’s first and final report and request for fees filed in February 2014 (some four months after the closing), NMLM filed a motion which asserted, inter alia, that the receiver should be held in contempt, that the bank had been unjustly enriched, and that the court should order the bank to return the “excess funds,” namely, the approximately $80,000 that should have been used to pay the taxes owed on the property at closing. The hearing justice denied NMLM’s contempt motion, but NMLM pressed on and filed a further petition in the receivership action for restitution against the bank, which Liberty incorporated in its own petition for restitution against the bank. It is these petitions that are the subject of the present appeal.', 'At the hearing on the petitions, the bank argued that, as a third-party creditor not aware of Liberty’s error in calculating the taxes, it was not obligated to return any funds disbursed to it by the receiver following the sale of the property. NMLM argued that the bank was not an innocent third party because the court order approving the purchase and sales agreement required that the property be conveyed free and clear of any liens and the bank knew it was only entitled to the net 1', 'This figure includes $273,982 in proceeds given to the seller at closing, plus $20,000 in earnest money held by the seller.', '-3- proceeds of the sale after any liens and taxes had been paid. Furthermore, NMLM argued that the bank did not change its position based on the mistaken disbursement of funds because it discharged its mortgage prior to the sale of the property and without knowing how much it stood to receive in proceeds.', 'In a bench decision on June 24, 2014, the hearing justice ruled in favor of the bank. He found that the bank had not changed its position following the overpayment of funds because it “clearly was prepared to accept whatever was excess after the closing and signed discharges of its mortgage[] * * * before it knew what the proceeds * * * would be.” The hearing justice went on to say that NMLM’s claim should have been brought against its title insurer, given that it was NMLM’s agent, Liberty, that had caused the error.', 'Final judgment in the receivership action was entered on July 17, 2014. NMLM and Liberty filed a timely joint notice of appeal on July 31, 2014.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“[I]t is well settled that [t]his Court will not disturb the findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury unless such findings are clearly erroneous or unless the trial justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence * * *.” South County Post & Beam, Inc. v. McMahon, 116 A.3d 204, 210 (R.I. 2015) (quoting JPL Livery Services, Inc. v.

Simmons, 45 A.3d 1246, 1256 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Fleet National Bank v. 175 Post Road, LLC, 851 A.2d 267, 273 (R.I. 2004)).', '-4-', 'III', 'Analysis', 'To be clear, the bank does not deny its good fortune in receiving an additional $80,000. Rather, the bank argues that it is insulated from a restitution claim as a third-party creditor that received the payment in good faith and without notice of Liberty’s error. At the outset, NMLM and Liberty argue that Liberty’s mistake in calculating the taxes owed on the property does not bar them from recovering on a claim for restitution. NMLM and Liberty posit that the bank should be ordered to return the excess funds because the bank did not change its position in reliance on any particular amount of proceeds from the sale of the property before discharging its mortgage. NMLM further argues that the bank was not an innocent third-party payee because it was on notice, per the purchase and sales agreement and the court’s order in the receivership action approving the sale, that any taxes owed on the property needed to be paid before any proceeds from the sale were disbursed to it.', '“Liability in restitution derives from the receipt of a benefit whose retention without payment would result in the unjust enrichment of the defendant at the expense of the claimant.” Zambarano v. Retirement Board of Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island, 61 A.3d 432, 438 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Restatement (Third) Restitution and Unjust Enrichment § 1 cmt. a at 3 (2011)). “To recover for unjust enrichment, a claimant must prove: (1) that he or she conferred a benefit upon the party from whom relief is sought; (2) that the recipient appreciated the benefit; and (3) that the recipient accepted the benefit under such circumstances ‘that it would be inequitable for [the recipient] to retain the benefit without paying the value thereof.’” Emond Plumbing & Heating, Inc. v. BankNewport, 105 A.3d 85, 90 (R.I. 2014) (quoting Dellagrotta v. Dellagrotta, 873 A.2d 101, 113 (R.I. 2005)).', '-5-', 'NMLM and Liberty are correct insofar as we have said that “[a] person who has conferred a benefit upon another by mistake is not precluded from maintaining an action for restitution by the fact that the mistake was due to his lack of care.” Toupin v. Laverdiere, 729 A.2d 1286, 1288-89 (R.I. 1999) (quoting Restatement of the Law, Restitution § 59 (1937)). Yet, we have also stated that “[o]ne who receives money in good conscience and has practiced no deceit or unfairness in obtaining it is under no legal obligation to return it to one from whom it has been obtained by deceit on the part of another.” Id. at 1288 (quoting Smith v. Pendleton, 53 R.I. 79, 86, 163 A. 738, 740 (1933)). A similar protection has been proposed for creditors who mistakenly receive payments without knowledge of the error; for example, Restatement (Third) Restitution and Unjust Enrichment § 67 at 558 (2011) recognizes a creditor’s defense to a restitution claim “to which it would otherwise be subject * * * to the extent that (a) the payee accepts the funds in satisfaction or reduction of the payee’s valid claim as creditor of the payor * * *” provided that the creditor did not have knowledge of the mistake.', 'Here, there is no reason to believe that at the time the proceeds from the sale were disbursed the bank knew that it was receiving an overpayment of funds. NMLM and Liberty argue that the bank was on notice of the overpayment because the purchase and sales agreement and the order approving the sale of the property required that municipal taxes be paid from the proceeds of the sale and that all liens against the property were to be released and discharged upon its sale. However, even if the bank was aware that taxes were to be paid on the property before it received any proceeds, it does not follow that it had reason to know that any taxes were actually owed on it. 2 Thus, the bank received the excess funds in good faith, and NMLM and 2', 'NMLM and Liberty also suggest that the bank knew there were outstanding taxes owed on the property because the City of Providence filed a proof of claim for municipal taxes in early 2012.', '-6- Liberty cannot seek the return of their erroneous payment predicated on the theory of unjust enrichment. 3 See The National Bank v. FCC Equipment Financing, Inc., 801 N.W.2d 17, 21 (Iowa Ct. App. 2011) (“[A] creditor should be able to treat funds credited in apparent payment of a debt as irrevocably his, unless news of the error precedes [payment]. Costs of errors should be borne by those who make errors * * * rather than by innocent beneficiaries.” (quoting General Electric Capital Corp. v. Central Bank, 49 F.3d 280, 284 (7th Cir. 1995))). Accordingly, the hearing justice properly denied NMLM and Liberty’s petitions for restitution. 4', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the aforementioned reasons, we affirm the decision of the Superior Court. The papers in this case shall be returned to that court. However, because they were not listed, the settlement statement prepared by Liberty suggested that these outstanding taxes had been resolved. 3', 'It is not clear why NMLM has not filed a claim against Liberty, which apparently caused the error, or NMLM’s title insurance carrier. 4', 'Our conclusion is further reinforced given that this claim arises from a receivership action. We appreciate the need for finality in insolvency actions and are hesitant to scrutinize after the fact the propriety of a receiver’s distributions to creditors.', '-7-', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S', 'OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'Bank of America, N.A. v.

This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided.

In doing so, we intend no disrespect.', '-1- decided at this time.', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'It is undisputed that, prior to the final decree barring plaintiffs’ rights of redemption, John was the owner of the Property and his mother held a mortgage on the Property. The complaint in the instant case reflects the following facts with respect to the Property. On May 3, 2012, after the failure to pay sewer fees, the Property was put up for sale at a tax sale and defendant purchased it. Subsequently, on May 6, 2013 (in a separate action from the one being considered on this appeal), defendant filed a petition in the Providence County Superior Court to foreclose plaintiffs’ rights of redemption to the Property (the Petition), pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 44-9-25. Neither plaintiff responded to the Petition in accordance with § 44-9-29. On August 9, 2013, a hearing was held on defendant’s Petition; it is undisputed that plaintiffs were not given notice of this hearing. A final decree was entered following the hearing, which final decree foreclosed plaintiffs’ rights of redemption to the Property. The issue in the action before us is the adequacy of notice of the Petition as it pertains to John and Carmel.', 'The plaintiffs filed the complaint commencing the instant case on September 9, 2013, pursuant to § 44-9-24.3 They sought entry of an order vacating the final decree of August 9, 3', 'General Laws 1956 § 44-9-24 provides as follows:', '“The title conveyed by a tax collector’s deed shall be', 'absolute after foreclosure of the right of redemption by decree of', 'the superior court as provided in this chapter.

On March 6, 2014, a bench trial took place before a justice of the Superior Court.', 'At the bench trial both plaintiffs testified. Carmel testified that she gave John the money to buy the Property and held a mortgage on the Property. She further testified that she lived in Florida for some portion of the year; but, on cross-examination, she conceded that she was a part-time resident of 20 Woodlake Avenue in Johnston. She also conceded on cross-examination that, on June 18, 2013—the date notices of the Petition arrived by certified mail to her Johnston address and the accompanying certified mail receipts were signed—she was living at the Johnston address; she stated, “I was definitely in Rhode Island June 18th, I will concede to that.” Carmel acknowledged in her testimony that another son, Carl, signed the certified mail receipts when the notices were delivered to the Johnston address.4', 'Carmel also explained in her testimony that the notices were addressed to her husband and herself but that her husband had passed away before the notices were sent. It was her testimony that Carl never gave her those notices.', 'Furthermore, the action to vacate shall only be instituted for', 'inadequacy of notice of the petition amounting to a denial of due', 'process or for the invalidity of the tax sale because the taxes for', 'which the property was sold had been paid or were not due and', 'owing because the property was exempt from the payment of such', 'taxes.

She added that, other than the two certified mailings signed for by Carl, she had received no other correspondence of any kind from Victor Realty. She also testified that she would have paid the sewer fees if she had been aware of the pending tax sale; she added that she was “financially able to do so.”', 'The certified mail receipts entered as exhibits at trial indicate that notice of the Petition was also sent to John by certified mail with return receipts requested at both 93 Manton Avenue and 105 Manton Avenue. John testified that, on June 20, 2013, his employee, Maria Mayen, signed both of the certified mail receipts relative to the notices of the Petition that were sent to him. He indicated that he was not informed of the notices, but he further stated that, on June 20, 2013, he discovered them “behind the cash register.” In his testimony, John acknowledged that, on June 21, 2013, he placed a phone call to counsel for Victor Realty to inquire about the redemption amount for the Property; he acknowledged that he was then provided with that information by fax. When specifically asked at trial if he had notice of the Petition, John responded in the affirmative.', 'Despite conceding that he had actual notice of the Petition, John acknowledged in his testimony at trial that he did not file an answer to the Petition nor did he make an offer to redeem. He did state that he tried to come up with the money to redeem the Property on his own, without “bringing [his] mother into it.” It was his further testimony that he never heard from counsel for Victor Realty again after he was provided with the redemption amount and that he only discovered that his right of redemption had been foreclosed when the locks on the building were changed and “all the machinery disappeared.”', '-4-', 'John testified that, even though he had actual notice of the Petition, he “didn’t know the ramification[s] of it.” However, on recross-examination by counsel for Victor Realty, John was asked the following question:', '“Okay. Now, Mr. Izzo, you’re certainly literate, as a businessman,', 'a successful businessman.', '“The citation [(i.e., the notices sent to John and signed for', 'on June 20, 2013)] that you received states as follows. You notice', 'what I’ve underlined for you on your copy, that if you desire to', 'make any objection or defense to said petition you or your attorney', 'must file a written appearance and answer under oath setting forth', 'clearly and specifically your objection or defense. And it says', 'further on down, Unless your appearance is filed, which is a', 'written filing, by or for you, your default would be recorded and', 'said petition will be taken as confessed, meaning the request of the', 'petition to foreclose will be confessed and granted.

No other witnesses were called.', 'During closing argument, plaintiffs’ attorney pointed out that notice to John was sent to his business address rather than his home address. He also argued that, regardless of the adequacy of notice, John “effectively entered an appearance” in the proceeding on the Petition when he called counsel for Victor Realty to inquire about the redemption amount. The plaintiffs’ attorney contended that, for that reason, it was necessary for John to be notified of the August 9 hearing. He also contended that Carmel never received actual notice of the Petition. Counsel for Victor Realty responded by positing that notice was sent in accordance with the statutory requirements (he stated that it was sent by certified mail, return receipts requested) and that there was no requirement that notice of the August 9 hearing be provided to John because he had never filed an answer.', '-5-', 'The trial justice issued a bench decision on the same day on which the trial took place. He noted that this Court had stated that “equity has been especially vigilant to relieve against forfeitures * * *.”', '(Internal quotation marks omitted.)', 'The trial justice also engaged in a carefully considered analysis of our precedent and its applicability to the instant case. He ultimately found that Carmel did not receive adequate notice when she did not have actual notice and a family member signed the certified mail receipts; therefore, the trial justice concluded that she was never given an opportunity to present her objections to the Petition. He also decided that notice to John was “deficient” because it was sent to his business address and that that fact “exacerbated” the failure to notify him of the August 9 hearing. However, the trial justice did state that notifying John of the August 9 hearing “may not have been required under the statute.”', 'Accordingly, the trial justice granted plaintiffs’ request to vacate the final decree foreclosing their rights of redemption on the basis of inadequate notice that amounted to a denial of due process. In early April of 2014, an order entered implementing the trial justice’s bench decision; it denied a motion for summary judgment which had been filed by Victor Realty and vacated the August 9, 2013 final decree foreclosing plaintiffs’ rights of redemption. Victor Realty filed a timely notice of appeal to this Court with respect to the trial justice’s vacating the August 9, 2013 final decree.', 'II', 'Issues of Appeal', 'Victor Realty contends on appeal that the Superior Court erred in vacating the final decree foreclosing plaintiffs’ rights of redemption because: (1) John had actual notice of the Petition; (2) John was not entitled to notice of the August 9, 2013 hearing; and (3) Carmel was served with notice “in the manner required by the * * * statute.” This Court is tasked with', '-6- determining whether the Superior Court erred in deciding that the notice provided to John and/or Carmel was so inadequate as to amount to a denial of due process, pursuant to chapter 9 of title 44 of the General Laws.', 'III', 'Standard of Review', 'We have specifically stated that, when considering an appeal from a judgment denying a party’s request to vacate a final decree foreclosing that party’s right of redemption to property, we “exercise a de novo standard of review.” Kildeer Realty v. Brewster Realty Corp., 826 A.2d 961, 962, 965 (R.I. 2003). Our reasoning in that opinion was that a request “which contends that a judgment is void is one which is not addressed to the court’s discretion. A judgment is either valid or it is not and discretion plays no part in resolving the issue.” Id. at 965 (quoting Nisenzon v. Sadowski, 689 A.2d 1037, 1047 (R.I. 1997)) (emphasis in original). Although Kildeer dealt with the denial of a motion to vacate a final decree whereas the instant case deals with a trial justice having actually vacated a final decree, it is our view that the same standard of review should apply. Thus, we will proceed to conduct a de novo review.', 'IV', 'Analysis', 'In Rhode Island, “a person holding an interest in * * * property has an absolute right,” for one year following a tax sale of the property, “to redeem the property by paying the purchase price to the buyer at the tax sale [(in this case, Victor Realty)] * * *, along with any accumulated fees, taxes, and penalties.” Johnson v. QBAR Associates, 78 A.3d 48, 52 (R.I. 2013); see § 44- 9-21. If the property has not been redeemed within a year of the tax sale, the purchaser at the tax sale may file a petition in Superior Court to “foreclose upon any interested party’s right of', '-7- redemption.” Johnson, 78 A.3d at 52; see § 44-9-25(a). The purchaser must then send notice to all interested parties, including the mortgagee. Johnson, 78 A.3d at 52; see § 44-9-27. After “notice * * * is effectuated, any interested party may redeem the property by filing an answer to the petition along with an offer to redeem * * *.” Johnson, 78 A.3d at 52; see § 44-9-29. If an interested party fails to do so, “a decree shall be entered which shall forever bar all rights of redemption.” Johnson, 78 A.3d at 52 (internal quotation marks omitted); see § 44-9-30. The only means to challenge such a decree is specifically provided for by statute; as plaintiffs did in the instant case, a separate action can be brought alleging inadequate notice of the petition to foreclose the rights of redemption which amounts to a due process violation. Sec. 44-9-24.', 'A', 'Notice to John', '1. Notice of the Petition', 'The first issue with which we are confronted is whether or not notice of the Petition to John was adequate. It is undisputed that John had actual notice of the Petition given that John expressly acknowledged as much in his testimony at trial.', 'The situation in the instant case has been expressly addressed by the General Assembly in § 44-9-11(c). That statute provides, in pertinent part, as follows:', '“Once a petition is filed under § 44-9-25, and any party in', 'interest entitled to notice of the tax sale receives actual notice of', 'the pendency of the petition to foreclose, the party must raise the', 'notice defense in accordance with the provisions of § 44-9-31 or be', 'estopped from alleging lack of notice in any action to vacate a final', 'decree entered in accordance with § 44-9-30.” Sec. 44-9-11(c). In the instant case, a petition was filed under § 44-9-25 by Victor Realty. John had actual notice of the Petition. He did not raise a notice defense in that action. In fact, he acknowledged at trial that the notices he received of the Petition made it clear that he had to file a written appearance', '-8- and answer to the Petition setting forth his objection or the Petition would be granted pursuant to § 44-9-31, and he acknowledged that he nonetheless took no action. As such, by the clear and unambiguous terms of the statute, he is estopped from alleging lack of notice in this separate action to vacate the final August 9, 2013 decree foreclosing his right of redemption with respect to the Property. See Olamuyiwa v. Zebra Atlantek, Inc., 45 A.3d 527, 534 (R.I. 2012) (holding that clear and unambiguous statutory language must be interpreted literally). Moreover, in Johnson, 78 A.3d at 53, where an individual brought an action alleging inadequate notice under § 44-9-24 but had, in fact, received actual notice of a petition to foreclose her right of redemption, we held that, in view of the fact that actual notice was received, there was no deprivation of due process. See also ABAR Associates v. Luna, 870 A.2d 990, 995 (R.I. 2005) (stating that it has been the repeated holding of this Court that, “upon notice of a petition for foreclosure of the right of redemption, the failure by one who owns an interest in real estate to file an answer or specifications on or before the return day forever bars that party from later contesting the validity of the tax title”) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, the statutory scheme at issue and our precedent lead us to the conclusion that the trial justice erred in finding that notice of the Petition as it pertained to John was inadequate since John was estopped from raising such an argument.', '2. Notice of the August 9, 2013 Hearing', 'The defendant argues on appeal that, since John received actual notice of the Petition and failed to file an answer or enter a written appearance, as required under chapter 9 of title 44 of the General Laws, he had not entered an appearance and was not entitled to notice of the August 9, 2013 hearing.', '-9-', 'As we turn to this issue, we begin by noting that it is by no means clear from the record that the trial justice actually held that John was entitled to notice of the August 9, 2013 hearing. In his decision, the trial justice stated:', '“Mr. Izzo was not properly served, the failure of the defendant to', 'subsequently notify him of the motion for foreclosure on August', '9th is exacerbated. Although that may not have been required', 'under the statute, as [counsel for Victor Realty] likes to remind the', 'Court to the strictures of the statute, since notice was not properly', 'served on Mr. Izzo, then his obligation to answer had not run, and', 'notice should have been provided to him * * *.” The trial justice’s comments, although unclear, suggest to this Court that he did not hold that John was entitled to notice of the August 9, 2013 hearing. However, despite our view in that regard, we will very briefly address the subject of John’s right to notice of the August 9, 2013 hearing.', 'This Court has indicated, with respect to defaults under Rule 55 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, that an appearance is “broadly defined and [is] not limited to a formal court appearance.”', 'Val-Gioia Properties, LLC v. Blamires, 18 A.3d 545, 548 (R.I. 2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, we have also expressly stated that the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure do not apply to tax foreclosure actions. Johnson, 78 A.3d at 53 n.7 (“[T]ax sale foreclosure proceedings are specifically exempted from the operation of the Rules of Civil Procedure by Rule 81(a)(2) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure * * *.”). The notices of the Petition which John testified he eventually received were in compliance with the form required under § 44-9-46 and contained the following language:', '“If you desire to make any objection or defense to said petition,', 'you or your attorney must file a written appearance and an answer,', 'under oath, setting forth clearly and specifically your objection or', 'defense to each part of said petition, in the office of the Superior', 'Court in Providence on or before the 20th day following the day of', '- 10 -', 'receipt of this Citation next, that you may then and there show', 'cause, if any, why the prayer of the petition should not be granted.', '“Unless your appearance is filed by or for you, your default will be', 'recorded, the said petition will be taken as confessed, and you will', 'be forever barred from contesting said petition or any decree', 'entered thereon.” (Emphasis in original.) Therefore, John was on notice that he had to enter a written appearance and an answer or his default would be recorded. He did not file a written appearance or an answer. Thus, in the context of this case, we are unable to hold that John had entered an appearance and was thereby entitled to notice of the August 9, 2013 hearing.', 'B', 'Notice to Carmel', 'Victor Realty contends that the Superior Court erred in finding notice to Carmel was inadequate because Victor Realty followed the requirements of the statute in providing notice to Carmel and actual notice was not required. The plaintiffs counter by averring that notice was inadequate and should be found to be so in order to accord with “the practice and procedure of equity.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.)', 'The requirements of notice pertinent to the instant case are set forth in the following clear statutory language:', '“Upon the filing of a petition, the petitioner shall, at his or', 'her own cost, select, with the approval of the court, a title company', 'or an attorney familiar with the examination of land titles. This', 'company or attorney shall make an examination of the title', 'sufficient only to determine the persons who may be interested in', 'the title, and the petitioner shall, upon the filing of the examiner’s', 'report, notify all persons appearing to be interested, whether as', 'equity owners, mortgagees, lienors, attaching creditors, or', 'otherwise, as well as the tax collector in the municipality where the', 'subject property is located, of the pendency of the petition, the', 'notice to be sent to each by registered or certified mail and return', 'of receipt required.” Sec. 44-9-27(a) (emphasis added).', '- 11 - In addressing whether notice to Carmel was adequate, we are keenly mindful of the maxim that “[E]quity never * * * lends its aid to enforce a forfeiture * * *.” ABAR Associates, 870 A.2d at 994 (quoting Albertson v. Leca, 447 A.2d 383, 387 (R.I. 1982)).', 'However, despite that venerable principle, we cannot overlook the statutory language; the statute specifically requires that notice be sent to a mortgagee (in the instant case, Carmel) by certified mail with a return receipt requested. There is no dispute that defendant followed the terms of the statute. The issue with which we must contend is whether, in the instant case where Carmel’s son signed for the certified mailings but did not inform her of those mailings, notice is still adequate so as not to amount to a denial of due process. A thorough review of the United States Supreme Court precedent, as well as our own precedent, leads to the conclusion that notice to Carmel was in compliance with the statute and was adequate, even though Carmel never received actual notice.', 'Due process requires “notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.” Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 314 (1950); see also Flynn v. Al-Amir, 811 A.2d 1146, 1151 (R.I. 2002). However, “[d]ue process does not require that a property owner receive actual notice before the government may take his property.” Jones v. Flowers, 547 U.S. 220, 226 (2006); see also Weigner v. City of New York, 852 F.2d 646, 649 (2d Cir. 1988) (“The proper inquiry is whether the state acted reasonably in selecting means likely to inform persons affected, not whether each property owner actually received notice.”).', 'Also, in Jones, 547 U.S. at 226, the United States Supreme Court acknowledged its “ample precedent” allowing for notice by mail. 5 See, e.g., Dusenbery v. 5', 'It is worth noting that, in Jones v. Flowers, 547 U.S. 220, 226, 239 (2006), the United States Supreme Court held that adequate notice of a tax sale was not provided when notice was sent by certified mail but it was returned to the sender marked “unclaimed.” The instant case is', '- 12 - United States, 534 U.S. 161, 164, 169, 172 (2002) (holding that notice sent by certified mail to an inmate was adequate).', 'Furthermore, this Court has followed the Supreme Court in holding that, when providing notice of a tax sale,6 § 44-9-10 permits notice by certified mail to the individual’s last known place of abode and that a hearing justice erred in finding such notice to be inadequate. Amy Realty v. Gomes, 839 A.2d 1232, 1235 (R.I. 2004). We specifically stated that “[a]ctual notice was not required.” Id. We have also held, when discussing service of process rather than notice under the tax foreclosure statute, that service sent by certified mail and signed for by the defendant’s mother was adequate. Flynn, 811 A.2d at 1151-52. Importantly, we stated: “Service by registered or certified mail should be regarded as equally efficacious [as personal service] from a constitutional perspective to invoke personal jurisdiction since the return receipt normally guarantees that the defendant or someone related or associated with him has received the process * * *.” Id. at 1151 (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'The testimony in the instant case reflects the fact that Carmel did not have actual notice. However, that does not necessarily mean that the notice provided to her was inadequate. See Jones, 547 U.S. at 226. Her testimony and the exhibits at trial reflect the fact that defendant sent her notice by certified mail with return receipts requested at her last known address, which is all the above-referenced precedent requires.', 'See, e.g., Amy Realty, 839 A.2d at 1235. Additionally, Carmel testified that, despite spending some of the year in Florida, she was “definitely” in Rhode Island and living at the address where the certified mailings were sent on easily distinguishable in view of the fact that Carmel’s son signed for the two notices that were sent to her address. As such, defendant had no reason to know that notice was not received. 6', 'While we are dealing with a petition to foreclose rights of redemption in the instant case, rather than a tax sale, cases addressing notice required before a tax sale are instructive since similar property interests are implicated.', '- 13 - the date they were signed for by Carl. In our judgment, such notice was reasonably calculated to apprise her of the Petition and allow her to present an objection. See Mullane, 339 U.S. at 314.', 'Moreover, our precedent is instructive with respect to the fact that Carl, not Carmel, signed for the certified mailings; service of process by certified mail is adequate since it typically guarantees that the individual to whom the service is addressed “or someone related” would receive service. Flynn, 811 A.2d at 1151 (emphasis in original). It follows that notice of a petition to foreclose rights of redemption which is sent by certified mail and signed for by a relative of the intended recipient is adequate notice and does not amount to a denial of due process. We note that we have specifically stated that the statutory scheme at issue, which requires only notice by certified mail with return receipts requested, “strikes a fair balance between the interests of the government and private property rights * * *.” Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. v. DePina, 63 A.3d 871, 876 (R.I. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also § 44-9-27. Furthermore, the fact that Carmel testified that she was “financially able” to redeem does not overcome the fact that she was provided legally adequate notice of the Petition and did not file an answer or an offer to redeem.', 'It is worth noting that the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, in Town of Andover v. State Financial Services, Inc., 736 N.E.2d 837, 840 (Mass. 2000), held that the notice provision of the Massachusetts tax title foreclosure law requiring notice by certified mail “satisfied * * * due process.” It is likewise our opinion that, in the particular circumstances of the instant case, the defendant’s compliance with § 44-9-27 in providing notice by certified mail with return receipts requested ensured adequate notice to Carmel.', '- 14 -', 'V', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated in this opinion, we vacate the order of the Superior Court.

63,: v. : James Main.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. Rosario Turdo, the plaintiff, appeals from a March 10, 2014 judgment following a jury-waived trial in the Washington County Superior Court. The trial justice entered judgment in favor of James Main, the defendant, on the plaintiff’s breach of contract claim and also entered judgment in favor of the defendant on his counterclaim for conversion. In addition, the plaintiff appeals from the May 5, 2014 denial of her motion for relief from the March 10, 2014 Superior Court judgment, which motion invoked Rule 60(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties’ arguments (both written and oral), we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this appeal may be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On July 12, 2011, plaintiff filed a complaint alleging that defendant was indebted to her in the amount of $17,840. She alleged that she had “an agreement in regard to said sum which was signed on December 17, 2009 by James Main, the [d]efendant.” On July 29, 2011,1 Mr. Main filed a response and a counterclaim for $12,050. On August 16, 2013, prior to trial, the parties agreed to a “Statement of Undisputed Facts.” The statement stipulated to the following facts: (1) the parties had been “involved in a ‘dating’/romantic relationship from 2007 to 2010;” (2) the parties entered into numerous agreements involving the exchange of funds and services; (3) plaintiff sold a truck to defendant for $11,000; (4) defendant made payments to plaintiff with respect to the truck; (5) plaintiff “had [d]efendant return [the] vehicle to her on or about February 21, 2010 after contacting the police department of Westerly, Rhode Island;” and (6) plaintiff sold the truck in question for $10,000. In the same document the parties agreed that a contract signed by both parties on June 5, 2009 would be admitted as a full exhibit at trial. That handwritten contract reads, in its entirety, as follows:', '“Agreement between Rose Turdo [and] James Main', '“Ref: 2004 GMC Sierra 4X4 Black Pickup', '“VIN # 1GTHK29G74E292070', '“Rose Turdo to remain owner until final payment received by 12-', '1-09 - $500.00 received as down payment 6-5-09. $150.00 per', 'week to be paid each Friday until $11,000 total received - First', 'payment due 6-12-09.', '“All repairs - parts - maintenance - expenses are the', 'responsibility of James Main -', '“Truck registration [and] Insurance [and] Title to remain', 'under Rose Turdo with right to use. Upon default the truck remains', 'the property of Rose Turdo without any reimbursement. 1', 'The record includes a handwritten objection to the complaint by Mr. Main denying all allegations and expressing his wish to “counter sue,” which is dated July 29, 2011. A more formal document containing Mr. Main’s answer and counterclaim was filed on August 13, 2013.', '-2-', '“Title to be released with Lean [sic] until previous debt of', '$10,000 paid in full by 7-1-2010.”', 'On August 27, 2013, a jury-waived trial was conducted. We relate below the salient aspects of what transpired at that trial.', 'A', 'The Testimony at Trial', '1. The Testimony of Rosario Turdo', 'Rosario Turdo testified at trial that she began dating Mr. Main in April of 2007. She testified regarding a ledger she kept which reflected monies owed to her by Mr. Main and payments made to her by Mr. Main. It was Ms. Turdo’s testimony on direct examination that she did not receive any payments from Mr. Main on the loan reflected in the above-referenced June 5, 2009 contract after November 9, 2009. She also testified that she had to have repairs costing $2,038.86 done on the truck before its sale; she added that Mr. Main’s use of the truck for the purpose of towing certain items caused some of the damage which she had subsequently caused to be repaired.', 'On cross-examination, Ms. Turdo testified that Mr. Main did not pay under the June 5, 2009 contract “for any period of time.” She was then specifically confronted with the fact that she had just testified that Mr. Main made no payments on the June 5, 2009 contract whereas her ledger reflected payments at least until December 3, 2009. She then conceded that Mr. Main did make payments under the June 5, 2009 contract and that, contrary to what she testified to on direct examination, he made regular payments up until December 11, 2009. She added that Mr. Main did pay her $1,600 after December 11, 2009, but she stated that said payment was not “another payment” on the contract at issue but rather was related to a visit made by his parents at which time they stayed at her home. She admitted during cross-examination that that payment', '-3- was not recorded on her ledger, which ledger she testified had ended before that point in time due to a new agreement between the parties on December 17, 2009. She went on to testify that, in addition to the $1,600 which Mr. Main paid her in December of 2009, he also assigned to her a debt of $800 from one “Ed Alore.” It was her testimony that Mr. Main did not make any payments after the purported new agreement of December 17, 2009.', 'On cross-examination, Ms. Turdo went on to testify that she told Mr. Main that she wanted the truck back on January 18, 2010. She conceded that in February she went to the Westerly Police Department with respect to the truck because “[Mr. Main] was driving my truck under my registration, and my insurance, without my permission.” She was asked if she told Mr. Main to return the truck “or [she] would pursue criminal charges,” and she replied in the affirmative. She was then asked whether she knew that Mr. Main was on probation, and she again replied in the affirmative. She denied that Mr. Main had offered to pay the debt he owed her in full in February of 2010, and she stated that he returned the truck on “February 26thish.”', 'When questioned during her surrebuttal testimony, Ms. Turdo was asked: “[Y]ou also told [Mr. Main] if he didn’t give [the truck] back, you were going to say it was stolen?” She replied that she considered it to be stolen at that point. She was then asked: “You were basically threatening him?” Ms. Turdo’s reply was: “I wanted my truck back. Yes, I wanted my truck.”', '2. The Testimony of James Main', 'James Main testified that it was his belief that he did not owe Ms. Turdo any money. He stated that Ms. Turdo wanted to enter into a new agreement on December 17, 2009 but that he refused to sign the new agreement. He also testified that Ms. Turdo intended to repossess the truck that day if he did not pay her $2,400. It was his understanding that the $1,600 he then paid her and the $800 debt which he agreed to assign to her were related to his debt for the truck. It', '-4- was his further testimony that he also commenced paying $200 a week. He added that he paid that $200 a week up until the time when Ms. Turdo repossessed the truck.', 'Mr. Main’s testimony then turned to February 21, 2010, which he stated was the date when he received a phone call from Ms. Turdo in which she said that she wanted to repossess the truck. It was his testimony that he agreed to meet her at the Westerly Police Station. He added that, despite having agreed to meet at the Westerly Police Station, he actually went to the Hopkinton Police Station because they “knew both of us and our situation.” He stated that he offered to “pay off the vehicle” and that Ms. Turdo’s response was simply that “[s]he wanted the truck back.” He then testified that Ms. Turdo said that she would report the truck stolen if he did not return it to her; he added that he returned the truck because he did not want any “legal problems.” It was also Mr. Main’s testimony that he was seeking damages pursuant to his counterclaim because Ms. Turdo wrongfully took his truck at the time when he was current on his required payments.', 'On cross-examination, Mr. Main conceded that he could not provide any proof for any of the payments which he made to Ms. Turdo that were not included in the ledger.', '3. The Testimony of Victoria Bentley', 'Victoria Bentley testified that she was Mr. Main’s stepmother. She testified that she was “a witness to a conversation” that took place on or near February 21, 2010 between Ms. Turdo and Mr. Main. She stated that Mr. Main told Ms. Turdo that he did not want to return the truck because he was “up to date on the payments.” Ms. Bentley also testified that she told Mr. Main during the conversation that she would pay the balance due on the truck, which fact she heard him convey to Ms. Turdo.', '-5-', 'B', 'The Trial Justice’s Decision', 'The trial justice issued a written decision on February 26, 2014. She began by making extensive findings of fact. The trial justice found that there was a handwritten contract between the parties, which was executed on June 5, 2009, authorizing Mr. Main to purchase a truck from Ms. Turdo. The trial justice found that Mr. Main timely made the down payment and “in large part” complied with the periodic payment terms. According to the trial justice, in mid-December of 2009, plaintiff presented defendant with a handwritten ledger regarding monies he owed her and told him that she would repossess the truck if he did not pay the lump sum of $2,500 and increase his weekly payments for the truck from $150 to $200. The trial justice also found that plaintiff presented defendant with a document to that effect on December 17, 2009. Crucially, the trial justice noted that the December 17, 2009 document, which is the basis of plaintiff’s complaint, was never introduced at trial. The trial justice then found that defendant did not execute any written agreement on December 17, 2009, although he did: (1) pay plaintiff $1,600; (2) assign to plaintiff an $800 debt he was owed; and (3) begin paying $200 a week.', 'According to the trial justice, the “credible testimony, supported by the documentary evidence of record” demonstrated that, when plaintiff tried to repossess the truck on February 21, 2010, defendant was current on his payments on his indebtedness with respect to the truck. The trial justice found that plaintiff demanded the return of the truck or she would report it as stolen to the police, knowing that defendant was on probation. The trial justice also found that, on the same February date, Ms. Turdo reported to the Westerly police that her ex-boyfriend would not return a truck after “she no longer permitted him to use it.” Eventually, as the trial justice found,', '-6- in February of 2010, defendant returned the truck to plaintiff, who thereafter sold it for $10,000 in September of 2010.', 'With respect to witness credibility, the trial justice found plaintiff to be “angry and vindictive” and characterized her testimony as “spiteful.” The trial justice stated that, “[w]hile it is not uncommon to observe some negative feelings between litigants, the disgust expressed by [p]laintiff about [d]efendant leaves the [c]ourt guessing what redeeming qualities [d]efendant had that attracted [p]laintiff to him in the first place.” She further found plaintiff’s testimony with respect to “debts incurred and payments received by [d]efendant” to “lack[] all credibility.” The trial justice then detailed circumstances where plaintiff’s testimony was inconsistent with a handwritten ledger on which she was relying to support her claim and where plaintiff’s testimony on direct examination was inconsistent with her testimony on cross-examination. By contrast, the trial justice found that defendant “presented as calm, rational, and genuinely hurt by the tone and vitriol of [p]laintiff’s testimony;” she added that defendant “appeared genuinely crestfallen during his testimony.” The trial justice went on to state that “[d]efendant never dismissed the affection he had for [p]laintiff, he presented as a credible witness, and [p]laintiff simply did not.” The trial justice also found Victoria Bentley’s testimony to be credible.', 'With respect to plaintiff’s breach of contract claim, the trial justice’s conclusions of law were shaped by the fact that plaintiff sued under a purported December 17, 2009 contract, which defendant did not execute and which was never entered into evidence at trial. The trial justice stated that, consequently, there was no “mutuality of agreement” between plaintiff and defendant as to the purported December 17, 2009 contract. She also concluded that, at the time when plaintiff repossessed the truck, defendant was in compliance with the terms of the only contract between the parties, the June 5, 2009 contract. As such, the trial justice concluded that plaintiff', '-7- had failed to meet her burden of proving a “valid, enforceable agreement” as the basis for her breach of contract claim, and she indicated that judgment should enter for defendant on that claim.', 'Moving on to defendant’s counterclaim, the trial justice reviewed the pertinent legal principles relative to the claims of conversion and then concluded that defendant had the required possessory interest in the truck at the time it was repossessed because he was current on his payments. She added that, for the same reason, plaintiff had no legal right to interfere with defendant’s possessory interest. The trial justice then stated that plaintiff had repossessed the truck in a manner “designed to intimidate and harass [d]efendant” and that, consequently, defendant’s act of turning over the truck was not voluntary. The trial justice then proceeded to state: “Accordingly, this Court finds that [p]laintiff appropriated the * * * truck for her own use without [d]efendant’s consent and without legal right;” she added: “Defendant has established the tort of conversion and is entitled to damages.” Finally, the trial justice set the amount for damages based on the value for which the truck was sold in September of 2010—viz., $10,000. A judgment to that effect was entered on March 10, 2014.', 'C', 'Post-Trial Motions', 'On March 28, 2014, plaintiff filed a motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 59 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. Subsequently, on April 23, 2014, she filed what she characterized as a “supplemental” motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 60(b)(3) & (6) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. (We note that Ms. Turdo provides no argument with respect to her Rule 59 motion on appeal; she confines her contentions to her Rule 60(b)', '-8- “supplemental” motion. Accordingly, we will recount only those facts that are relevant to plaintiff’s Rule 60(b) motion.)', 'A hearing on plaintiff’s motions was conducted on April 24, 2014. At the close of the hearing, the trial justice issued a bench decision. With respect to plaintiff’s Rule 60(b) motion, the trial justice stated that the “rule permits a Court to relieve a party from a judgment under certain circumstances and upon such terms that are just.” It was the trial justice’s opinion that plaintiff’s counsel was requesting a “do-over because the case was not tried in the manner that this new counsel[2] would have tried the case.” She held that such a request, especially where she had found plaintiff to be “entirely lacking in credibility,” did not meet the requirements of Rule 60(b)(6). Moreover, she held that any misrepresentations alleged by plaintiff were “nothing more than a request to reconsider this Court’s determination of credibility;” she added that it was “just a last-ditch attempt to get a do-over after an unfavorable decision.” Accordingly, she held that plaintiff was not entitled to relief under Rule 60(b)(3).', 'The trial justice’s decision denying Ms. Turdo’s motion for a new trial was entered as an order on May 5, 2014. Ms. Turdo timely appealed the judgment issued following the trial and the denial of her motion filed pursuant to Rule 60(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'The plaintiff argues that the trial justice erred: (1) in determining that “there was no contract on December 17, 2009;” (2) in not awarding plaintiff damages under the June 5, 2009 2', 'It is clear from the record that, at the hearing on her motion pursuant to Rule 60(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, plaintiff was represented by an attorney who was different from the attorney who had represented her at trial; that new attorney entered her appearance on March 28, 2014.', '-9- contract; (3) in finding that defendant had a possessory interest in the truck; (4) in determining the amount of damages due to defendant on his conversion counterclaim; and (5) in denying plaintiff’s Rule 60(b) motion for relief from the March 10, 2014 judgment.', 'III', 'Standard of Review', 'We have repeatedly stated that it is well established that the “factual findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury are accorded great weight and will not be disturbed unless the record shows that the findings clearly are wrong or the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence.”', 'Wellington Condominium Association v.

Pereira, 926 A.2d 1005, 1011 (R.I. 2007). If it becomes clear to us, as we review the record, that “competent evidence supports the trial justice’s findings, we shall not substitute our view of the evidence for [that of the trial justice] even though a contrary conclusion could have been reached.” Wellington Condominium Association, 68 A.3d at 599 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Grady v.

However, based on our review of the record and plaintiff’s contentions on appeal, it is clear to us that no questions of law as to the original March 10, 2014 judgment have been raised in this case.', '- 10 -', 'IV', 'Analysis', 'A', 'The Breach of Contract Claim', 'The plaintiff alleges that, despite the fact that the December 17, 2009 contract which formed the basis of her complaint was not entered as an exhibit at trial, the trial justice erred in determining there was no contract because both parties testified regarding the contract. She adds that testimony reflected the fact that Mr. Main made at least some payments in accordance with the terms of the purported December 17, 2009 contract.', 'We begin by noting that plaintiff bore the burden of proving her breach of contract claim by a fair preponderance of the evidence. Campbell v. Walsh-Kaiser Co., 72 R.I. 358, 359-60, 51 A.2d 530, 531 (1947); see General Accident Insurance Co. of America v.

While we acknowledge that Mr. Main did testify that he made a lump- sum payment in December of 2009 and that he made larger payments after December 17, 2009, we nonetheless conclude, based on our review of the record, that the trial justice had competent evidence to support her finding that plaintiff failed to meet her burden of establishing the existence of a contract. See Wellington Condominium Association, 68 A.3d at 599.', 'We have stated that a contract requires “competent parties, subject matter, a legal consideration, mutuality of agreement, and mutuality of obligation.” Lamoureux v. Burrillville Racing Association, 91 R.I. 94, 98, 161 A.2d 213, 215 (1960) (internal quotation marks omitted). The plaintiff inexplicably failed to produce at trial a copy of the purported December 17, 2009 contract. Additionally, as plaintiff recognizes in her filing before this Court, defendant testified', '- 11 - at trial that he refused to sign the December 17, 2009 document. He also stated that he gave Ms. Turdo a lump-sum payment in December of 2009 because she had threatened to repossess the truck—not because such a payment was required under the terms of the purported new December 17, 2009 contract. Without a copy of the alleged contract containing defendant’s signature and in light of his testimony that he did not agree to its terms, we perceive no evidence in the record of a mutuality of agreement. Moreover, we must bear in mind that the trial justice found plaintiff’s testimony with respect to debts owed to her by Mr. Main and monies she had received from him to “lack[] all credibility.” As such, it is our opinion that the trial justice did not clearly err in making a factual determination that defendant did not execute a written agreement with plaintiff on December 17, 2009.3', 'B', 'The Counterclaim for Conversion', 'Ms. Turdo contends that the trial justice’s finding in defendant’s favor on his conversion counterclaim was in error because Mr. Main did not prove a possessory interest in the truck. She references the fact that the registration, title, and insurance on the truck remained in her name.', 'An action for conversion requires a plaintiff to establish that he or she “was in possession of the personalty, or entitled to possession of the personalty, at the time of conversion.” Narragansett Electric Co. v. Carbone, 898 A.2d 87, 97 (R.I. 2006) (quoting Montecalvo v. Mandarelli, 682 A.2d 918, 928 (R.I. 1996)). The “gravamen of an action for conversion lies in 3', 'The plaintiff makes an additional argument that she should have been awarded damages under the June 5, 2009 contract. But plaintiff’s complaint is based solely on the December 17, 2009 document. Consequently, despite plaintiff’s contentions on appeal, there was no basis upon which the trial justice could award her damages on the June 5, 2009 contract. Moreover, it is also worth noting that the trial justice specifically found that Mr. Main was in compliance with the June 5, 2009 contract at the time the truck was repossessed.', '- 12 - the * * * taking [of the] personalty [of another party] without consent and exercising dominion over it inconsistent with the [other party’s] right to possession.” Fuscellaro v. Industrial National Co., 117 R.I. 558, 560, 368 A.2d 1227, 1230 (1977). The intentional exercise of dominion or control over another’s chattel must “so seriously interfere[] with the right of another to control it that [the individual exercising dominion or control over the chattel] may justly be required to pay the other the full value of the chattel.” Narragansett Electric Co., 898 A.2d at 97 (quoting Montecalvo, 682 A.2d at 928).', 'The June 5, 2009 contract, by its terms, granted Mr. Main the “right to use” the truck, regardless of the fact that the title, insurance, and registration were still in Ms. Turdo’s name; the contract allowed him to possess and use the truck as long as he continued to make the required payments. Mr. Main testified that he was current on his payments for the truck at the time it was repossessed. Moreover, Victoria Bentley’s testimony confirmed that Mr. Main expressed his belief that he was current in his payments to Ms. Turdo when she attempted to repossess the truck in February of 2010. In accordance with the just-referenced testimony, the trial justice found as a fact that defendant was current on his debt in February of 2010. She also found that Mr. Main did have a possessory interest at the time the truck was repossessed, which possessory interest existed pursuant to the June 5, 2009 contract. Moreover, she came to the conclusion, based upon her findings as to credibility, that Mr. Main returned the truck to plaintiff due to the threat of having it reported as stolen and that, therefore, his return of the truck was not a voluntary act. The trial justice proceeded to hold that plaintiff was liable for conversion. Upon our review of the record and the trial justice’s decision, we are also of the opinion that plaintiff was liable for conversion when she took the truck in which defendant had a possessory interest without his consent and, by taking dominion over the truck, deprived him entirely of the use of', '- 13 - the truck. See Narragansett Electric Co., 898 A.2d at 97; Fuscellaro, 117 R.I. at 560, 368 A.2d at 1230. Our review has unearthed no error in the factual findings of the trial justice; and, in our judgment, those facts can lead to only one conclusion—that plaintiff converted the truck to her own use without legal entitlement.', 'Ms. Turdo further contends that, even if defendant prevails on his conversion counterclaim, defendant should not receive any damages due to the fact that the value of the truck had already been deducted from what Mr. Main owed her. However, the purpose of the trial in this case was to make a determination as to the debts of the parties based on any contracts or agreements executed by the parties. The trial justice found plaintiff’s testimony regarding defendant’s debt not to be credible. The plaintiff has not presented us with any basis on which to question the trial justice’s credibility findings in this regard. See Wellington Condominium Association, 68 A.3d at 599.', 'The plaintiff also posits that defendant is not entitled to damages because he did not meet his burden of producing any evidence as to the value of the truck at the time it was repossessed in February of 2010. We have stated that “the measure of damages for conversion is usually the value of the property at the time of its conversion, a matter susceptible of being proved by evidence of market value.” Jeffrey v. American Screw Co., 98 R.I. 286, 291, 201 A.2d 146, 150 (1964). The trial justice in the instant case based her award on the market value of the truck in September of 2010 when the truck was sold. Even though the trial justice based her damages award on the market value of the truck at a point in time after the conversion had taken place, she relied on our established method of calculating damages for a conversion using the market value of the chattel and, based on the evidence in this particular case, we cannot say that there was reversible error in the trial justice’s damages determination.', '- 14 -', 'We would also note that, on appeal, plaintiff’s argument seems to be little more than an attempt to re-litigate this case. Her filings before this Court address only her disagreement with the factual findings of the trial justice. However, it is not our role to make new factual findings. Our role is confined to determining whether the trial justice committed clear error in her factual findings or misconceived or overlooked material evidence.', 'See Wellington Condominium Association, 68 A.3d at 599. We are entirely unable to say that the trial justice in the instant case committed any such error. Accordingly, we affirm the trial justice’s judgment in the instant case.', 'C', 'The Rule 60(b) Motion', 'The plaintiff next avers that, at the hearing on her post-trial Rule 60(b)(3) & (6) motion, she demonstrated that Mr. Main “outright lied” at the trial and that she should have been granted “relief for manifest injustice.”', 'Specifically, plaintiff contends that she demonstrated the following: (1) that Mr. Main stated at trial that he never agreed to the terms of the purported December 17, 2009 contract whereas a police report from the Hopkinton Police reflected the fact that defendant “went to the police with the December 17, 2009 agreement in hand and told the police he had typed up the agreement;” (2) that Mr. Main lied about the date on which he went to the police; (3) that Mr. Main returned the truck not because of threats by Ms. Turdo but, rather, due to the fact that the police advised him to return it; and (4) that Mr. Main had been convicted of committing four domestic offenses against Ms. Turdo, for which he received jail time and probation.', 'Rule 60(b)(3) provides that “[o]n motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or a party’s legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for * * * [f]raud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party * * *.”', 'Rule', '- 15 - 60(b)(6) allows for relief from a final judgment for “[a]ny other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.” It is our well-settled precedent that “[a] motion to vacate a judgment is left to the sound discretion of the trial justice and such a ruling will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.” Berman v. Sitrin, 101 A.3d 1251, 1260 (R.I. 2014) (quoting Malinou v. Seattle Savings Bank, 970 A.2d 6, 10 (R.I. 2009)). Moreover, our “review is limited to an examination of the decision to determine the correctness of the order granting or denying the motion, not the correctness of the original judgment.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'The trial justice in the instant case found no misrepresentations or misconduct on the part of the defendant that would allow for relief pursuant to Rule 60(b)(3). She further held that the plaintiff was not entitled to relief under Rule 60(b)(6) because that rule typically applies only in extraordinary circumstances and none were present in this case. See Allen ex rel. Allen v. South County Hospital, 945 A.2d 289, 297 (R.I. 2008) (“Rule 60(b)(6) was not intended to constitute a catchall and * * * circumstances must be extraordinary to justify relief.”) (internal quotation marks omitted). It was the opinion of the trial justice that the plaintiff was simply looking for a “do-over.” After our thorough review of the record in this case, we likewise are of the opinion that, in her Rule 60(b) motion and on appeal, the plaintiff appears to be seeking a “do-over” in view of the fact that she received an unfavorable result at trial. The misconduct or “lie[s]” which Ms. Turdo claims she demonstrated at the hearing on her Rule 60(b) motion did not sway the trial justice, and we cannot perceive any error in the trial justice’s application of Rule 60(b) to the instant case.

Joseph Perry appeals from the July 7, 2010 denial of his application for postconviction relief in the Providence County Superior Court.', 'This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties’ arguments (both written and oral), we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this appeal may be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'According to Mr. Perry’s application for postconviction relief and his filings before this Court, his criminal case originally went to trial in November of 1995.1 He was convicted by a jury of one count of conspiracy to commit assault with a dangerous weapon and one count of assault with a dangerous weapon. Mr. Perry was also charged with one count of first-degree 1', 'We note that the trial in November of 1995 is not the trial at issue in this case.', '-1- murder; however, according to Mr. Perry’s application for postconviction relief, the jury was “unable to reach a verdict” on the murder charge. This Court upheld his conviction on the conspiracy and assault charges in State v. Perry, 725 A.2d 264, 268 (R.I. 1999). A second jury trial on the first-degree murder charge was then held on September 21, 1998, and Mr. Perry was convicted by the jury of one count of first-degree murder; he was sentenced to life imprisonment on the murder charge.2 This Court denied Mr. Perry’s appeal from that conviction in State v. Perry, 770 A.2d 882, 887 (R.I. 2001).', 'On March 28, 2002, Mr. Perry filed an application for postconviction relief; he then filed an amended application in March of 2005 and a second amended application in March of 2010. In his application and the accompanying memorandum, Mr. Perry contends that he did not receive a fair trial in 1998 because the justice who presided over his second murder trial had, while in private practice, represented him in Family Court in 1978 and 1980, when Mr. Perry was a minor. Accordingly, Mr. Perry avers that that trial justice should have recused. Mr. Perry also alleges that his counsel at the second murder trial was ineffective because: (1) he did not seek the trial justice’s recusal; (2) he did not present evidence to support a diminished capacity defense; and (3) he did not allow Mr. Perry to testify on his own behalf at the trial.', 'On April 23, 2008, Mr. Perry’s court-appointed attorney submitted a no-merit memorandum and a motion to withdraw as counsel, pursuant to the requirements in Shatney v. State, 755 A.2d 130 (R.I. 2000). Mr. Perry’s attorney was allowed to withdraw at a hearing on the application for postconviction relief on April 30, 2008. Mr. Perry eventually retained new counsel, and a hearing was held on his application for postconviction relief on April 6, 2010. We relate below the salient aspects of what transpired at that hearing. 2', 'It is from this conviction that Mr. Perry seeks postconviction relief.', '-2-', 'A', 'The Testimony of Joseph Perry', 'Mr. Perry testified that the justice who presided over his second murder trial had represented him on a robbery charge when Mr. Perry was a juvenile. He stated that he did not realize that connection initially; however, he added that, about three days into the murder trial in September of 1998, his brother pointed it out to him. It was Mr. Perry’s further testimony that he then communicated his thought as to what he considered to be a potential conflict to his attorney the next day while meeting with him in the “cellblock.” Mr. Perry further stated that he told his attorney that he did not feel “comfortable” with the trial justice continuing to preside over the second murder trial.3 Mr. Perry stated: “I didn’t feel comfortable with him being there because he was only going to draw one conclusion in my mind and I didn’t believe it was going to give me a fair shake.” He testified that his attorney then told him that “they’re not going to change the judge in the middle of a trial.”', 'Mr. Perry was asked what he was seeking in the postconviction relief action, and he responded that he wanted “some kind of offer like they offered [his] co-defendant.” He further stated: “They offered me nothing, never offered me anything; some kind of relief;” he added, “I’m just looking for some kind of remedy.” It should be borne in mind, however, that on cross- examination, Mr. Perry expressly acknowledged that he had killed the victim.', 'On cross-examination, Mr. Perry was confronted with the fact that, in his filings in support of his application for postconviction relief, he had stated that, before the 1998 murder trial commenced, he knew that the justice who presided over that trial had represented him as a 3', 'We deem it important to note that, after an explanation by the hearing justice, Mr. Perry expressly waived his attorney-client privilege with respect to his communications with the attorney who served as his counsel for the second murder trial.', '-3- lawyer; that statement was contrary to his testimony during his direct examination. Mr. Perry additionally acknowledged on cross-examination that he never asked the attorney who represented him at his second murder trial to move for a mistrial or to “stand up and tell the judge, inform the judge” of Mr. Perry’s concerns with respect to the justice’s potential prejudice against him. When he was asked the following question: “[A]s far as you know [the trial justice] had no idea that he had formerly represented you * * * ?” Mr. Perry responded: “Not to my knowledge.”', 'B', 'The Testimony of Thomas Gatone', 'Thomas Gatone testified that, at the time of the hearing on the application for postconviction relief, in 2010, he had been recently paroled from the Adult Correctional Institutions.', 'He testified that, while in the cellblock during his own trial for robbery, he overheard a conversation between Mr. Perry and his lawyer in which Mr. Perry told his lawyer that “the judge represented him before, I guess when he was younger as a lawyer and that he thought that might be a conflict.” He testified that the conversation “stuck in [his] head” because he had a personal experience where he believed there was a conflict of interest present in a case in which he was involved. He also stated on direct examination that, after his robbery trial, he had not appeared before the Superior Court in connection with any further crimes.', 'On cross-examination, Mr. Gatone stated that the conversation which he overheard in the cellblock had taken place in 1996, while he was on trial for robbery. On redirect examination, Mr. Gatone conceded that he was not “clear on the date as far as the exact year.” Mr. Gatone stated as follows:', '“I have a hard time remembering long distance years apart; even', 'though I have my problem, I do remember the day we were in the', '-4-', 'cellblock and Mr. Perry talked about it. It could have been ’98,', '’96.” On recross-examination, he stated that, in fact, the conversation which he overheard had taken place in 1998; he added that he “made a mistake” when he said that it was in 1996. The date of the conversation about which Mr. Gatone was testifying was important because, as he conceded in his testimony, his sentencing at the conclusion of his robbery trial occurred on January 11, 1996, whereas Mr. Perry’s second murder trial was held in 1998; Mr. Gatone had testified on direct examination that he had not appeared before the Superior Court after his robbery trial in 1996. When he was later asked how many times he was brought back to the Superior Court building after his 1996 trial, he stated: “I can’t recall the days, exact days and months.” After being confronted with the problems in the timeline about which he was testifying, he added: “I was back in this court in ’98. I overturned my case. In 1998 there is a possible chance I was here on appeal for conflict of interest.”', 'C', 'The Testimony of the Attorney Who Represented Mr. Perry at his Second Murder Trial', 'The attorney testified that he remembered that he had represented Mr. Perry. However, he further stated that he did not have a recollection of any conversation taking place between Mr. Perry and himself, either before or during the second murder trial, with respect to any concerns about the justice assigned to preside over that trial; but he added that he “certainly d[id]n’t have a recollection of every conversation [he] had with Mr. Perry.” He reiterated that he had no recollection of the issue of the trial justice’s potential prejudice having been raised but could not “definitively” say that “nothing happened.”', 'The attorney then testified with respect to how he would have proceeded if Mr. Perry had indicated a concern about the trial justice’s impartiality. He stated that the first thing he would', '-5- have done would be to discuss that concern with the client and explain the advantages and disadvantages of raising it with the justice. He testified that how he would want to proceed might depend on the justice who had been assigned to preside over the trial. He stated that the justice assigned to preside over Mr. Perry’s second murder trial was “great;” he added that that justice was a “good judge for a homicide trial.” The attorney then reiterated in his testimony that he had no recollection of having discussed the issue of any possible prejudice with the trial justice at Mr. Perry’s second murder trial. When asked if he would have raised such an issue with a trial justice if his client insisted that he do so, he stated:', '“I would probably do it though I probably would theoretically take', 'the position that it’s a tactical decision that a lawyer has the right', 'to make. Probably if the client insisted I bring it to the judge’s', 'attention I would probably in a homicide case defer to the client', 'and bring it to the judge’s attention. If I thought it was unwise I', 'would do that only after a lot of conversation with the client * * *.” There were no further witnesses at the hearing. Following the submission of supplemental memoranda, the hearing justice ultimately issued a written decision on July 7, 2010, denying Mr. Perry’s application for postconviction relief.', 'D', 'The Postconviction Relief Decision', 'In his written decision denying the application for postconviction relief, the hearing justice began by noting that Mr. Perry did not dispute that he committed the homicide that was the basis of his first-degree murder conviction in his criminal case. The hearing justice then proceeded to make findings of fact. He found that the justice who presided over Mr. Perry’s second trial had, in fact, represented Mr. Perry while that justice was in private practice. However, he found that no connection with Mr. Perry was ever brought to the attention of the', '-6- justice presiding over the second murder trial, and he further specifically found that there was no evidence that that justice acted with any “prejudice, malice, or predisposition against Mr. Perry.”', 'The hearing justice further found that Mr. Perry “did not ask his attorney to tell the [trial justice] of [any] alleged conflict.” The hearing justice stated that the testimony of Mr. Perry and Mr. Gatone as to that point was “neither convincing nor credible.” In the hearing justice’s judgment, Mr. Gatone’s “demeanor, coupled with his contradiction of the dates of the alleged conversation * * * severely impinge upon his credibility.”', 'Additionally, the hearing justice characterized Mr. Perry’s testimony as “self-serving.” In contrast, the hearing justice found the testimony of the attorney who represented Mr. Perry at the second murder trial to be “highly credible.”', 'He noted that the attorney did not remember having any conversation about a “conflict” between Mr. Perry and the trial justice during the course of Mr. Perry’s second murder trial.', 'As it pertained to the merits of Mr. Perry’s application, the hearing justice found that Mr. Perry had failed to carry his burden of demonstrating ineffective assistance of counsel since there was no credible evidence that Mr. Perry ever told his attorney about his history with the justice presiding over the second murder trial. He further stated that the law in Rhode Island does not require a trial justice to recuse sua sponte under the particular circumstances of this case where there was no evidence that the justice who presided over the second murder trial even knew that he had represented Mr. Perry many years earlier while he was in private practice. The hearing justice added that it is customary for the party concerned about possible prejudice to raise that issue in a motion, which Mr. Perry did not do.4 4', 'It is worth noting that the hearing justice added that the recusal issue was not in Mr. Perry’s original application for postconviction relief but was only asserted when he later amended that application, many years after his conviction.', '-7-', 'A final judgment dismissing the application for postconviction relief was entered on January 5, 2012. Mr. Perry appealed the denial of his application for postconviction relief to this Court.', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'Mr. Perry contends on appeal that the justice who passed on his application for postconviction relief erred in denying his application for the following reasons: (1) the justice who presided over Mr. Perry’s second murder trial should have recused; (2) Mr. Perry received ineffective assistance of counsel at the second murder trial because counsel did not request that the justice recuse; and (3) the hearing justice who passed on his application for postconviction relief failed to consider Mr. Perry’s contention that his counsel at his second murder trial was also ineffective due to the fact that he did not introduce evidence to support a diminished capacity defense and he refused to allow Mr. Perry to testify on his own behalf.', 'III', 'Standard of Review', 'Postconviction relief, under G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-1, is “available to any person who has been convicted of a crime and who thereafter alleges * * * that the conviction violated the applicant’s constitutional rights * * *.” Merida v.

State, 935 A.2d 82, 85 (R.I. 2007).', 'IV', 'Analysis', 'A', 'Recusal', 'Mr. Perry contends that the justice who presided over his second murder trial should have recused due to the fact that he had previously served as Mr. Perry’s attorney when Mr. Perry was a juvenile; it is Mr. Perry’s position that, due to the trial justice’s failure to recuse, he did not receive a fair and impartial trial as guaranteed to him by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.', '-9-', 'We have stated that “[t]he customary manner in which one raises the issue of prejudice is by appropriate motion at trial, by a motion for a mistrial, or by a motion for disqualification of the justice presiding.”', 'State v. D’Amario, 568 A.2d 1383, 1385 (R.I. 1990); see State v. Nidever, 120 R.I. 767, 769, 390 A.2d 368, 369-70 (1978); see also State v. Buckley, 104 R.I. 317, 322, 244 A.2d 254, 257 (1968). Mr. Perry concedes that no such motion was filed during his second murder trial. Despite that fact, Mr. Perry seeks to have this Court declare that the trial justice should have recused sua sponte. We are unable to make such a declaration in this case.', 'In his filings before this Court, Mr. Perry expressly admits that “there is no clear obligation in Rhode Island to recuse sua sponte without * * * a motion.” Rather, he posits that there is an “implied duty” for a trial justice to recuse. He provides no precedent that supports that contention nor could we unearth any in the course of an extensive review of our precedent on the subject. The only case that Mr. Perry cites which is even arguably close to being somewhat on point is State v. Tucker, 625 A.2d 34, 36 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1993), which opinion specifically states that “defense counsel informed the judge that in 1987 the judge, while still an assistant prosecutor * * *, presented two cases which involved the defendant before the grand jury.” (Emphasis added.) The opinion in Tucker is obviously distinguishable from the instant case. In this case, the evidence elicited at the postconviction relief hearing established that any potential prejudice stemming from the trial justice’s previous representation of Mr. Perry was not made known to the trial justice at any point during the second murder trial. Additionally, the hearing justice noted, in his July 7, 2010 written decision, that Mr. Perry did not even “suggest” during his postconviction relief case that the trial justice who presided over his second murder trial even “remembered” him. Thus, it is apparent to this Court that there is an utter lack of any evidence that the trial justice in question was even aware of his history with', '- 10 - Mr. Perry or any potential prejudice therefrom. Accordingly, we are unable to perceive any error in the hearing justice’s denial of Mr. Perry’s application for postconviction relief on the grounds that the trial justice at Mr. Perry’s second murder trial should have recused.', 'B', 'Ineffective Assistance of Counsel', 'This Court reviews an allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel under the criteria set forth by the United States Supreme Court in its opinion in Strickland v.

Mr. Perry also avers that his counsel should have “taken reasonable steps to investigate the backgrounds of Mr. Perry and [the trial justice].”', 'Initially, we note that the hearing justice found as a fact that Mr. Perry did not ask his attorney for his second murder trial to inform the trial justice that he had previously represented Mr. Perry and that there was no credible evidence that Mr. Perry ever even told his attorney about his history with the trial justice. The hearing justice made those determinations based on his finding that neither Mr. Perry’s testimony nor Mr. Gatone’s testimony was convincing or credible, due to the inconsistencies in Mr. Gatone’s testimony and the self-serving nature of Mr. Perry’s testimony. By contrast, the hearing justice did find the testimony of Mr. Perry’s attorney at his second murder trial to be highly credible when the attorney testified that he did not remember having any conversation with Mr. Perry regarding any potential prejudice on the part of the trial justice. Upon our review of the record, we can find no evidence to suggest that the hearing justice’s credibility determinations were not well founded. Accordingly, we are firmly in agreement with the hearing justice’s conclusion that Mr. Perry’s counsel could not possibly have been ineffective in failing to raise the recusal issue if he was never aware that a connection existed between his client and the trial justice.', 'Mr. Perry makes a further allegation on appeal that his attorney should have investigated the backgrounds of Mr. Perry and the trial justice to determine if there was a connection between them that might have caused the justice to be prejudiced against him. In our opinion, that contention merits only a brief response: such a requirement, for which no authority has been cited, would be infeasible and unduly burdensome on the attorney. For that reason, an attorney’s', '- 12 - failure to conduct such an investigation certainly would not be an error so serious as to amount to a denial of the effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment. See Linde, 78 A.3d at 745.', 'Accordingly, we necessarily conclude that the hearing justice did not err when he determined that Mr. Perry’s counsel was not ineffective for failure to raise the recusal issue before the trial justice at Mr. Perry’s second murder trial.', '2. Failure to Introduce Evidence of Diminished Capacity and Not Allowing Mr. Perry to', 'Testify', 'Mr. Perry’s final argument on appeal is that the hearing justice erred in failing to address his contentions that his counsel for his second murder trial was ineffective due to the fact that he did not present evidence relative to a diminished capacity defense and did not allow Mr. Perry to testify in his own defense.', 'We have repeatedly stated that on an application for postconviction relief “the burden of proof resides with the applicant, who must establish ‘by a preponderance of the evidence, that such relief is warranted.’” Lyons v. State, 43 A.3d 62, 65 (R.I. 2012) (quoting DeCiantis v. State, 24 A.3d 557, 569 (R.I. 2011)); see Brown v. State, 32 A.3d 901, 907 (R.I. 2011); State v. Laurence, 18 A.3d 512, 521 (R.I. 2011); see also Brown, 964 A.2d at 526; Chalk, 949 A.2d at 398.', 'We acknowledge that, in his application for postconviction relief, Mr. Perry did allege ineffective assistance of counsel with respect to: (1) the lack of evidence of diminished capacity at his second murder trial; and (2) his not having been allowed to testify in his own defense at his second murder trial. However, that is the extent of Mr. Perry’s efforts with regard to those two contentions. He did not present any evidence with respect to those contentions at the hearing on', '- 13 - his application for postconviction relief. In fact, not only did he not provide evidence, he did not even raise or discuss either of those contentions before the hearing justice. We specifically note that Mr. Perry had the opportunity to question his attorney for his second murder trial with respect to the diminished capacity defense and the issue of Mr. Perry testifying in his own defense, but he did not avail himself of that opportunity. Accordingly, we are led to the ineluctable conclusion that Mr. Perry did not sustain his burden of proof as it relates to his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel with respect to those two issues. As such, in our judgment, the hearing justice did not err in failing to address those contentions in his decision on Mr. Perry’s application for postconviction relief.', 'V', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court denying Mr. Perry’s application for postconviction relief.

65,: v. : Philip A. McAndrew. :,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. The defendant, Philip A. McAndrew (McAndrew or defendant) is before the Supreme Court on appeal from an order of a justice of the Family Court, declining to exercise jurisdiction over an ongoing custody dispute between the defendant and his former wife, Valerie M. Hogan1 (Hogan or plaintiff), on the ground of forum non conveniens. For the reasons set forth within, we vacate the judgment of the Family Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'The parties, both dual citizens of the United States and the Republic of Ireland (Ireland), married in 1996. Their son, P.,2 was born in 1999, C. arrived in 2000, and E., the youngest, was born in 2004. McAndrew and Hogan chose to part ways in 2006, and a divorce was granted in Rhode Island Family Court in 2008. In accordance with a property settlement agreement drafted 1', 'After the divorce, plaintiff resumed use of her maiden name. 2', 'To afford the family a measure of privacy, we honor McAndrew’s request to identify the children by their first initials.', '-1- by Hogan’s attorney, the parties share joint custody of their three children, with Hogan having physical placement. The parties agreed that Hogan could return to Ireland with the children as early as 2009 and that McAndrew would exercise visitation with them in the United States and in Ireland. As part of the agreement, the parties stipulated that all future child-custody disputes “shall remain under the jurisdiction of the [Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1738A], [the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), G.L. 1956 chapter 14.1 of title 15,] and that of the Rhode Island Family Court * * *.” The property settlement agreement subsequently ripened into a final judgment of divorce, which included the agreed-upon forum-selection clause; it was entered by consent.', 'Hogan relocated to Ireland in 2009 with the children, while McAndrew remained in Rhode Island. He visited the children regularly in Ireland, and they spent two weeks with him in Rhode Island each summer. The children were with McAndrew in Rhode Island for their summer holiday in July 2014 when the current dispute before the Court arose. According to McAndrew, the two oldest children had alleged that Hogan had subjected them to physical and emotional abuse. The Irish Child and Family Agency (TUSLA) had become involved after P. reported an incident of alleged abuse to his school counselors. McAndrew claimed that P. and C. did not wish to return to their mother in Ireland. The two children and their younger sister, E., were scheduled to depart for Ireland, with Hogan, on July 16.', 'On July 9, 2014, McAndrew filed three motions in the Rhode Island Family Court: an ex parte emergency motion to modify custody and placement; a motion for an in camera interview of the three children; and a motion for an order requiring Hogan to submit to a mental health examination.', 'The court granted the ex parte emergency motion.', 'However, on July 16, notwithstanding the marital settlement agreement and the final judgment of divorce, Hogan', '-2- sought to dismiss the action on the grounds that the Family Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the children had resided in Ireland continuously for more than five years. She also moved to vacate the ex parte order. The next day, July 17, at the expedited hearing on Hogan’s motion to vacate the ex parte order,3 the Family Court justice raised the issue of whether the Family Court was an inconvenient forum to hear the case. The court continued the matter to September 12 for a hearing on the issues of subject matter jurisdiction and forum non conveniens. 3', 'On July 17, 2014, the Family Court vacated its ex parte order based on the hearing justice’s finding that an emergency order was no longer warranted. The parties reached an agreement that P. would remain with his father until at least September 12, the date of the hearing on jurisdiction and forum non conveniens, and that he may enroll in school in Rhode Island. Also by agreement, C. would extend her visit with McAndrew in Rhode Island until mid-August. C. subsequently returned to Ireland to live with Hogan, although not on the date initially scheduled. By consent order, P. remained in Rhode Island with his father.', 'On January 28, 2015, with C. in Ireland, McAndrew filed a motion in this Court seeking an emergency order granting him temporary custody and placement of C., or, alternatively, a limited remand to the Family Court. In support of his motion, McAndrew alleged that Hogan had “abandoned” C. at Hogan’s brother’s home in Ireland on Christmas Eve after an argument between the mother and daughter. McAndrew contended that C. had been residing with her uncle since that date but was at imminent risk of being placed into Irish foster care. He stated that TUSLA had recommended placement with McAndrew in the United States. In support of her objection to McAndrew’s motion, Hogan again asserted that the Irish courts were the appropriate forum to hear the matter. On January 29, 2015, this Court remanded the case to the Family Court for the limited purpose of entertaining McAndrew’s most recent motion, and the Family Court subsequently held a hearing. It was conceded at oral argument that a social worker employed by TUSLA who had been working with the family testified via teleconference from Ireland. Hogan, who was also in Ireland at the time, refused to testify telephonically and did not participate as a witness. Exhibits that were before the Family Court justice included reports by TUSLA transmitted from Ireland. On March 11, the Family Court granted McAndrew’s motion to modify the custody and placement of C. At oral argument, counsel for both parties confirmed that C. and her older brother, P., continued to reside in Rhode Island with McAndrew, while E. remained in Ireland with Hogan.', '-3-', 'Meanwhile, Hogan turned to the High Court of Ireland (Irish High Court) for relief and instituted a special summons under Irish domestic legislation.4 In the special summons, Hogan sought “a declaration that Ireland is the place of habitual residence of the children, and that the Irish High Court has jurisdiction in all matters pertaining to their welfare, custody[,] and access.” On September 9, 2014, three days before the hearing scheduled in Family Court, the Irish High Court granted McAndrew’s motion to stay the special summons proceedings. The Irish High Court concluded that “if [the Rhode Island Family Court] declines jurisdiction, the Irish proceedings will progress. If [the Rhode Island Family Court] assumes jurisdiction, the question of a stay of the Irish proceedings, pending a determination of the substantive matter, may come to be made in Ireland * * *.”', 'Back in Rhode Island, on September 12 and 15, 2014, the Family Court heard the parties on the issue of jurisdiction. The following facts gleaned from testimony were not disputed. With the exception of yearly visits with their father, the children lived continuously in Ireland with Hogan from January 2009 to July 2014, while McAndrew has resided in the United States. Despite this distance, McAndrew spends multiple weeks with the children each year, with most of their time together being in Ireland. The children have attended Irish schools exclusively from the time they moved to Ireland until August 2014, when P. enrolled in school in Rhode Island. Both Hogan and the children have been receiving support services through TUSLA over the past few months. With the exception of health-care professionals who cared for the children during 4', 'Hogan also sought relief under the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, but the Irish High Court concluded that, “for the present purposes, * * * the proceedings brought by [Hogan] are not properly [characterized] as Hague Convention proceedings.”', '-4- their stays in Rhode Island, all of the current medical doctors, psychotherapists, and social workers for the children, Hogan, or both are based in Ireland.', 'McAndrew testified on cross-examination that the parties’ agreement that the Rhode Island Family Court would maintain jurisdiction was “vital” to his decision to assent to the children’s relocation to Ireland. He testified that “[w]ithout it I would never have agreed to let them go. This was a consent agreement, and it was predicated on that very statement.” He stated that allowing Irish courts to have jurisdiction would have been a “deal breaker,” because it was his contention that Irish courts generally do not recognize a divorced father’s right to the joint custody of his children.', 'McAndrew further testified that he is a physician and a partner in a medical practice. He generally, but not always, receives a biweekly stipend regardless of whether he works during that period. McAndrew also testified to the approximate fair market value of his home, his monthly rental income, and the value of his 401(k) and investment accounts. He receives four weeks of vacation time each year. McAndrew also identified multiple potential witnesses based in Rhode Island who could testify to the quality of his relationship with his children. He testified that he was willing to cover the expenses of any witness who would travel to Rhode Island to testify in Family Court. He also asserted that certain testimony could be provided by teleconference.', 'Hogan testified that she is a per diem nurse at a local hospital. On average, Hogan’s wages are eight times lower than McAndrew’s. She does not receive paid vacation time from her employer and is not paid when she does not work. She recounted the difficulties she experienced in securing child care when she had to travel to Rhode Island for court appearances.', 'After hearing testimony from both parties, the hearing justice issued a bench decision in which she declared that the Family Court retained exclusive, continuing jurisdiction pursuant to', '-5- the UCCJEA.5 However, the hearing justice went on to conclude that Ireland was a more appropriate forum for the dispute to be heard and declined to exercise jurisdiction on the ground of forum non conveniens.', 'An order was entered in accordance with the bench decision.6 McAndrew timely appealed.', 'Before this Court, McAndrew argues that the hearing justice abused her discretion by not giving proper weight to (1) the mutually agreed upon forum-selection clause set forth in the property settlement agreement and in the final judgment and (2) additional factors enumerated under the UCCJEA.', 'Standard of Review', '“The application of the doctrine of forum non conveniens leaves much to the discretion of the [lower] court.” Kedy v. A.W. Chesterton Co., 946 A.2d 1171, 1185-86 (R.I. 2008). This Court will not disturb a decision to grant or deny a motion to dismiss on the grounds of forum non conveniens absent a showing of an abuse of discretion. Id. at 1186. However, this standard does not suggest that this Court merely endorses the findings made by the lower court. As the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has explained: 5', 'General Laws 1956 § 15-14.1-14(a) provides in pertinent part:', '“[A] court of this state which has made a child custody determination consistent', 'with this chapter has exclusive, continuing jurisdiction over the determination', 'until: (1) A court of this state determines that neither [sic] the child, the child’s', 'parents, and any person acting as a parent do not have a significant connection', 'with this state and that substantial evidence is no longer available in this state', 'concerning the child’s care, protection, training, and personal relationships; or (2)', 'A court of this state or a court of another state determines that the child [and] the', 'child’s parents * * * do not presently reside in this state.” 6', 'Because this order possesses obvious elements of finality, we consider it a final order. See McAuslan v. McAuslan, 34 R.I. 462, 472, 83 A. 837, 841 (1912).', '-6-', '“Judicial discretion is necessarily broad—but it is not', 'absolute. Abuse occurs when a material factor deserving', 'significant weight is ignored, when an improper factor is relied', 'upon, or when all proper and no improper factors are assessed, but', 'the court makes a serious mistake in weighing them.” Independent', 'Oil and Chemical Workers of Quincy, Inc. v. Procter & Gamble', 'Manufacturing Co., 864 F.2d 927, 929 (1st Cir. 1988).', 'Discussion', 'This Court accords great sanctity to final judgments entered by consent of the parties. See McCulloch v. McCulloch, 69 A.3d 810, 825 (R.I. 2013). Such judgments “cannot be opened, changed, or set aside without the assent of the parties in the absence of fraud, mutual mistake or actual absence of consent.” McEntee v. Davis, 861 A.2d 459, 463 (R.I. 2004) (quoting DeFusco v. Giorgio, 440 A.2d 727, 729 (R.I. 1982)). Likewise, stipulations between the parties are accorded equal weight. In re McBurney Law Services, Inc., 798 A.2d 877, 881-82 (R.I. 2002). Neither final judgments entered by consent nor stipulations may “be set aside simply because a litigant no longer wants to be bound by [their] terms.” Id. at 882.', 'In an ordinary case, a final judgment entered by consent would be conclusive and only could be set aside pursuant to Rule 60 of the Family Court Rules of Domestic Relations Procedure. See McBurney, 798 A.2d at 882 (citing Richardson v. Smith, 691 A.2d 543, 546 (R.I. 1997)). However, where the final judgment selects the forum to hear a child-custody dispute, the provisions of the UCCJEA impose a narrow statutory limitation on the enforceability of the judgment. See § 15-14.1-19.', 'We therefore are called upon, once again, to scrutinize the jurisdictional aspects of the UCCJEA.', 'See, e.g., Sidell v. Sidell, 18 A.3d 499, 504-08 (R.I. 2011).', '“The National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws promulgated the UCCJEA in 1997 ‘to deal with the problems of competing jurisdictions entering conflicting interstate child custody', '-7- orders, forum shopping, and the drawn out and complex child custody legal proceedings often encountered by parties where multiple states are involved.’” Friedman v.

The Family Court justice must conclude both that the court “is an inconvenient forum under the circumstances and that a court of another state [or a foreign tribunal] is a more appropriate forum.” Section 15-14.1-19(a) (emphasis added). Subsection (b) of § 15-14.1-19 provides that, before the Family Court decides that Rhode Island is an inconvenient forum, the court must address whether it would be “appropriate for a court of another state to exercise jurisdiction.” This determination is informed by allowing “the parties to submit information” and considering “all relevant factors,” including eight factors enumerated in that subsection. Id. If the court concludes, based on an evaluation of the evidence, that a more appropriate forum exists, the court then proceeds to the second step of the analysis, in which it considers whether this state would be an inconvenient forum under the circumstances of the case at hand.', '-9-', 'Section 15-14.1-19 of the UCCJEA codifies the common law doctrine of forum non conveniens9 and closely tracks the common law test that courts must undertake when determining whether to decline jurisdiction. See Kedy, 946 A.2d at 1183 (application of the common law doctrine requires a “two-prong analysis” in which the court first must determine whether an alternative forum exists and then must assess the level of inconvenience posed by the present forum). Adopted by this Court in Kedy, “[t]he [common law] doctrine of forum non conveniens is ‘an equitable principle by which a court having jurisdiction may decline to exercise it on considerations of convenience, efficiency, and justice.’” Id. at 1178 (quoting AT & T Corp. v. Sigala, 549 S.E.2d 373, 375 (Ga. 2001)). The doctrine is available when the present forum “is significantly inconvenient and the ends of justice would be better served if the action were brought and tried in another forum.” Id. (emphasis added). Accordingly, declining to hear a matter over which the court possesses exclusive, continuing jurisdiction is not a determination that a court should undertake lightly. It should be done only after strict adherence to the statute and careful analysis of the evidence.', 'With this in mind, we turn our attention to the Family Court decision to decline jurisdiction on the ground of inconvenient forum. In reaching her decision, the hearing justice properly referenced each of the eight factors enumerated in subsection (b) of § 15-14.1-19. She found that the first factor lacked relevance since both parties had stipulated that domestic 9', 'See UCCJEA prefatory note, 9 U.L.A. 650 (1997) (UCCJEA “harmonize[s] the law on * * * forum non conveniens”); see also Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act § 7 cmt., 9 U.L.A. 499 (1968) (applying the common law principle of inconvenient forum to the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA)); Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction & Enforcement Act § 207 cmt., 9 U.L.A. 683 (1997) (retaining the focus of the UCCJA, predecessor to the UCCJEA).', '- 10 - violence was not an issue. She found that the second factor “weigh[ed] in favor of declining jurisdiction and allowing Ireland to assume jurisdiction” because the children had resided in Ireland since 2009.', 'For the third factor—distance between the courts—the hearing justice observed that one of the parties will have to embark on a transatlantic flight regardless of which court eventually hears the case on its merits. Nevertheless, the hearing justice weighed this factor in favor of Hogan, given her struggles with child care and her employment situation. On the issue of the parties’ relative financial circumstances—the fourth factor—the hearing justice noted that McAndrew was in a stronger financial position than Hogan. Thus, she interpreted the fourth factor in favor of declining jurisdiction.', 'Turning to the fifth factor—“[a]ny agreement of the parties as to which state should assume jurisdiction,” § 15-14.1-19(b)(5)—she noted:', '“[T]he forum[-]selection clause is one out of eight factors.', '“In other words, just because it’s in a property settlement', 'agreement doesn’t make it absolutely binding. The Court must', 'consider all of the factors in the statute, particularly in matters', 'relating to children where the court always has final decision-', 'making authority. Clearly the parties here did have an agreement', 'in the final judgment and in the property settlement agreement that', 'Rhode Island would maintain jurisdiction; and, therefore, this', 'factor weighs in favor of Rhode Island maintaining jurisdiction.”', 'Next, the hearing justice considered the sixth factor—the nature and location of the evidence required to resolve the pending litigation. In doing so, she entertained many of the factors this Court set forth in Pettinato v. Pettinato, 582 A.2d 909, 913-14 (R.I. 1990), since the Pettinato factors would govern the court’s substantive analysis of McAndrew’s motions for a change in placement if the Family Court were to retain jurisdiction. In particular, the hearing justice observed that two of the three children were located in Ireland, as was the evidence related to their adjustment to home, school, and community. Since Hogan’s fitness as a parent', '- 11 - would lie at the center of any inquiry on the merits, the hearing justice observed that the majority of potential witnesses who could attest to the children’s relationship with their mother resided in Ireland. She also noted that Ireland was the home base for most potential witnesses who could testify to the state of Hogan’s mental health. Accordingly, she concluded that the sixth factor “weighs most heavily” toward declining jurisdiction.', 'The hearing justice found that the seventh factor—the ability of each court to decide the matter expeditiously—tilted neither in favor of retaining jurisdiction nor declining it. Finally, the court found that the eighth factor—each court’s respective familiarity with the litigation— tilted “somewhat in favor of Rhode Island” yet not “heavily” because, although the divorce had been finalized in Family Court, the hearing justice herself had not presided over the matter until the most recent round of motions.', 'After laying out each of the eight statutory factors, the hearing justice stated:', '“In reviewing all of these factors and in considering all of them,', 'the Court must conclude that the weight of * * * the statutory', 'factors[ ] compels, and particularly where the evidence is located', 'for those motions which are substantive, that the Court must', 'decline to exercise jurisdiction in this matter, and that the more', 'appropriate forum for this matter to be heard would be Ireland.” We review the decision in light of the two-step analysis prescribed by § 15-14.1-19 of the UCCJEA.', 'I. More Appropriate Forum', 'We first consider the factor that lies at the heart of McAndrew’s appeal, “[a]ny agreement of the parties as to which state should assume jurisdiction,” § 15-14.1-19(b)(5), and the hearing justice’s treatment of that factor. This Court previously touched upon the role of forum-selection clauses under the UCCJEA in Sidell. In that case, the defendant father, a former resident of Rhode Island, filed post-divorce motions concerning child-custody and support orders issued by', '- 12 - the Rhode Island Family Court. Sidell, 18 A.3d at 502-03. However, at the time the defendant filed his motions, both parents and the child no longer lived in Rhode Island. Id. at 505. The defendant contended, inter alia, that the Family Court was vested with jurisdiction because the parties had stipulated in their marital settlement agreement that Rhode Island would retain exclusive jurisdiction over the matter. Id. at 504. Since neither parent nor the child resided in Rhode Island, this Court determined that Rhode Island courts lacked exclusive, continuing jurisdiction under § 15-14.1-14(a)(2). Sidell, 18 A.3d at 505, 508. We concluded that a forum- selection clause does not confer a court with subject matter jurisdiction when such jurisdiction otherwise is absent. Id. at 508. However, we noted that, in situations where a court is, in fact, vested with subject matter jurisdiction, “[a]n enforceable forum-selection clause * * * settles the proper venue for the case and prevents ‘a party that has agreed to be bound * * * [from] * * * assert[ing] forum non conveniens as a ground for dismissing a suit brought in the chosen forum.’” Id. at 507 (quoting American Biophysics Corp. v. Dubois Marine Specialties, 411 F. Supp. 2d 61, 62 (D.R.I. 2006)). In the case before us, unlike the custody dispute in Sidell, the Family Court has exclusive, continuing jurisdiction over this dispute. The issue before us presents precisely the scenario envisioned in Sidell.', 'The Family Court justice addressed Sidell briefly in her bench decision.', 'She acknowledged that parties may enter into a forum-selection agreement when the court retains subject matter jurisdiction but that such an agreement constitutes only one of the eight factors listed in § 15-14.1-19(b). In her decision, the Family Court justice overlooked McAndrew’s testimony that the forum-selection clause had been a predominant factor in his agreement to allow the children to move to Ireland with their mother and that the parties had entered into the agreement in anticipation of their relocation. The hearing justice also failed to address the nature', '- 13 - of the agreement as a final judgment by consent and the high value that is conferred upon such judgments. We deem these to be material factors deserving significant weight, but which were ignored by the hearing justice. See Independent Oil and Chemical Workers of Quincy, Inc., 864 F.2d at 929.', 'We next consider the hearing justice’s treatment of the seventh factor—“the ability of the court of each state to decide the issue expeditiously and the procedures necessary to present the evidence.” Section 15-14.1-19(b)(7). We begin by noting that the children are not living in another state but have relocated to a foreign country. The hearing justice noted the paucity of evidence before the court regarding the ability of the court in Ireland to hear and decide this case. She observed that “the only evidence the [Family] Court has of * * * proceedings in Ireland” is the Irish High Court decision. She calculated the amount of time that elapsed between the filing of the special summons by Hogan on July 30, 2014, and the decision issued by the Irish High Court on September 9.', 'Based on this information, the hearing justice concluded that the proceedings in Ireland would be expeditious and consequently that the seventh factor was of equal weight.10 The hearing justice made no note of the procedures necessary to present the evidence in Irish courts, nor was such evidence before the Family Court. In particular, neither party provided the court with a clear understanding about an issue of particular concern to McAndrew—whether the courts in Ireland would recognize an American joint-custody arrangement—nor could the parties do so on appeal to this Court. Moreover, there was no 10', 'We note that, although the hearing justice had acknowledged elsewhere in her decision that the Limerick District Court would hear the substantive matter should the Rhode Island Family Court decline jurisdiction, she failed to consider whether the Limerick District Court would be equally as expeditious as the Irish High Court that had issued the judgment on the summons. There was no evidence before the court to support such a determination.', '- 14 - evidence before the Family Court—and the hearing justice did not inquire—whether the wishes of the children entangled in custody disputes are relevant or even considered by the Irish courts.11 The dearth of information before the Family Court prompts us to conclude that the hearing justice improperly determined that the seventh factor weighed equally in favor of Ireland and Rhode Island. See Independent Oil and Chemical Workers of Quincy, Inc., 864 F.2d at 929.', 'We pause to stress that our concern over the inadequacy of evidence before the Family Court on this point bears no reflection upon our confidence in the ability of the judicial system in the Republic of Ireland to resolve custody disputes impartially or expeditiously. Much like the “best interests of the child” standard employed by the Family Court, see, e.g., Chiappone v. Chiappone, 984 A.2d 32, 38 (R.I. 2009), Ireland has a long-established tradition of recognizing the welfare of the children as “the first and paramount consideration” in the determination of custody disputes.12 Our research instructs us that joint custody such as that currently held by McAndrew and Hogan is available by statute and granted regularly in Ireland.13 Irish statutory authority provides that a father maintains guardianship of his minor children following divorce 11', 'At oral argument before this Court, the parties disclosed that there may be legislation moving through the Irish Parliament that, if approved by the Irish High Court, would give voice to children in custody disputes.

With the exception of the sixth factor—“[t]he nature and location of the evidence required to resolve the pending litigation,” § 15-14.1-19(b)(6)—the hearing justice appears to have given equal weight to most of the factors and then based her conclusion on the forum with the greatest number of factors in its favor. She did not consider the interplay among the factors. She also found that the sixth factor—the location of the social service workers and the location of two (now one) of the children in Ireland—was of foremost importance in deciding that Ireland was the most appropriate forum. However, she did not set forth her reasons for doing so and overlooked McAndrew’s contention that testimony from witnesses in Ireland could be obtained through teleconference or that written reports could be transmitted electronically. 16 In reaching the conclusion that Ireland constituted a more appropriate forum, the hearing justice overlooked 14', 'Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996 § 10(2) (Act No. 33/1996) (Ir.), available at http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1996/act/33/enacted/en/print; see also Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 § 6(1) (“The father and mother of an infant shall be guardians of the infant jointly.”). 15', 'Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 § 11(1), (2)(a). 16', 'We note that, although we benefit from hindsight not available to the hearing justice at the time she declined jurisdiction, the transatlantic nature of the evidence did not impede the ability of the court to conduct a hearing on McAndrew’s emergency motion for custody and placement of C. in January 2015. As we discussed in a footnote above, the court heard the testimony of a key witness in Ireland through teleconference, and evidence that originated in Ireland was sent to the parties in Rhode Island to be introduced as exhibits.', '- 16 - and misconceived material evidence, and she gave improper weight to the seventh factor for which there was insufficient evidence and the record otherwise was silent. She also overlooked the fact that the agreement between the parties had ripened into a final judgment and served as a crucial condition for McAndrew’s consent to his children relocating to Ireland, which merited at least some deference from the court.', 'II. Convenience of Rhode Island as a Forum', 'As we elucidated above, the inquiry under § 15-14.1-19 of the UCCJEA requires a two- part analysis. The court first must determine that a more appropriate forum exists. Upon reaching such a conclusion, the court only may decline jurisdiction if it makes a separate finding that Rhode Island is an inconvenient forum to hear the matter. The record indicates that the hearing justice performed only the first step set forth in § 15-14.1-19. She merely determined that the weight of the statutory factors required the court to decline jurisdiction in favor of Ireland. Absent from the decision is an independent finding that Rhode Island was “significantly inconvenient and [that] the ends of justice would be better served if the action were brought and tried in another forum.” Kedy, 946 A.2d at 1178. Even when reviewed as a whole, there is no determination that it would be inconvenient or unjust to proceed in Rhode Island, only that Rhode Island was not as convenient a forum as Ireland. A court may not decline jurisdiction under the UCCJEA merely because another forum of equal or greater convenience exists.', 'We therefore are of the opinion that the hearing justice abused her discretion in executing both steps of the necessary two-part analysis under § 15-14.1-19 of the UCCJEA and by subsequently declining jurisdiction on the ground of forum non conveniens.', '- 17 -', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth above, we vacate the judgment of the Family Court. The case is remanded to the Family Court for hearing on the defendant’s motion to modify custody and placement and for further proceedings in accordance with this decision. The papers shall be returned to the Family Court.', 'Justice Flaherty did not participate.', 'Chief Justice Suttell, concurring in part and dissenting in part. Although I concur with the majority’s conclusion that the judgment of the Family Court should be vacated, I depart somewhat from its reasoning. Perhaps my quarrel with the majority opinion is more form than substance. Nevertheless, I believe that the hearing justice appropriately considered the statutory factors set forth in G.L. 1956 § 15-14.1-19(b) and that she did not abuse her discretion in finding that Ireland was the more appropriate forum. I agree with the majority, however, that the hearing justice did not perform the second step of the two-part analysis required by the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act’s (UCCJEA) forum non conveniens inquiry as set forth in § 15-14.1-19—she did not make an independent finding that Rhode Island is an inconvenient forum.', 'Section 15-14.1-19(a) provides that the Family Court “may decline to exercise its jurisdiction at any time if it determines that [1] it is an inconvenient forum under the circumstances and [2] that a court of another state [or foreign country in this instance] is a more appropriate forum.”', 'Under § 15-14.1-19(b), the court must first determine “whether it is appropriate for a court of another state [or foreign country] to exercise jurisdiction.” The statute further enumerates eight non-exclusive factors that the court “shall consider.” As the majority', '- 18 - opinion acknowledges, the hearing justice “properly referenced” all eight factors in reaching her conclusion that Ireland was the more appropriate jurisdiction. Although I might have weighed the various factors differently than the hearing justice did, her finding in this regard was, in my judgment, well within the ambit of her discretion.', 'To be sure, the hearing justice did not articulate the specific significance she ascribed to each factor. Nevertheless, I believe that the fair inferences that can be drawn from her decision indicate that she did appropriately weigh them in making her determination. She considered that all three children had lived in Ireland for five and a half years “especially during the children’s growing years” from “young children to adolescence.”', 'In discussing the third factor—the distances between the courts—she noted that defendant testified that he typically travels to Ireland at least three times a year.', 'She also compared the difficulty to each party that transatlantic travel for court hearings would necessitate. The plaintiff worked at a local hospital on a per-diem basis and was unable to get a job with vacation time; defendant received a biweekly stipend from his medical practice “whether he works or not” as long as the funds were available. In addition, the hearing justice found that “the child care problems weigh more heavily on the [p]laintiff than they do on the [d]efendant if travel is required for court hearings,” noting that plaintiff testified that she had difficulty finding someone to care for the two children who were then living with her in Ireland, whereas defendant “lives with his significant other who presumably * * * would be available to stay with [P.] if the defendant had to travel to Ireland.”', 'As for the parties’ financial circumstances, the hearing justice found that defendant was in a better situation than plaintiff. Specifically, she stated that defendant was a partner in a medical practice receiving a biweekly stipend of $5,500 when funds were available and that he had not received the stipend four to five times in 2014. He also had a 401(k) plan with an', '- 19 - approximate balance of $400,000 and another investment account with approximately $25,000. The hearing justice noted that defendant testified he would pay the travel expenses of all witnesses who might have to travel to Rhode Island. The plaintiff worked as a registered nurse on a per-diem basis, earning approximately $340 per week. The hearing justice further found that plaintiff had no ability to pay her own travel and hotel expenses, stating that plaintiff had had to borrow funds from her brother to retain a barrister and solicitor in Ireland.', 'The majority takes particular issue with the hearing justice’s treatment of the fifth factor—any agreement of the parties—holding that she overlooked defendant’s testimony that the forum selection clause was the sine qua non of his willingness to execute the property settlement agreement and to allow the children to move to Ireland with plaintiff. Clearly, an agreement by the parties in a child custody dispute as to which court should exercise jurisdiction is a significant factor; it is not dispositive, however. The hearing justice stated, correctly I believe, that “just because it’s in a property settlement agreement doesn’t make it absolutely binding. The [c]ourt must consider all of the factors in the statute, particularly in matters relating to children where the court always has final decision-making authority.” I fail to see, however, why a party’s motivation for entering into the agreement should give it enhanced significance. No matter what the inducement, it is a binding contract—indeed in this case it had ripened into a final judgment—and, as such, it is entitled to due consideration. Under the UCCJEA forum non conveniens calculus, however, it is but one of the factors that must be considered.', 'It is the sixth factor—location of the evidence—on which the hearing justice placed the greatest emphasis. In so doing, she considered the location of the evidence relative to the factors set forth in Pettinato v. Pettinato, 582 A.2d 909, 913-14 (R.I. 1990) that would come into play in a change-of-placement hearing. She considered the fact that at that time two of the children', '- 20 - resided with their mother in Ireland and that one of defendant’s primary allegations supporting a change of placement was the children’s deteriorating relationship with their mother. Accordingly, she reasoned, “[v]irtually everybody involved with this family who could testify to the [p]laintiff’s relationship with the children, which is one of the mainstays of the [d]efendant’s motion, they’re all in Ireland.” So too, she found, was all of the evidence concerning the children’s adjustment to their Irish home, school, and community. The hearing justice further indicated that plaintiff’s mental health would be a major issue and that all of the evidence pertaining thereto would necessarily be in Ireland, including two therapists to whom either she or the children had been referred by “Tusla,” the Irish Child and Family Agency. The hearing justice also considered that all evidence relating to the stability of the children’s home environment would be located in Ireland.', 'The hearing justice next addressed the ability of each court “to decide the issue expeditiously and the procedures necessary to present the evidence.” Based upon the little evidence presented to the court, she found this factor to be neutral. The majority concludes that the lack of information about Irish courts should weigh in favor of Rhode Island exercising jurisdiction. I agree. The only information before the court regarding the judicial process in Ireland concerned the proceedings before the High Court of Ireland. The hearing justice noted the time that had elapsed between the filing of a special summons on July 30, 2014, and the rendering of a “judgment” on September 9, 2014, remarking “[t]hat’s pretty quick action. It certainly was expeditious.” The appropriate forum for the custody proceedings in Ireland, however, would presumably be the Limerick District Court, not the High Court of Ireland. Further, there was no evidence whatsoever concerning the procedures necessary to present the evidence in the Irish courts.', '- 21 -', 'I think it incumbent on a party seeking to remove a case under the UCCJEA from Rhode Island to another jurisdiction to produce evidence bearing on the evidentiary procedures and potential for an expeditious resolution in that jurisdiction. This is particularly true when the other jurisdiction is a foreign country where court practices and procedures may be quite different from those in Rhode Island. In the case under review, neither party requested that the Family Court decline to exercise its jurisdiction; rather the issue was raised by the hearing justice sua sponte. Nevertheless, it was clearly in plaintiff’s interest that the custody determination be made by the Irish courts. She had an opportunity to present evidence relative to this factor, yet did not do so.', 'Consequently, I agree with the majority that the hearing justice improperly weighed this factor by treating it as neutral. In my opinion, however, her error is not of such a magnitude as to constitute an abuse of discretion in her ultimate conclusion that Ireland was the more appropriate forum. As the majority acknowledges, the lack of evidence in this regard does not undermine our confidence in the ability of the Irish courts to resolve custody disputes “impartially or expeditiously.” It is a factor, however, that should have tilted in favor of Rhode Island retaining jurisdiction.', 'Finally, the hearing justice found that the eighth statutory factor—the familiarity of each court with the facts and issues in the pending litigation—weighed “somewhat” in favor of Rhode Island exercising jurisdiction. She then concluded that:', '“in reviewing all of these factors and in considering all of them,', 'the [c]ourt must conclude that the weight of the factors, the', 'statutory factors, compels, and particularly where the evidence is', 'located for those motions which are substantive, that the [c]ourt', 'must decline to exercise jurisdiction in this matter, and that the', 'more appropriate forum for this matter to be heard would be', 'Ireland.”', '- 22 - I cannot say that the hearing justice abused her discretion in reaching this conclusion. She considered all the statutory factors. Although she may not have articulated extensively the relative weight she ascribed to each particular factor, a hearing justice’s findings and analysis of the evidence need not be exhaustive. See, e.g., South County Post & Beam, Inc. v. McMahon, 116 A.3d 204, 210 (R.I. 2015); Lembo v. Lembo, 677 A.2d 414, 417 (R.I. 1996). The hearing justice did indicate that she considered the location of the evidence to be of particular significance. I also believe that a fair inference from her decision is that she placed a great deal of import on the relative financial circumstances of the two parties. I might have placed greater weight on the parties’ agreement than did the hearing justice, but the issue is not whether I would have reached a different result than she did; the issue is whether she abused her discretion in so doing. See South County Post & Beam, Inc., 116 A.3d at 210 (stating that “we shall not substitute our view of the evidence for [that of the hearing justice] even though a contrary conclusion could have been reached” (quoting JPL Livery Services, Inc. v. Rhode Island Department of Administration, 88 A.3d 1134, 1142 (R.I. 2014))). In my judgment, she did not.', 'The inconvenient-forum analysis under § 15-14.1-19, however, is a two-step process. Having concluded that Ireland was the more appropriate forum, the hearing justice was required to determine that Rhode Island was an inconvenient forum. This inquiry, I suggest, entails the weighing of private- and public-interest factors such as we discussed in Kedy v. A.W. Chesterton Co., 946 A.2d 1171, 1184-85 (R.I. 2008). Undoubtedly there will be an overlap of many of the factors already considered in the determination of which forum is more appropriate; nonetheless, under the statute it is a distinct analysis. I would also maintain that the fact that the parties’ forum selection clause had been incorporated into the final judgment should be an important consideration at this stage of the analysis. A final judgment mandating that the Rhode Island', '- 23 - Family Court “shall” retain jurisdiction ought to create a heavy burden to overcome in any determination that said court is an inconvenient forum.', 'I concur with the majority, therefore, that the judgment of the Family Court should be vacated because the hearing justice, having concluded that Ireland was the more appropriate forum, failed to properly consider whether Rhode Island was an inconvenient forum. I disagree, however, with the majority’s holding that a Family Court justice must make an independent finding that Rhode Island is “significantly inconvenient” (quoting Kedy, 946 A.2d at 1178). By so doing, the majority attempts to engraft a common-law concept onto a statutory procedure. In Kedy, 946 A.2d at 1175, we recognized the viability of the doctrine of forum non conveniens in Rhode Island’s common-law jurisprudence. In the context of child custody disputes under the UCCJEA, the doctrine is purely a creature of statute. Section 15-14.1-19(a) provides that the court “may decline to exercise its jurisdiction at any time if it determines that it is an inconvenient forum * * *.” The statute does not require a finding that it is “significantly” inconvenient, nor should this Court.', 'Accordingly, I would vacate the judgment and remand the case to the Family Court with instructions that the court determine whether or not the Family Court is an inconvenient forum. As it has been represented to us that two of the parties’ three children are now living in Rhode Island, I would direct the Family Court to reopen the evidence so as to consider the issues under § 15-14.1-19 in light of current circumstances.', '- 24 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S', 'OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'Valerie M.

For the reasons stated below, we deny the appeal and affirm the judgment.', 'Facts and Travel', 'Founded in 1993, the J.G. Goff’s Pub (J.G. Goff’s or pub) was a small tavern overlooking the Providence River and the Point Street Bridge in Providence. The pub was located in a freestanding historic brick building at the Davol Square Complex.', 'Styling itself as “the neighborhood pub that’s not in the neighborhood,” J.G. Goff’s was a favorite destination among patrons on the way home from their downtown offices and the nearby hospitals, as well as university students and families.', '-1-', 'J.G. Goff’s was formed, owned, and operated by Free & Clear, an “S” corporation 1 that originally was held jointly by Robert Freeman, Jr. (Freeman) and Stephen Cleary (Cleary). In addition to his ownership interest in Free & Clear, Cleary owned the real estate management company that managed the Davol Square Complex until the late 1990s. Freeman, who sold Cleary his interest in Free & Clear in 1998, was the son of the then-owner of the Davol Square Jewelry Mart, LLC (Davol Square).2', 'The building that housed the pub (Goff Building) was owned by Davol Square.3 Free & Clear and Davol Square entered into a series of multi-year lease agreements throughout the 1990s. During that time, the liquor license for J.G. Goff’s was in the name of Davol Square. This arrangement bred complications when J.G. Goff’s attempted to renew its liquor license in 1998, and, due to an unrelated matter involving Davol Square, the pub was forced to close for three weeks until a new license could be procured. The pub encountered a similar problem renewing its liquor license the following year, resulting in an interruption of four months in operations starting in December 1999. To resolve the problem, Davol Square agreed to transfer the liquor license to Free & Clear in exchange for a renegotiation of the lease agreement.

Goff’s expanded to a second location in Bristol, which operated until it was sold for $1.35 million in 2007. Meanwhile, the Providence site continued to operate as usual until the end of 2002, when, according to Free & Clear, NBC’s nearby construction project began to interfere with its business. The dispute currently before the Court arises from damages caused by the construction project.', 'In 2001 NBC, a public corporation,4 commenced its Combined Sewer Overflow Project (CSO), which was designed to prevent overflow raw sewage from contaminating the Narragansett Bay and its estuaries. As part of the first phase, NBC constructed an underground tunnel below the city of Providence, measuring 16,000 feet in length and twenty-six feet in width.', 'The construction of the tunnel required contractors for NBC to perform drilling operations near the Davol Square Complex and the site of the Goff Building. Free & Clear claims that NBC began to prepare for the project in the vicinity of the Goff Building in the last few months of 2002; NBC counters that work in that area did not start until April of the following year. Nonetheless, NBC does not dispute that, by June 2003, the construction began to cause at least some disruption to the pub’s business. The construction continued throughout the autumn and into the winter.', 'On December 5, 2003, NBC’s engineers were preparing to position pipes underground at Point Street outside of J.G. Goff’s. To stabilize the pipes, the engineers would drive thin sheets 4', 'See G.L. 1956 § 46-25-4.', '-3- of steel known as “H-piles” into the ground until the sheets could not descend further. It was during this process that the ground unexpectedly began to shake. Joseph Pratt, the CSO program manager, who was present at the time, later would testify that, in retrospect, it was his belief that the engineers had damaged the foundation and structural integrity of the Goff Building while driving down the H-piles on December 5.', 'Four days later, just before opening time on December 9, 2003, Cleary received a telephone call from a pub employee, who reported significant damage to the Goff Building. When Cleary arrived at the pub shortly thereafter, he discovered that the front façade of the building had become displaced and was on the verge of collapsing forward. One of the CSO engineers was on the scene and advised Cleary not to open that afternoon until the damage to the structure could be assessed.', 'The pub did not open for business on December 9, 2003, and it has not served another customer since that date. Two days later, on December 11, the Building Inspector for the City of Providence declared that the building was unsafe for occupancy and use. At that time, NBC advised Davol Square and Cleary in writing that, “until further advisement from [NBC] or the [B]uilding [I]nspector[,] the J.G. Goff’s structure should remain closed to occupation by the public.”', 'On January 30, 2004, the parties reached an agreement (2004 agreement) in which NBC conceded liability for the damage to the Goff Building, promised to make repairs, and agreed to compensate Free & Clear for lost profits “until the [Goff] Building is put back in operation.” NBC made an initial lost-profits payment of $15,000 to Free & Clear. Cleary, representatives for NBC, and representatives for Davol Square communicated at various points in 2004 and 2005 without resolution. NBC did not make additional payments to Free & Clear due to a dispute', '-4- regarding requested documentation, and the building remained condemned. The Goff Building ultimately was demolished in November 2005. It has not been rebuilt.', 'On December 8, 2006, Free & Clear filed suit in the Providence County Superior Court, alleging that NBC owed it damages in excess of the $15,000 initial payment. NBC moved for partial summary judgment, which the trial justice denied.', 'The case proceeded to trial on March 4, 2013. Because NBC had admitted liability, the only issue to be resolved at trial was the amount of damages. Central to the case was the time period for which NBC should be held liable. Free & Clear sought damages from October 1, 2002, when it contended that it began to incur losses as a result of the construction, until November 1, 2007, when Davol Square released it from its obligations under the lease and—in counsel’s words—“[J.G.] Goff’s essentially was pronounced dead.” NBC countered that damages should be limited to the period between June 1, 2003, the date it contends that the construction began to infringe upon the pub’s business, and August 31, 2005, the termination date of the lease agreement. Other fundamental issues in controversy included the amount of lost profits and the value of the pub. We recount the testimony at trial salient to this appeal.', 'Cleary was the first witness to testify. He insisted that he never had intended that J.G. Goff’s would shut down its business on August 31, 2005, the date the five-year lease was set to terminate. He testified that he had planned to renegotiate the lease with Davol Square. He stated that, in his experience as a property manager, commercial landlords frequently treat the expiration of a lease as a mere negotiating tactic and that he had no reason to believe that he could not renew the lease. Cleary said that he had no plans to close the business even if the lease was not renewed. Rather, he would have relocated J.G. Goff’s to a new location nearby.', '-5-', 'Cleary then testified as to the impact the construction had had on J.G. Goff’s. According to Cleary, in October 2002, NBC commenced “pre-engineering” activities, such as jackhammering, drilling, and digging, on Point Street on the strip of land between J.G. Goff’s and the Providence River. NBC’s presence in the area near J.G. Goff’s increased significantly each month. By December 2002, construction moved directly into the Davol Square Complex. Cleary reported a 45 percent decline in J.G. Goff’s fourth-quarter sales from 2001 to 2002, which he attributed to the construction, and stated that, by April 2003, many of his regular customers had stopped frequenting the pub. Beginning in October 2003, a “slurry mixture” from the construction activities began to seep into J.G. Goff’s basement, which affected the pub’s food- storage equipment and its office records.', 'Cleary testified that after the structural damage to the Goff Building on December 9, 2003, NBC’s contractors informed him that they would develop a plan in the next three to four weeks so that J.G. Goff’s could reopen its doors to customers “pretty quickly.” He testified that, in reliance upon NBC’s representation that it would restore the Goff Building, he opted to wait to reopen rather than relocate the pub. Cleary stated that, had it not been for the 2004 agreement, he would have immediately found a new location for J.G. Goff’s. He testified that he would have been able to obtain financing for relocation at that time and identified possible sites that could have housed the relocated pub. Cleary contended that he did not move the pub because NBC had promised that the interruption in operations would be temporary and that J.G. Goff’s would be back in business by peak season.', 'Cleary recalled that representatives from NBC later told him that its engineers had decided to delay work on J.G. Goff’s until NBC finished construction around the Davol Square Complex; Cleary initially agreed to this plan. However, communications between Cleary and', '-6- NBC’s representatives, as well as between NBC and Davol Square, became increasingly strained in subsequent months. In June 2005, the Davol Square property manager, Richard Jaffe (Jaffe), and the new president of Davol Square, Anthony Meyer, informed Cleary that NBC was weighing the option of tearing down the building and constructing a new one. Based on this, Cleary assumed that the demolition of the Goff Building in November 2005 was the first step in the plan to rebuild.', 'According to Cleary, by the time the building was demolished, he no longer had the means or ability to reopen the pub at another location. He stated that he would not have been able to obtain financing for a business that had not operated in the past two years and that he had lost his customer base and relationships with suppliers. However, he contended that NBC’s representations led him to expect that J.G. Goff’s eventually would reopen in a new building constructed where the Goff Building once had stood. Cleary testified that, when rebuilding had not commenced by the end of 2007, he concluded that J.G. Goff’s would never reopen. At that point, two years after the demolition, he opted to negotiate a mutual general release of Free & Clear’s lease agreement with Davol Square. On cross-examination, Cleary testified that, because Free & Clear was an “S” corporation, any money made by the business would be listed on his personal tax returns.', 'Free & Clear’s business appraisal expert, Donald Wisehart (Wisehart), testified at length. Wisehart offered his opinion as to J.G. Goff’s lost profits and the value of the business. He explained that professional valuation standards dictate that appraisers approach valuations differently depending on whether the business in question is an ongoing business or a liquidated business. Wisehart elected to treat J.G. Goff’s as an ongoing business because it had operated profitably for a decade and had enjoyed a good client base, a liquor license, relationships with', '-7- vendors and suppliers, branding, and an assembled work force. According to Wisehart, it would be erroneous to assume that J.G. Goff’s lacked a future simply because it had a limited period of months remaining on its lease with Davol Square.', 'Wisehart explained that, in the course of appraisal, he made “normalizing adjustments” to J.G. Goff’s sales revenues, costs, and operating expenses.', 'Such normalizing adjustments allowed him to consider what a “normal” expenditure or revenue item would be in an ordinary year. In so doing, he weighed as anomalies the prior disruption in business related to difficulties in renewing the liquor license in 1999 and 2000. He also considered the success of the second pub located in Bristol. Relying on these calculations, Wisehart testified that J.G. Goff’s suffered a total of $1,218,158 in lost profits. With respect to the value of the business, he determined that J.G. Goff’s worth, as of December 9, 2003, was $1,038,000.', 'Wisehart further testified that business expenses are calculated differently when appraising a business than when determining tax liability. He explained that expenses deductible for tax purposes sometimes are not part of the ordinary operating expenses needed to run a business and thus such expenses are omitted from calculations made for valuation. Wisehart stated that an expense may be properly deducted from taxes but may not be a recurring business expense relevant for the purposes of valuation.', 'After Free & Clear rested its case, NBC moved for judgment as a matter of law on any claim for damages beyond August 31, 2005, the scheduled termination date of J.G. Goff’s lease with Davol Square. The trial justice denied the motion and stated that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to consider damages beyond that date.', 'NBC then presented its own business appraisal expert, Gregory Porcaro (Porcaro), who disagreed with the normalization adjustments made by Wisehart. Based upon information he', '-8- received from representatives from NBC, Porcaro concluded that CSO activities did not interfere with J.G. Goff’s business until June 2003.', 'Porcaro stated that, after making his own normalization adjustments, he determined that J.G. Goff’s lost profits totaled $149,939. He valued the business at zero dollars because the sworn tax return submitted to the United States Internal Revenue Service by J.G. Goff’s for the year of 2003 listed the pub’s profits at that amount. On cross-examination, Porcaro stated that he had not relied on all of the records that Wisehart had, nor had he met with the pub’s management, as Wisehart had done.', 'NBC also called Jaffe, the property manager for Davol Square, to testify. Jaffe stated that, in 2002, he had approached Cleary about the possibility of buying out the lease but they failed to reach an agreement regarding the buyout price. Jaffe testified that there were no discussions about renewing the lease at that time and that it would have been highly unlikely in 2003 for Davol Square to have agreed to renew the lease. Jaffe indicated that, because there were plans to develop the Davol Square Complex near the Goff Building, any new lease would have excluded access to the outdoor patio area that had been utilized by the pub. On cross- examination, Jaffe acknowledged that, if the building had not been damaged, Davol Square likely would have agreed to continue to rent the premises to J.G. Goff’s on a month-to-month basis in 2005, without the patio.', 'NBC then renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law on the basis that Free & Clear could not recover damages for the period after its lease terminated. The trial justice denied the renewed motion. The jury subsequently returned a verdict for Free & Clear in the amount of $680,277, and the trial justice added prejudgment interest in the amount of $756,169.92. Judgment entered on March 22, 2013. NBC moved for a new trial, or alternatively, a remittitur to the jury award, which the trial justice denied. This timely appeal followed.', '-9-', 'Issues on Appeal', 'NBC raises a bevy of issues on appeal. Of those issues that are properly before this Court,5 NBC first assigns error to the denial of its motion for a new trial. Second, NBC challenges the refusal by the trial justice to grant a remittitur, which it had sought in the alternative to a new trial.', 'Third, NBC asserts that the trial justice erred in calculating prejudgment interest. Fourth, NBC appeals from the denial of its motion for partial judgment as a matter of law.', 'Analysis', 'A. Denial of Motion for a New Trial', 'NBC contends that the trial justice erred when he denied its motion for a new trial. When considering a new-trial motion, the trial justice is required to “weigh the evidence and assess the credibility of the witnesses,” as if he or she were a “superjuror.” Yi Gu v. Rhode Island Public Transit Authority, 38 A.3d 1093, 1099 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Pollard v. Hastings, 862 A.2d 770, 777 (R.I. 2004)). After undertaking this independent analysis, the trial justice must uphold the jury verdict if he or she “determines that the evidence is evenly balanced or is such that reasonable minds in considering the same evidence could come to different conclusions * * *.” Id. (quoting Botelho v. Caster’s, Inc., 970 A.2d 541, 545 (R.I. 2009)). This Court will not upset that determination unless the moving party demonstrates that “the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material and relevant evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.” Id. (quoting Izen v. Winoker, 589 A.2d 824, 829 (R.I. 1991)). 5', 'Among the issues NBC raises on appeal is a challenge to the denial of its pretrial motion for partial summary judgment. However, this Court declines to entertain an appeal of the denial of summary judgment after the Superior Court holds a trial and enters final judgment on the merits of the case. Nationwide Property & Casualty Insurance Co. v. D.F. Pepper Construction, Inc., 59 A.3d 106, 110 n.3 (R.I. 2013).', '- 10 -', 'NBC appeals the denial of its motion for a new trial on four separate grounds. According to NBC, (1) the trial justice erred in instructing the jury; (2) the jury awarded damages based on speculation; (3) the trial justice did not review properly the testimony of Free & Clear’s expert witness when issuing his decision; and (4) the doctrine of judicial estoppel should have barred Cleary from asserting that certain expenses were personal and thus not attributable to J.G. Goff’s operations. We will address each issue seriatim.', '1. Jury Instructions', 'We first consider the challenge to the jury instructions. In charging the jury, the trial justice must “fram[e] the issues in such a way that the instructions reasonably set forth all of the propositions of law that relate to material issues of fact which the evidence tends to support.” Riley v. Stone, 900 A.2d 1087, 1092 (R.I. 2006) (quoting Morinville v. Old Colony Co-operative Newport National Bank, 522 A.2d 1218, 1222 (R.I. 1987)). This Court evaluates “jury instructions ‘in their entirety to ascertain the manner in which a jury of ordinarily intelligent lay people would have understood them.’” Id. (quoting Parrella v. Bowling, 796 A.2d 1091, 1101 (R.I. 2002)).', 'NBC’s challenge to the jury instructions stems from its chief argument on appeal: that, as a matter of law, Free & Clear could not recover damages beyond August 31, 2005, the date its lease with Davol Square was scheduled to terminate. NBC points to Mahon v. Director of Public Works of Rhode Island, 98 R.I. 426, 204 A.2d 197 (1964), as support for this argument. In Mahon, we reaffirmed our prior holding that, to be enforceable, options to renew a lease agreement must include either a definitive amount for rental payments or, in the alternative, a prescribed method for determining the amount at the time of renewal. Id. at 428-29, 204 A.2d at', '- 11 - 198 (citing Vartabedian v. Peerless Wrench Co., 46 R.I. 472, 129 A. 239 (1925)). Without these terms, options to renew are void. See id.', 'NBC’s reliance on Mahon is misplaced, however, because the enforceability of an option to renew a lease agreement is immaterial to the case at bar. Free & Clear’s claim for damages beyond August 31, 2005, does not rest on whether there was an option-to-renew provision in its lease with Davol Square. In fact, none existed. Rather, Free & Clear presented evidence at trial that, but for the destruction of the Goff Building and the representations by NBC that it would restore the structure, the pub would have remained in operation either at its original location or at a new site. Specifically, the jury heard testimony that both the landlord and the tenant would have been amenable to renewing the lease past August 31, 2005, albeit on different terms, and that Cleary had no intention of closing the pub even if his attempts to renew the lease had failed. For this reason, there is no merit to NBC’s argument that Free & Clear could not, as a matter of law, recover damages past August 31, 2005. The trial justice thus did not err when he declined to instruct the jury as such.', 'We also reject NBC’s contention that the trial justice erred by refusing its request to instruct the jury that, to qualify for damages after August 31, 2005, Free & Clear had the burden to prove that it would have renewed the lease with Davol Square. Adherence to that request would have resulted, in effect, in an instruction that the jury disregard Cleary’s testimony that he would have relocated the pub had the lease not been renewed. See, e.g., Miller v. Bessette, 80 R.I. 187, 189, 94 A.2d 253, 255 (1953) (noting that, in instructing the jury, the trial justice may not “call[] to the attention of the jury only [one party’s] testimony and nowhere advert[] to the evidence for [the other party]”).', '- 12 -', 'NBC also assigns error to the trial justice’s instruction that NBC “has acknowledged in this case that its activities caused Free & Clear to lose profits * * * both before and after December 9, 2003, which is when [NBC] damaged Free & Clear’s building.” This issue was not preserved. Before the trial justice, NBC objected only to the failure of the trial justice to include an end date of August 31, 2005, and not that the instruction amounted to an inaccurate representation of its position. This argument therefore has been waived on appeal. See State v. Gregson, 113 A.3d 393, 398 (R.I. 2015) (indicating that this Court “shall not review issues that were not presented to the trial court in such a posture as to alert the trial justice to the question being raised”, quoting Berard v. HCP, Inc., 64 A.3d 1215, 1219 n.2 (R.I. 2013)).', '2. Jury Speculation', 'In appealing the denial of its motion for a new trial, NBC next contends that the jury award was based on speculation, arguing that the jury wrongfully applied damages beyond August 31, 2005. Because we have rejected the argument by NBC that Free & Clear could not recover damages beyond that date as a matter of law, this argument also fails. However, we pause to note that the award of $680,277 was well below the seven figures in damages claimed by Free & Clear. Further, without objection from NBC, the jury was asked to enter its verdict on a general verdict form. NBC in effect agreed that the jury should indicate the amount of damages awarded, if any, in a lump sum rather than have them separated and delineated by time period. See, e.g., Union Pacific Railroad Co. v. Barber, 149 S.W.3d 325, 341 (Ark. 2004) (“When special interrogatories concerning liability or damages are not requested, and this court is left in the position of not knowing the basis for the jury’s verdict, we will neither question nor theorize about the jury’s findings.”).', '- 13 -', '3. Wisehart Testimony', 'NBC also claims that a new trial is warranted because, when issuing his decision on the motion for a new trial, the trial justice failed to review certain aspects of the testimony given by Wisehart, Free & Clear’s business appraisal expert. Specifically, NBC asserts that the trial justice did not address its contention that Wisehart’s calculations were erroneously based in part on the value of the second pub located in Bristol, which NBC claims was too dissimilar to J.G. Goff’s to justify comparison. However, this Court previously has acknowledged that, in passing on a motion for a new trial, “the trial justice need not make an exhaustive analysis of all of the evidence upon which he relies,” only that he “refer to the evidence that motivated him to rule as he did.” Juchnik v. Betters, 471 A.2d 222, 223 (R.I. 1984).', 'Here, the trial justice noted the incongruity between the valuation of J.G. Goff’s determined by Wisehart and that reached by Porcaro, NBC’s business appraisal expert, which he attributed to the “great disparity” in the experts’ methods of valuation.', 'He noted that Porcaro did not have the same level of access to Free & Clear accounting records from which Wisehart had benefited. While his analysis did not expound upon every factor that the expert witnesses relied upon in reaching their valuations, the trial justice did reference the most significant points of Wisehart’s—and Porcaro’s—testimony. See Juchnik, 471 A.2d at 223. He weighed the evidence presented by each business appraisal expert, neither overlooking nor misconceiving their testimony. See Yi Gu, 38 A.3d at 1099. The assignment of error on this ground by NBC thus lacks merit.', '4. Judicial Estoppel', 'As the final basis on which NBC appeals the denial of its motion for a new trial, it argues that the trial justice erred in refusing to apply the doctrine of judicial estoppel to portions of', '- 14 - Wisehart’s testimony. NBC asserts that the court should have barred testimony that certain expenses were personal to Cleary when, in its sworn tax returns, Free & Clear declared these expenses as business expenses. However, since NBC did not object to this testimony at trial, we decline to consider the issue.6 See Gregson, 113 A.3d at 398 (issues not presented at trial are not preserved on appeal).', 'B. Alternative Motion for Remittitur', 'NBC next appeals the denial of its alternative motion for a remittitur that was filed in conjunction with its motion for a new trial. A remittitur is defined as “[a]n order awarding a new trial, or a damages amount lower than that awarded by the jury, and requiring the plaintiff to choose between those alternatives.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1486 (10th ed. 2014). A trial justice may grant a remittitur “when the jury award clearly appears to be excessive or is found to be the result of the jury’s passion and prejudice.” Lennon v. Dacomed Corp., 901 A.2d 582, 590 (R.I. 2006). Our review of the grant or denial of a remittitur hinges on whether the trial justice “overlook[ed] or misconceive[d] relevant evidence.” Id. Here, Wisehart testified that Free & Clear lost $1,218,158 in profits as a result of NBC’s actions, and he valued the business at $1,038,000 just before it was forced to cease its operations. Under such circumstances, the jury award of $680,277 hardly seems excessive. We discern no error.', 'C. Calculation of Prejudgment Interest', 'Next, NBC challenges the methodology used by the trial justice in calculating prejudgment interest. General Laws 1956 § 9-21-10(a) governs our analysis of the calculation of prejudgment interest in civil actions. Section 9-21-10(a) provides, in relevant part: 6', 'Nonetheless, even had this issue properly been before this Court, the doctrine of judicial estoppel does not extend to sworn tax returns. See, e.g., Kaiser v. Bowlen, 455 F.3d 1197, 1204 (10th Cir. 2006); Atlantic Limousine, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Board, 243 F.3d 711, 715 n.2 (3d Cir. 2001); Smith v. Travelers Insurance Co., 438 F.2d 373, 377 (6th Cir. 1971).', '- 15 -', '“In any civil action in which a verdict is rendered or a', 'decision made for pecuniary damages, there shall be added by the', 'clerk of the court to the amount of damages interest at the rate of', 'twelve percent (12%) per annum thereon from the date the cause of', 'action accrued, which shall be included in the judgment entered', 'therein.” (Emphasis added.) Since we are confronted with a question of law, we review the calculation of prejudgment interest de novo. See Andrews v. Plouff, 66 A.3d 840, 842 (R.I. 2013).', 'It is well settled that “[p]rejudgment interest begins to run when the action accrues for purposes of the statute of limitations.” Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Co. v. Barry, 892 A.2d 915, 924 n.5 (R.I. 2006). In actions stemming from “injury to property[] resulting from [a] negligent act,” the statute of limitations begins to accrue when the injury occurs. Lee v. Morin, 469 A.2d 358, 360 (R.I. 1983); see id. at 359 (homeowner’s negligence action alleging property damage as a result of the construction of a municipal aqueduct in an adjacent lot).', 'NBC contends the prejudgment interest clock should have started running on the date Free & Clear filed suit. Instead, the trial justice declared that prejudgment interest be awarded from December 9, 2003, the date J.G. Goff’s was forced to cease its operations. Although Free & Clear offered evidence of injury to the Goff Building and the pub’s operations as early as 2002 and NBC conceded interference starting in June 2003, it is undisputed that total destruction of the business occurred on December 9, 2003. We conclude that this date was reasonable and fair as a starting point for the running of prejudgment interest, and we note that the trial justice could have determined that it had accrued even earlier.', 'D. Denial of Motion for Partial Judgment as a Matter of Law', 'Lastly, NBC argues that the trial justice erred by denying its motion for partial judgment as a matter of law. The Court applies de novo review to a trial justice’s ruling on a motion for', '- 16 - judgment as a matter of law. O’Connell v. Walmsley, 93 A.3d 60, 65 (R.I. 2014). In so doing, “[t]his Court, like the trial justice, will examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, without weighing the evidence or evaluating the credibility of witnesses, and draw from the record all reasonable inferences that support the position of the nonmoving party.” Id. at 66 (quoting McGarry v. Pielech, 47 A.3d 271, 279 (R.I. 2012)). Judgment as a matter of law is appropriate only upon a determination that the nonmoving party failed to introduce “legally sufficient evidence to allow the trier of fact to arrive at a verdict in his favor.” Id. (quoting McGarry, 47 A.3d at 280).', 'In assigning error to the denial of its motion for partial judgment as a matter of law, NBC again relies on its contention that, as a matter of law, Free & Clear could not recover damages past August 31, 2005, the termination date of its lease agreement with Davol Square. This argument lacks merit. In viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Free & Clear and applying all reasonable inferences in support of its position, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that J.G. Goff’s would have remained in business past that date, regardless of whether the lease had been renewed. For this reason, NBC was not entitled to partial judgment as a matter of law.', 'Conclusion', 'Because the defendant’s claims of error are unavailing, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

The defendant, Luis Roldan, was convicted of felony assault with a dangerous weapon, discharging a firearm while committing a crime of violence, and carrying a handgun without a license. On appeal, he contends that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial. For the following reasons, we affirm the judgment of conviction.', 'Facts and Travel', 'The genesis for the crimes of which defendant stands convicted was a love-triangle feud that involved face-to-face and Facebook confrontations and threats. According to the testimony of Luis Enrique Guzman Rosa (Guzman),1 he dated Genesis Febriel (Febriel) for about eight to twelve months in 2010. Sometime after their relationship ended, Guzman received a call from defendant, Febriel’s new boyfriend.2', 'During the call, defendant warned Guzman to stop bothering Febriel. In approximately December 2012, the men encountered each other when 1', 'Guzman testified that he does not use his full last name, and he introduced himself as Luis Guzman. Taking our cue from him, we refer to him as Guzman. 2', 'During the events leading up to defendant’s crimes, Guzman knew defendant only as “Chinito” or “Kelvin Pena,” the name defendant used for his Facebook profile.', '-1- defendant approached Guzman in a store. After identifying himself, defendant told Guzman: “You know I have my gun up there. And the next time I see you[,] you’re going to die.” The defendant also told Guzman that, “if [he] was a man, * * * [the two] should find some guns and go to the park and shoot each other.”', 'After this confrontation, defendant repeated his desire to kill Guzman to Guzman’s current girlfriend and a friend. The tension escalated when Guzman and defendant took their feud to Facebook, where the two exchanged several messages. At trial, Guzman depicted defendant as the aggressor in these messages: “I would ask him to leave me alone, that I was not looking for trouble. And he said no, that whenever he would see me he was going to kill me.” However, the messages were admitted at defendant’s trial and reveal that both defendant and Guzman addressed one another menacingly. On February 22, 2013, in response to threats from defendant to Guzman’s girlfriend and his friend, Guzman initiated the Facebook messaging by writing to defendant: “Listen kid when you have something to tell me say it to me[.] That I am a real man and I am trying to find out where you live since you threatened to kill me[.] I won’t leave it like that.” The defendant wrote back:', '“We’re going to run into each other on Broad Street and you will', 'see[.] Lucky that I didn’t kill you last night rat[.3] I would have', 'gone there and you would have been dead for sure but I didn’t go', 'so you look bad * * *.

D]on’t', 'threaten[] me[.] I remember she said it was around [D]ouglas.” The defendant responded by proposing that the two “meet up at [CVS] right now to get it over with already.” Guzman replied in agreement: “Go ahead come but you won’t * * *[.] You think I’m like you * * *[. L]et’s get it over with already[.] Bet you won’t come * * *.” The defendant responded, “I’m on my way there.” The two exchanged more messages in rapid succession. Guzman told defendant: “We are going to go head up fist fight [sic][.] I’m almost there[.] I will wipe out the hatred you have towards me[.]”', 'As the battleground shifted from Facebook to a CVS parking lot on Broad Street in Providence, Guzman obtained a ride to the parking lot from a friend, who drove a Nissan Maxima. The defendant arrived in the parking lot in a vehicle driven by Febriel. Unbeknownst to Guzman, defendant brought a gun to this fistfight. The defendant and Guzman both exited their vehicles, when defendant pulled out a firearm and fired at Guzman. The bullet entered and exited Guzman’s arm just above his elbow.4 After the shot rang out, the car that transported Guzman to CVS pulled away, and Guzman ran from the parking lot in the direction of a public 4', 'Apparently, the bullet also hit the Nissan Maxima.', '-3- housing complex on Prairie Avenue. While running, Guzman felt faint; he headed into a store so that an ambulance could be summoned. Shortly after Guzman entered the store, defendant appeared at the store’s entrance. The defendant told Guzman: “You see, I am not playing. That’s who I am.”5 The defendant then fled the scene, and, soon thereafter, officers from the Providence Police Department arrived at the store.', 'A search of the CVS parking lot revealed an area of broken automobile glass and a 9 millimeter shell casing. Later that evening, police discovered a Nissan Maxima on a nearby street.', 'The vehicle had ballistic damage to the passenger side of the hood, and the front passenger window was shattered. Meanwhile, police were able to locate defendant’s address, where they apprehended defendant and Febriel on the night of the shooting. A protective sweep of the home revealed neither a firearm nor ammunition, and police never recovered the weapon defendant used to shoot Guzman. Officers did not test defendant for gunshot residue. Although police processed the Nissan Maxima for fingerprints, the efforts proved futile. Police asked Guzman the identity of the driver of the Nissan Maxima on the night of the shooting, but Guzman refused to provide a name. At trial, Guzman testified that he knew the driver as “Shortie” and that he did not know his real name.', 'The defendant was charged with felony assault with a dangerous weapon (count 1), discharging a firearm while committing a crime of violence (count 2), and carrying a handgun without a license (count 3).6 On January 3, 2014, defendant, while incarcerated at the Adult 5', 'Guzman also testified that defendant said: “You see, you see, I am Chinito, mother fucker, and you see what’s going to happen.” 6', 'The defendant was also charged with three additional offenses: discharging a firearm within a compact area; violation of a no-contact order; and conspiracy to commit a felony assault. The state dismissed these counts pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure prior to the commencement of trial.', '-4- Correctional Institutions (ACI) awaiting trial on these charges, called Guzman in an attempt to bribe him to refrain from testifying against defendant. A recording of this phone call and a transcript of it were admitted into evidence at defendant’s trial. The defendant opened the conversation by telling Guzman: “I am ‘Chinito[.]’ [H]ey, let’s talk you and me. I’ve got five thousand bucks so you don’t go to court.” Guzman told defendant, “[D]on’t call me with this kinda stuff brother, just let it go.” The defendant replied: “Well then, you, [y]ou are not going [to] set foot in? You are not going there?” Guzman responded, “I don’t know, don’t call me for this kinda shit, brother,” and the conversation ended. Despite Guzman’s reluctance to discuss the bribe over the phone, he proved to be very interested in the money. In a series of text messages, Guzman implored Febriel to speak with a member of defendant’s family in order to collect the $5,000. When informed that it was unlikely that defendant’s family would pay up, Guzman responded, “[T]hen they shouldn’t be crying when the son gets his 30.” Ultimately, Guzman accepted $2,100 from defendant’s family, but the attempted bribery failed.', 'At trial, defendant’s theory of the case was that Guzman was shot by someone else, perhaps by Shortie or another occupant of the Nissan Maxima, and that a story was then concocted to pin the blame on defendant so that, with defendant out of the picture, Guzman could reunite with Febriel. The jury rejected this theory and instead found defendant guilty on all counts. The defendant moved for a new trial, arguing that the verdict was contrary to the clear weight of the evidence. The defendant noted certain mistakes in the lead detective’s incident report that were corrected by the detective at trial and argued that the police failed to investigate the identity of the person who drove Guzman to CVS on the night of the shooting. The defendant also emphasized that police failed to test him for gunshot residue when they', '-5- apprehended him hours after the shooting, and he also noted that the weapon was never found. Finally, defendant contended that Guzman was not a credible witness.', 'The trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial. The trial justice found Guzman—whom he labeled “[t]he key and crucial witness” in this case—to be “a very credible witness”; the trial justice added that, “[F]rom my perspective as a front-row observer, the jury was well[ ]warranted in accepting his testimony.” The trial justice also concluded that the jury’s guilty verdict was well supported by the threats made by defendant through the Facebook messages and defendant’s attempt to bribe Guzman in the hopes of avoiding prosecution. He deemed the discrepancies in the police reports to be “scarcely significant” given the evidence of defendant’s guilt. The trial justice was similarly unmoved by Guzman’s reluctance to identify the driver of the Nissan Maxima that transported him to the CVS on the night of the shooting. He noted that defense counsel did not ask Guzman to identify the driver, and he emphasized that “Guzman could not have legally persisted in his nondisclosure if pressed by [defense counsel] to identify that person.” The trial justice characterized defense counsel’s election not to pursue the matter as a tactical decision.', 'The trial justice sentenced defendant to twenty years on count 1 to be served at the ACI; twenty years on count 2, suspended with probation, to run consecutively to the sentence imposed on count 1; and ten years on count 3, suspended with probation, to be served concurrently with the sentence imposed on count 2. The defendant timely appealed.', 'Standard of Review', 'A criminal defendant’s motion for a new trial can be prosecuted in two ways: one that challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the guilty verdict and one that assails the verdict as against the weight of the evidence. State v. Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 569 (R.I. 2009). In', '-6- this case, apart from scattered references7 that might be understood to allege insufficiency of the evidence, the thrust of defendant’s argument on appeal is that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. When confronted with a motion for a new trial claiming that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence, the trial justice must “sit[] as the legendary thirteenth juror.” State v. Covington, 69 A.3d 855, 862 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Smith, 39 A.3d 669, 673 (R.I. 2012)). In this capacity, the trial justice must, “in light of the charge to the jury, * * * exercise his or her independent judgment in weighing the evidence and assessing the credibility of the witnesses.” Id. (quoting Smith, 39 A.3d at 673). Fulfilling this endeavor is a three-step process: “[t]he trial justice must (1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” Id. at 863 (quoting Smith, 39 A.3d at 673). If, after adhering to this framework, the trial justice reaches the same conclusion as the jury, the inquiry is at an end; “the verdict should be affirmed and the motion for a new trial denied.” Id. (quoting Smith, 39 A.3d at 673).', 'We review a trial justice’s ruling on a motion for a new trial deferentially. Covington, 69 A.3d at 863. So long as the trial justice complies with the three-step procedure and articulates adequate reasons for his or her decision, the decision “will be given great weight and left undisturbed unless the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence or otherwise was clearly wrong.” Id. (quoting Smith, 39 A.3d at 673). “We employ this deferential standard 7', 'Despite these isolated references, defendant’s brief in this Court sets forth only the standard of review for motions for a new trial concerning the weight of the evidence. Moreover, the record demonstrates—and defendant concedes on appeal—that the new-trial motion below was limited to the argument that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. In these circumstances, to the extent defendant intended to argue on appeal that the evidence was insufficient, we deem such an argument waived for our review. See State v. Buchanan, 81 A.3d 1119, 1126-27 n.9 (R.I. 2014).', '-7- of review because ‘a trial justice, being present during all phases of the trial, is in an especially good position to evaluate the facts and to judge the credibility of the witnesses.’” State v. Paola, 59 A.3d 99, 104 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Texieira, 944 A.2d 132, 141 (R.I. 2008)).', 'Analysis', 'The defendant principally argues that the trial justice should have granted his motion for a new trial because Guzman’s testimony was not credible.', 'He contends that Guzman’s testimony that defendant was the sole aggressor in the months before the shooting is belied by the Facebook messages, which show that Guzman and defendant both exchanged threats. The defendant also points out that the text messages between Guzman and Febriel demonstrate that Guzman sought to capitalize on defendant’s $5,000 bribe by pestering Febriel to collect. Finally, defendant notes that Guzman “stubbornly masked” the identity of the person who dropped him off at the CVS in the Nissan Maxima, “thereby ensuring that no one would be available to contradict his testimony.”', 'The defendant faces a steep uphill climb because, “[i]n the mine-run of cases, credibility battles are won or lost in Superior Court,” and “[a] defendant’s disagreement with a trial justice’s credibility determinations ‘is not a sufficient basis to warrant the granting of a motion for new trial.’” State v. Pona, 66 A.3d 454, 476 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Paola, 59 A.3d at 104). This Court will not disturb a trial justice’s assessment of witness credibility unless it is clearly erroneous or the trial justice “overlooked or misconceived relevant and material evidence.” Id. (quoting Paola, 59 A.3d at 104). This deference is grounded in the commonsense notion that, “[b]ecause the trial justice has observed the witnesses testify, he or she is in a better position than this Court to assess their credibility.” Id.', '-8-', 'This case is no exception. The trial justice considered defendant’s argument with respect to Guzman’s reluctance to reveal Shortie’s true identity, but he was ultimately unpersuaded. He noted that “Guzman could not have legally persisted in his nondisclosure if pressed by [defense counsel] to identify that person”; however, rather than risk another eyewitness to the shooting, defense counsel elected not to press Guzman for that identity. We discern no error in this reasoning or in the trial justice’s characterization of defense counsel’s election not to pursue the matter as a tactical decision.', 'The trial justice also sat as a “front-row observer” during Guzman’s testimony and the introduction of the Facebook messages, defendant’s prison call to Guzman, and the text messages between Guzman and Febriel. Although aspects of Guzman’s unsavory character were revealed in the Facebook and text messages, the evidence was also damning for defendant. As the trial justice noted, the Facebook messages “demonstrat[ed] that * * * defendant had been bent on killing Guzman.” The trial justice also considered Guzman’s receipt of some of the money that defendant promised Guzman, but he chose to place more significance on the fact that defendant attempted to bribe Guzman when “facing certain prosecution” than on Guzman’s receipt of a portion of the bribe. The trial justice concluded that, “[p]lainly, the jury was impressed * * * by the abject clarity and brazen comments by * * * defendant that he intended to kill Guzman in his Facebook posting of February 22, and pay him not to testify as recorded in the telephone call, when it was clear that Guzman was going to be produced at trial.” The incriminating evidence referenced by the trial justice supported Guzman’s story that defendant was the person who shot him. We are not convinced that the trial justice clearly erred or overlooked or misconceived relevant and material evidence in concluding that Guzman was a credible witness.', '-9-', 'In a last-ditch effort to stem the tide, the defendant points to perceived shortcomings in the investigation in the aftermath of the shooting. He notes that the Nissan Maxima was never processed, the scene was never reconstructed, ballistic analysis was never performed at the scene or on the Maxima, and, most importantly, no weapon or other incriminating evidence was found when the defendant was apprehended at his home on the night of the shooting. When confronted with this argument, the trial justice concluded that, “[g]iven the defendant’s Facebook threat to kill Guzman, and the defendant’s blatant attempts to bribe him not to testify, it’s hardly surprising that the jury found those other miscues to be of no moment.” We agree with the trial justice’s reasoning; the Facebook messages, the bribe, and Guzman’s testimony constituted ample evidence of the defendant’s guilt, even if the police investigation could have produced other incriminating evidence.', 'Conclusion', 'For these reasons, we conclude that the trial justice did not err in denying the defendant’s motion for a new trial.

68,(Dissent begins on page 8) Kathleen Carlson : v. : Town of South Kingstown et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The plaintiff, Kathleen Carlson, appeals from a Superior Court judgment in favor of one of the defendants, South Kingstown Little League (league or defendant), in this negligence action. The plaintiff sustained an injury at a park owned by the Town of South Kingstown (town) while she was a spectator at a Little League baseball game organized by the defendant. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'This Court is familiar with the facts of this case as set forth in our previous decision in Carlson v. Town of South Kingstown, 111 A.3d 819 (R.I. 2015) (Carlson I). 1 In summary, on July 28, 2010, plaintiff was at Tuckertown Field (the park) in the Wakefield section of South Kingstown watching her son play Little League baseball.', 'The game was scheduled and organized by defendant. The park and field were owned and maintained by the town. At the end of the game, plaintiff, who had been “watching the game against a fence between one of the dugouts and the batting cages,” began to walk towards her son. As she walked towards the concession stand, plaintiff “felt [her] ankle fall into this little divot in the ground.” As a result, plaintiff fractured her right leg in three different places.', 'Victor J. Beretta (Beretta), a fellow Little League parent and former assistant coach, did not witness the fall but observed the divot on the ground where plaintiff was injured. During his deposition, he described the divot as roughly “6, 8 inches across, maybe a little wider than that” and “a good 8, 10 inches deep.” Beretta also testified at his deposition that the divots were a “repetitive problem” that was caused by players who would dig the toe and spikes of their baseball cleats into the ground while waiting for their turn to enter the batting cages. He estimated that the location of this specific divot was “probably 10 or 15 feet from the right field fence” and “probably 5, 8 feet, maybe closer” to the “gate that leads into the first batting cage.” Although Beretta could not confirm if it was this same divot, he testified at his deposition that divots had been filled in in the past and that this specific divot looked as if it had been there for a while. 1', 'In Carlson v. Town of South Kingstown, 111 A.3d 819 (R.I. 2015), this Court held that the Recreational Use Statute, G.L. 1956 chapter 6 of title 32, applied to bar plaintiff’s personal injury claims against the town.', '-2-', 'Theresa Murphy (Murphy), the Director of Leisure Services for the town, explained during her deposition that the town had three, three-person maintenance crews who maintained the town’s seventeen parks. She explained that, with respect to Tuckertown Park, a three-person crew “provide[s] park maintenance twice a week.”', 'Among other tasks, the town mowed the grass, picked up litter, and checked for damage to park equipment and grounds. According to Frank J. Gallucci, the league’s president, the town is also responsible for preparing the field for the game, which includes lining the field, grooming the infield, and placing the bases and home plate on the field. After being informed of the divot that allegedly caused plaintiff’s injuries, the town filled in the divot the following day. Murphy further testified that there were no warnings posted at the park alerting the public to potential defects in the grounds, but she acknowledged that it was not uncommon to find divots in the field.', 'According to Murphy, the town does not charge the league to use the baseball field because it is a nonprofit youth sports league. Murphy also testified that the league is not instructed to remedy any defect observed while using the ball field. Gallucci, who at the time of the incident was on the league’s board of directors, testified at his deposition that he had never observed the divots at the park. He also explained that there was no formal inspection process of the field conducted by the league; but he added that if the coaches saw “any issues that [they] want[ed] to question on the field,” they would raise them. He further testified that, had he seen the divot “[he] would inform the [t]own[,]” but that the league was not responsible for maintaining the park.', 'In her complaint, plaintiff alleged that defendant was “negligent in maintaining the premises of Tuckertown Field * * *.” As a result of defendant’s negligence, plaintiff claims that she “sustained severe personal injuries that required medical treatment that is ongoing, as well as', '-3- lost wages and loss of earning capacity, anxiety, pain and suffering * * *.” On July 7, 2014, the league moved for summary judgment, arguing that it had not owed a duty of care to maintain the park. The plaintiff objected to the motion, insisting that defendant had a duty to inspect the park prior to hosting a Little League game and to repair any defects that were discovered, or at a minimum to warn of known dangerous conditions. The league’s motion was argued and granted on August 18, 2014. The hearing justice reasoned that “[t]here’s no ownership interest that the league has in the property itself, both of the athletic field itself as well as the surrounding areas.” The hearing justice further explained that “to impose a duty to maintain and repair somebody else’s property * * * [is] something that the [L]egislature should make a determination of, not t[he] [c]ourt.” The plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“This Court will review the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo, ‘employing the same standards and rules used by the hearing justice.’” Daniels v.

Specifically, plaintiff argues that there are questions of fact as to:', '“whether * * * the hole pre-existed before the game, whether it', 'was or should have been known by the various coaches in the', '[league], when were the holes created near the batting cage,', '[whether] they [were] ignored, whether * * * the defect amounted', 'to a warranted reckless conduct and whether * * * it was merely', 'simple negligence * * *.” In response, defendant asserts that it did not owe a duty of care to plaintiff, given that the town— and not the league—maintains the park where the injury occurred.', '“It is well settled that to prevail on a claim of negligence a plaintiff must establish a legally cognizable duty owed by a defendant to a plaintiff, a breach of that duty, proximate causation between the conduct and the resulting injury, and the actual loss or damage.” Nationwide Property & Casualty Insurance Co. v.

Michaels Stores, Inc., 42 A.3d 1273, 1276 (R.I. 2012)). “Although we have frowned upon the disposition of negligence claims by summary judgment, the existence of a duty is nonetheless a question of law.” Wyso v. Full Moon Tide, LLC, 78 A.3d 747, 750 (R.I. 2013). “In the absence of such a duty, ‘the trier of fact has nothing to consider and a motion for summary judgment must be granted.’” Id. (quoting Holley v.

Khea, 963 A.2d 630, 633 (R.I. 2009).', 'Generally, this Court uses “an ad hoc approach that turns on the particular facts and circumstances of a given case” to determine whether a duty exists. Woodruff v. Gitlow, 91 A.3d 805, 814 (R.I. 2014) (quoting Ouch, 963 A.2d at 633). Under this approach, the Court will “consider ‘all relevant factors, including the relationship of the parties, the scope and burden of the obligation to be imposed upon the defendant, public policy considerations, and notions of fairness.’” Id. (quoting Gushlaw v. Milner, 42 A.3d 1245, 1252 (R.I. 2012)); see also Banks v. Bowen’s Landing Corp., 522 A.2d 1222, 1225 (R.I. 1987). Because the duty of a property owner is based “firmly on the landowner’s possession of the premises and his or her attendant right and obligation to control the premises[,]” Wyso, 78 A.3d at 751, this Court has declined to find a duty where an injury occurred on property not owned by the defendant. See Ferreira v. Strack, 636 A.2d 682, 684-86 (R.I. 1994) (the plaintiffs injured while crossing public street adjacent to church where they had just attended services); see also Maguire v. City of Providence, 105 A.3d 92, 93-94 (R.I. 2014) (the plaintiff injured while walking on sidewalk outside mall); Wyso, 78 A.3d at 749 (the plaintiff injured while walking along public sidewalk that abutted the defendant’s business). Additionally, this Court has declined to find a duty where—although the property was indeed owned by the defendant—the defendant did not exercise any control over the property. See Berman v. Sitrin, 991 A.2d 1038, 1048 (R.I. 2010) (finding no duty on the part of the defendant, owner of property over which public easement runs, for injuries to user of easement where the defendant had no control over easement).', '-6-', 'Turning to the particular facts in this case, we are satisfied that the plaintiff has failed to overcome the duty hurdle in her negligence action against the defendant because the defendant does not own, operate, or have control over the park where the plaintiff’s alleged injury occurred. See Berman, 991 A.2d at 1048. Instead, it is the town that owns, operates, maintains, and has exclusive control over the park. The town’s employees—not the league’s—inspect the park regularly and conduct any repairs necessary to the park. As such, it was the town—and not the league—that repaired the divot that allegedly caused the plaintiff’s injuries. 2 Additionally, it is the town that is responsible for preparing the field before the baseball game. There is no evidence that the town ever required the league to do any work to the park or on the field. Importantly, although the defendant had exclusive use of the playing field during the baseball game, the injury occurred outside of the playing field after the game had ended in an area adjacent to the batting cages. This area was open to the general public, and there is no evidence indicating that the defendant exercised any control over such area. There is also no evidence that the defendant could exclude or limit access to this area. Additionally, the players would not be present in this area during the game. There is uncontroverted evidence before this Court that the town is responsible for maintenance of the park. In the context of this case, therefore, we are of the opinion that the league did not owe a duty of care to the plaintiff.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. The record shall be returned to the Superior Court. 2', 'This subsequent remedial measure undertaken by the town emphasizes that the town had control over the park and the responsibility for remedying any defects thereto.', '-7-', 'Robinson, J., dissenting.', 'The Court’s opinion is well-written and reflects careful research into the law of torts. However, it fails to convince me that summary judgment was correctly granted, and I feel obliged to respectfully dissent.', 'In the second paragraph of the “Facts and Procedural History” section of the majority’s opinion, one reads the following:', '“Victor J. Beretta, a fellow Little League parent and former', 'assistant coach, did not witness the fall but observed the divot on', 'the ground where plaintiff was injured. During his deposition, he', 'described the divot as roughly ‘6, 8 inches across, maybe a little', 'wider than that’ and ‘a good 8, 10 inches deep.’ Beretta also', 'testified at his deposition that the divots were a ‘repetitive', 'problem’ that were caused by players who would dig the toe and', 'spikes of their baseball cleats into the ground while waiting for', 'their turn to enter the batting cages.” In my view, the fact that “the divots were a ‘repetitive problem’” and that they “were caused by players who would dig the toe and spikes of their baseball cleats into the ground” takes this case out of the ambit of the several cases cited by the majority holding that there is no duty “where an injury occurred on property not owned by the defendant.” What radically differentiates this case from the cases cited by the majority is the fact that the Little League players “caused” the divots to come into existence—and indeed have acted in that matter so often that a witness (described by the majority as “a fellow Little League parent and former assistant coach”) characterized it as a “repetitive problem.” That being the case, it is clear to me that the Little League is no ordinary user of property owned by another. The plain blunt fact is that Tuckertown Field was changed and made more hazardous by the deliberate activities of the players “who would dig the toe and spikes of their baseball cleats into the ground while waiting for their turn to enter the batting cages.” Accordingly, considering all the relevant factors and, particularly, the principle of fairness, it is my opinion that the Little League did owe a duty of care to the plaintiff, who was a', '-8- parent at the field to watch her son play Little League baseball when she was injured. See Woodruff v. Gitlow, 91 A.3d 805, 814 (R.I. 2014). 1 In my judgment, the Little League had a duty to warn spectators of the presence of the divots repeatedly caused by the activities of the players as they prepared to enter the batting cages. Needless to say, if the summary judgment had been vacated (as I believe it should have been), the plaintiff would still have had to grapple with issues of breach and causation, not to mention credibility.', 'I would not venture to hypothesize as to which party would prevail at a trial. I only know that the plaintiff’s quest for recovery should not have been cut off short of a trial. Therefore, I respectfully record my dissent. 1', 'As the majority notes, in this Court’s opinion in Woodruff v. Gitlow, 91 A.3d 805, 814 (R.I. 2014), we stated that, when determining whether a duty exists, the Court will consider “all relevant factors, including the relationship of the parties, the scope and burden of the obligation to be imposed upon the defendant, public policy considerations, and notions of fairness.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.)', '-9-', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'Kathleen Carlson v.

The defendant, Miguel Davis, appeals from a judgment of conviction entered after a jury found him guilty of three offenses: the murder of Dominique Gay, in violation of G.L. 1956 §§ 11-23-1 and 11-23-2; using a firearm while committing a crime of violence resulting in the death of Dominique Gay, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-47- 3.2; and carrying a pistol without a license, in violation of § 11-47-8(a).

When Dutra and Gay broke up, they agreed that each could see other people “as long as it wasn’t anybody that [either Dutra or Gay] knew.” Soon, Dutra began a relationship with defendant. Dutra testified that, in keeping with her agreement with Gay, she asked Davis whether he knew Gay, going so far as to point out several pictures of Gay in her home; however, each time Davis responded that he did not know Gay.', 'But at some point after Dutra began dating defendant, Gay told Dutra that he did know Davis. Dutra said that Gay told her that defendant was “one of the younger crowd that they hanged [sic] with.” Indeed, Gay was able to describe defendant to her, describing his “long hair, braids and ‘Loyalty’ [tattooed] on his neck.” Dutra rebuffed Gay and told him that he did not know Davis and that he was just jealous that she was dating someone else.', 'Unfortunately, that did not end the matter. Gay began to confront defendant repeatedly between the summer of 2007 and January 2009, tensions escalating drastically with each encounter.', 'Those incidents included several occasions when Gay challenged defendant to engage in fisticuffs or when defendant was otherwise threatened by Gay. On one occasion,', '-2- Dutra allowed Gay to spend the night at her house, because he had nowhere else to go. When defendant also needed a place to stay that night, Dutra allowed Gay to stay, while defendant slept in his car outside her apartment. The bad blood continued even after defendant and Dutra ended their relationship and Dutra restarted an intermittent liaison with Gay.', 'Dutra moved to Boston for almost a year, but when she returned to Providence and resumed her relationship with Gay, she heard about several more incidents between Gay and defendant. Dutra said that Gay’s challenges continued into the fall of 2008. She recalled that one day that Gay woke her up after he received a call from Robinson. Gay demanded that she drive him “really fast” to the Domino’s Pizza on Broad Street. When they got there, Robinson was holding onto someone and Gay told Dutra to remain in the parking lot while he went inside. Dutra observed as Gay walked to the front of the Domino’s and said that “he grabbed [a] kid and * * * lifted the kid in the air by his shirt.” She then heard Gay say that he was not there for him, that “his beef was with Miguel.” Gay then gave the young man a piece of paper with his phone number and told him to give it to defendant and have him call Gay.', 'Dutra admitted that she never saw defendant pursuing or looking for Gay and that, during each confrontation, defendant was either running from or avoiding Gay. She said that she understood that Gay was confronting defendant because “it was a respect thing * * * [Gay] said he wanted to fight him.”', 'Another serious incident occurred in early January 2009, when defendant was with his then girlfriend, Lisa. 2 On that night, Lisa, defendant, and defendant’s friend, Juan Arciliares, drove to Arciliares’s house. After Lisa parked her car, defendant took her keys and her cell phone, and he and Arciliares went into the building, leaving her behind. Suddenly, Lisa heard 2', 'We have assigned a pseudonym to defendant’s former girlfriend to protect her privacy.', '-3- the windows of her car shatter from a gunshot, although she was unable to determine the direction from which the shots came. Lisa’s rear windshield was smashed, there was a hole through the front windshield on the passenger side, and a bullet was lodged in the grille of the car. After the shots were fired, Lisa began screaming to defendant to bring her keys back so that she could leave. The defendant did not come down immediately, but responded through the window of the apartment, “It wasn’t for you, it was for me.”', 'Kevin Santiago, a somewhat younger friend who hung out with defendant and his associates, testified that he was in Arciliares’s apartment playing video games when the shooting happened.', 'Santiago testified that defendant told them that “Mike Stokes and Dean – and Dominique were shooting at him.”', 'The Eyewitness', 'The only eyewitness to Gay’s murder who testified at trial was Wilson Andujar. 3 Andujar testified that, after moving away, he moved back to Providence toward the end of 2008. At that time, Andujar reconnected with old friends, but met Gay for the first time about a month after returning to Rhode Island. Andujar and Gay became friends; he said that the pair would see each other about two or three times each week.', 'Andujar testified that on the day of the murder, March 20, 2009, Gay showed up at his house that morning around 9 or 10 a.m., looking for a way to smoke some marijuana. They decided to go to a store to buy a cigar for that purpose and, on their way, Andujar and Gay decided to call on Robinson to see if he wished to join them. After picking up Robinson, the three friends walked to a gas station, bought a cigar, and then went to a restaurant. After they left the restaurant, the group decided to walk back to Robinson’s house. 3', 'Dean Robinson, who also was present when Gay was shot, was expected to testify at trial, but unexpectedly invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.', '-4-', 'Andujar explained that they walked side-by-side with Andujar in the middle, Gay to his left, and Robinson to his right. Andujar testified that there was an alley behind a laundromat where a dumpster was located. As they approached the alley, he heard “a gravel noise” and then looked to his left and saw defendant standing beside the dumpster pointing a handgun at them. Almost immediately, Andujar said, “Right there where I looked, I heard the first shot. Right when I went to run, I slipped. That’s right there, when I slipped [I] heard a second shot. I kept—I started to run.” Andujar also testified, on cross-examination, that he saw a black handgun, but that he did not know whether the weapon was a revolver or what caliber it might have been.', 'Andujar further testified that the assailant was wearing a “hoodie” that covered part of his head but that the hood was not pulled all the way forward. The gunman also had a bandanna that covered part of his face, from the tip of his nose past his chin, so that the only portion of his face that Andujar could see was his hairline, his forehead, his eyes, and part of his nose. When asked if he was able to recognize the person holding the weapon, Andujar responded that it was Miguel Davis. He said that he recognized Davis because he knew him from 2006—three years prior to the shooting and seven years prior to trial—when they were in school together for “a couple weeks.” 4 Andujar identified defendant in the courtroom as the man he had seen with the gun on March 20, 2009; however, when asked at what point he realized that it was Miguel Davis with the gun, Andujar testified that it was not immediate; it was not until later, when “it just * * * clicked in my head who I just saw.”', 'After fleeing from the gunman, Andujar said, he looked over his left shoulder and saw Robinson being chased by another man, whom he eventually identified as Christopher “Ucci” 4', 'Although Andujar testified that he knew defendant, he said that they were not friends and they did not talk to each other in school or hang out together.', '-5- Martinez. Andujar testified that Ucci was not the same person he saw with a gun, that Ucci did not have anything covering his face when he saw him pursuing Robinson, and that he was also wearing “a black hoodie.” 5 When he did not hear any more gunshots, Andujar lay down on the ground and called 9-1-1.', 'Andujar soon came upon Robinson, who was crying, yelling, and saying, “They got him.” From where they were standing, Andujar said, he could see Gay’s body, lying on the sidewalk near the dumpster, and he began to cry himself.', 'Andujar and Robinson were brought to the police station to be questioned. Andujar said he was not cooperative and merely told the police “the simple fact that we got shot at, I didn’t see nothing.” When asked at trial if that was true, Andujar said no, that “I was just going by the so-called street code and I was * * * fearing for my life of what just happened” and that he feared that he “could be retaliated.” He testified that he did not discuss the shooting with Robinson at the police station, but that they did discuss it at Gay’s funeral. At that time, he said, he told Robinson that he had seen defendant shoot Gay.', 'Andujar left the state shortly after the shooting, determined, he said, to turn his life around. The next time Andujar saw or heard anything about his friend’s murder was more than three years later, in September 2012, when a friend sent a Facebook message to him that said he should look at an accompanying link to a video clip. The video clip was a news report of a “break in the case,” showing defendant in a courtroom being arraigned for the murder of 5', 'The color of the hoodie that the gunman wore was not discussed until cross-examination during the following exchange: “Q And you say that Ucci is wearing a black hoodie; right? “A Correct.', '“* * * “Q Same black hoodie you said you saw on the shooter; right? “A Correct.”', '-6- Dominique Gay. Soon after he viewed that video, Andujar was contacted by Robinson. Andujar and Robinson specifically discussed that defendant had been arrested for the murder of Gay.', 'Andujar then returned to Rhode Island at the request and expense of the Providence police, and he met with police and prosecutors. During that meeting, Andujar disclosed to the police, for the first time, that he had seen Davis shoot Gay. The police showed two photo arrays to Andujar. In the first six-photo array, Andujar identified a photo of Ucci and, in the second, he identified a picture of defendant.', 'Forensic Evidence', 'During the trial, the state called Dr. Alexander Chirkov, who performed the autopsy on Dominique Gay. He testified that he found two bullet wounds in Gay’s body and that both wounds were fatal. The state also called Providence Bureau of Criminal Information Det. Douglas Allin to testify about forensic evidence that had been found at the scene, including two cartridge casings and two full cartridges that had been found near the dumpster.', 'Robert A. Hathaway, an expert in firearm and toolmark examination at the Rhode Island State Crime Laboratory, testified about the forensic examination conducted on the spent casings. Hathaway observed that both were 9 mm Luger Winchester cartridge cases. Hathaway testified that it was his expert opinion that both rounds had been fired from the same weapon.', 'However, after analyzing the two lead projectiles extracted from Gay’s body, Hathaway was unable to positively identify them as having been fired from the same weapon. Hathaway was, however, able to conclude, based on the weight and diameter of both projectiles, that the bullets would have been in the “.38 caliber class” of bullets. He further testified that that class would include such weapons as the .38 special, .38 S&W, 9 mm Luger, and .357 Magnum.', '-7-', 'Access to Guns', 'At trial, the state was unable to produce the murder weapon or to directly link the forensic evidence to defendant, but it did introduce extensive evidence of defendant’s access to guns. The state’s primary witness on that front was Santiago. Santiago was interviewed by Providence police one week after Gay was murdered and at a time when Santiago had a pending robbery charge. During that interview, Santiago gave the police information about defendant’s access to firearms. At trial, Santiago testified that defendant told him and some friends that he was romantically involved with Lisa and that, while Lisa’s grandfather was in Florida, the pair had used the grandfather’s Johnston home for a liaison.', 'Santiago said that, according to defendant, while Lisa was in the bathroom, he rummaged through the grandfather’s bedroom and discovered a 9 mm handgun, two shotguns, a 20-gauge and a 12-gauge, as well as a .22-caliber rifle under the bed. Santiago said defendant had brought those guns to Arciliares’s garage. He described the handgun as being chrome with a black handle, and he said defendant kept it on his person at all times. He also said that defendant stashed the other weapons at Arciliares’s house and that they often fired them into a punching bag in Arciliares’s garage. Santiago also claimed that defendant admitted to him on several occasions that it was he who had killed Dominique Gay. The defendant, he said, claimed that he was “hiding behind the dumpster until he seen Dominique Gay come out [sic] the house, that’s when he started shooting at Dominique Gay.”', 'Lisa also testified about defendant’s access to her grandfather’s guns. She said that her grandfather was a retired correctional officer, that he was a hunter, and that she was aware that he kept firearms in his house. She said that her grandparents had given her a key to their house and asked her to check on it while they were in Florida. She testified that she met defendant in', '-8- October of 2008 and, for a few months, she saw him almost every day. During that time, Lisa said, she and defendant frequently drove around or hung out with his friends, during which time she recalled hearing conversations about guns, including descriptions such as a “nina” and numbers such as “38 something.”', 'Lisa testified that she brought defendant to her grandparents’ house on two occasions in November. On both of those occasions, Lisa stated that she and defendant were in the house for about an hour, that they had engaged in sexual intercourse, and that Lisa briefly went to the bathroom before they left. She said that, on a few occasions, defendant had borrowed her car for several hours and that the key to her grandparents’ house was on her key ring. Yet, despite seeing defendant every day from October to January, she testified that she never saw him holding any firearm. Lisa testified that she asked defendant if he took her grandfather’s gun and he responded, jokingly, saying, “Yeah, I took your grandfather’s gun. Why would I take it?”', 'The state also offered the testimony of another witness, Louise, 6 Lisa’s aunt. Louise testified that she received a call from her father, Lisa’s grandfather, asking that she check on the condition of his home. She said that her father “was afraid something might have happened. There may have been a robbery or something could’ve been disturbed in some way.” When she and her husband visited the house, she called her father to tell him they had arrived. He asked her if anything looked disturbed, and she said everything looked normal. Her father then asked them to look for a handgun that he kept in the bedroom between the mattress and the box spring. When they lifted the mattress, there was no handgun; the only thing they noticed was a darkened, soiled spot on the sheet. After that, Louise and her husband removed multiple weapons from the 6', 'We have assigned a pseudonym to Lisa’s aunt in the interest of protecting her privacy.', '-9- house. She had no idea how many guns were removed, or even whether the weapons removed were handguns, because all the weapons were in cases.', 'After the close of all evidence, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on the counts submitted to it.', '2', 'Issues on Appeal', 'Before this Court, defendant argues that his convictions should be vacated for several reasons. First, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in not instructing the jury about: (1) prejudicial opening statements that detailed the expected testimony of Dean Robinson; and (2) a specific limiting instruction on the unreliability of eyewitness testimony.', 'Second, defendant argues that the trial justice abused his discretion when he allowed three witnesses to testify about firearms that allegedly had been stolen by defendant from the home of his girlfriend’s grandparents.', 'Third, defendant contends that the trial justice erred in permitting the prosecution to display an “in-life” family portrait of the victim, his daughter, and his daughter’s mother because the state’s sole purpose for admitting it was to invoke the jurors’ sympathy for the victim.', 'Fourth, defendant claims that the trial justice erred when he did not grant defendant’s motion for a new trial.', '- 10 -', '3', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Jury Instructions', 'i', 'The Opening Statement', 'During the state’s forty-minute opening statement, the prosecutor informed the jury about the testimony that the state expected to present during the course of the trial, explaining that both Andujar, and particularly Robinson, would testify to the events of the day. The prosecutor told the jury that:', '“The case will be proved directly. It’s going to be proved by two', 'men, Wilson Andujar and Dean Robinson, who will tell you', 'directly what they saw. They saw him. They’ll both tell you that', 'they knew him, that they recognized him * * *. And both will tell', 'you that according to Dean Robinson, it’s as soon as he saw him he', 'knew it was him.” The state repeatedly indicated that both Andujar and Robinson would say that they were acquainted with defendant and that they knew he was the shooter, but that neither had identified defendant to the police right after the crime was committed. The prosecutor explained to the jury that Andujar immediately left the state out of fear. He then said that Robinson would testify that he did not tell the police right away who the shooter was, but that he did tell Crystal Dutra “that he had seen and knew that Miguel Davis was the shooter of Dominique Gay.” Furthermore, the state claimed that Robinson would say that he did not want to tell the police whom he saw “because he wanted to take care of it himself. He wanted to do to Miguel Davis what Miguel Davis had done to Dominique Gay.”', '- 11 -', 'The prosecutor also said that Robinson, for his own reasons, had declined to cooperate with them, but “now finally * * * [would] tell the police and did tell the police what he had seen happen to his dearest friend, this man shooting and killing him.” The state ended its lengthy soliloquy by telling the jury the following:', '“Finally, you know from what you were told before you', 'were chosen that for lack of bail this Defendant is at the ACI.', 'You’ll hear that. So is Dean Robinson. The deal he cut about his', 'robbery landed him two years in jail, that he’s now serving.

The trial justice had Robinson confirm, on the record and outside the presence of the jury, that he had been advised against testifying and would invoke his privilege against self-incrimination. The defendant did not move for a mistrial.', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice committed reversible error when he failed to accede to his request to impart a limiting instruction to the jury to remedy the prosecutor’s lengthy opening statements about expected testimony from Dean Robinson, testimony the jury never heard because the witness invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The defendant concedes that the prosecutor did not act in bad faith when he described the expected testimony. However, he urges that he nonetheless was prejudiced by the detailed and lengthy nature of the prosecutor’s comments, including an alleged threat made by defendant to 7', 'Defense counsel repeatedly objected during the prosecutor’s opening statements, twelve times in all, but each time he was overruled.', '- 12 - Robinson while both of them were incarcerated. The state responds that defendant waived any right to review of this issue because he failed to renew his objection at the conclusion of the trial justice’s charge to the jury. The state further argues that the trial court was not required to give any curative instruction because the prosecutor’s opening statements did not cause incurable prejudice to defendant. Indeed, the state argues that any prejudice resulting from the statement and the unfulfilled promises that it contained actually harmed the state.', '1', 'Standard of Review', '“[T]he standard of review for jury instructions is well settled. A charge ‘need only adequately cover[] the law.’” State v. Long, 61 A.3d 439, 445 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v.

Hanes, 783 A.2d 920, 924 (R.I. 2001). In the numerous cases where this Court has declined to address a particular issue on appeal, the reasoning is frequently directed at trial counsel’s failure to alert the trial justice to the particular objection at any point in the trial. See State v. Lynch, 854 A.2d 1022, 1034 (R.I. 2004) (“waived by [the] defendant’s failure to object after the trial justice instructed the jury”); State v.

Fetzik, 577 A.2d 990, 993 (R.I. 1990), this Court considered whether an objection was raised with sufficient specificity and held that the objection and proffered supplemental instruction concerning an affirmative defense, that was not timely filed, was nevertheless preserved. We reasoned that:', '“[a]lthough the instruction was technically late, the trial justice', 'appears to have had an adequate opportunity to consider this', 'instruction.

Furthermore, this Court specifically held that “[b]y failing to raise a proper objection, defendant deprived the trial justice of any opportunity to remedy possible deficiencies in the instructions before they were delivered.” State v.

Palmer, 962 A.2d 758, 766 n.5 (R.I. 2009). Nevertheless, this Court held that the objection was waived because “the trial justice informed counsel in no uncertain terms that objections were to be made after he instructed the jury.” Id.', '- 15 -', 'At the close of the state’s case, the trial justice addressed several matters on the record but outside the jury’s presence, including jury instructions.

Although defense counsel brought some concerns to the trial justice’s attention, it is significant that he made no objection about Dean Robinson or the state’s opening statement.', 'Therefore, this Court must decide whether, in the context of this case, the failure to do so was fatal.', 'On that point, this Court’s determination in State v. Pailin, 114 R.I. 725, 339 A.2d 253 (1975), is illuminating. There, the defendant objected to statements made by the state in its closing argument and moved for a mistrial. Id. at 727, 339 A.2d at 255. This Court explained as follows:', '“We have made it perfectly clear that for a defendant to', 'preserve a question of prejudicial error in closing argument for our', 'review he must not only make an objection at the time, but must', 'make a request for cautionary instructions.', 'Except under', 'circumstances where the trial justice could find no fault with the', 'challenged remarks, or where they are so flagrant that no', 'precautionary instruction could dilute their effect, this failure to', 'request instructions is fatal. * * * The defendant asked the trial', 'justice to declare a mistrial, but once this request was denied, he', 'remained silent and did not request instructions either at the bench', 'conference or at the close of the state’s argument, nor did he object', 'to any of the justice’s charges to the jury in regard to this point.', 'Having failed at trial to request curative measures of the allegedly', 'prejudicial remarks of the prosecutor, defendant will not be heard', 'to complain here.” Id. at 728, 339 A.2d at 255 (emphases added). After a thorough review of the record, it is our opinion that we would be elevating form over substance if we were to hold that defendant failed to adequately preserve the issue of the trial justice’s denial of a request for a limiting instruction. We observe that, although defendant did not renew the objection after the trial justice instructed the jury, he did object the day before during a recorded charging conference after instructions were provided to the parties and in', '- 17 - response to the trial justice’s request for specific objections. Therefore, defendant adequately preserved the issue of the trial justice’s denial for a limiting jury instruction for appeal.', '3', 'Did the Opening Statement Cause Prejudice Requiring a Limiting Instruction?', 'The defendant argues that the state predetermined the outcome of this case by virtue of its opening statement because it was permitted to present to the jury a lengthy and persuasive narrative of the events, introducing anticipated direct quotes from Robinson, the most important eyewitness, without giving defendant a chance to cross-examine. The defendant contends that Robinson’s “phantom” corroboration of Andujar’s identification, particularly when paired with the state’s concluding allegation that defendant warned Robinson not to testify, doomed defendant. The state maintains that it operated on the good-faith belief that Robinson was going to testify exactly as it laid out in its opening, and that any prejudice that might have arisen as a consequence of Robinson’s failure to appear before the jury inhered against the state, because it failed to deliver on its promise to present him. 8', 'It is well settled that “[t]he prosecutor is entitled, during opening statements, to comment on evidence the prosecutor believed in good faith will be available and admissible.” State v. Usenia, 599 A.2d 1026, 1032 (R.I. 1991). “The general rule in such situations is that there must be a good-faith and reasonable basis upon which a prosecutor may believe that such evidence will be offered and deemed admissible at trial.” State v. Ware, 524 A.2d 1110, 1112 (R.I. 1987). 8', 'As an initial matter, this Court feels obliged to note that despite defendant’s not having raised a constitutional claim under the Confrontation Clause during the trial with respect to this issue, such a claim would have no traction. This is so because we have held that “[w]hen a witness refuses to testify and invokes a legitimate Fifth Amendment privilege, the Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause no longer applies because the witness is unavailable.” State v.

Pugliese, 117 R.I. 21, 362 A.2d 124 (1976)). “Prejudice inheres if the comments ‘are totally extraneous to the issues in the case and tend to inflame and arouse the passions of the jury’ against the defendant.” Ware, 524 A.2d at 1112 (quoting Collazo, 446 A.2d at 1010).', 'In Usenia, 599 A.2d at 1032, the defendant challenged a comment by the prosecutor that “[i]ncriminating evidence is found both inside the car and on the person of the people inside the car,” because that incriminating evidence was not later admitted. We held that there was no error in overruling the defendant’s objection, reasoning as follows:', '“The prosecutor was justified at that time in believing that these', 'relevant items would be admitted into evidence. The prosecutor is', 'entitled to tell the jury what he intends to prove. If the prosecution', 'is unable to prove what has been promised, it will lose credibility', 'with the jury and [the] defendant will benefit.” Id. In Collazo, 446 A.2d at 1009, the defendant challenged comments made by the prosecutor to the jury that the murder weapon had been stolen by the defendant from an off-duty policeman. This Court determined that those remarks were improper because there was no competent and', '- 19 - admissible evidence to support the claim that the defendant stole the murder weapon. Id. at 1010. However, because there was substantial other evidence submitted at trial from which the jury could infer premeditation—the basis for which the state claimed it made the improper comment—this Court held that “the challenged remarks did not have any effect on the determination of [the] defendant’s guilt or innocence.” Id. at 1011.', 'Here, because defendant concedes that the state acted in good faith when it offered a preview of Robinson’s expected testimony, we need only address whether the comments were so prejudicial that the trial justice was required to give specific limiting instructions. The comments throughout the state’s opening statement centered on testimony that it believed would be directly presented to the jury by Robinson.', 'We believe it to be significant that the trial justice attempted to cure whatever prejudice that might have inhered to defendant by repeatedly admonishing the jury that “the statements of lawyers are not evidence.” See State v. Monteiro, 924 A.2d 784, 792 (R.I. 2007). The trial justice made this comment before the state’s opening statement, at the close of evidence, and again in the course of his jury instructions. Indeed, it is readily apparent that the trial justice tailored his remarks to the jury in response to defendant’s concern that he might be prejudiced, telling the panel: “As I said to you at the beginning of the trial, statements of lawyers are in no way to be considered as evidence. I renew that sentiment again, and remind you that anything a lawyer has said or is about to say in closing arguments is not evidence.”', 'Therefore, we discern no error by the trial justice when he declined to give the specific limiting instruction requested by defendant to disregard what the state said in its opening statement about Dean Robinson.', '- 20 -', 'ii', 'Eyewitness Identification Testimony', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice committed reversible error when he refused to grant defendant’s request for instructions on certain factors for the jury to consider when assessing the reliability of eyewitness identification testimony.', 'The defendant urges that, because Andujar’s identification was so unreliable, 9 a specific instruction was necessary to ensure that the jury properly considered all the risks associated with misidentification. The defendant argues that Andujar’s identification was particularly unreliable because he could not have viewed the gunman for more than a second or two, because he began to run as soon as he saw the gun and the first shot was fired, and because the gunman’s features were partially covered. Also, defendant contends that, although he asserted that he knew defendant, he had not seen him for several years and had never spoken to him, and he did not identify defendant as the shooter until after watching a video of defendant being arraigned for this specific crime, more than three years after the shooting. For those reasons, defendant requested that the trial justice give the jury “some sort of Neil v. Biggers identification instruction.” The state responds that the trial justice’s decision comported completely with Rhode Island law and to hold otherwise would result in a rejection of thirty years of this Court’s precedent.', '1', 'Waiver', 'The state concedes that defendant’s objection to the trial justice’s refusal to include an instruction on eyewitness identification testimony was preserved for the record.

At most, we said that this model instruction need not be given.” Id. at 206.

It is enough that you conclude that the witness was mistaken in her belief or impression.” Id. at 1290-91.

The defendant argues that it is undisputed that the murder weapon was never found and that evidence that he allegedly stole four guns—a handgun, two shotguns, and a rifle—was irrelevant, highly prejudicial, and introduced for the sole purpose of casting his character in an unfavorable light. The state responds that defendant has waived the right to press this issue on appeal because he never articulated in the trial court that the evidence violated Rule 404(b).

The parties discussed at length what testimony was expected from the numerous witnesses, with the state urging that the evidence was admissible because it demonstrated that defendant had access to firearms.

And he doesn’t say that when he met him that he came walking in with, you know, with any firearms, but the main point that I was trying to make is that the daughter, who received a call from the grandfather, she can’t testify that it was a .9 millimeter that was taken or that the grandfather had a .9 millimeter. And there’s nobody that can testify that the grandfather checked for the .9 millimeter before getting on the plane. So the .9 millimeter could have been missing six months earlier.

That’s something you would argue to a jury for its weight.', '“* * * “[Trial Justice]: I don’t know that the State contends that that’s the only person who went in the house. But the State’s contending that it was your client who was among them and that your client was the one, according to Santiago, who stole the guns.

Rios, 996 A.2d 639 (2010), the Rhode Island Supreme Court indicated that that kind of material, particularly access to firearms, even though it may not have been the very firearm that was used in the event, is admissible evidence.

At that time, defense counsel also advanced an objection pursuant to Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence because, he argued, the discussion of guns was not probative of his having a gun on March 20, 2009, and that any probative value was outweighed by its prejudicial impact. Contemporaneously, defense counsel and the trial justice had a conversation about proposed testimony by Dutra that she saw defendant with a gun in 2007.

The state also asserts that, even assuming defendant properly raised the issue before trial, he did not properly preserve the issue for appeal because he failed to object to the same evidence when it was proffered at trial. The defendant responds that the trial justice repeatedly denied defendant’s motions on issues of relevancy and other misconduct evidence on the grounds that State v.

The defendant repeatedly argued to the trial justice that the “stolen guns” evidence was highly prejudicial, that there was not a sufficient nexus between the guns that had been stolen and the murder weapon, and he specifically challenged the trial justice’s reliance on our holding in Rios.', 'The sole issue that this Court addressed in Rios, 996 A.2d at 638, was whether the trial justice committed error because evidence that two witnesses had observed the defendant in', '- 35 - possession of a handgun several months prior to the murder was inadmissible under Rule 404(b). This Court determined “that the trial justice engaged in the appropriate analysis of the testimony offered by both [witnesses] by first evaluating the relevance of the proffered testimony under Rule 404(b) and then carefully weighing the probative value of the testimony against the danger of unfair prejudice under Rule 403.” Rios, 966 A.2d at 640-41. The trial justice in the case at bar conducted precisely the same analysis at defense counsel’s urging. Thus, it is readily apparent to this Court that, in founding his decision squarely on our ruling in Rios, the trial justice was adequately alerted to the basis of defendant’s objection on Rule 404(b) grounds.', 'However, we are not convinced that the trial justice’s several and temporized rulings on the pretrial motion were “unequivocally definitive” to relieve defendant of his obligation to raise the issue again in “the vital context of the trial itself.” See Andujar, 899 A.2d at 1222 (quoting Kaner, 876 A.2d at 1134 n.4). Not only were the issues of access to or interest in guns repeatedly reargued before trial, but the issues became intertwined and conflated. On more than one occasion, the trial justice indicated that he was unsure of what his final decision would be and that he wished to reevaluate his rulings after seeing how the trial progressed. 14', 'Therefore, it is our considered opinion that defendant did not properly preserve the issue for appeal and we will not address the merits of the argument.', 'C', 'In-Life Family Portrait Photograph', 'The defendant next argues that the trial justice committed reversible error when he allowed the state to introduce an “in-life” family portrait-style photograph of the victim, Dutra, 14', 'On the occasion that the trial justice was most definitive—when he said, “Your objection is noted for the record. It’s coming in.”—he was specifically referring to the testimony of Dutra that she saw defendant with a gun in 2007. That evidence was not, in the end, admitted and therefore is not at issue in this appeal.', '- 36 - and their daughter. The defendant urges that the photograph had no probative value and was introduced by the state for the sole purpose of engendering the jury’s sympathy, thereby prejudicing defendant. The state responds that (1) this issue was not preserved for appeal and (2) that it needed the photograph to meet its burden of proving all the elements of the case, including the identity of the victim, and to show that defendant knew the victim.', 'i', 'Waiver', 'The defendant included an objection to the photograph among his motions in limine. The trial justice made the following ruling on the record:', '“I’m satisfied that there’s nothing prejudicial about this', 'photograph, to the extent that you are concerned about sympathy', 'being generated.', '[Defense counsel], both you and [the', 'prosecution] may have already told the jury that they must not be', 'swayed by sympathy. Of course, I will be telling them the same', 'thing. This was a rather tame photograph. There’s nothing', 'prejudicial about it, in any event. That will be admitted if proper', 'foundation is laid.” During the trial, Dutra was asked if she recognized the photo, to which she responded affirmatively. The state then moved to have the photo marked as a full exhibit and there was no objection. When the state asked Dutra if the photo was something that was displayed in her home, defendant objected without providing any basis; the objection was overruled.', 'No objection was made when the state asked the witness if defendant had claimed that he did not know Gay.', '- 37 -', 'It is clear to us that the trial justice’s in limine ruling on the admission of the photograph was not “unequivocally definitive,” and, therefore, defendant’s failure to object when the photograph was introduced is fatal to his arguing the issue on appeal. 15', 'D', 'Motion for New Trial', 'The defendant’s final argument on appeal challenges the trial justice’s denial of his motion for a new trial, pursuant to Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. The defendant submits that the trial justice was clearly wrong in affirming the jury’s verdict because the state’s two key witnesses, Andujar and Santiago, were either unreliable or otherwise unworthy of belief.', 'i', 'Standard of Review', '“When ruling on a motion for a new trial, the trial justice acts as a thirteenth juror, exercising ‘independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.’” State v.

Imbruglia, 913 A.2d 1022, 1028 (R.I. 2007)). “Specifically, ‘the trial justice must (1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the 15', 'We pause to note that, had defendant properly preserved his objection, we would not have identified an abuse of discretion in admitting the photograph. “Decisions about the admissibility of evidence on relevancy grounds are left to the sound discretion of the trial justice * * *.

Here, the trial justice considered defendant’s argument and the proffered relevance of the photo by the state, finding that it was relevant and not prejudicial.

The trial justice noted that Santiago was “vigorously” cross-examined and related details on some important factual items that showed he was not simply making up facts to impress the jury. Many of those details—“[f]or example, he recounted how the defendant had told him he had had sex with [Lisa] at her grandparents’ house, that he knew where the house was, and he knew the guns were under the bed, and that the grandfather may have been some kind of a law enforcement officer”—corroborated his testimony about defendant. Moreover, Santiago’s testimony that defendant showed him a 9 mm handgun was corroborated by the forensic evidence revealing that a 9 mm handgun was used to murder Dominique Gay.', '- 39 -', 'The trial justice explained that he too found Santiago’s testimony to be credible and that it was supported by Dutra, who provided a motive for defendant to bring harm to Gay. He further found that with the testimony of Andujar, “the evidence of guilt becomes overwhelming.” The trial justice described that Andujar was not a stranger to defendant and, despite the shooter’s attempt to hide his identity, Andujar testified that he had known that the assailant was defendant since the day of the shooting. Additionally, the trial justice found that Andujar’s explanations for not telling the police what he knew were believable—particularly that he was in fear for his life because he had just seen his friend murdered while he was walking with him on a public street. Finally, the trial justice said he was not at all critical of the jury’s apparent acceptance of Andujar’s testimony.', 'The trial justice also addressed several of the arguments defendant has raised on appeal, explaining that each of the issues was addressed before and during trial and that he stood by his rulings. Finally, the trial justice concluded that he was “convinced beyond peradventure that the jury’s verdict was absolutely the correct one, that it was beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant’s guilt was established.”', 'Our review of the record convinces us that the trial justice more than met his obligations to consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, independently assess the credibility of the two most important witnesses, Andujar and Santiago, and determine whether he agreed with the jury’s ultimate verdict.', 'With that, our review of the trial justice’s decision to deny the defendant’s motion for a new trial comes to an end.

The defendant, Barry Offley, appeals to this Court, seeking to vacate his convictions for the execution-style murder of Jessica Imran and the serious wounding of Julie Lang. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '1', 'Facts and Travel', 'By July 26, 2006, Alonzo Shelton had been involved in an intermittent seven-year relationship with Brenda Alvarez. Although he listed his sister’s apartment in Providence as his official residence, Shelton also lived at Brenda’s 1 apartment in Central Falls with her and her three children, Natasha, Carlos, and Tatiana. Shelton developed a paternal relationship with the 1', 'We identify Brenda and her children by their first names solely for the sake of clarity. No', 'disrespect is intended.', '-1- children and in turn, Brenda became acquainted with several of Shelton’s relatives, including his nephew, Barry Offley. According to Brenda, Offley and Shelton had a “pretty tight relationship” and Offley would often spend time with his uncle at her apartment. Indeed, Offley had, for several months, lived in the Alvarez apartment and the Alvarezes considered Offley to be part of the family as well.', 'During the afternoon of July 26, 2006, Brenda had a telephone conversation with Shelton while she was at work. During that conversation, Shelton complained that “he was bored” and he asked Brenda to bring Offley to the apartment so that they could play video games. Later, at about 8 p.m., while she was running job-related errands, Brenda picked Offley up and dropped him off at her apartment; she then returned to her place of employment in Lincoln. Shelton and Offley spent the evening drinking beer, watching movies, and playing video games. At about 2 a.m., Brenda’s sixteen-year-old son, Carlos, joined them. At some point, the pair told Carlos that they were leaving but that they would be returning in twenty minutes. According to Offley, he and Shelton went to a “bootlegger’s” to buy more beer. 2 Offley later testified that he ingested two Ecstasy pills before they left to purchase the beer. 3', 'Meanwhile, intending to enjoy a night of leisure, Julie Lang dropped her three children off at their father’s home. Lang planned to spend the evening with her close friend, Jessica Imran. After meeting at Imran’s apartment in Pawtucket, the women dined at a Providence restaurant and eventually returned to the apartment at about 3 a.m. As they relaxed in Imran’s 2', 'A “bootlegger” is one who sells alcohol illegally after hours. 3', 'Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, also known as MDMA or “Ecstasy,” “is a synthetic,', 'psychoactive drug that is chemically similar to the stimulant methamphetamine and the', 'hallucinogen mescaline.

Imran, believing it to be her boyfriend, asked Lang to answer the door.', 'However, the person on the other side of the door was not Imran’s boyfriend, but Shelton, accompanied by Offley. Although Lang and Shelton had been involved previously in a romantic relationship, a serious disagreement had caused that relationship to come to an end.', 'The principal cause of the falling-out was an incident that had occurred several months earlier. Shelton had been a passenger in Lang’s car when the Woonsocket Police pulled her over for a broken taillight. At the time of the traffic stop, Shelton was on probation and had cocaine in his possession. According to Lang, Shelton feared that, if he was arrested for possession of a controlled substance, a violation of his probation would result, and that would result in his incarceration. To prevent that from happening, he secretly slid the crack cocaine he was carrying into Lang’s purse during the course of the stop. The officer, after discovering both occupants of the vehicle had outstanding warrants, placed Lang and Shelton under arrest.', 'The police subsequently charged Lang with possession of the cocaine and with operating a vehicle while her license was suspended. Lang was incensed by what Shelton had done, and she told him in no uncertain terms that she would not admit to the drug charge to save him. She remained unmoved despite Shelton’s pleas that a finding that it was he who had possessed the drugs would result in a violation of his probation and a long period of incarceration for him. That did not end the matter; Shelton continued to press her to “take the charge,” but Lang remained steadfast that at her scheduled court date in early August she would maintain that the cocaine was his and that, unbeknownst to her, he had slipped the drugs into her bag during the course of the traffic stop.', 'And so, in the early morning hours of July 27, 2006, with Shelton still anxious about his probation being violated, he and Offley meant business when they forced their way into Jessica', '-3- Imran’s Pawtucket apartment. The women demanded that the men leave the apartment. During an ensuing argument, a gunshot rang out. Lang later testified that she heard a shot and turned toward her friend. When she did, she saw Offley point a handgun at Imran. Offley fired a second time; this time, a round struck Imran in the head, killing her instantly. Offley then set his sights on Lang and fired again, but missed. When he attempted to fire another round, the gun jammed, causing live ammunition to spill onto the floor. Shelton then seized the gun from Offley and poured five shots into Lang—two of which struck her in the chest, two in the lower neck, and one behind the left ear.', 'The assailants then fled the apartment.', 'However, unbeknownst to Offley and Shelton, Lang survived. Bleeding heavily, but somehow managing to retain consciousness, Lang was able to dial 9-1-1.', 'Despite the severity of her injuries, Lang was able to identify herself by name and to provide her date of birth to a responding officer. Through labored breath, she also informed the officer that it was Shelton who had shot her, that her friend, Jessica Imran, also had been shot and that Jessica was lying upstairs. Another responding officer accompanied Lang into an arriving ambulance. When asked by that officer who else was in the apartment when the shooting occurred, she responded with the names of Jessica Imran, Alonzo Shelton, and Barry Offley.', 'Lang arrived at Rhode Island Hospital sometime around 5 a.m., suffering from a fractured vertebra in her neck, a damaged vertebral artery, and a collapsed left lung. The treating medical staff administered Dilaudid to her. 4 Pawtucket Police Detective Raymond Johnson arrived at the hospital shortly after 6 a.m., at which time hospital staff were still tending to Lang. After learning about Lang’s critical condition, and fearing that she might not live, the detective 4', 'Lang’s treating physician at Rhode Island Hospital testified that Dilaudid is nine times more', 'powerful than morphine.', '-4- asked her to provide another statement to him. Working around the medical staff, Det. Johnson began a tape-recorded interview. The Interview was interrupted several times, however, by emergency room staff tending to the intermittently conscious patient. Eventually, when asked why Shelton would want to kill her, Lang explained that it would be so that “I can’t blame him for drugs. They’re not mine * * * [h]e put it in my bag and I’m not taking that charge. I snitched on him in court.” As the interview continued, Lang became more confused about what had happened that night; she said that it had been Offley who shot both her and Imran. When asked if she was certain if that was what transpired, she responded that she was not, and that it was Shelton who had shot both of them after he grabbed the gun from Offley. As Lang’s condition continued to weaken, Det. Johnson was forced to terminate the interview.', 'About noon the following day, Pawtucket Police Detectives William Magill and Tina Goncalves arrived at the hospital to find Lang heavily sedated, but in stable condition. After providing the detectives with information about the acrimonious end of her past relationship with Shelton, Lang again recounted the previous night’s events. This time, however, Lang said that she clearly remembered that it was Offley who had the gun and that it was he who had killed Imran. Just before she was discharged from the hospital on August 2, 2006, the detectives paid Lang one last visit to show two photo arrays to her. When shown the first array, she immediately identified Offley as Imran’s killer.', 'In the meantime, police continued to search for Offley and Shelton. The United States Marshals eventually tracked the pair down in Florida and arrested them on September 7, 2006. On October 4, 2006, a grand jury returned a ten-count indictment against Shelton and Offley. 5 The state charged them with: (1) first-degree murder of Jessica Imran in violation of G.L. 1956 5', 'With the exception of count 8—possession of a firearm following a previous conviction for a', 'crime of violence—which was against Shelton only.', '-5- §§ 11-23-1 and 11-23-2; (2) conspiracy to commit the crime of murder of Jessica Imran, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-1-6 and § 11-23-1; (3) assault on Julie Lang with a dangerous weapon in a dwelling with the intent to murder her in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-4; (4) conspiracy to murder Julie Lang in violation of §§ 11-1-6 and 11-23-1; (5) burglary of the dwelling of Jessica Imran in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-8-1; (6) conspiracy to commit burglary in violation of §§ 11-1-6 and 11-8-1; (7) carrying a pistol without a license in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-47-8(a); (8) possession of a firearm following a previous conviction for a crime of violence in violation of § 11-47-5; (9) discharge of a firearm during a crime of violence, resulting in the death of Jessica Imran, in violation of § 11-47-3.2(b)(3); and (10) discharge of a firearm while in the commission of a crime, resulting in the injury of Julie Lang, in violation of § 11-47-3.2(b)(2). Before trial, the state, pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, dismissed the two burglary counts. Offley went to trial before a jury on the remaining counts in Superior Court in the fall of 2007. 6', 'In his opening statement, counsel argued that Offley had been nothing more than an innocent bystander to the shooting. He stressed the fact that Offley did not share any motive his uncle may have had to kill either woman. The defense sought to further mitigate any liability by telling the jury that Offley would testify to the effects that alcohol and Ecstasy may have had on his decision-making on the night of the shooting. Specifically, counsel suggested that Offley had been so intoxicated that night that he “wasn’t completely with it” and could not have been an active participant to his uncle’s crime.', 'After trial, the jury convicted Offley of the first-degree murder of Imran, conspiracy with his uncle to murder Imran, assault of Lang in a dwelling with intent to murder her, conspiracy to 6', 'Shelton was tried separately.

We have said on numerous occasions that “a litigant cannot raise an objection or advance a new theory on appeal if it was not raised before the trial court.” State v. Bido, 941 A.2d 822, 829 (R.I. 2008).

The Rules of Evidence require that a specific ground for an objection must be stated unless the reason for the objection is clear from the context in which it was made. See Rule 103(a)(1) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. After reviewing the record, it is our opinion that, although the colloquy between the trial justice and the defense is by no means a model of effective communication, the objections were sufficiently focused to alert the trial justice. The objections occurred as the prosecutor read the witness’s prior testimony into evidence and the trial justice responded to the defense’s numerous objections by stating, “This is prior testimony.” Also, counsel was rebuffed both at counsel table and when he tried to approach the trial justice at sidebar so that he could explain the rationale for his objection. Although the onus does not rest on the trial justice to clarify the grounds for a party’s objection, after a review of the record, we are satisfied that in the context of this exchange, the hearsay objections were adequately preserved for our review.', 'i', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court reviews a trial justice’s admission of evidence for clear abuse of discretion.', '- 11 - See State v.

When Carlos testified that he could not recall the answers he gave at Shelton’s trial, the state asked him if his memory would be refreshed if he read a transcript of his testimony; he answered affirmatively.

It would only be after Carlos said that the transcript did not refresh his memory that the state could attempt to introduce his prior testimony under one of the hearsay exceptions.', 'However, after a thorough review of the entire record in this case we conclude that, to the extent there may have been any error by allowing the prior testimony to be read into the record, we do not believe it requires vacating the conviction because Offley’s defense was predicated on accident and not on any theory of diminished capacity. Indeed, even though he alluded to defendant’s state of sobriety during the course of his opening statement, counsel, on the record, specifically abandoned any reliance on a diminished capacity defense.', '“Under a diminished capacity defense, a defendant submits that, although he is responsible for the prohibited act, ‘his mental capacity may have been diminished by intoxication, trauma, or mental disease so that he did not possess the specific mental state or intent essential to the particular offense charged.’” Linde v. State, 78 A.3d 738, 746 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Washington v. State, 989 A.2d 94, 101 (R.I. 2010)) (emphasis added). The defendant, who testified in his own defense, did not concede that he shot Imran. Rather, he testified that the first shot went off accidentlly and that it missed Imran, that his uncle then seized the weapon and shot the two women, and that he had nothing to do with the shootings. Simply put, defendant could not avail himself of a diminished capacity defense because he testified and denied any responsibility for the shootings.

The record reveals this colloquy:', '“The Court: In any event, I think we are all on the same page that the', 'diminished capacity defense is a square peg in a round hole, are we not?', '“[Defense]: Yes, your Honor.', '“The Court: This is a man who has told this jury that whatever happened', 'in that apartment, to the extent that he had anything to do with something', 'untoward, was a total accident. That’s basically what he’s saying; and he', 'is innocent and divorced from any and all criminal activity, and that it was', 'all Alonzo Shelton’s doing. Is that not the essence of his defense?', '“[Defense]: Yes, your Honor.', '“The Court: So, to the extent he may have consumed alcohol or ingested', 'Ecstasy, as he claims, none of it is impacted on his defense, as he has', 'offered it.', '“Were I to permit the defense of diminished capacity to intrude in this', 'case, it would be as if I were to * * * graft a self-defense instruction onto a', 'defendant who claims that he never, ever struck anybody in the', 'altercation, but says that, ‘By the way, if I did, I did it in self-defense.’', 'You just can’t do that. So, that’s pretty much where we are here.', '“I appreciate your candor in acknowledging this particular diminished', 'capacity defense has no play in this case.” Further, in his closing argument to the jury, defense counsel did not argue that defendant labored under a diminished capacity on the night of the shooting, and instead focused his closing remarks on the reliability of Lang’s account of what had occurred on that evening. In that defendant disavowed any responsibility for the shooting, he could not—and did not—offer a theory of diminished capacity as part of his defense. Because he was not seeking to mitigate responsibility for the crime under a theory of diminished capacity, any prior testimony that was admitted, by', '- 15 - any means, regarding his level of intoxication was utterly immaterial to his defense and defendant did not, in any way, suffer prejudice.', 'B', 'Motion for a New Trial', 'Next, defendant contends that because the verdict was against the weight of the evidence, the trial justice erred when he denied his motion for a new trial. Before we begin our analysis, we will set forth what we consider to be necessary background information.', 'After the state’s case-in-chief concluded, defendant moved for judgment of acquittal under Rule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. Defense counsel argued that the state’s evidence was fatally flawed because it failed to establish that defendant had shot Imran or Lang, or that defendant entered into an agreement with his uncle to carry out the murders. 8 Defense counsel also argued that the evidence was insufficient to support either a verdict of first-degree murder or conspiracy in light of what defense counsel characterized as the spontaneous, rather than deliberate, conduct by defendant. After hearing from both of the parties, the trial justice denied the motion for judgment of acquittal.', 'The defense then put on its case; its sole witness was defendant himself. The defendant admitted his close relationship with Shelton, as well as his awareness that Shelton “got in trouble” with Lang during the traffic stop. The defendant also testified that he was aware of his uncle’s fear of being sent back to jail and of Lang’s unwillingness to relieve him of that fear by pleading to the drug charges herself. Despite all this animosity, defendant maintained that they did not barge into Imran’s apartment that night. To the contrary, he said that they had been 8', 'The defendant did not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence regarding count 7, carrying a', 'pistol without a license.', '- 16 - invited there. The defendant told the jury that instead of going to the bootlegger’s, the pair met Imran and Lang in the parking lot of a nearby gas station, where he and Imran drank alcohol while Shelton and Lang spoke out of earshot. 9 Although he claimed to be “zoning” and “in a whole other world,” defendant said that he could recall being invited by the women to Imran’s Pawtucket apartment. Before going there, however, defendant and his uncle made a brief stop at the Alvarez apartment, where Shelton ran back into the house while defendant waited outside.', 'The defendant said that when they finally arrived at Imran’s apartment, but before they got out of the car, out of nowhere, his uncle asked him to carry a gun. According to defendant, Shelton was afraid that the weapon might be stolen if it was left in the car but he was unwilling to carry the gun himself, because Lang feared guns and she would “feel it on him” when she hugged him. He said that he first declined his uncle’s request, but ultimately relented, sticking the gun down the front of his pants before following Shelton upstairs. In addressing the effects the drugs and alcohol had on him that night, defendant testified that when the pills “kicked in,” he was “feeling real good,” but was nonetheless still aware of what was going on around him and could still recall what happened after he and his uncle were inside the apartment.', 'While “still feeling the same way [he] was feeling earlier” from the drugs, defendant testified, he decided to play a joke on Lang by pulling out the gun and walking up behind her. Although Lang initially was frightened by the weapon, defendant told the jury that he relieved her anxiety by informing her that he only had it on him because he was trying to sell it. He said he was surprised when Imran expressed an interest in purchasing it; the $500 or $600 price tag piqued Imran’s interest and she wanted to know more, including whether or not the gun was loaded. The defendant told the jury that he pulled the slide back to reveal “a whole bunch of 9', 'The state’s medical examiner testified that no alcohol was discovered in Imran’s system.', '- 17 - bullets” in the chamber. When he shook the gun to dislodge one of them the gun went off accidentlly, firing a round into the wall. He testified that the next thing he knew, his uncle grabbed the gun out of his hands and shot Imran and Lang in quick succession. When asked how he felt in the aftermath of the shooting, defendant responded that he was “[n]ot completely sober, but I was sober.”', 'The defendant told the jury that his shock dissipated when his uncle demanded that they leave. When Shelton told him, “I love you, but I can’t leave you,” defendant said, he realized that his uncle would shoot him if he did not comply. The defendant testified that, having presumed that both women were dead, the pair fled to a nearby crackhouse. Although he said he could not recall anything about the location, defendant did recall that soon after arriving, a “crackhead,” known only to Shelton, drove them to New York City, where the two men hopped on a bus to Florida. In explaining his six weeks at large, defendant explained that he loved his uncle and did not want to get him in trouble. He also told the jurors that Shelton had convinced him that they were equally culpable of any crimes that had been committed and that he feared that his uncle would kill him if he tried to leave or report Shelton’s whereabouts to the police. The defendant also admitted that even though he was innocent of any crime, he nonetheless chose to give police a false name after he was arrested.', 'i', 'Standard of Review', '“When ruling on a motion for a new trial, the trial justice acts as a thirteenth juror, exercising ‘independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.’” State v.

And, after hearing defendant’s testimony, he asserted that he could “in no way fault” the jury for believing Lang’s testimony about what happened on July 27, 2006. Indeed, the trial justice found that defendant’s own testimony was “wholly unworthy of belief” and served the very purpose of convicting him. In passing on the credibility of defendant’s testimony, the trial justice cited this Court’s decision in State v. Mattatall, 603 A.2d 1098 (R.I. 1992), in which we said', '“when a defendant elects to testify, he runs the very real risk that if disbelieved,', 'the trier of fact may conclude that the opposite of his testimony is the truth. * * *', ""As long as there exists some other evidence of the defendant's guilt, disbelief of"", '[a] defendant’s sworn testimony is sufficient to sustain a finding of guilt. * * * ‘A', 'trier of fact is not compelled to accept and believe the self serving stories of', 'vitally interested defendants.

Cisneros, 448 F.2d 298, 305 (9th Cir. 1970)). Here, the trial justice clearly did not accept defendant’s version of events, ruling that “no rational factfinder would or could accept” defendant’s explanation that the gun’s discharging while it was in defendant’s hands was an accident. The trial justice also found there was ample evidence for the jury to find that defendant and his uncle plotted the murder in advance. The defendant admitted on cross-examination that he had a close relationship with his uncle and that he knew his uncle was facing a return to prison because of the drug incident. In light of the facts that Imran was shot in the head and Lang was shot five times and left to die, the trial justice found this effort to execute two people was motivated by “the oldest motive of all”—leaving no witnesses. In rejecting defendant’s claim that, to the extent he participated in the crime, he did', '- 20 - so at the behest of a domineering uncle, the trial justice cited this Court’s observation that “[i]t runs counter to human experience to suppose that criminal conspirators would welcome innocent nonparticipants as witnesses to their crimes.” State v.

Batista-Polanco, 927 F.2d 14, 18 (1st Cir. 1991)).', 'The trial justice acknowledged the inconsistencies in Lang’s early accounts of the assault, but described her as being “steadfast” in her later accounts and her testimony of what had occurred that night: after missing Imran with his first shot, Offley dispatched her with a second shot. Shelton then took the gun from defendant after it jammed before he turned it on her. Even in the face of inconsistencies among Lang’s statements, the trial justice also found that defendant’s actions after the shooting and during his arrest were strong indications of guilt. The defendant’s flight to Florida, where he hid for six weeks with the uncle he supposedly feared, and the use of a false name when he was finally arrested provided further proof of his guilt. The trial justice described defendant’s testimony as not only “ludicrous,” but “perjurious,” concluding that “the evidence resoundingly compels the verdict as announced by this jury.”', 'In our opinion, the trial justice properly assessed the weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses, and he “articulated adequate reasons for denying the motion.” State v.

However, I cannot agree with my colleagues that “the requirements of Rule 612 [of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence] were not satisfied” and that, therefore, the prior testimony should not have been read into the record. In my opinion, the requirements of Rule 612 are irrelevant in this case because Carlos’s prior testimony was properly admitted as a prior inconsistent statement made by a previously cooperative witness.', 'Therefore, I would affirm the trial justice’s decision allowing this testimony into evidence at trial.', 'Under Rule 801(d)(1)(A) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, “[a] statement is not hearsay if: * * * The declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement, and the statement is (A) inconsistent with the declarant’s testimony[.]” In this trial, at a point in the state’s case when defendant’s diminished-capacity defense very much was in play, 1 Carlos testified that, in the hours leading up to the murder, defendant and Shelton were drinking in Brenda’s apartment. When asked how many drinks defendant consumed that evening, the witness responded, “I really don’t know.” (Emphasis added.) The witness was also asked whether defendant exhibited any signs of intoxication, and Carlos answered, “I wasn’t really focusing on that. I guess so.

This testimony does not reflect a failure of memory as the majority concludes.', 'This occasion—in November 2007—was not the first time the witness testified about what transpired in the apartment shortly before the murder. Approximately seven months earlier, in early May 2007, 2 Carlos testified at Shelton’s trial, before the same trial justice who presided over defendant’s trial. During that appearance, Carlos testified that, although defendant and Shelton were drinking in the early morning hours of July 27, 2006, they were “acting normally”; they were not slurring their words or falling down and were capable of conversing with Carlos while they played video games.', 'At defendant’s trial in November 2007, the prosecutor confronted Carlos with this prior testimony after he testified that he did not know about or was not focusing on these same facts and professed an inability to recall a number of important details about defendant’s consumption of alcohol shortly before the murder. In my opinion, this was proper impeachment evidence and not a Rule 612 exercise intended to refresh the witness’s recollection.', 'In State v. Matthews, 88 A.3d 375 (R.I. 2014), this Court explained the circumstances in which prior testimony might be admissible under Rule 801(d)(1)(A) to impeach a witness who was experiencing a “convenient failure of memory” on the witness stand:', '“Where a witness no longer remembers an event, a prior statement', 'describing that event should not be considered inconsistent. Yet', 'the tendency of unwilling or untruthful witnesses to seek refuge in', 'a claim of forgetfulness is well recognized.

On several occasions, this Court has affirmed a trial justice’s admission of prior statements of a witness in these circumstances.', 'See, e.g., id. (affirming introduction of witness’s police statement under Rule 801(d)(1)(A) where witness “professed a lack of memory regarding almost all of the facts salient to the robbery and his subsequent arrest”); State v. McManus, 990 A.2d 1229, 1234-36, 1236 (R.I. 2010) (affirming introduction of witness’s police statement even though it was improperly admitted by the trial justice as a recorded recollection because the statement could have been admitted as a prior inconsistent statement under Rule 801(d)(1)(A) where witness “purported to suffer from jail-house amnesia, a frequent malaise”); State v. Jaiman, 850 A.2d 984, 986, 986-88, 990 (R.I. 2004) (affirming introduction of witness’s police statement under Rule 801(d)(1)(A) where witness “suffered a convenient failure of memory, declaring over and over again, especially at critical points about details of this drive-by shooting, that he had difficulty remembering”). As this Court explained in Matthews, 88 A.3d at 384, once the prior statement of the witness is admitted, the question of whether the witness’s inability to recall is in fact untrue and an implied denial of the prior statement is ultimately a question for the jury in assessing the witness’s credibility. See also McManus, 990 A.2d at 1236 (explaining that the purpose of Rule 801(d)(1)(A) is “to allow for [prior inconsistent] statements * * * to be introduced as substantive evidence in order for the fact finder to decide which statement [i.e., the prior inconsistent statement or the in-court testimony], if any, is worthy of belief”). Importantly, this testimony is admitted as substantive proof at trial.', '- 24 -', 'I am of the opinion that the circumstances of this case are analogous to—although not as extreme as—those in Matthews, McManus, and Jaiman and served as the basis for the impeachment evidence. I reach this conclusion notwithstanding the prosecutor’s question to Carlos whether reading a transcript of the prior testimony would “refresh [his] memory.” It is apparent from the record that the prior testimony was being used not to refresh Carlos’s recollection, as was done immediately beforehand with the witness’s police statement, but to impeach his inconsistent testimony under Rule 801(d)(1)(A). The record supports this conclusion. Shortly before Carlos’s prior testimony was admitted, it was quite clear that the prosecutor was well versed in the proper procedure for refreshing a witness’s recollection and did so in a textbook-perfect manner. 3 Nonetheless, the witness continued to be vague and 3', 'The following exchange is illustrative:', '“Q Do you recall what time — Well, you mentioned that you were in the living', 'room playing video games with [defendant].

The prior testimony was used to impeach the witness with a prior inconsistent statement. Moreover, this seasoned trial justice, who was a front-and-center observer of Carlos’s testimony in May 2007 and his performance in November 2007, clearly understood that this was impeachment of the witness’s testimony with a prior inconsistent statement. In response to defendant’s objection to the prosecutor’s use of the prior testimony, the trial justice tersely responded, “Overruled. This is prior testimony. Overruled.” In my opinion, it is apparent from the record that the trial justice permitted the prosecutor to impeach Carlos with his prior inconsistent statement and that the prosecutor was no longer attempting to refresh the recollection of this recalcitrant witness. The prosecutor’s repeated demonstration of her ability to refresh Carlos’s recollection in textbook fashion a mere ten transcript pages before the crucial exchange, when coupled with the trial justice’s comment that “[t]his is prior testimony,” makes me unable to join the majority’s analysis of whether “the requirements of Rule 612” were satisfied and the majority’s conclusion that they were not. I am of the opinion that Rule 612 is simply not implicated in this case and this evidence was properly admitted under Rule 801(d)(1)(A).', 'I pause to note, however, that the trial justice’s refusal to grant defense counsel’s request to be heard on the objection or at a sidebar conference is unfortunate. Defense counsel’s request should have been granted. The efficacy of appellate review is strengthened by a developed record, and, in this case, had the parties and the trial justice discussed the use of the prior testimony on the record, this Court’s resolution of the issue would have been more straightforward. Nonetheless, I remain convinced from my review of the record that the trial justice appropriately allowed the prosecutor to impeach the suspiciously-forgetful Carlos with', '- 27 - his prior testimony and to admit that testimony under Rule 801(d)(1)(A). I cannot agree that this evidence was erroneously admitted, notwithstanding the majority’s conclusion that the error was harmless. In my opinion, a harmless-error analysis of this testimony is unnecessary in the context of this case.

On October 6, 2011, a Washington County Superior Court jury found the defendant, Kimberly Fry (defendant or Kimberly), guilty of second degree murder of her eight-year-old daughter in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-23-1. On May 22, 2012, the trial justice sentenced the defendant to a term of forty years’ imprisonment, with twenty years to serve and the remaining twenty years suspended, with probation.', 'On appeal, the defendant contends that the trial justice erred in: (1) declining to instruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter due to diminished capacity and inadequately instructing the jury on accident; (2) permitting the state to elicit testimony from a witness through improper impeachment and leading questions; (3) failing to declare a mistrial following the state’s violation of the court’s sequestration order; and (4) allowing admission of a video depicting the scene of the murder, including the victim’s body. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On October 8, 2010, Kimberly was charged by indictment with the murder of her daughter, Camden. The case was tried before a jury over the course of three weeks in September and October 2011. Throughout the course of this trial, the following facts were revealed through the testimony of the various witnesses.', 'Camden Alexis Fry was born on May 6, 2001 to Kimberly and Timothy (Tim) Fry 1 in New Hampshire, where the family lived at the time. While Tim went to work during the day, Kimberly stayed home and took care of Camden. During Camden’s early-childhood years, Tim and Kimberly began to notice that she had difficulty with transitioning from one activity to another, often protesting when she was forced to end an activity.', 'In August 2007, the Fry family moved to North Kingstown and Camden started first grade at Fishing Cove Elementary School.', 'After the move, Camden began to struggle academically and continued to have difficulty with transitioning between activities. For instance, Camden would cry and scream when taken to the store if she did not get what she wanted, forcing Kimberly to drag her out of the store. On one occasion, when Tim was away on business, Kimberly reported to him that Camden had a “really bad crying episode” and that Camden had “been punching her and hitting her and that [Kimberly] had to sit on her.”', 'In the belief that Camden might have attention deficit disorder (ADD) or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the Frys sought to have her evaluated through the school but, according to Tim, the school did not want to spend the funds to get her tested. Eventually, while Camden was in second grade, the Frys took matters into their own hands. Kimberly began 1', 'We use the first names of Kimberly Fry, Tim Fry, and Camden Fry to avoid confusion.', '-2- researching private schools that might provide a better academic environment for Camden, and, in April 2009, the family began seeing a family therapist, Wendy Phillips (Phillips), to aid them in developing strategies to help Camden cope with the symptoms that she was exhibiting. In addition, the Frys scheduled a neuropsychological evaluation for Camden with Christine Trask, Ph.D. (Dr. Trask). As a result of this evaluation, Dr. Trask issued a report diagnosing Camden with ADHD and mild anxiety.', 'On July 1, 2009, based upon the diagnosis from Dr. Trask, Camden was prescribed medication used to treat ADHD. Tim and Kimberly noticed that the medication helped keep Camden calm and helped with her ability to transition.', 'Nevertheless, Tim and Kimberly observed that she sometimes became more irritable in the evening as the medication wore off.', 'Throughout this period of time, Kimberly was also suffering from various mental health issues, including depression, insomnia, anxiety, and panic attacks. During a counseling session on May 4, 2009, Kimberly explained to Phillips that she felt as though Camden’s crying and screaming episodes lasted longer for her than for Tim. Kimberly further reported to Phillips that Camden’s tantrums caused her stress and, after about twenty minutes, she would put her hands over her ears to block out the sound of Camden’s crying and screaming.', 'Phillips testified at trial that the last two therapy sessions before Camden’s death, on July 28 and August 4, 2009, were particularly difficult for Kimberly. Throughout these two sessions, Phillips observed that Kimberly seemed overwhelmed by the process of buying a new car, necessitated by her involvement in a car accident several days prior to the July 28 session. In addition, Phillips reported that Kimberly was upset and angry with Tim; in fact, at the July 28 session, Phillips asked Camden to leave the room because Tim and Kimberly were arguing. Phillips’s notes from that session indicated that, during their arguments, “Kim[berly] began to', '-3- triangle Camden with her father” by asking Camden to take sides between her and Tim “[i]n an inappropriate manner.” Phillips further reported that, after Camden had left the room, Kimberly told her that “she blamed Camden for her depression” and that “she was an incompetent mother and she felt hopeless.” By the end of the session, Phillips instructed Tim that “if he was concerned about [Kimberly’s] behavior, that if she appeared to not be safe or he was concerned about her, to take her to the emergency room immediately.” Phillips also recommended that Kimberly make an appointment with an individual therapist. At the session on August 4, Kimberly “seemed better than the prior session.” Nevertheless, Phillips again recommended that she make an appointment with an individual therapist.', 'Tim testified that, on August 10, 2009, Kimberly told him that she “wished that Camden wasn’t around because it was so much easier when it was just the two of us.” Tim replied that he didn’t think that this was an appropriate thing for her to say. After this discussion ended, Tim and Kimberly spent the day signing the paperwork for Kimberly’s new car and returned home at around 3:30 that afternoon. Camden, who had spent the day at the beach with friends, returned home sometime between 4 and 4:30. At approximately 5:50 that evening, Tim left the house to play hockey. When he left, Kimberly and Camden were sitting next to each other in the living room watching television.', 'Tim received a phone call from Kimberly just after 9:00 that night. He asked her how the night was going, to which she responded that “after a two-hour crying fit Camden had finally settled down and gone to bed.” Tim testified during trial that Kimberly “sounded a little groggy” during this conversation, but that she was nevertheless clear in speaking to him. He further testified that it was not out of the ordinary for Kimberly to be groggy, as “[s]he normally had taken [C]lonazepam or Benadryl at night * * * so she could get to sleep.”', '-4-', 'Tim arrived home at approximately 9:40 that night and, upon entering the living room, noticed that Kimberly was “kind of falling asleep, leaning over against the side of the couch.” He testified that she seemed “more groggy than she was on the phone” and suggested that she should go to bed. He then removed his hockey equipment from his car and again told Kimberly that she should go to bed. Tim went to shower, passing Camden’s bedroom on the way. When he passed Camden’s bedroom, he looked in and noticed that she was in bed under the covers. After showering, Tim realized that Kimberly was still sitting on the couch, so he helped her up and walked her into the bedroom. Tim testified that he didn’t recall Kimberly ever previously needing assistance to get into bed.', 'The following morning, Tim had planned to work from home; but, by 9:30 he realized that it was unusual that Camden was still sleeping. He went into her bedroom to check on her and realized that she was in the same position that she had been in the night before. When he walked over to the side of the bed, he noticed that her eyes were opened and her pupils were completely dilated. He started screaming, pulled the covers back, and removed a stuffed animal that she had under her arm. Tim turned her onto her back and, at that point, determined that she was not alive because she was “ice cold and stiff.” He called 911 and screamed for Kimberly to come into the room, who—still groggy—crawled into the room on her hands and knees.', 'When police and rescue personnel arrived, they found Tim and Kimberly in Camden’s bedroom crying and hysterical. Once Camden had been pronounced dead, the police asked Tim and Kimberly to leave the room to allow them to secure the scene. Officer John MacCoy (Officer MacCoy), a responding officer, asked Kimberly about the prior evening with Camden, to which she replied that Camden had been giving her a hard time in taking a bath. She recounted to Officer MacCoy that Camden fell on the bathroom floor and that she ultimately had', '-5- to pull Camden into the bedroom. She further reported to the police that she then watched television and read books with Camden until about 9:10 when she put her to bed.', 'Officer MacCoy testified that, after being present while a pastor read Camden her last rites, the Frys went to the back porch, and Kimberly’s condition began to deteriorate. Tim testified that Kimberly looked up at him, and it occurred to him that she must have taken some kind of medication. He then told Officer MacCoy to call an ambulance and went to the kitchen to discover that several bottles of prescription medication were empty.', 'Kimberly was transported to South County Hospital by rescue, and she was placed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Tim testified that he visited Kimberly the following day in the hospital, and she told him that “she had a battle with Camden, [and] that Camden had been kicking and punching her and biting her.” She further relayed that, at one point during the “battle,” she went to take Clonazepam to calm down and, when she returned, they started fighting again. Tim testified that Kimberly told him that “Camden was punching and kicking and biting her and that she sat on top of her” and that Kimberly had “put her hand over Camden’s nose and mouth to make her stop screaming.” He testified that Kimberly then said, “I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry.”', 'Kimberly also made several statements to medical personnel. Courtney Briar Pichardo, Kimberly’s nurse in the ICU, testified that on the night that Kimberly was admitted she was not oriented as to whether it was daytime or nighttime, but she was able to identify who the president was and she knew that she was in the hospital. Pichardo further testified that Kimberly stated, “I’m her mother. I was supposed to protect her but I couldn’t protect her from me.” Barbara Kettle, a patient care technician who was also in the room with Kimberly on the night that she', '-6- was admitted, testified that Kimberly stated that she had taken Benadryl, muscle relaxers, and some other medication, because “[s]he wanted the crying and screaming to stop.”', 'During the trial, on October 4, 2011, the defense submitted proposed jury instructions, including a request for an instruction on accident and on voluntary manslaughter due to diminished capacity. That same day, the trial justice held a charging conference in chambers, during which he indicated that he was going to deny defendant’s request for a diminished capacity instruction. The conference was not recorded, and there is nothing to indicate whether defendant objected to the denial of the diminished capacity instruction or merely argued for such an instruction prior to the trial justice’s decision. The trial justice charged the jury on October 5, 2011, omitting an instruction for voluntary manslaughter due to diminished capacity. Following the charge, defense counsel objected at sidebar to the fact that the instruction “just briefly” discussed accident, 2 but failed to object to the lack of an instruction on voluntary manslaughter due to diminished capacity.', 'On October 6, 2011, during their deliberations, the jury submitted a question to the trial court: “Does there have to be mental competency for there to be intent?” After meeting with the prosecutor and defense counsel to develop an answer to this inquiry, the trial court sent the jury the following answer:', '“A defendant’s competency to stand trial is a legal determination made before', 'trial and is not an issue before you.', '“Do not confuse ‘mental competency’ with the defendant’s state of mind or', 'intent.', '“Please refer to the jury instruction on DEFENDANT’S INTENT.” 2', 'Defense counsel also objected to the judge’s instruction regarding expert testimony. However, this objection is not pertinent to the issues on appeal.', '-7- After this answer was submitted to the jury, the parties met in chambers to discuss these supplemental instructions and note any potential objections on the record. At that point, defense counsel conceded that he had failed to object to the lack of a diminished capacity instruction at the time the jury was charged, but he nevertheless requested that one be given at that time. However, the conference was interrupted because the jury had reached a verdict.', 'The jury found Kimberly guilty of second degree murder of Camden. The defendant moved for a new trial, which the trial justice denied. The defendant timely appealed.', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'The defendant raises four issues on appeal. First, she submits that the trial justice erred in declining to present the jury with an instruction on voluntary manslaughter due to diminished capacity 3 and that the trial justice’s instruction on accident was inadequate. Second, she claims that the trial justice improperly allowed the state to employ leading questions on direct examination and improperly allowed the state to impeach a witness by use of prior inconsistent statements. Third, she asserts that the trial justice erred by declining to pass the case when the prosecutor conferred with his witness during breaks in testimony, which she contends was in violation of a sequestration order. Finally, she claims that the trial justice erred by admitting into evidence a seven-minute video of the crime scene, which included three and one-half minutes showing Camden’s body in her bed. 3', 'We note that the trial justice did instruct the jury on involuntary manslaughter, stating, in pertinent part: “[M]anslaughter is the unlawful but unintentional killing of a human being without malice or premeditation. A person who recklessly does an act that results in the death of another human being is guilty of manslaughter, even though she did not intend or did not contemplate such a result.”', '-8-', 'III', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Jury Instructions', '“Our standard of review concerning jury instructions is well settled; we review such instructions in a de novo manner.”', 'State v.

This standard of review is applicable whether our review is focused on the content of jury instructions or on a trial justice’s refusal to instruct the jury on a lesser-included offense. See State v. Ricci, 54 A.3d 965, 971 (R.I. 2012); State v. Motyka, 893 A.2d 267, 281 (R.I. 2006).', 'When determining whether a trial justice’s refusal to give an instruction was warranted, “this Court will examine the record in the case and determine whether the evidence justifies such an instruction.” Motyka, 893 A.2d at 281. In making this determination, our review is limited to “ascertaining whether ‘an actual and adequate dispute exists as to the distinguishing element between the lesser and greater offenses in question.’” Id. (quoting State v. Garcia, 883 A.2d 1131, 1137 (R.I. 2005)). On the one hand, the trial court should instruct the jury on a lesser- included offense when “some minimal evidence exists that, if credited by the jury, could support a conviction for the lesser-included offense.” Id. at 284 (quoting State v. McGuy, 841 A.2d 1109, 1112 (R.I. 2003)). On the other hand, however, this Court has repeatedly recognized that “a trial justice is not required to instruct the jury on a lesser-included offense when the evidence presented at trial completely fails to support such a charge[.]” Id. at 285 (citing McGuy, 841 A.2d at 1112).', '-9-', 'The focus of our review is different, however, when reviewing the content of jury instructions. In such circumstances, “it is our role to examine the instructions in their entirety to ascertain the manner in which a jury of ordinary intelligent lay people would have understood them, * * * and we review challenged portions of jury instructions in the context in which they were rendered.” Adefusika, 989 A.2d at 475 (quoting State v. John, 881 A.2d 920, 929 (R.I. 2005)). In so doing, we remain mindful that the trial justice need not use particular words in the instruction, and we look only to whether the trial justice correctly stated the applicable law. Ricci, 54 A.3d at 971. Particularly pertinent to the case at hand, “[t]his Court has consistently held that when the ‘requested charge is fairly covered in the general charge,’ the ‘trial justice’s refusal to grant a request for jury instruction is not reversible error.’” Id. (quoting State v. Price, 706 A.2d 929, 934 (R.I. 1998)). “[E]ven if we conclude that a jury instruction was erroneous, reversal is warranted ‘only if a jury could have been misled to the prejudice of the complaining party.’” Adefusika, 989 A.2d at 475 (quoting State v. Graham, 941 A.2d 848, 855 (R.I. 2008)).', '1. Diminished Capacity', 'The defendant contends that the evidence on the record could sustain a verdict for voluntary manslaughter due to diminished capacity and, therefore, it was error for the trial justice to refuse to give such an instruction. The state responds that defendant waived any argument as to this instruction because defense counsel failed to object before the jury retired to deliberate. The state further contends that, in any event, there was no credible evidence as to defendant’s diminished capacity at the time of the murder and, thus, such an instruction was not warranted. Given that the state’s waiver argument, if correct, would end our inquiry, we address this argument first.', '- 10 -', 'In accordance with our well-settled “raise-or-waive” rule, claims of error that were not effectively raised and articulated at trial are deemed to be waived and not preserved for appellate review, subject only to exception in some circumstances where “basic constitutional rights are concerned.” State v.

Similarly, Rule 30 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure serves to bar a party from contesting jury instructions when that party fails to timely object. Specifically, Rule 30 provides, in pertinent part:', '“No party may assign as error any portion of the charge or omission therefrom', 'unless the party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict,', 'stating distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds of the', ""party's objection. Objections shall be made out of the presence of the jury.” Notably, Rule 30 requires only that objections be made before the jury retires to deliberate, but “does not explicitly mandate that objections to instructions be made after the instructions are given.” State v. Palmer, 962 A.2d 758, 766 n.5 (R.I. 2009). Nonetheless, such an objection must be made on the record and in a manner that permits this Court to conduct appropriate appellate review."", 'In the case at hand, defendant asserts that defense counsel objected to the omission of a diminished capacity instruction in an off-the-record chambers conference held before the jury was charged. The defendant points to excerpts from the record in which the parties and the trial justice refer to a request for a diminished capacity instruction made at the off-the-record conference as evidencing defendant’s objection. However, our reading of the record reveals that, at best, it is ambiguous as to whether defendant objected to the trial justice’s refusal to include a diminished capacity instruction or merely reiterated her request for such an instruction in the off-', '- 11 - the-record conference. Given that an objection must be made on the record and articulated in such a manner that permits this Court to conduct appellate review, we conclude that the defendant’s reference to a diminished capacity instruction in the off-the-record conference was insufficient to properly preserve the issue for our review. See State v. Anderson, 752 A.2d 946, 951 (R.I. 2000).', 'In a last-ditch effort to redeem her diminished capacity argument, defendant asseverates that her opportunity to object under Rule 30 was renewed when the jury, during its deliberations, asked the question, “Does there have to be mental competency for there to be intent?” In support, defendant contends that this Court’s decisions in State v. Oliveira, 730 A.2d 20 (R.I. 1999) and State v. Gomes, 590 A.2d 391 (R.I. 1991) permit a defendant to have a second bite at the apple in objecting to jury instructions if the jury requests clarification of the instructions during its deliberations and the trial justice delivers faulty supplemental instructions in response.', 'The defendant’s interpretation of our case law is flawed. Never in Oliveira, 730 A.2d at 25, nor in Gomes, 590 A.2d at 394, did we hold that juror confusion would somehow render Rule 30 nugatory.', 'In those cases, we were faced with a challenge to the supplemental instructions provided by the trial justice after the jury had asked a question. 4 While we did hold that a trial justice, after the jury indicates that it does not understand an element of the offense charged, is “obligated to clarify the matter for the jury in a concrete and unambiguous manner,” we did not go so far as to suggest that juror confusion presented the parties with an opportunity to suggest the addition of another instruction entirely. See Gomes, 590 A.2d at 394. In the case 4', 'In State v. Gomes, 590 A.2d 391, 394 (R.I. 1991), we considered a defendant’s objection to the lack of responsiveness to the jury’s question and the confusing nature of the supplemental charge. Similarly, in State v. Oliveira, 730 A.2d 20, 25 (R.I. 1999), we were faced with an objection to a trial justice’s supplemental instructions in which the trial justice erroneously instructed the jury with regard to a crime of which the defendant had not been charged.', '- 12 - at hand, we are not faced with a situation where the trial justice provided the jury with an erroneous answer to the question presented or a faulty supplemental instruction. Indeed, the answer provided to the jury both directly addressed the question presented and accurately explained the law. Moreover, in Oliveira and Gomes we were faced with a direct challenge to a supplemental instruction provided by the trial justice. As such, we considered only the faultiness of the supplemental instruction; we did not suggest that a juror question would allow a party another opportunity to object to the original instructions. Thus, our decisions in Oliveira and Gomes are inapposite to the case at hand.', 'We pause to note that defendant’s suggestion that a juror question presents another opportunity to add a certain instruction to the trial justice’s original charge is impractical. Not only would it be entirely unfair to the opposing party, but it would be exceedingly suggestive to the jury by placing this new instruction in a special light. We decline to interpret our case law to reach such an unpalatable result.', 'Given our conclusion that defense counsel failed to preserve the issue for our review, we need not determine whether there was sufficient evidence presented at trial to warrant an instruction on voluntary manslaughter due to diminished capacity.', '2. Accident', 'We proceed next to defendant’s contention that the trial justice erred by delivering an inadequate instruction on accident in light of the evidence introduced at trial. At trial, defendant presented expert testimony from Dr. Elizabeth Laposata (Dr. Laposata) regarding the cause of Camden’s death. Doctor Laposata testified that Camden’s injuries were consistent with an attempted restraint procedure and explained that “sometimes * * * the person who is trying to restrain the other person will keep the restraint maneuvers on after the person is calm just', '- 13 - because they are not sure that they have actually gotten that person under restraint.” Doctor Laposata also testified that, once Camden had passed out, chest compressions alone could have been sufficient to deprive her of oxygen. On the basis of this testimony, defendant requested the following instruction:', '“If you find that the [s]tate has not proven to you beyond a reasonable', 'doubt that Kimberly Fry acted with ‘malice,’ or with the momentary intent to kill,', 'or with criminal negligence, but that the death of Camden Fry instead was', 'accidental, then such a killing is neither murder nor manslaughter.” The trial justice charged the jury and did not include the specific instruction requested by defendant.', 'Instead, the trial justice provided an alternative instruction on accident in two separate contexts.', 'The trial justice first instructed the jury on accident in his discussion of the willful and malicious nature of second degree murder. Specifically, he stated:', '“Second-degree murder * * * is a murder that is willful and malicious.', 'And in order to convict the defendant of second-degree murder under this theory,', 'the [s]tate must prove beyond a reasonable doubt, one, that the defendant acted', 'willfully, intended to kill, and in fact, did cause the death of Camden Fry, and,', 'two, the defendant acted with malice.', '“An act is done willfully if it is done intentionally and voluntarily and not', 'by mistake or accident or some other reason.” (Emphases added.) The trial justice again discussed accident later in his instructions, this time referring to it as it may negate defendant’s intent:', '“Intent ordinarily may not be proved directly because there is no way of', 'fathoming or scrutinizing the operations of the human mind. You may, however,', 'infer a defendant’s intent from all the surrounding circumstances. You may', 'consider any statement or act done by the defendant, and all other facts and', 'circumstances that are in evidence which may indicate the state of her mind.', '“An act is done intentionally and deliberately and purposefully and not', 'because of mistake or accident or any other innocent reason.” (Emphasis added.) In responding to defendant’s objection that the instructions “just briefly” discussed accident, the trial justice noted that “there are at least two places” where the jury was told that a finding of', '- 14 - mistake or accident precluded them from concluding that an essential element of second degree murder was established and, therefore, he denied defendant’s request. 5', 'Despite the two instructions on accident, defendant asserts that the evidence warranted a more specific one. She contends that, without a more specific instruction like the one she requested, “[i]t is very likely that most jurors failed to even notice that accident was mentioned at all, much less comprehend the necessity and critical implications of their findings on accident.” However, in our opinion, the trial justice’s instructions adequately convey that the jury could not find defendant guilty of second degree murder if Camden’s death occurred by accident. Specifically, the instructions indicate that second degree murder must be committed willfully and that, if the death were accidental, then it could not be willful. The instructions further describe that, if defendant’s actions were accidental, then they cannot be considered intentional acts of defendant for purposes of the jury’s determination of second degree murder. It is well settled in this jurisdiction that “[t]he trial justice need not use particular words in the instruction, but must ‘correctly state[] the applicable law.’” State v. Cipriano, 21 A.3d 408, 423 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Imbruglia, 913 A.2d 1022, 1030 (R.I. 2007)). We are satisfied that the instructions provided to the jury in this case meet this criterion.', 'In addition, contrary to defendant’s suggestion, there was minimal evidence presented at trial from which the jury could conclude that Camden’s death was accidental. Instead, any hope of the jury finding accident would have to be predicated on defendant’s statements to others that she was attempting to get Camden to stop crying by putting her hands on Camden’s mouth and sitting on her, or derived from Dr. Laposata’s testimony that Camden’s injuries were consistent with an attempted restraint procedure. Given the dearth of evidence upon which a jury could 5', 'The trial justice also doubted that there was sufficient evidence to support an accident instruction.', ""- 15 - conclude that the killing occurred by accident and in light of the instructions given by the trial justice—which twice mentioned accident as a bar to a finding of culpability—we cannot conclude that a more elaborate instruction was necessary. Accordingly, we are satisfied based on an examination of the record that the trial justice instructed the jury adequately concerning defendant's claim of accidental homicide. 6"", 'B', 'Complaints Directed at the State’s Examination of Phillips', '1. Improper Impeachment', 'Next, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in allowing the prosecutor to ask Phillips to read from her therapy notes during her direct examination. Specifically, defendant points to nine instances in which she asserts that the prosecutor was improperly allowed to “dictate” the testimony of Phillips, which she claims served to improperly impeach Phillips’s credibility. The defendant asserts that Phillips’s credibility was instrumental to her defense because she had observed defendant’s behavior and mental health close in time to Camden’s death. In our opinion, however, defendant failed to preserve this issue for appellate review.', '“This Court staunchly adheres to the ‘raise or waive’ rule, which requires parties to raise an issue first in the trial court before raising it on appeal.” Figuereo, 31 A.3d at 1289. This rule 6', 'The dissent juxtaposes the accident instruction given by the trial justice in this case with the one given by the trial justice in State v. Drew, 919 A.2d 397 (R.I. 2007), suggesting that this Court referred to the trial justice’s mention of accident in Drew as an “anemic reference.” On that basis, the dissent claims that the “almost identical instruction” in this case could not have adequately apprised the jury of the defendant’s accident defense. However, in Drew, the premise of our opinion was that the scant evidence of accident proffered at trial did not warrant a more comprehensive accident instruction. Id. at 404. In the case at hand, not only was there minimal evidence to support an accident defense, but the trial justice also gave a more detailed instruction than the one given in Drew—here, twice mentioning accident. As in Drew, “any further mention of accident in the charge probably would have served only to confuse or mislead the jury.” See id. at 405.', ""- 16 - serves as an “important guarantor of fairness and efficiency in the judicial process” by requiring issues to be presented to a trial justice “in such a posture as to alert the trial justice to the question being raised.” State v.

For this reason, “[a] party who fails to record his specific objections is deemed to have waived his rights on appeal.” State v. Estrada, 537 A.2d 983, 987 (R.I. 1988) (emphasis added). “[W]e have repeatedly cautioned that ‘a general objection is not sufficient to preserve an issue for appellate review; rather, assignments of error must be set forth with sufficient particularity to call the trial justice's attention to the basis of the objection.’” Moten, 64 A.3d at 1238 (quoting Union Station Associates v. Rossi, 862 A.2d 185, 192 (R.I. 2004))."", 'As an initial matter, defendant failed to object at all to seven out of the nine instances to which she now assigns error. Without any objection on the record, the trial justice did not have an opportunity to consider the issue and, therefore, any argument regarding these seven instances is deemed waived. See Figuereo, 31 A.3d at 1289. As to the other two instances, the only adequate basis that defendant articulated below suggests that her objection was to improperly refreshing the witness’s recollection or on the basis of the rule of completeness. Specifically, defendant’s first objection—posed when the prosecutor asked Phillips to read from her notes— stated: “I already offered this into evidence. I understand the [s]tate is not submitting it into evidence, therefore, I think it is inappropriate that the witness read from the transcript. I think she should be allowed to simply testify to her memory.”', 'This objection can, at best, be interpreted as taking issue with the state improperly refreshing the witness’s recollection by asking her to read from her notes. Her second objection—set forth when the prosecutor directed Phillips to review her notes—stated: “Judge, again, I’m simply going to have to object. I have', '- 17 - no objection to this going in full.” This statement appears to suggest the rule of completeness as grounds for her objection.', 'Importantly, neither of these objections can be construed as suggesting that the state was improperly impeaching the witness based on a prior inconsistent statement, which defendant now argues on appeal.', ""Accordingly, because defendant’s “assignment[] of error [was not] set forth with sufficient particularity to call the trial justice's attention to the basis of the objection” that defendant now argues on appeal, the issue is deemed waived and not preserved for our review. See Moten, 64 A.3d at 1238 (quoting Union Station Associates, 862 A.2d at 192)."", '2. Leading Questions', 'The defendant next takes issue with the prosecutor’s use of leading questions during the direct examination of Phillips. Specifically, defendant lists forty-five questions posed by the prosecutor that she labels as leading and argues that such use was excessive, unnecessary, and prejudicial. However, defendant failed to object to forty-four out of the forty-five instances which she now attacks on appeal. In fact, she later characterized her refusal to object as a strategic decision, stating that defendant “didn’t object to [the state’s] leading questions all the time because, frankly, we would have been on our feet 90 percent of the time objecting, and we don’t want to give that impression to the jury.”', 'Nevertheless, whether strategic or not, defendant’s failure to object places her plaint toward the forty-four questions squarely within our “raise-or-waive” rule and, thus, her contention with regard to these forty-four questions is not preserved for our review. Thus, for purposes of this appeal, we consider only the sole question to which defendant objected. 7 7', 'Notably, the thrust of defendant’s argument on appeal appears to attack the cumulative effect of the leading questions posed by the state, contending that the overwhelming quantity of leading questions rendered them prejudicial. However, given that she failed to object to these leading', '- 18 -', ""“A leading question is most generally defined as a question that suggests the desired answer.” State v.

Gomes, 764 A.2d 125, 137 (R.I. 2001)). “The danger of a leading question is that it may suggest to the witness the specific tenor of the reply desired by counsel and such a reply may be given irrespective of actual memory.” Id. (quoting State v. Girouard, 561 A.2d 882, 888 (R.I. 1989)). “Although leading questions generally are prohibited on direct examination, they may be allowed for a limited purpose such as to guide the testimony of a hostile or a purportedly forgetful witness.” State v. McManus, 990 A.2d 1229, 1236 (R.I. 2010). “A party is entitled to treat a forgetful witness as adverse; and, in an effort to elicit truthful testimony from the witness, the examiner may resort to leading questions.” Id. Further, “[w]hile it is true that as a general rule leading questions are prohibited on direct examination, a trial justice has considerable latitude in sustaining or overruling objections to leading questions.” Whitaker, 79 A.3d at 813 (quoting Gomes, 764 A.2d at 137). Thus, “a trial justice's decision regarding the use of leading questions ‘will be overturned only upon an abuse of discretion or where there is substantial injury to the defendant.’” Id.

Do you ever reference Tim and a difficulty with Tim; yes or no?” The defendant objected on the grounds that this was a leading question, to which the state responded that “[the state] move[s] hostile witness, * * * inability to cross-examine.” The trial justice overruled defendant’s objection, stating, “I’m going to give [the state] some leeway just to phrase some yes-or-no questions. I’m not even sure they are leading if there is a choice between yes or no.” While the trial justice did not explicitly state that he found the witness to be hostile, he was not required to do so in giving the state some flexibility in examining the witness. Our review of the record suggests that there were some instances in which Phillips was corrected by the prosecutor after testifying to details that varied from her therapy notes and other instances in which Phillips testified to a lack of memory. Given these difficulties, we cannot conclude that the trial justice abused his discretion in allowing the state some flexibility to pose questions in yes-or-no form.', 'C', 'Violation of the Sequestration Order', 'The defendant also claims that the trial justice erred in refusing to pass the case after the prosecutor discussed testimony with the state’s witness, Dr. William Cox (Dr. Cox), a medical examiner, during breaks in Dr. Cox’s testimony. The defendant claims that this discussion violated the trial justice’s sequestration order and that the measures taken by the trial justice to temper the potential prejudice to defendant were insufficient.', 'Following opening statements, the trial justice granted the parties’ joint request for a general sequestration order prohibiting any trial witness from listening to the testimony of any other witness.

All witnesses for this trial are sequestered.” The following day, during his continued direct examination, Dr. Cox testified that he had not reviewed photographs taken by law enforcement at the murder scene and that he did not know whether such photographs were ever sent to the medical examiner’s office. However, during a lunch break shortly thereafter, the prosecutor conferred with Dr. Cox about his prior testimony and, as a result of this discussion, Dr. Cox realized that he had made a mistake in his testimony. After looking through his file, Dr. Cox concluded that he had in fact received the photographs the prosecutor asked about.', 'The prosecutor also discussed potential cross-examination with Dr. Cox. Specifically, the prosecutor discussed Dr. Cox’s failure to dissect the hyoid bone, which defendant claims is pertinent to the potential of chest compression as a cause of death. The defendant contends that the cause of death was relevant to her accident defense and was a major point of contention between Dr. Cox and her expert witness, Dr. Laposata.', 'When Dr. Cox returned to the stand after the lunch break, the prosecutor again asked Dr. Cox whether he had seen photographs from law enforcement taken at the scene. This time, Dr. Cox testified that he had “misspoke” and that he had been shown a compact disc (CD) of photographs from the North Kingstown Police Department.', 'On September 28, 2011, outside the presence of the jury, defense counsel informed the trial justice that she saw the prosecutor talking with Dr. Cox and Det. Jeffrey St. Onge of the North Kingstown Police Department, and did not think anything of the discussion until Dr. Cox corrected his prior testimony. Defense counsel then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that the', '- 21 - prosecutor improperly conferred with Dr. Cox during the break in testimony. In the alternative, she also moved to strike the problematic testimony from the record.', 'The prosecutor admitted that he spoke to Dr. Cox during breaks in the testimony regarding the photographs and chest compression as a potential cause of death, including mention of the hyoid bone. The trial justice stated that he told each witness “not [to] discuss your testimony with anyone,” and specifically “recall[ed] telling Doctor Cox, do not discuss your testimony[.]” However, the trial justice determined that the “precise parameters” of his order were an issue because he did not specifically tell Dr. Cox “not [to] consult with anybody, including the [s]tate’s attorney.” On that basis, he determined that the prosecutor had not “done anything improperly in this case” and denied defendant’s motion for a mistrial. Nevertheless, the trial justice fashioned a remedy allowing defendant to “inquire of [Dr. Cox] and suggest that he may have violated the [c]ourt’s order,” and said that defendant was “also free to fashion an appropriate question that suggests perhaps a recall of certain testimony was, in fact, prompted by that consultation during the middle of [Dr. Cox’s] testimony.”', 'During cross-examination of Dr. Cox, defense counsel took advantage of the opportunity offered by the trial justice and inquired into whether he had been ordered not to discuss his testimony.', 'However, the trial justice did not permit defense counsel to ask whether his discussion with the prosecutor was in violation of the trial court’s order. 8 The trial justice reasoned that he did not want the question to insinuate that there had been a violation of the sequestration order when he did not determine that there had been one in the first instance, stating that he would “[l]et the jurors determine that.” Following this ruling, defense counsel questioned Dr. Cox in regard to whether he had spoken with the prosecutor about his testimony. 8', 'Importantly, this was the only limitation imposed on defense counsel in his cross-examination of Dr. Cox based on the allegedly improper discussion.', '- 22 - In particular, defense counsel made apparent to the jury that Dr. Cox originally testified that he did not review any crime scene photographs, but that after his discussion with the prosecutor he testified that he did remember reviewing the photographs.', ""“The decision to pass a case and declare a mistrial belongs to the trial justice, and this Court gives great weight to his or her sound discretion.” State v.

The trial justice’s instructions to Dr. Cox prior to recessing for the day on September 26 indicated that the witness was not to discuss the case “with anybody,” 9 but did not preclude the witness from discussing his testimony with the prosecutor. 10 We note that, in cases where a witness’s testimony is protracted over the course of multiple days, it is commonplace for the party calling that witness to discuss the 9', 'The only instruction that Dr. Cox received prior to the allegedly improper discussion with the prosecutor occurred on September 26.

See United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1177 (1st Cir. 1993).

See State v. Staffier, 21 A.3d 287, 293 (R.I. 2011) (concluding that any potential harm to the defendant was addressed by the trial justice allowing the defendant to elicit testimony from a witness regarding the witness’s questionable violation of the court’s sequestration order). Where a defendant’s contention is grounded in her fair-trial rights, such as is the case here, “we shall reverse only for an abuse of discretion that results in actual prejudice to him.” State v. Gomes, 690 A.2d 310, 318 (R.I. 1997). In the case at hand, the record makes clear that there was no actual prejudice to defendant. The discussion between the prosecutor and Dr. Cox involved only two topics:', '(i) Dr. Cox’s review of photographs of the crime scene taken by the North Kingstown Police Department; and (ii) the hyoid bone as it related to chest compression as a potential cause of death, which the prosecutor regarded as a probable topic to come up on cross- examination.', 'First, with regard to the prosecutor consulting with Dr. Cox about the crime scene photographs, the only effect that such consultation with the prosecutor could have had was to allow Dr. Cox to correct his prior testimony without impeaching him in the presence of the jury. Thus, the only potential prejudice flowing from the discussion would be the withholding of some information from the jury that would be pertinent to evaluating the witness’s credibility.

See id.', 'Second, the trial justice’s remedial measure would also have allowed defense counsel to negate any prejudice with regard to the prosecutor’s discussion of the potential cross- examination on cause of death. Defense counsel was not prohibited from asking questions about the content of the prosecutor’s discussion with the witness, including whether the prosecutor had prepared the witness for cross-examination. While such questioning would have served to temper any prejudice, defense counsel failed to ask any questions in that regard. Defense counsel’s failure to take full advantage of the remedial measure offered by the trial justice cannot somehow be transformed into reversible error.', 'When the potential violation of a sequestration order is at issue, the court’s response should focus on what needs to be done to prevent any prejudice to the defendant. See Gomes, 690 A.2d at 318; see also United States v. Magana, 127 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1997).

Accordingly, we hold that the trial justice did not err in refusing to implement defendant’s additional suggested remedial measures.', 'D', 'Admission of the “Seven Minute-Plus” Video', 'The defendant’s final assignment of error is that the trial justice erred in admitting a “seven minute-plus” video showing the police walking through the Fry home and depicting Camden’s body. The defendant argues that the video’s focus on Camden’s body in her bed unfairly prejudiced the jury and inflamed their passions against her. The defendant further', '- 25 - asserts that the video was minimally probative because the layout of the Fry home was not contested by the defense and because the scenes depicted in the video were cumulative of other photographic and video exhibits offered by the state.', 'Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence provides that relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. “The admission or exclusion of evidence ‘under Rule 403 is within the sound discretion of the trial justice.’” State v.

In addition, the trial justice stated that the videotape showed a different perspective from other photographs, thus providing additional probative value.', ""While we do not ignore the fact that a three-and-a-half-minute focus on a deceased eight- year-old girl in her bed is a disturbing sight, we cannot conclude that the video was offered “solely to inflame the passions of the jury[,]” as would be required to prevent its admission. See State v. O'Brien, 774 A.2d 89, 107 (R.I. 2001) (quoting State v. Carter, 744 A.2d 839, 847 (R.I."", ""- 26 - 2000)). The thrust of defendant’s argument that this video was unfairly prejudicial is directed at the video’s focus on Camden’s body in her bed, stating that “[o]ne cannot look at this [video] of this little girl, obviously dead, without having their heart broken.” However, this Court has recognized that “[b]y their very nature, crime-scene [portrayals] of murder victims may unsettle or even horrify the viewer, yet * * * because it is the state’s burden to prove each element of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt, such photographs are unquestionably relevant to its need to do so.” Id. (quoting Carter, 744 A.2d at 847). Thus, because of the inherently prejudicial nature of a murder, “[t]he test for determining the admissibility of photographs does not gauge their ghastliness, but instead asks whether they will ‘inflame the jurors and therefore prejudice them beyond the ordinary prejudice that is always sustained by the introduction of relevant evidence intended to prove guilt.’” Carter, 744 A.2d at 847 (quoting State v. Ellis, 619 A.2d 418, 424 (R.I. 1993)). “‘Indeed, only when such evidence is offered solely to inflame the passions of the jury should a photograph’ or other visual images of a crime victim be excluded.” O'Brien, 774 A.2d at 107 (quoting Carter, 744 A.2d at 847). For that reason, “[t]his Court has consistently held that ‘when such evidence * * * is probative, the trial court's admission of explicit photographs is not an abuse of discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal.’” Carter, 744 A.2d at 847 (quoting Hughes v. State, 656 A.2d 971, 972 (R.I. 1995))."", 'In the case at bar, the video presented was probative, as it displayed the pathway of the struggle which presumably ensued between defendant and Camden. Specifically, the video illustrated the course from the bathroom, where the fighting allegedly started, to Camden’s bedroom, where it ended. Additionally, the video allowed the jury to see imagery of the floor next to the bed where the final struggle allegedly occurred and the bed in which defendant ultimately placed Camden’s body. Further, the video showed the placement of a stuffed elephant', '- 27 - close to Camden’s body, presumably where Tim moved it when he found her the morning after her death.

Thus, the cumulative effect of the other video could not have been taken into the trial justice’s calculus in making his Rule 403 determination. 11 Further, this longer video focuses largely on other areas of the home and was recorded after the medical examiner removed Camden’s body, evidence placards were placed around the bedroom, and police had seized other evidence from the bedroom. This Court has never required the state to prove its case in the least prejudicial way possible; to the contrary, we have steadfastly held that, because the state bears the burden to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, “the state has the right to establish the existence of those elements as it deems just.” State v.

It is well settled that “Rule 403 cuts across the rules of evidence.” State v. Gaspar, 982 A.2d 140, 148 (R.I. 2009). When deciding whether or not to admit evidence, a trial justice “must carefully weigh the possibility that this evidence will unfairly prejudice the accused.” State v.

It does not appear from the record that the trial justice articulated, either expressly or impliedly, the balancing test required by Rule 403. This is, in my opinion, in and of itself, error. And, in the context of this case, that error cannot be said to be harmless. See State v. Pona, 948 A.2d 941, 953 (R.I. 2008) (Superior Court erred when it did', '- 29 - not attempt to strike a balance between the necessity of admission and the danger of unfair prejudice).', 'It goes without saying that the mere fact that the video contains images that are difficult for any reasonable person to see is not a sufficient reason to exclude it from consideration by the factfinder.

After all, we have said on many occasions that a criminal defendant “is not entitled to a sanitized version of the * * * evidence.” State v. Pona, 66 A.3d 454, 468 (R.I. 2013). Indeed, the impact that such disturbing or gruesome images may have on the finder of fact has been addressed on many occasions by this Court.', 'For example, in State v. Ellis, 619 A.2d 418, 424 (R.I. 1993), we upheld the admission of photographs of a victim’s head that was “blown apart by a shotgun blast.” Likewise, in State v. Brown, 88 A.3d 1101, 1118-21 (R.I. 2013), we upheld the admission of autopsy photographs where the murder victim’s dissected brain was shown with hair protruding from the folded skin of his scalp. And, in State v. Patel, 949 A.2d 401, 412-14 (R.I. 2008), we upheld the trial justice’s admission of a 9-1-1 recording that contained a young child’s distraught voice as he sobbed after his father was murdered before his eyes. In the recording, the rest of the family’s agonized cries could clearly be heard in the background. Id. at 413.', 'The state argued, and the majority apparently agrees, that the video was necessary to demonstrate the interior of the Fry home and the path that defendant and Camden took as they struggled between the bathroom and the victim’s bedroom.', 'The seven minute video is disturbing by any measure.

The viewer then follows the videographer as he enters the front door of the residence, at which time a man, presumably the child’s father, can clearly be heard sobbing. The footage consumes only ninety seconds inside the bathroom and then takes but a few seconds travelling from the bathroom into the child’s bedroom. Almost the entirety of the remainder of the video, consuming over half the footage, consists of the videographer panning the body of the dead child from every conceivable vantage point, including close-ups of the young girl’s mottled skin after the processes of rigor mortis and livor mortis have been completed. After a four and a half minute viewing of her room—three and a half of which intensely focuses on the dead child’s body—the remaining few seconds leave the viewer with shots of the child’s bedroom, toys, and bookcase.', 'With all due respect to the majority, I see a difference, not merely in degree, but also in kind with respect to the images allowed into evidence in this case. The nearly silent scenes of the eight-year-old’s body as the camera moves up, down, and around her lifeless corpse are macabre, if not grotesque. Given the extremely limited probative value of the images, there can be no other purpose or result other than to evoke feelings of sympathy or disgust in the jury, to the extreme prejudice of defendant.

The trial justice declined to impart a specific accident instruction, instead relying on two somewhat tangential references to accident that were included in his charge to the jury. The majority embraces this conclusion, reasoning that the charge that was provided to the jury informed the panel that it could not find defendant guilty unless it determined that her actions were intentional and not the product of unintentional conduct.', 'I respectfully disagree. The word accident appears in the trial justice’s charge only twice in an instruction that spans twenty-five minutes. In his charge, the trial justice did not discuss accident as a theory of defense, but rather employed the word to modify and limn the definition of intent. This passing reference was insufficient in light of defendant’s theory of the case, which was that Camden’s death had been occasioned by unintentional conduct that occurred', '- 32 - while defendant was attempting to restrain an unruly child.', 'The defendant’s requested instruction, brief as it may have been, was much more clearly focused on that theory of defense.', 'Interestingly, the instruction that was given to the jury here is exquisitely similar to that in State v. Drew, 919 A.2d 397 (R.I. 2007). In Drew, we upheld the trial justice’s refusal to give a specific accident instruction because a passing reference to the word “accident” during the testimony at trial did not “trigger a trial justice’s obligation to issue an accident instruction.” Id. at 405. We upheld the trial justice’s refusal to give a comprehensive accident instruction because the defendant admitted that accident was not a defense he pursued at trial and the defendant neither presented evidence of accident at trial nor argued it in his closing. In Drew, the trial justice instructed that', '“As to the word ‘willfully,’ you are instructed that an act is done', 'willfully if it is done voluntarily and intentionally and not by', 'mistake or accident. * * * You should consider all of the facts and', 'circumstances in evidence that you think are relevant in', 'determining whether the state has proved beyond a reasonable', 'doubt that [defendant] acted with the required intent or state of', 'mind.” Id. at 404 (emphasis added.). According to the Court in Drew, this “anemic reference” to accident was appropriate based on the paucity of evidence of accident presented at trial. Id.

The majority attempts to differentiate this case from Drew by seeking solace in the fact that the trial justice made two passing references to the word accident instead of one. I cannot agree that that was sufficient.', 'Additionally, I take issue with the majority’s conclusions that an accident instruction was not justified because there was only “minimal evidence” that would support the jury’s conclusion that Camden’s death was accidental and its assessment that there was a dearth of evidence of an accidental occurrence. Under our jurisprudence, minimal evidence is all that is required. See Larngar, 918 A.2d at 857. In my view, there was much more than minimal evidence on the record.', 'The theme of both the opening and closing statements of defense counsel was that Camden’s death was accidental and that it occurred while the mother was attempting to restrain a resistant and flailing child. The defense offered but one witness, Dr. Elizabeth Laposata, the state’s former medical examiner. Doctor Laposata testified that the cause of Camden’s death was consistent with an accident because it may well have occurred while her mother was attempting to restrain her, and that the cause of death was asphyxia as a result of a combination of compression of the blood vessels on the side of the neck, compression of the torso, and obstruction of the mouth. Significantly, on cross-examination, the state’s witnesses Timothy Fry and Barbara Kettle testified that the defendant related to each of them that she tried to control the thrashing and screaming child by sitting on her and covering her mouth, and that she had successfully employed that procedure during past instances of difficulty with Camden. Although it is not the defendant’s burden to prove that Camden’s death was an accident, the defendant', '- 34 - more than provided minimal evidence upon which a trier of fact could conclude that the death was not intentional beyond a reasonable doubt.

For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court in all respects.', '1', 'Facts and Travel', 'In 1958 William B. Ross, decedent, was a member of the United States Army stationed in Greece, where he lived with his wife, Emily Ross, and their three young sons, James, William, Jr., and Glen. 3 At some time during that year, William suffered a massive cerebral hemorrhage; he subsequently underwent two brain surgeries, including a frontal lobectomy, and he was eventually transferred to a facility in Brockton, Massachusetts. As a result of the brain trauma and surgeries, William experienced a substantial loss to his short-term memory. In 1959, his wife was appointed as the guardian of his person and estate. While he resided at the facility in Brockton, his doctors determined that William was incompetent and severely mentally impaired, with a prognosis that there was a reasonable likelihood that he would remain severely impaired and would not regain the ability to function in society in a reasonable manner.', 'William’s sons testified that, during his stay at the facility, they visited their father in Brockton approximately once each month, but that William was unable to engage in any sort of conversation with them and that he did not even recognize them. Around 1965, however, William experienced a remarkable improvement in his functionality. James testified that he 3', 'We will identify several of the parties in this case by their first names for the sake of clarity, due to the fact that this case deals with an estate and several family members have the same surname. No disrespect is intended.', '-2- remembered visiting the Brockton facility one day when suddenly his father recognized them all, knew they were coming to visit, and was conversing with them. William was reevaluated by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), which determined that William was functioning at a sufficient level to be released to live with his parents.', 'In 1964 Emily resigned as William’s guardian, and, around that same time, the couple divorced. Soon after, Citizens Trust Company was appointed guardian of the decedent’s estate and attorney Jeremiah Jeremiah 4 was appointed as the guardian of his person; the decedent was rated as 100 percent disabled by the VA. However, in 1971, William was again evaluated by the VA and determined by Dr. Robert Hyde to be competent. Both Citizens and Jeremiah were discharged as William’s guardians.', 'Between 1971 and 1992, William maintained his competency designation and remained without a guardian. Between 1980 and 1991, William purchased several annuities and opened a number of investment accounts, designating various beneficiaries among his three sons, the plaintiffs, and his two sisters, defendants Nancy Howard and Lois Sanford.', 'William also executed a Last Will and Testament. Until the mid-1980s, William’s parents had been providing for his welfare and assisting him with financial investments, but, around 1985, Howard testified, her father suffered an abdominal aneurism and about a year or two later her mother was stricken with a heart attack. At that time, Howard, in an unofficial capacity, stepped in to care both for her parents and her brother.', 'In 1992 William was again determined to be incompetent by the VA, and his sister, Howard, was appointed by the VA to be his “legal custodian.” As legal custodian, Howard had control of William’s finances, investments, and estate. In 1994, at the suggestion of the VA, she 4', 'The late Jeremiah Jeremiah later became the Chief Judge of the Rhode Island Family Court.', '-3- petitioned the probate court to appoint her as William’s guardian. The petition was granted, and, pursuant to that appointment, she was required to file yearly accountings of all William’s investments. William died on May 31, 1999. 5', 'Howard testified that she initially was appointed to be William’s legal custodian at the request of the VA, due to the growing size of his estate. Howard prepared an accounting of her brother’s assets at the time of her appointment.', 'At that time, the estate was valued at approximately $416,000. Each year after that, Howard prepared a yearly inventory of her brother’s investments and accounts, providing a total accounting of his estate to both the VA and the East Greenwich Probate Court. The fifth and final accounting was submitted in 1999, shortly after William passed away, at which point the estate contained approximately $920,000. William’s three sons filed an objection to the final accounting in the probate court, but on December 21, 2000, the probate judge entered a consent order allowing the guardian’s accounting without prejudice to the contestants’ right to appeal to the Superior Court.', 'Plaintiffs filed a notice of probate appeal in Kent County Superior Court on January 5, 2001, listing as reasons for appeal that the guardian, Howard, had violated her fiduciary duty to the decedent, had committed fraud, and had a conflict of interest in making the determination of what assets to include in the decedent’s estate.', 'A nonjury trial was held before a trial justice in the Kent County Superior Court. William’s three sons and two sisters each testified at the trial. The parties also presented the testimony of Thomas F. Flynn, the Ross family’s financial advisor, and Dr. Andrew Rosenzweig, a geriatric psychiatrist.', 'The deposition of another psychiatrist, Dr. William B. Land, was admitted as a full exhibit by agreement of the parties. 5', 'William’s will was admitted to the East Greenwich Probate Court and without objection; Howard and Sanford were appointed co-executrixes of his estate.', '-4-', 'William, Jr. testified that, from the time his father moved in with his grandparents, his father’s condition was improved but he remained confused, experienced memory loss, and acted like a person with Alzheimer’s disease and “as if he was the best disciplined eight-year-old boy.” He testified that he got along very well with his aunts, but he explained that, prior to 1994, he had no knowledge of his father’s assets or whether he had any interest in those assets, nor that his father had been under a guardianship at any point.', 'James, William’s oldest son, testified that he clearly remembered visiting his father in Brockton and the day that his father’s condition drastically transformed. However, he said that his father never returned to be the man he had been before his brain injury; an intelligent, athletic, gifted man who spoke three languages, and had been an honor student. James said that his father retained some of his language abilities but otherwise was unable to remember daily events. James said that he had lived with his father and grandparents on at least two occasions, for at least a year following his high school graduation in 1969 and again around 1990 for a year or more.', 'James also testified that, at some point in the 1980s, he was approached by his aunts, his grandmother, and his father about his father’s assets. He said that they showed him a document that listed his father’s assets, such as stocks that he owned. The document also laid out who the stocks were “being appropriated to” among himself, his brothers, and his aunts. He said they explained that his father’s worth had reached a point where they felt that investing his money would result in a better return. He testified that his family “meant for me to be proud, and I was, that my father had acquired this much monies and that it was being invested and that he was looking towards, well, not only his own future but that he was making preparations for my future and my brothers’ futures.” According to James’ testimony, the accounts totaled approximately', '-5- $180,000, and he was told that they were set up so that he and his brothers would each receive 30 percent of his father’s assets and each of his aunts would receive 5 percent. He recalled being asked if it bothered him that his aunts were receiving some money and he explained his feelings at the time as follows:', '“I always felt that * * * they were there when we were children,', 'especially on a much more permanent basis or on a basis where', 'they saw him and met his needs if he had any, and I’m sure they', 'too, like, they were saddened by how his condition had', 'deteriorated * * * but, of course, they were always kind, they', 'showed him much love, and it was evident to me as a child and', 'later as an adult, I never saw their affection or their loyalty, let’s', 'say, to their brother decline, it never did, I mean, and I always felt', 'that they had his best interest at heart, and I trusted them', 'completely.”', 'He additionally testified that, when he returned to live with his father and grandparents, his father’s condition was the same; he could not converse about current events but he had a routine that he followed every day. For approximately ten years, his father had a job at E.A. Adams Jewelry Company, to which he would take the bus.', 'James said that, while he was living with his father and grandparents from 1990 to 1991, it came to his attention that his father was paying for a private life insurance policy. Because his father had served in the military, James believed that the VA should be paying for the policy as part of his father’s disability benefits. During the course of getting the VA to take over the policy, James, with the permission of his father, grandmother, and Howard, also changed the beneficiary form to include Glen’s two children, William’s grandchildren. James also learned that his father had been seeing several private physicians and dentists and believed that he should have been obtaining that care for free through the VA. James also discovered at that time that his father had been found to be competent at some earlier time, much to James’ surprise, and he began to inquire further about how that had happened, including requesting medical records from', '-6- the VA. However, he did not inform his grandparents or aunts that he was making such an inquiry.', 'James testified that at some time in 1994 he received a letter from Howard explaining that the VA had asked her to assist his father and stating that she was responsible for a yearly fiduciary accounting on his behalf. He said that he was upset by the letter because it was the first time he heard anything about the VA contacting his aunt, and he was troubled that the agency would have contacted her and not any of William’s sons. He said that his brother Glen was particularly upset, but James said that he tried to calm his brother down by explaining that his aunt was with their father daily, that she was doing things for him, and that he “had every faith in [his] aunt to do the right thing for [his] father.”', 'James also said that he had frequently borrowed money from William over a period of nearly thirty years, totaling approximately $35,000. James repeatedly said that his father would understand at the time when his family discussed financial matters with him, such as when James asked to borrow money from his father or the family talked to him about changing the beneficiary form to include his grandchildren.', 'Finally, James testified that he had no knowledge that his aunts ever misappropriated funds from his father, but, nonetheless, he believed that his aunts had changed some documents so that he and his brothers “lost a significant amount of [his] father’s estate.” After his father died, James received no more than $70,000, and he believed his brothers received the same amount.', 'Glen testified that he remembered his father as not being very communicative, that he usually just sat and watched television, and that, to his knowledge, his father’s condition did not improve much over time. Glen acknowledged that he received a letter advising him that there', '-7- was a hearing scheduled on August 18, 1994, to address the appointment of a guardian for his father, but that the letter said it was not necessary for him to attend and so he did not attend. He testified that he did not receive an accounting or inventory that was supposed to have been attached to that letter. He explained that at the time he had no knowledge of the contents of his father’s estate or of any of his investments.', 'Finally, Glen testified that in 1987 he and his fiancée, Mary, wished to purchase a house, but that his credit was very bad. He spoke to his aunt, grandmother, and father about using his father’s good credit to help them secure a mortgage. Eventually, they purchased a house in William’s and Mary’s names only. His father also signed an agreement with Mary and Glen, concerning the house and repayment terms. Glen admitted that his father understood the basic provisions of the agreement as well as he himself did, since he also did not understand much of the “legal jargon” in the agreement.', 'Sanford, decedent’s sister, testified that her brother did not discuss financial matters with her; indeed, she said that she was unaware that he was under a guardianship. She said she believed that her mother had taken care of his finances for many years, until Howard took over. Sanford also testified that at some point she became aware that her brother had created a checking account designating her as a joint owner, but that at the time she had no knowledge of it and did not know why she was listed as an owner. The only investment that she knew of at the time was in 1971 when her brother placed $7,000 in a certificate of deposit in her name. Finally, she testified that she received approximately $360,000 from her brother’s estate and that the money had been expended.', 'Howard was questioned at length about her brother’s condition and her knowledge of his investments; however, she had very little memory of the details of each investment. Regarding', '-8- William’s condition after he moved in with his parents, she explained that, at a certain point in the 1980s, her brother was able to start driving a car again and he obtained employment at E.A. Adams in Pawtucket. She further testified that he was active in his church, was involved in a retired senior volunteer program, and was a member of a bowling league. She said that he could speak Greek fluently up until the time of his death.', 'Howard testified that, although she could not remember any of her brother’s investments with particularity, “It’s not my custom to sign things I don’t know what I’m signing.” She said that she discussed all the investment changes with her brother and Thomas F. Flynn, and that she never went to the investment firm without her brother. She identified a letter she wrote to Glen, William, Jr., and James, dated June 22, 1994. In her letter, Howard explained that she had been serving as decedent’s legal custodian with the VA since 1992 at the VA’s recommendation.', 'Howard testified that, during her term as her brother’s guardian and fiduciary, she did not change any of the beneficiary designations on his accounts. She maintained that however the assets were designated in terms of ownership or beneficiaries at the beginning of her involvement was how they remained until her brother’s death, even though the investment vehicles may have been changed from time to time. She further testified that, to her recollection, at no time did any of her brother’s children contact her to inquire about the investments.', 'Thomas F. Flynn testified that he had served as a financial advisor to the decedent and stated that he had met with the decedent, who signed various documents and applications for funds in Mr. Flynn’s presence. He testified that the decedent appeared to understand what he was signing.', 'Doctor Andrew Rosenzweig, a geriatric psychiatrist, who reviewed the decedent’s VA medical records, testified that he saw no evidence in the records he had reviewed that anyone had', '-9- exerted undue influence on the decedent, nor anything to indicate that the decedent was not competent at the time his will was signed. He further testified that, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, the decedent would have understood who the beneficiaries of his assets were and would have understood his decisions surrounding such designations at the time he was making them. 6', 'At the conclusion of the evidence, the trial justice rendered a bench decision, finding in favor of defendants on all claims. She found that Howard did not breach her fiduciary duties as guardian or in rendering her fifth and final accounting of the guardianship estate.', 'The trial justice conducted a detailed review of the facts and procedural history of the case and the evidence, including the testimony of William B. Ross, Jr., James C. Ross, Glenn E. Ross, Dr. William B. Land, Lois E. Sanford, Nancy D. Howard, Dr. Andrew Rosenzweig, and Thomas F. Flynn. The trial justice first addressed the issues raised in the 2004 case that is not before this Court. 7 Regarding the appeal filed by plaintiffs with respect to the consent order entered in East Greenwich Probate Court on the fifth and final accounting that is before this Court, the trial justice found that plaintiffs “failed to satisfy their burden of demonstrating that Howard breached her fiduciary duty.” 6', 'The trial justice found that there was no critical difference between the conclusions of Dr. Land and Dr. Rosenzweig. 7', 'Because this appeal arises out of case KP 01-9, which was plaintiffs’ probate appeal from the order approving Howard’s fifth and final accounting, the trial justice’s analysis of the claims alleged in case KC 04-644, including breach of fiduciary duty, undue influence, and fraud, will be discussed here only as needed for context as to the issues raised in this appeal. The trial justice disposed of the undue-influence claim that is not subject to this appeal, finding that “[u]pon review of the totality of the circumstances, there [was] no evidence to suggest a scintilla of undue influence,” and that, “[t]o the contrary, the overwhelming evidence shows that the decedent acted independently and with full knowledge in reaching a fair, proper and reasonable disposition of his assets.”', '- 10 -', 'As to the claim that Nancy Howard breached a fiduciary duty through a scheme by which she wrongfully transferred funds or beneficiary interests to herself and her sister, the trial justice found that, although Howard owed a fiduciary duty to the decedent, plaintiffs did not prove that she had breached that duty. The trial justice found that “there’s no evidence that Howard changed the beneficiary designations on the decedent’s accounts.”', 'She further found that because Sanford did not owe a fiduciary duty to William, there was no reason to address those claims alleged by plaintiffs against her.', 'The trial justice found that the fees that Howard received for her services as guardian, totaling $2,127.50, were not unreasonable. She also found that there was no evidence that Howard used income or other assets of the estate for her own purposes, or for anyone else’s personal support or maintenance.', 'Therefore, she ordered that judgment enter in favor of defendants on the alleged breach of fiduciary duty.', 'Similarly, as to the claim of fraud, she found that plaintiffs had failed to present any evidence that defendants made any false representations to either plaintiffs or the decedent, that no one had been induced to rely on any representations made by defendants that led to their harm.', 'The trial justice further concluded that plaintiffs’ posttrial claim that Howard had committed fraud by concealing a conflict of interest had not been pled in the original complaint or the amended complaint, and thus that claim was not considered by the court. Additionally, she found that plaintiffs “failed to establish that defendants engaged in any wrongdoing with respect to the decedent’s estate.”', 'Finally, the trial justice addressed plaintiffs’ posttrial claim that the decedent lacked the capacity to name Howard and Sanford as joint tenants in some of his investment assets, notwithstanding the fact that this claim had not been pled in either complaint. She found that', '- 11 - plaintiffs’ own testimony supported a conclusion that their father had the contractual capacity to perform these designations, “because [the sons] engaged in a multitude of financial transactions with their father during his lifetime and during the relevant time period which they [now] challenge.” Specifically, she cited to instances when James borrowed money from his father, and William co-signed documents with Glen so that he could purchase a home, as well as other occasions in which plaintiffs received funds from their father over the course of the years. She also noted that the medical testimony supported the conclusion that decedent had the ability to act on his own behalf during the time period in question.', 'A judgment entered in favor of defendants, and plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal.', '2', 'Issues on Appeal', 'Before this Court, plaintiffs broadly argue that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived the evidence presented during the trial. Insofar as this Court can discern, plaintiffs appear to argue, first, that the trial justice erred in concluding that Howard did not breach her fiduciary duty when she renewed certain of decedent’s investments at some point after the first accounting with the probate court in 1994. The plaintiffs contend that she was treating those investments as her own rather than those of her ward. Second, plaintiffs claim that the trial justice committed error because she overlooked Howard’s failure to disclose a conflict of interest when she filed the guardianship petition in 1994, in which she described William’s estate as consisting of “various investments * * * in the name of Ward and various third persons as Joint Tenants with Rights of Survivorship,” when she herself was a joint owner of several of those investments.', '- 12 -', 'Third, plaintiffs allege that the proper procedure for veterans’ guardianships, found at G.L. 1956 chapter 16 of title 33, was not followed, and that Howard violated § 33-17-1. They further allege that she did not comply with the requirements of § 33-18-27 when she obtained the approval from the probate court for the fifth and final accounting.', '3', 'Standard of Review', '“It is well established that the factual findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury are accorded great weight and will not be disturbed unless the record shows that the findings clearly are wrong or the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence.”', 'Wellington Condominium Association v.

Although much of their written submissions to this Court focus on defendant’s conduct after she was appointed the legal guardian, plaintiffs further contend that she acted as a de facto guardian for her brother as early as 1980. The plaintiffs also appear to argue that defendant Howard’s failure to disclose her purported conflict of interest constituted a breach of her duty of loyalty that is a fundamental aspect of the fiduciary relationship.', 'The defendants respond that the trial justice’s findings were supported by competent evidence, that plaintiffs failed to demonstrate how the trial justice misconceived material evidence, and that Rhode Island law does not prohibit a guardian from being a joint tenant on the investments of a ward.', 'Insofar as plaintiffs argue that defendant’s fiduciary duty began prior to her appointment as guardian by the probate court, this Court will not address such an argument because it is clear from the trial justice’s decision that it was not argued at the trial court level. 9 The trial justice 8', 'Although plaintiffs’ notice of appeal pertains to both defendants, plaintiffs’ briefs do not develop or even assert any challenges to the trial justice’s decisions pertaining to defendant Sanford.

See Connor v. Schlemmer, 996 A.2d 98, 109 (R.I. 2010) (discussing constructive trust as an equitable solution in situations where a violation of a fiduciary or confidential relationship occurs); see also chapter 16 of title 33 (establishing veterans’ guardianships). “If a fiduciary duty is found, such duty ‘is one of trust and confidence and imposes the duty on the fiduciary to act with the utmost good faith.’” Notarantonio v.

Hendrick, 755 A.2d 784, 789 (R.I. 2000)). “A fiduciary duty is a duty of loyalty; it is a special confidence reposed in one who in equity and good conscience is bound to act in good faith and with due regard to the interests of the one reposing confidence.” 37 Am. Jur. 2d Fraud and Deceit § 35 at 64 (2013).', 'The trial justice concluded, and neither party disputes, that Howard owed a fiduciary duty to William when she was appointed as guardian for William. However, the trial justice made several critical findings in addressing plaintiffs’ several contentions that Howard breached that duty. First, the trial justice found that Howard’s testimony was credible, but that much of the testimony from the three plaintiffs was self-serving and unconvincing. In response to plaintiffs’ suggestion that Howard engaged in self-dealing when she changed the beneficiaries of the decedent’s annuities and/or life insurance policies, she concluded that there was no evidence on the record that Howard changed any beneficiary designations. She found that “the evidence', '- 15 - indicates that the beneficiary designations on the decedent’s accounts remained as initially established by the decedent.” Furthermore, the trial justice found that the actions taken by Howard to exchange investment vehicles for several of the accounts were “aimed at appreciating the decedent’s estate [and] indicate prudent behavior and sound judgment.”', ""The plaintiffs now ask this Court to disregard or find error in the trial justice’s findings of fact and determinations of credibility. As mentioned above, and on countless occasions by this Court, “the factual findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury are accorded great weight and will not be disturbed unless the record shows that the findings clearly are wrong or the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence.” Wellington Condominium Association, 68 A.3d at 599 (quoting Hernandez, 41 A.3d at 982). “[W]e ‘accord a substantial amount of deference to th[e] [credibility] determinations, due to the fact that the trial justice * * * has had an opportunity to appraise witness demeanor and to take into account other realities that cannot be grasped from a reading of a cold record.’” D'Ellena v. Town of East Greenwich, 21 A.3d 389, 392 (R.I. 2011) (quoting B.S. International Ltd. v. JMAM, LLC, 13 A.3d 1057, 1062 (R.I. 2011))."", '“[W]e shall not substitute our view of the evidence for [the trial justice’s] even though a contrary conclusion could have been reached.” Cullen v.

Furthermore, we can discern absolutely no evidence from the record that would contradict the trial justice’s findings that William “acted independently and with full knowledge in reaching a fair, proper and reasonable disposition of his assets” and that “during her time as guardian for the decedent Howard only made changes as to investments themselves to maximize their returns and not to the beneficiary designations.”', '- 16 -', 'Notably, the trial justice neither considered nor ruled on plaintiffs’ claim that Howard committed fraud by concealing a conflict of interest because it was not pled in the original complaint or the amended complaint filed in the 2004 lawsuit. The trial justice identified only a claim of breach of fiduciary duty in the 2001 probate appeal. However, the appeal that is before us asserted both a breach of fiduciary duty claim and an allegation that the “Guardian * * * and her counsel are now in a conflict of interest to determine the proper inclusion of assets in Decedent’s estate which is pending in East Greenwich Probate Court.” The plaintiffs reiterate their argument before us that Howard’s concealment of her conflict of interest is actionable in this Court; however, they couch the violation as a breach of fiduciary duty.', 'We have held that a trial justice’s failure to rule on an issue raised in the trial court is an error, but this Court may still address the issue if it presents a pure question of law. See Power v. City of Providence, 582 A.2d 895, 900 (R.I. 1990) (“Once again, the arguments that the parties have presented relate solely to questions of law. The trial judge erred in failing to rule on the legal question of whether the settlement agreement is invalid on the basis that it contravenes the act.”). Indeed, in Notarantonio, 941 A.2d at 145, we said that “[a]lthough [the trial justice] did not specifically address the claim of breach of fiduciary duty, her findings of fact for all intents and purposes preclude a finding that [the defendant] breached any such duty.” We find that reasoning to be equally applicable regarding plaintiffs’ conflict of interest allegations in this case.', 'Here, plaintiffs argue that Howard breached her fiduciary duty when she failed to disclose to the probate court that she was a joint owner on some of decedent’s investment accounts because, had she made such a disclosure, such an apparent conflict of interest would have precluded her appointment as guardian. The plaintiffs argue that the duty of loyalty', '- 17 - mandated that she eradicate any such conflict of interest by removing herself as a joint tenant from those accounts. Howard responds that there is no basis in Rhode Island law that would prevent a guardian from being a joint tenant of the ward’s property.', 'Several legal principles are relevant to the issues raised by plaintiffs, and a few courts have directly addressed the issue of a guardian’s joint ownership of the ward’s accounts. First, we are of the opinion that “[a]s a general rule, close relatives are preferred as guardians or conservators of incompetent persons since they are regarded as the ones most solicitous of the ward’s welfare and the ones most likely to rehabilitate the ward.” 39 Am. Jur. 2d Guardian and Ward § 41 at 48 (2008). Under Rhode Island’s Limited Guardianship Statute, relatives or friends of incapacitated individuals are eligible to be appointed as guardians, and the statute specifically provides that “the court should consider the wishes expressed by the individual found to be incapacitated as to preferences among individuals eligible to serve as limited guardian or guardian.” General Laws 1956 § 33-15-6(c), (e). 10', 'In situations where the spouse is the preferred guardian, either by statute or by the ward’s own request, joint accounts and investments would necessarily be involved. Were that to automatically invalidate a guardianship or require the guardian to remove herself from all jointly owned accounts, it would run counter to the public policy favoring close relatives as guardians and would likely invalidate many existing guardianships.', 'The plaintiffs rely heavily on a decision of the Court of Appeals of Georgia, wherein the court found that a guardian and joint tenant had breached his duty of loyalty, explaining: 10', 'The trial justice acknowledged that the guardianship was subject to the provisions of the Uniform Veterans’ Guardianship Act, which provides that “[e]xcept where inconsistent with this chapter, laws of this state relating to guardian, ward, and the judicial practice relating thereto, including the right to trial by jury and the right of appeal, shall be applicable to beneficiaries and their estates.” General Laws 1956 § 33-16-32.', '- 18 -', '“since the guardian, as an individual, was joint tenant with his', 'ward with right of survivorship as to the savings accounts, * * *', 'there can be no doubt that he occupied a conflict-of-interest', 'position and was thus in violation of his duty of loyalty, as he', 'stood to gain personally by preserving the savings accounts and', 'taking the balance as the survivor.” Dowdy v. Jordan, 196 S.E.2d', '160, 165 (Ga. Ct. App. 1973). Although it is true that in that case the guardian inappropriately drained the ward’s individual accounts while maintaining the entirety of the joint account for himself, it is also true that the court rested its decision that the guardian breached his fiduciary duty on the acceptance of the trust from the beginning because of the joint account. Id. at 165-66. The court reasoned that there is “a duty to refuse the trust, or resign, or to remove the conflicting personal interest. He cannot prevent the existence of the conflict of interest, but he can immediately remove it.” Id. at 166 (quoting Bogert, Trusts and Trustees § 543 at 478 (2d Ed.1960)).', 'However, other courts addressing the issue have turned away from such a strict approach. The Kansas Court of Appeals declined to adopt a strict rule that a conflict of interest posed by a guardian’s dual status as joint tenant and guardian should compel forfeiture of her right of survivorship. Fielder v. Howell, 631 P.2d 249, 251 (Kan. Ct. App. 1981). There, the defendant was appointed guardian of her father’s estate several years after being made a joint tenant with right of survivorship on a certificate of deposit by her father. Id. at 249-50. On the same day that she was appointed guardian, she withdrew the proceeds of the certificate and deposited them in a joint checking account with her husband. Id. at 250. The court specifically distinguished the situation from that present in Dowdy, reasoning that she had a right to the money in the account as a joint holder, that she had been entrusted as a joint owner by her father for several years before his incapacitation, that she spent money from the joint account to pay for her father’s expenses during the guardianship, and that there was no liquidation of other assets of the estate.', '- 19 - Id. Therefore, the court held that “when the estate of the ward is in no way diminished and the apparent conflict of interest does not manifest itself by controlling the guardian’s actions, it would seem unduly harsh to make an example of a loyal fiduciary because of a potential, yet unrealized, conflict.” Id. at 251.', 'We find the reasoning of the Kansas Court of Appeals to be persuasive. In light of the trial justice’s factual findings in this case—that Howard did not apply any monies from the income of the estate in support of herself or any person other than the ward, and that all evidence pointed to her properly attending to her duties with the assistance of Flynn—there was no evidence that Howard acted in any way that was detrimental to the estate or its beneficiaries. Had Howard not been appointed as William’s guardian, she and Sanford, as joint tenants, would have had the same interest in those joint investments and would have received whatever monies remained in the account at the time of William’s death by operation of law. See Robinson v. Delfino, 710 A.2d 154, 161 (R.I. 1998) (“the opening of a joint bank account wherein survivorship rights are specifically provided for is conclusive evidence of the intention to transfer to the survivor an immediate in praesenti joint beneficial possessory ownership right in the balance of the account remaining after the death of the depositor, absent evidence of fraud, undue influence, duress, or lack of mental capacity”); see also Trust of McManus v. McManus, 18 A.3d 550, 553-54 (R.I. 2011) (reiterating holding in Robinson).', 'B', 'Violations of Guardianship Statutes', 'Finally, plaintiffs assert that Howard violated various provisions of three applicable guardianship statutes. Specifically, plaintiffs allege that the proper procedure for veterans’ guardianships found at § 33-16-16, which requires an accounting of all securities and', '- 20 - investments in the probate court, was not followed, and that Howard violated § 33-17-1, which requires that a bond be posted in certain circumstances as the probate court deems necessary. The defendants argue that these allegations were neither contained in the 2001 reasons for appeal nor in the 2004 complaint, nor were they raised in the trial court until plaintiffs’ posttrial memorandum. We agree. Because these arguments were not addressed by the trial justice, it is clear to us that they were not properly preserved and they will not now be addressed. See State v. Bido, 941 A.2d 822, 828 (R.I. 2008).', 'The plaintiffs also argue that Howard allowed for the distribution of assets prior to the probate court’s approval of her fifth and final accounting in violation of § 33-18-27, covering decedents’ and incompetents’ estates. Although we hold that this argument was also waived, we feel compelled to say that, had it been preserved, there would nevertheless be no justiciable issue. Section 33-18-27 provides, in pertinent part, that:', '“If an executor, administrator, or guardian has paid or', 'delivered to the persons entitled thereto the money or other', 'property in his or her hands as required by a decree of a probate', 'court, he or she may perpetuate the evidence of payment or', 'delivery by presenting to the court, within one year after the decree', 'is made, an account of the payments or delivery, together with the', 'vouchers therefor, which shall be kept in the files of the court.

Furthermore, other than generalized assertions that defendants somehow improperly received decedent’s assets, plaintiffs fail to point to any specific instance where any such impropriety occurred or to any asset that was received by anyone other than a person designated by the decedent.', 'Therefore, we have no difficulty in concluding that the trial justice did not err in finding in favor of the defendants as to the plaintiffs’ appeal of the probate court order approving the fifth and final accounting. The plaintiffs failed to produce any evidence to indicate that Howard did anything other than attempt to continue to carry out the decedent’s wishes in terms of the appointment of beneficiaries, joint tenants, or other recipients of his assets.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

73,State : v. : Jose Lopez,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. The defendant, Jose Lopez, appeals to the Supreme Court from a judgment of conviction after a jury trial held in the Superior Court for Providence County. He was found guilty of the following counts: Count One, assault with a dangerous weapon on Jorge Semidey, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2; Count Two, assault with a dangerous weapon against Maribel Bonet-Perez, in violation of § 11-5-2; Count Three, carrying a pistol without a license, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-47-8(a); Count Five, the discharge of a firearm while committing a crime of violence, in violation of § 11-47-3.2(b)(2); and Count Six, the use of a firearm while in the commission of a crime of violence, in violation of § 11-47- 3.2(a). On appeal, the defendant contends that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial. More specifically, he argues that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence when he determined that the weight of the evidence supported the convictions because, in the defendant’s view, two key witnesses were not credible and the forensic evidence failed to conclusively link him to the shooting at issue.', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On December 18, 2013, a criminal information was filed charging defendant with: Count One, assault with a dangerous weapon on Jorge Semidey, in violation of § 11-5-2; Count Two, assault with a dangerous weapon constituting domestic violence against Maribel Bonet-Perez, in violation of § 11-5-2 and G.L. 1956 § 12-29-5; Count Three, carrying a pistol without a license, in violation of § 11-47-8(a); Count Four, assault and battery, in violation of § 11-5-2; Count Five, discharging a firearm while committing a crime of violence, in violation of § 11-47- 3.2(b)(2); Count Six, using a firearm while in the commission of a crime of violence, “to wit, assault with a dangerous weapon,” in violation of § 11-47-3.2(a); Count Seven, assault with intent to commit murder, in violation of § 11-5-1; Count Eight, using a firearm while in the commission of a crime of violence, “to wit, assault with intent to commit murder,” in violation of § 11-47-3.2(a); and Count Nine, discharging a firearm within the compact part of the City of Providence, in violation of § 11-47-50. The state dismissed Counts Four, Seven, Eight, Nine, and the domestic element of Count Two, pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. The defendant’s trial began on March 3, 2014 and continued on March 4, 6, and 7. We recount below the salient aspects of the trial.', 'A', 'The Testimony of Maribel Bonet-Perez', 'Maribel Bonet-Perez testified that, on December 1, 2012 (the date of the events that led to defendant’s being criminally charged), she was living in the Chad Brown Housing Complex in Providence. She stated that she had met Mr. Lopez on November 3, 2012 and that the two had become “boyfriend/girlfriend.” She further testified that she and defendant were “together” for', '-2- about three weeks or a month before she broke up with him in order to “[go] back to [her] husband,” which is how she referred to Jorge Semidey.1', 'She next testified that she and defendant thereafter resumed their relationship, but that she subsequently broke up with him for a second time. She further testified that Mr. Semidey and defendant did not know one another, but that she had told defendant about Mr. Semidey.', 'It was the further testimony of Ms. Bonet-Perez that, between her second break-up with defendant and December 1, 2012, the two of them had communicated by cellphone. She testified that she spoke to defendant by phone on the afternoon of November 30 and that, in that conversation, he indicated to her that he was unwilling to have their relationship come to an end. She added that defendant requested that she come to a particular restaurant where he was located, and she stated that she complied with that request.', 'Ms. Bonet-Perez said that she was accompanied on her drive to the restaurant by her cousin, Damaris Torres. She stated that, upon arriving at the restaurant, she and Ms. Torres remained in the car, while defendant stood outside the vehicle as he spoke with her. Ms. Bonet-Perez said that she and defendant talked for about five minutes and that she then left.', 'Ms. Bonet-Perez testified that, accompanied by Ms. Torres, she then returned home, where the two women changed in order to get ready to go “clubbing” as they had previously planned. Ms. Bonet-Perez stated that, after 10:00 p.m. that evening, she and Ms. Torres drove to a club in Providence. Ms. Bonet-Perez said that she saw defendant at that first club, but that they did not speak; she added that she left the club as soon as she saw him.', 'Ms. Bonet-Perez testified that she and Ms. Torres then went to a second club, where they remained until its closing, which she estimated to have been at around 1:45 a.m. on December 1. 1', 'In spite of her use of the word “husband” in her testimony, Ms. Bonet-Perez testified that she and Mr. Semidey were not legally married.', '-3- She said that, after leaving the second club, she and Ms. Torres drove back to her home; she added that, once there, the two women remained in the car for ten minutes, during which time, Jorge Semidey arrived and asked to go into her residence in order to retrieve some belongings he had left there. Ms. Bonet-Perez testified that while Mr. Semidey was in the residence, defendant unexpectedly pulled up behind her car, which he approached and began to pull her out. She added that she volunteered to get out of the car and “went with him as he was pulling [her].” She described defendant as being “mad;” and she said that, after pulling her from the car, he took a gun out.', 'Ms. Bonet-Perez further testified that an argument ensued between defendant and her behind her car and that the situation started escalating, culminating in defendant firing a gunshot “[t]o the floor.” She stated that, after defendant started shooting, Mr. Semidey came out of the house, and he tried to calm him down, at which time Mr. Lopez fired his gun again, this time striking Mr. Semidey. She further stated that Mr. Semidey fell, but then got up to try to speak again to defendant, who continued shooting. She said that she could tell that Mr. Semidey had been struck by a bullet because he was bleeding. She testified that, in the same time frame, defendant pointed the gun at her head and neck, as well as at her armpit and stomach. She added that, while defendant had the gun pointed at her, she heard a “click” as he pulled the trigger a couple of times, causing her to feel “scared” and fearful that she was “going to die.”', 'Ms. Bonet-Perez further testified that, after Mr. Semidey had been shot and defendant had pointed the gun at her, he began walking away. She stated that she then helped Mr. Semidey into her car and drove a short distance to a nearby parking area, where she encountered the police, to whom she provided a description of defendant.', '-4-', 'B', 'The Testimony of Damaris Torres2', 'Damaris Torres testified that she knew of Jose Lopez and had seen him on multiple occasions prior to December 1, 2012. Whereas Ms. Bonet-Perez testified that Ms. Torres arrived at her home in the afternoon of November 30, Ms. Torres testified that it was around 7:00 p.m. on that date when she went there. In addition, Ms. Torres made no mention of having gone to a restaurant with Ms. Bonet-Perez that afternoon or having seen defendant at such an establishment.', 'Although Ms. Bonet-Perez testified that she and Ms. Torres had planned to “go out” on the night of November 30, Ms. Torres said that she had not been planning to do so, but then agreed to accompany Ms. Bonet-Perez. She stated that the two women went to two clubs, but she did not testify to having seen Mr. Lopez at either club.', 'Ms. Torres testified that, after leaving the second club, the two women returned to Ms. Bonet-Perez’s home. She further testified that, after returning there, she and Ms. Bonet-Perez remained in the car for a short time, during which time Ms. Bonet-Perez received a phone call from Mr. Semidey. In contrast with Ms. Bonet-Perez’s testimony, Ms. Torres’s testimony contained no mention of Mr. Semidey arriving at the house at that time. She stated that, while they were in Ms. Bonet-Perez’s car, a car in which defendant was a passenger parked directly behind them. She said that, seconds after Ms. Bonet-Perez told her that defendant was parked behind them, he appeared at the car door and threatened Ms. Bonet-Perez, saying: “‘If you don’t 2', 'Since the focus of defendant’s challenge to the denial of his motion for a new trial is on what he characterizes as “inconsistencies” between the testimonies of Ms. Bonet-Perez and Ms. Torres, we shall depart from our usual practice by pointing out some of those testimonial differences in the course of summarizing the testimony of Ms. Torres.', '-5- get out of the car, I’m going to kill you.’” She added that defendant removed Ms. Bonet-Perez from her car and pointed a gun at her head.', 'Ms. Torres testified that, as Mr. Lopez removed Ms. Bonet-Perez from the vehicle and threatened her, Ms. Torres ran and hid behind a nearby vehicle and contacted the police by cellphone. She testified further that she then saw Mr. Semidey approaching the parking lot on foot, but she did not say where he was coming from. Ms. Torres then stated that defendant pointed the gun at Mr. Semidey, “pulled the trigger[,] and shot him.” She added that she saw Mr. Semidey collapse and heard him say: “‘He shot me.’” She said that she realized that his knee had been hit because he had blood on his leg.', 'C', 'The Testimony of Patrolman Eric Chabot', 'Eric Chabot, a patrolman with the Providence Police Department, was also a witness at the trial. He testified that he was called to the Chad Brown Housing Complex around 2:30 a.m. on December 1, 2012. He further testified that, as he was traveling down Chad Brown Street, he observed a “Spanish male” in a black leather coat, who matched the description of defendant that had been broadcast. He stated that he saw defendant pull a firearm from his waistband and “drop it down his left side.” He said that another officer then got out of his patrol car and tackled defendant, who was then immediately placed in custody.', 'D', 'The Testimony of Patrolman David Perez', 'Providence Police Patrolman David Perez also provided testimony at trial. He testified that, on December 1, 2012, he received a message from dispatch directing him to the Chad Brown Housing Complex because someone had been shot.', 'He further testified that, after', '-6- arriving at the housing complex in his vehicle, he saw a black Nissan Maxima speeding towards him, which he proceeded to cut off. It was his testimony that a male and female “jumped out of the vehicle” and that the female driver screamed that her passenger had been shot. He added that she described the shooter as being a “short Hispanic male with a dark jacket.” Officer Perez further stated that, while the female driver was describing the shooter, “she turned and looked behind her and shouted, ‘That’s him.’” He said that he then observed, “a short, Hispanic-looking male [who he] believed had a black leather jacket on.”', 'E', 'The Testimony of Dennis Lyons', 'Dennis Lyons testified as an expert in firearms analysis; he indicated that he had performed an analysis of the evidence seized at the scene of the shooting.3 He stated that, in conducting his analysis, he examined class characteristics, which are the “features that are predetermined by a manufacturer,” and individual characteristics, which comprise “such things as use, abuse, [and] rust” that leave identifying marks.', 'He testified that the result of his examination of the gun seized by the police and the bullet fragments collected at the scene of the shooting was “inconclusive,” which he said means that the individual characteristics were insufficient for an expert to determine whether the fragments were fired from the weapon in question. 3', 'Ralph Costantino, a detective in the Bureau of Criminal Identification of the Providence Police Department, testified at trial that he seized eight nine-millimeter casings from the scene of the shooting as well as the gun from that area.', '-7-', 'F', 'The Verdict and Subsequent Motion for New Trial', 'On March 7, 2014, the jury returned a verdict finding defendant guilty of all five Counts that had been submitted to it. The trial justice eventually sentenced Mr. Lopez as follows: on Counts One and Two, two twenty-year terms, to be served consecutively; on Count Three, ten years, to be served concurrently with Count Two; on Count Five, twenty years without the possibility of parole, to be served consecutively to Counts One, Two, and Three; and, on Count Six, ten years without the possibility of parole, to be served consecutively to all other Counts.', 'The defendant moved for a new trial. On March 19, 2014, a hearing was held on that motion, after which the trial justice denied it. The defendant then filed a notice of appeal.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'A motion for a new trial may be predicated on the grounds that the “weight of the evidence was not adequate to convict” a defendant. State v. Fleck, 81 A.3d 1129, 1133 (R.I. 2014). When addressing a motion for new trial which posits that the weight of the evidence was inadequate to support a conviction, the trial justice “act[s] as a thirteenth juror, exercising independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). The trial justice must engage in a three-step analysis which requires that he or she: “(1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” Id. at 1134 (quoting State v. Heredia, 10 A.3d 443, 446 (R.I. 2010)). After completing that three-step analytical process, “if the trial justice agrees with the jury’s verdict or if the evidence is such that', '-8- reasonable minds could differ as to the outcome, the motion for a new trial should be denied.” State v. Gonzalez, 56 A.3d 96, 102 (R.I. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). If the trial justice does not agree with the jury’s verdict or “does not agree that reasonable minds could differ as to the proper disposition of the case,” then the trial justice must take a fourth analytical step in which he or she “determine[s] whether the verdict is against the fair preponderance of the evidence and fails to do substantial justice.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Hie, 93 A.3d 963, 975 (R.I. 2014); State v. Robat, 49 A.3d 58, 71 (R.I. 2012); State v. Adefusika, 989 A.2d 467, 480 (R.I. 2010).', 'When a defendant appeals the denial of a motion for a new trial, he or she “bears the burden of convincing this [C]ourt that the trial justice did not conscientiously apply these standards.” State v. Garrett, 91 A.3d 793, 800 (R.I. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Adefusika, 989 A.2d at 476.', 'This Court has previously stated that, with respect to a trial justice’s ruling on a motion for new trial, the “record should reflect a few sentences of the [trial] justice’s reasoning on each point.” Hie, 93 A.3d at 975 (internal quotation marks omitted); see Garrett, 91 A.3d at 800; Robat, 49 A.3d at 71. The trial justice is not required to “refer to all the evidence supporting the decision; rather, he or she need only cite evidence sufficient to allow this [C]ourt to discern whether the justice has applied the appropriate standards.” Robat, 49 A.3d at 71 (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Hie, 93 A.3d at 975; Gonzalez, 56 A.3d at 102.', 'When this Court reviews the denial of a motion for new trial, “[i]f the trial justice has complied with this procedure and articulated adequate reasons for denying the motion, his or her decision will be given great weight and left undisturbed unless the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence or otherwise was clearly wrong.” Garrett, 91 A.3d at 800', '-9- (internal quotation marks omitted). We apply this deferential standard of review because “a trial justice, being present during all phases of the trial, is in an especially good position to evaluate the facts and to judge the credibility of the witnesses.” Gonzalez, 56 A.3d at 103 (internal quotation marks omitted); see State v. Clay, 79 A.3d 832, 842 (R.I. 2013) (noting that this Court is deferential to a trial justice’s credibility determinations and does “not focus on whether this Court simply agrees or disagrees with the trial justice’s credibility determinations”) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Hie, 93 A.3d at 975 (“[T]his Court affords a great deal of respect to the factual determinations and credibility assessments made by the judicial officer who has actually observed the human drama that is part and parcel of every trial and who has had an opportunity to appraise witness demeanor and to take into account other realities that cannot be grasped from a reading of a cold record.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'III', 'Analysis', 'On appeal, Mr. Lopez argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial because, in his view, the state’s two key witnesses, Ms. Bonet-Perez and Ms. Torres, gave “such conflicting and contradictory testimony that it was not reasonable for any jury to believe [them].” Mr. Lopez also contends that “it was impossible to attach much significance to the fact that Mr. Lopez happened to be carrying a 9 mm caliber weapon and the cartridge cases found at the scene could have been discharged from a 9 mm, firearm among others.”', 'It is clear to us from the record that, in passing upon defendant’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice conducted the requisite three-step analytical process. See Gonzalez, 56 A.3d at 102; Adefusika, 989 A.2d at 480.', '- 10 -', 'The trial justice completed the first step in the analysis by considering the evidence in light of the jury charge. See State v. Rosario, 35 A.3d 938, 948 (R.I. 2012). He summarized the testimony of Ms. Bonet-Perez and Ms. Torres relative to the events of November 30 and December 1. Specifically, the trial justice stated that the evidence showed that defendant shot Mr. Semidey in the leg and pointed a gun at various parts of Ms. Bonet-Perez’s body while pulling the trigger more than once.', 'Next, the trial justice completed the second step of the analysis by independently assessing the credibility of the witnesses and weighing the evidence. See Hie, 93 A.3d at 976. The trial justice explicitly noted that there were “some discrepancies between the two women’s testimony,” but he nevertheless concluded that “those discrepancies or inconsistencies [did] not diminish * * * the weight or the significance of their testimony.” Furthermore, the trial justice noted that both Ms. Bonet-Perez and Ms. Torres had “categorically, unequivocally, unhesitatingly said that this defendant shot Jorge Semidey.” The trial justice concluded that the state’s witnesses were “wholly credible and forthright.”', 'With respect to the third step in the analysis, the trial justice characterized the jury’s verdict as “well warranted.” He then denied defendant’s motion for a new trial and moved on to sentencing. See Gonzalez, 56 A.3d at 104.', 'We turn now to Mr. Lopez’s specific contentions on appeal. He argues that the trial justice erred in finding Ms. Bonet-Perez and Ms. Torres credible in view of what he characterizes as inconsistencies in their testimony at trial. The following are the purported inconsistencies in the testimony to which he points:', '\uf0b7', 'Ms. Bonet-Perez testified that her cousin arrived at her home in', 'the afternoon of November 30, whereas Ms. Torres testified', 'that she did not arrive until 7:00 p.m. that evening.', '- 11 -', '\uf0b7', 'Ms. Bonet-Perez testified that Ms. Torres was with her when', 'she saw defendant on the afternoon of November 30, whereas', 'Ms. Torres provided no such testimony.', '\uf0b7', 'Ms. Bonet-Perez testified that the two women had planned to', 'go “clubbing” on the evening of November 30, while Ms.', 'Torres made no reference to such a plan and instead testified', 'that she simply agreed to accompany her cousin in going out.', '\uf0b7', 'Ms. Bonet-Perez testified to having seen defendant at the first', 'nightclub on the night in question, but Ms. Torres testified that', 'she did not see defendant at that nightclub.', '\uf0b7', 'Ms. Bonet-Perez testified that she was not expecting to see Mr.', 'Semidey when she returned home from the nightclubs on', 'December 1, whereas Ms. Torres testified that Mr. Semidey', 'had called Ms. Bonet-Perez.', '\uf0b7', 'Ms. Bonet-Perez testified that she spoke with Mr. Semidey', 'when he arrived at her home and permitted him to enter her', 'home, whereas Ms. Torres testified that she had not seen Mr.', 'Semidey that evening until she saw him walking through a', 'parking lot towards Ms. Bonet-Perez and defendant.', '\uf0b7', 'Ms. Bonet-Perez testified that Mr. Semidey was coming from', 'her home when he approached defendant, while Ms. Torres', 'testified that she was unsure of where he was coming from.', 'Even if we were to concede arguendo that each of the just-summarized differences in the testimony of the two witnesses constituted actual inconsistencies, it would not preclude a determination that the witnesses were credible. See State v. Jensen, 40 A.3d 771, 781 (R.I. 2012) (citing various decisions of this Court in support of the proposition that “the presence of some inconsistencies between or among utterances of a witness or witnesses at different points in time does not ipso facto render the testimony unworthy of belief”); see also Rosario, 35 A.3d at 948, 949 (recognizing that, even when there are testimonial inconsistencies, it is not necessary to discredit all of the witness’s testimony). Percipient witnesses often differ concerning some details about events in which they had some degree of involvement. Accordingly, it is clear to us that the trial justice had a basis for determining that, in spite of the fact that their recollections were not identical, the two witnesses were credible as to material issues such that their testimony could support defendant’s conviction. In ruling upon Mr. Lopez’s motion for a new trial, the', '- 12 - trial justice observed that there were “some discrepancies between the two women’s testimony.”4 Nevertheless, these discrepancies did not require that the trial justice conclude that the witnesses are not credible; and, in fact, he determined that the two witnesses were credible with respect to the central issue—namely, whether defendant shot Mr. Semidey and “put[] the gun to [Ms. Bonet-Perez’s] head, and her neck, and her side, [and pulled] the trigger multiple times.”', 'With respect to the second purported inconsistency, the fact that Ms. Torres did not describe visiting defendant at the restaurant on the afternoon of November 30, is not necessarily inconsistent with Ms. Bonet-Perez’s testimony because Ms. Torres was never directly questioned as to when she first saw defendant on November 30. And, with respect to the third purported inconsistency, it is entirely possible that the two women had different expectations as to how they would spend their time together on the night in question, even though they ultimately decided to “go out” together to clubs.', 'As we have previously remarked, when a defendant challenges a trial justice’s credibility determinations, “[t]he mere fact that [a] defendant disagrees with the trial justice’s conclusions about credibility is not a sufficient basis to warrant the granting of a motion for new trial.” State v. Rivera, 987 A.2d 887, 903 (R.I. 2010). It is important to bear in mind that, as we have previously noted, a trial justice is physically present for the entirety of a trial and, accordingly, is “in an especially good position to * * * judge the credibility of the witnesses.” Adefusika, 989 A.2d at 476 (quoting State v. Texieira, 944 A.2d 132, 141 (R.I. 2008)). It is noteworthy that the trial justice in this case expressly referred to his “vantage point as a front-row observer” in 4', 'We acknowledge that there are discrepancies in the first, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh testimonial passages to which defendant has directed our attention—although we consider each of those discrepancies to be of the “de minimis” variety.', '- 13 - passing upon defendant’s motion for a new trial, and he found that Ms. Bonet-Perez and Ms. Torres were “credible and forthright.” See id.5', 'Consequently, upon review of the record, this Court perceives no basis for concluding that the trial justice committed clear error or that he overlooked or misconceived material evidence relating to a critical issue in the case when denying the defendant’s motion for a new trial.

74,Sophie F. Danforth : v. : Timothy T. More et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. These consolidated cases came before the Supreme Court on cross-appeals from an order of the Superior Court granting summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff, Sophie F. Danforth (plaintiff or Danforth). On appeal, the defendant, Timothy T. More (defendant or More), contends that the hearing justice erred in (1) granting summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff; and (2) awarding statutory prejudgment interest. In her cross- appeal, the plaintiff asserts that the hearing justice improperly denied her request for attorney’s fees. On December 10, 2015, this case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised should not be summarily decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and reviewing the memoranda submitted on behalf of the parties, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown. Accordingly, we shall decide the appeal at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On March 22, 2011, Danforth entered into a purchase and sales agreement (PSA) with More and his wife, Rebecca (the Mores), pursuant to which she agreed to sell, and the Mores agreed to purchase, certain real estate (the property) located at 10 Lloyd Lane in Providence. The PSA provided that the sale price of the property would be $700,000, of which $30,000 would be paid as a deposit at the time the PSA was executed. This deposit was to be paid to Andrew Davis, Esq. (Davis) as attorney and escrow agent for Danforth. The PSA set a closing date for October 15, 2011, but also provided that the Mores “may elect to close on any business day on or after September 1, 2011, and before October 15, 2011[.]”', 'The PSA provided as a condition to its performance:', '“The [Mores] may, at [their] expense, have the [property] inspected for radon,', 'lead paint, physical condition, termites, rodents and other pests, which inspection', 'shall be satisfactory to the [Mores] in all respects. If any of the foregoing', 'inspections are not satisfactory to the [Mores] for any reason, the [Mores] may', 'elect to notify [Danforth] in writing of the unsatisfactory condition on or before', '3:00 p.m. on April 4, 2011 (‘Inspection Contingency Date’) and terminate this', 'Agreement. In the event [the Mores] elect[] to terminate this Agreement in', 'accordance with this [section], this Agreement shall be deemed null and void and', 'the Deposit shall be returned to the [Mores], and the parties will have no further', 'obligations to each other.” Importantly, the PSA further provided that “[t]he parties hereto acknowledge and agree that * * * [t]ime is of the [e]ssence for purposes of the Inspection Contingency Date” and that, if the Mores found an unsatisfactory condition prior to the inspection contingency date, their sole remedy would be to terminate the PSA. However, if the Mores failed to invoke their right to terminate the PSA prior to the inspection contingency date and thereafter defaulted on their obligations, the PSA provided that “[Danforth] shall have the right to retain the Deposit for [her] own use, which right shall be [her] sole remedy for such default.”', '-2-', 'The inspection contingency date set for April 4, 2011, came and went with no notification from the Mores that they intended to exercise their right to terminate the PSA. On April 7, 2011, the house was inspected; and, following the inspection, More sent Danforth an email, stating: “I spent over an hour with the house inspector this morning. * * * There are some things that need to be fixed or replaced * * * but nothing beyond what might be expected. I will email you a copy of the report when I receive it. Certainly nothing that would cause us to terminate the contract.” Thereafter, More sent a series of emails to Davis, in which he indicated that the Mores still intended to go forward with the closing. On April 12, 2011, More sent an email stating: “The inspection report attached shows two items that [Danforth] might want to address: the termites in an area of the crawl space and a wood column in the crawl space that has been compressed because it is carrying too much weight. Otherwise nothing too serious. * * * We are tentatively looking at a closing date of September 7.” An email sent on April 15, 2011, provided: “We went to [the property] this morning to do some measuring. It appears that someone tried to break in the front door. * * * It does not appear that the structural integrity of the door was compromised but the surface of the door is cracked around the door handle.”', 'Apparently, the Mores were planning to sell their current house and use the proceeds to purchase the property. However, their plan was complicated when their “prospective buyers got cold feet[,]” forcing them to place their house back on the market.', 'As a result of this complication, More contacted Davis on April 28, 2011, stating, “This may mean that we will not want to close on September 7.” Another email followed from More on July 18, 2011, in which he stated: “Query – did you do anything about the termites in the ceiling of the crawl space? We have no prospects for our house and will need a mortgage to buy yours. Someone just told me that we may not be able to get financing if there are termites.”', '-3-', 'A series of email correspondence followed, in which More and Davis discussed a potential closing date. On August 3, 2011, in response to Davis’s request for a closing date, More indicated, “In the absence of a buyer we are looking at October 15.” Thereafter, More contacted Davis again on September 12, 2011, this time requesting an extension of the closing date to December 1, 2011, because the Mores were having difficulty selling their home. Davis responded on September 14, 2011, indicating that, in order to extend the closing date, Danforth would require an increased deposit and an upward adjustment of the purchase price. In this email, Davis reminded More that “‘time is of the essence’ with respect to the purchase agreement.” Although the closing was scheduled for October 17, 2011, 1 the Mores failed to appear at it. On October 18, 2011, Davis informed the Mores that they were in default pursuant to the terms of the PSA. More responded requesting a reduction in the purchase price and an extension of the period of time to close, which Danforth subsequently declined. 2', 'On November 14, 2011, Danforth filed a complaint in Providence County Superior Court, which was subsequently amended on December 5, 2011. In her amended complaint, Danforth alleged breach of contract (count 1), requesting that she be allowed to retain the Mores’ deposit in the amount of $30,000. In addition, she sought declaratory relief (count 2), asking the court to “construe the terms of the [PSA] and to order Attorney Davis, the escrow agent, to disburse the [deposit] to Ms. Danforth.” Finally, the amended complaint also asserted a request 1', 'From an email exchange between More and Davis, it can be gleaned that October 17, 2011, would be the latest date on which the closing was scheduled to occur. Specifically, Davis sent an email to More indicating that he would like to schedule the closing for October 14, 2011. In reply, More indicated that his “preference is to close Monday [October 17, 2011,] * * * just to give us another day to make sure the paper work is in place.” There is no evidence that the closing was extended beyond this date. 2', 'The property was later sold to a third party in December 2011 for $ 670,000.', '-4- for attorney’s fees (count 3), because—according to Danforth—the Mores were defending the action “in the complete absence of any justiciable issue of either law or fact.”', 'On December 19, 2011, the Mores filed an answer, in which they claimed that they “had no obligation to purchase the [property] because of [Danforth]’s failure to repair termite damage and vandalism damage that occurred after the inspection date and the closing date specified in the [PSA] and further assert[ed] that [Danforth] did not tender performance on the closing date.” In addition, the Mores asserted as a counterclaim that More advised Danforth by an email sent on April 7, 2011, that her “‘immediate attention’ was required for termites” and that this matter “needed to be fixed or repaired.” The Mores further asserted that, after executing the PSA, the front door had been damaged during an attempted break-in. The Mores claimed that this damage to the property resulted in a breach to the contract because—in their view—the PSA required the property to be delivered in the same condition that it was in when the PSA was executed.', 'In due course, Danforth filed a motion for summary judgment, to which the Mores filed a written objection. 3 At the hearing on the motion for summary judgment, the hearing justice determined that the PSA required termination by April 4, 2011, and not only did the Mores fail to terminate the PSA by that date, but they “never attempted to use the termite issue or the door issue as a reason to cease their obligations under the [PSA].” Accordingly, the hearing justice granted Danforth’s motion for summary judgment. Additionally, the hearing justice went on to consider Danforth’s request for attorney’s fees and concluded that, although he did not find merit in the Mores’ argument, “the issue of termites and the issue of the door was something that was 3', 'Timothy More, acting pro se and serving as his wife’s attorney, did not appear for the hearing on the motion for summary judgment. After noting that the court did have the benefit of More’s written objection and memorandum, the hearing justice considered the motion in his absence.', '-5- raised through e-mail, although not as a reason to terminate. * * * But it was an issue that was ongoing[.]” Accordingly, he denied Danforth’s request for attorney’s fees.', 'On January 18, 2013, the hearing justice entered an order granting Danforth’s motion for summary judgment on counts 1 and 2 of her complaint and on the Mores’ counterclaim. The order stated that Danforth was entitled to retain the $30,000 deposit, awarded prejudgment interest on that amount, and denied Danforth’s request for attorney’s fees. On February 6, 2013, Danforth filed a motion for entry of final judgment, to which the Mores objected. At the hearing on this motion, the parties disputed whether prejudgment interest was applicable and requested clarification as to the time period for calculating prejudgment interest. On March 1, 2013, the hearing justice entered judgment in favor of Danforth, which order stated that the applicable time period for calculating prejudgment interest was from October 17, 2011 (the date of the scheduled closing) until January 28, 2013 (the date that More authorized Davis to release the deposit to Danforth). Both parties timely appealed; in particular, Danforth appealed the denial of attorney’s fees, and More appealed 4 the grant of summary judgment and award of prejudgment interest.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'In reviewing the granting of a motion for summary judgment, this Court engages in a de novo review, “apply[ing] the same standards and rules as did the motion justice.” Narragansett Indian Tribe v. State, 81 A.3d 1106, 1109 (R.I. 2014) (quoting Beauregard v. Gouin, 66 A.3d 489, 493 (R.I. 2013)). In so doing, “[w]e view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.” Id. We will affirm a hearing justice’s grant of a motion for summary judgment “if there exists no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to 4', 'Notably, Timothy More is the only defendant that has pursued the appeal currently before us.', '-6- judgment as a matter of law.” Takian v. Rafaelian, 53 A.3d 964, 970 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Classic Entertainment & Sports, Inc. v. Pemberton, 988 A.2d 847, 849 (R.I. 2010)). “The nonmoving party bears the burden of showing the existence of disputed issues of material fact by competent evidence; it cannot rest on allegations or denials in the pleadings or on conclusions or legal opinions.” Id. at 971 (quoting Zanni v. Voccola, 13 A.3d 1068, 1071 (R.I. 2011)).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, each party has dug its trenches and lobbed various arguments across the battlegrounds. More mounts a two-pronged attack. First, he argues that the hearing justice erred in granting Danforth’s motion for summary judgment because there was a genuine issue of material fact “as to whether the [property] was in the same condition on the closing date as it was on the date the [PSA] was executed.” Second, More asserts that the hearing justice erred in awarding Danforth prejudgment interest because the deposit was in the physical possession of Danforth’s attorney during the period for which interest was awarded and—according to More— the suit was not a suit for pecuniary damages as required by G.L. 1956 § 9-21-10. In her counter attack, Danforth argues that the hearing justice wrongfully declined her request for attorney’s fees because the Mores “raised no justiciable issue of law or fact to the claims asserted by [Danforth].” We consider each of these arguments in turn.', 'A', 'Summary Judgment', 'Our inquiry starts with the propriety of the hearing justice’s grant of Danforth’s motion for summary judgment. More points to a single issue of material fact which he contends should have precluded the grant of Danforth’s motion. Specifically, he cites to evidence of the presence', '-7- of termites and vandalism related to an attempted break-in and contends that a material fact existed as to whether the property was in the same condition on the date of the closing as it was on the date that the PSA was executed.', '“It has long been established that when concurrent acts are to be performed by the parties to a contract, the party bringing suit for breach need only aver that he or she was ready and willing to perform and that the alleged breacher was requested to perform but refused.” Kottis v. Cerilli, 612 A.2d 661, 663-64 (R.I. 1992). “When the party alleging the breach demands the other’s performance of the concurrent act, an offer to perform on the part of the alleging party is implied and understood.” Id. at 664. It is not necessary that the party alleging the breach actually perform; instead, “notice of his or her readiness to perform constitutes and implies tender.” Id.', 'In the case at hand, the email correspondence between More and Davis make clear that Danforth was ready and willing to perform on the closing date, but that the Mores were not. Specifically, on September 12, 2011, More sent Davis an email indicating that he was having difficulty selling their current house and requested an extension of the closing date to December 1, 2011. After negotiations regarding an extension of the closing date turned out to be fruitless, the parties settled on a closing date of October 17, 2011. On October 18, 2011, after the Mores failed to appear at the closing, Davis sent More an email notifying him that they were in default pursuant to the terms of the PSA. Based on this email correspondence, we conclude that Danforth’s act of attending the closing constituted sufficient tender of performance and can support her contract claim.', 'Nevertheless, More claims that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the presence of termites and the damaged front door rendered Danforth in breach of the PSA. In', '-8- support of this contention, More points to the following “Conditions of Premises” provision of the PSA:', '“Possession of the [property], free of all tenants, shall be delivered by [Danforth]', 'to the [Mores] at Closing and the [property] shall be then in the same condition in', 'which they are now, reasonable use and wear of the Fixtures and buildings', 'thereon and of any Personal Property and damage by fire and other unavoidable', 'casualty excepted. OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS', 'AGREEMENT, THE BUYER AGREES THAT HE HAS INSPECTED THE', 'PREMISES, FIXTURES AND PERSONAL PROPERTY, AND HE IS', 'PURCHASING THE SAME ‘AS IS’ * * *.” More claims that the presence of the aforementioned defects prevented Danforth from delivering the property in the same condition that it was in at the time that the PSA was executed. We consider each of these alleged maladies separately.', 'Turning first to the alleged damage to the front door resulting from the presumed attempted break-in, we note that this “Conditions of Premises” provision, by its very terms, offers no recourse to More. While the provision required the property to be delivered in the same condition that it was in when the PSA was executed, it also provided that “damage by fire and other unavoidable casualty [was] excepted.” (Emphasis added.) Here, the Mores provided no evidence to suggest that the damage from the attempted break-in was somehow avoidable. Instead, damage from an attempted break-in falls squarely within the classification of “other unavoidable casualty.” Accordingly, the presence of damage to the front door did not present a genuine issue of material fact to preclude summary judgment.', 'We next turn our inquiry to the alleged presence of termites. Despite More’s assertion to the contrary, the “Conditions of Premises” provision also offers no recourse to him with regard to any potential termite damage; instead, the PSA provided a separate escape hatch for the Mores:', 'if they found the property to have any unsatisfactory condition by the inspection contingency date, they could—upon notification to Danforth—treat the PSA as null and void.', '-9- Indeed, the PSA specifically provided that “[t]he [Mores] may, at [their] expense, have the [property] inspected for * * * termites” and elect to terminate the agreement if the inspection is “not satisfactory to the [Mores] for any reason.” To invoke this provision, the PSA required that the Mores notify Danforth in writing by April 4, 2011, the inspection contingency date. The PSA further provided that time was of the essence with respect to the inspection contingency date and that the Mores’ right to terminate the PSA was their sole remedy under the section. However, the Mores neglected to have the property inspected until April 7, 2011. While this inspection ultimately exposed the presence of termites, their right to terminate the contract due to termite damage had already expired, as they had neglected to inspect the property and notify Danforth of the damage prior to the inspection contingency date. 5 By failing to avail themselves of the opportunity presented in the PSA to inspect for termite damage, the Mores relinquished any right to base a claim on such damage. Thus, the alleged presence of termites also did not preclude summary judgment.', 'Accordingly, we hold that the hearing justice did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of Danforth.', 'B', 'Prejudgment Interest', 'Having determined that summary judgment was appropriate, our inquiry now turns to whether prejudgment interest on the coveted deposit was properly awarded. More asserts that prejudgment interest should not have been awarded because the Mores received no benefit from the deposit during the period for which prejudgment interest was awarded, as they did not have access to it. In support of this contention, he argues that the deposit was in the physical 5', 'In addition, we note that, even after the discovery of the termites, the Mores indicated that they were willing to proceed with the sale despite the defect.', '- 10 - possession of Danforth’s escrow agent and opines that he was under no obligation to sign the release requested by Danforth.', 'Alternatively, More contends that prejudgment interest is inappropriate in this case because—according to More—the case at hand is either a declaratory judgment action or is otherwise equitable in nature and not a suit for pecuniary damages, as required by § 9-21-10(a). Danforth responds that prejudgment interest was appropriate because summary judgment was awarded on the breach of contract count in addition to the declaratory judgment count.', 'The prejudgment interest statute, § 9-21-10(a), provides, in relevant part: “In any civil action in which a verdict is rendered or a decision made for pecuniary damages, there shall be added by the clerk of the court to the amount of damages interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum thereon from the date the cause of action accrued, which shall be included in the judgment entered therein.” Particularly pertinent to the case at hand, our case law has created various dividing lines with regard to whether a certain claim constitutes “pecuniary damages” within the meaning of § 9-21-10(a). We consider two of these distinctions as they relate to the case before us.', 'First, we have recognized that “[t]he return of a deposit is simply a reimbursement rather than an award of pecuniary damages, and thus the [prevailing party is] not entitled to the addition of statutory interest.” Andrews v. Plouff, 66 A.3d 840, 843 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Bogosian v. Bederman, 823 A.2d 1117, 1121 (R.I. 2003)). In creating this distinction, however, we were careful to note that “our holding [did] not preclude every plaintiff from recovering prejudgment interest whenever a deposit is at issue. For example, if a plaintiff were awarded damages in a breach of contract case involving a deposit, then that plaintiff might well be entitled to statutory interest under * * * § 9-21-10(a).”', 'Andrews, 66 A.3d at 843 n.2.', 'The case before us', '- 11 - unquestionably does not involve the return of a deposit, but, instead, involves the retention of a deposit as a form of damages, as this was Danforth’s sole remedial measure under the PSA. Thus, the mere fact that a deposit was involved does not preclude Danforth from recovering statutory interest.', 'Second, in another context, we held that “[a] determination of benefits, by way of a declaratory judgment, was not an award of damages[,]” and, therefore, the prevailing party in such a case “is not entitled to prejudgment interest.” Fravala v. City of Cranston ex rel. Baron, 996 A.2d 696, 708 (R.I. 2010). More argues that the suit before us was declaratory in nature and, therefore, prejudgment interest cannot be awarded.', 'However, Danforth’s complaint included both a breach of contract claim and an action for declaratory judgment. In ruling on Danforth’s summary judgment motion, the hearing justice specifically found that the Mores did not comply with the terms of the PSA. Accordingly, because there was a breach of contract claim before the hearing justice and the Mores were found to have breached the terms of the PSA, prejudgment interest was appropriately awarded. See Turacova v. DeThomas, 45 A.3d 509, 517 (R.I. 2012).', 'In his final attack, More asserts that prejudgment interest would be improper because Danforth’s escrow agent was in physical possession of the deposit and he was under no obligation to sign a release to allow it to be turned over to Danforth.', 'He suggests that prejudgment interest should not be awarded because the Mores were not in possession of the deposit and, thus, received no benefit from it. While More’s argument is admittedly creative, it must fail.', 'This Court has consistently recognized that imposition of prejudgment interest pursuant to Rhode Island’s prejudgment interest statute “is a ministerial act which does not allow for any discretion by the judge or the jury.” King v. Huntress, Inc., 94 A.3d 467, 499-500 (R.I.', '- 12 - 2014). Further, we have stated that “[t]he dual purpose of prejudgment interest is to encourage early settlement of claims and to compensate an injured plaintiff for delay in receiving compensation to which he or she may be entitled.” Oden v. Schwartz, 71 A.3d 438, 457 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Metropolitan Property & Casualty Insurance Co. v. Barry, 892 A.2d 915, 919 (R.I. 2006)). More’s position places the shoe on the wrong foot: The focus of prejudgment interest is not on a defendant’s ability to benefit from the money, but, rather, on the plaintiff’s delay in receiving compensation. See id. During the time in which the deposit remained in Davis’s account as Danforth’s escrow agent—that is, until the Mores executed written releases— Danforth did not have access to the compensation to which she was entitled. Under such circumstances, prejudgment interest was appropriately awarded. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial justice did not err in awarding prejudgment interest to Danforth pursuant to § 9-21-10(a).', 'C', 'Attorney’s Fees', 'We turn now to Danforth’s contention that attorney’s fees were improperly denied. Danforth contends that she is entitled to attorney’s fees because the Mores breached the PSA when they failed to close on the scheduled closing date and because the Mores had no legal or factual justification for contesting such breach.', ""This Court has “staunch[ly] adhere[d] to the ‘American rule’ that requires each litigant to pay its own attorney's fees absent statutory authority or contractual liability.” Shine v. Moreau, 119 A.3d 1, 8 (R.I. 2015) (quoting Moore v. Ballard, 914 A.2d 487, 489 (R.I. 2007)). However, in certain circumstances, the Legislature has determined that attorney’s fees should be available to the prevailing litigant. One such circumstance is provided in G.L. 1956 § 9-1-45(1), which provides that a trial justice may award reasonable attorney’s fees to a prevailing party “in any"", '- 13 - civil action arising from a breach of contract in which the court * * * [f]inds that there was a complete absence of a justiciable issue of either law or fact raised by the losing party[.]”', 'We have recognized that “[t]he issue of whether there exists a basis for awarding attorneys’ fees generally is legal in nature, and therefore our review of such a ruling is de novo.” Shine, 119 A.3d at 8 (quoting Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island v. Najarian, 911 A.2d 706, 709 (R.I. 2006)). If it is determined that there is an adequate legal basis for such an award, then we review a trial justice’s decision awarding or denying attorneys’ fees for an abuse of discretion. Id. The parties do not dispute that § 9-1-45 provides an adequate basis for an award of attorney’s fees; thus, we review the trial justice’s decision denying such fees under an abuse of discretion rubric. In so doing, we remain mindful that the decision to grant or deny attorney’s fees is vested within the sound discretion of the trial justice. See Greensleeves, Inc. v. Smiley, 754 A.2d 102, 103 (R.I. 2000) (mem.); Bucci v. Anthony, 667 A.2d 1254, 1256 (R.I. 1995).', 'In light of the discretion due to the hearing justice, we need not loiter long over this assignment of error. He determined that the termite problem and damage to the door presented justiciable issues, even though he ultimately concluded that More’s arguments in that regard were meritless. We agree, and so cannot conclude that the hearing justice’s determination was an abuse of his considerable discretion. Accordingly, we perceive no error in the hearing justice’s denial of attorneys’ fees.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the Superior Court’s judgment in all respects.

In this matter, we are faced with determining whether a wind turbine is exempt from local property taxation. The defendant, Linda Cwiek, in her capacity as Tax Assessor for the Town of North Kingstown (the town or defendant), appeals from an order granting summary judgment against her and in favor of Mark and June DePasquale (the DePasquales or plaintiffs). On December 10, 2015, this case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised should not be summarily decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and reviewing the memoranda submitted on behalf of the parties, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown. Accordingly, we shall decide the appeal at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The facts of this case are straightforward and undisputed. In 2011, the DePasquales allowed a wind turbine to be built 1 on their property located at 42 Thorton Way in North Kingstown, Rhode Island. This turbine produces electricity which is sold directly to National Grid pursuant to a standard Power Purchase Agreement, conforming with G.L. 1956 chapter 26.2 of title 39. Importantly, none of the electricity produced by this wind turbine is sold to the public.', 'On December 31, 2012, the town assessed the DePasquale wind turbine at a value of $1.9 million and issued a tax bill seeking the payment of annual tangible personal property taxes. The DePasquales took the position that the wind turbine was tax-exempt and, on that basis, appealed the assessment to the North Kingstown Tax Assessor and then to the North Kingstown Tax Board of Review, both of which denied their appeal. On March 5, 2014, the DePasquales filed the instant action in Superior Court and, after some discovery was conducted, filed a motion for summary judgment. After hearing argument from both parties, the hearing justice concluded that, based on her interpretation of the statutes and applicable case law, “[the] wind turbine must be determined to be manufacturing equipment that is exempt from taxation.” Accordingly, the hearing justice granted the DePasquales’ motion for summary judgment. The town timely appealed to this Court. 1', 'This turbine is owned by WED NK Green, LLC, of which Mark DePasquale is the only member.

While summary judgment is a drastic remedy, it is nevertheless appropriate when, “viewing the facts and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, the court determines that there are no issues of material fact in dispute, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Id.

To qualify for the exemption listed in § 44-3-3(22)(i), machinery and equipment must be “used exclusively in the actual manufacture or conversion of raw materials or goods in the process of manufacture by a manufacturer[,] * * * [or] used exclusively by a manufacturer for research and development or for quality assurance of its manufactured products[.]” Section 44-3-3(22) refers to § 44-3- 3(20)(i) to provide the definition of a manufacturer, which provides, in pertinent part:', '“[A] person is deemed to be a manufacturer within a city or town within this state', 'if that person uses any premises, room, or place in it primarily for the purpose of', 'transforming raw materials into a finished product for trade through any or all of', 'the following operations: adapting, altering, finishing, making, and ornamenting;', '-3-', 'provided, that public utilities, non-regulated power producers commencing', 'commercial operation by selling electricity at retail or taking title to generating', 'facilities on or after July 1, 1997[,] * * * are excluded from this definition[.]”', 'Section 44-3-3(20)(i). In other words, if the DePasquale wind turbine transforms raw materials into a finished product through “adapting, altering, finishing, making, [or] ornamenting[,]” id., then it is exempt from taxation, unless the turbine is deemed to be a public utility or a non-regulated power producer that commenced operation by selling electricity at retail or taking title to the generating facility on or after July 1, 1997.', 'The first question presented to this Court is whether the DePasquales meet the definition of manufacturer set forth in § 44-3-3(20), thus giving the turbine tax-exempt status. It appears to be uncontested that the wind turbine is used exclusively for the purpose of transforming raw materials—namely, wind—into a finished product—namely, electricity.', 'Thus, the only remaining issue is whether the DePasquale wind turbine falls within the exclusion to the definition. However, the town conceded below that the DePasquale wind turbine is not a public utility and is not a non-regulated power producer selling electricity at retail. 2', 'Before this Court, the town argues that the manufacturing equipment exemption is inapplicable because the DePasquales’ sale of electricity from the turbine to National Grid constitutes a “sale at wholesale” which—the town contends—places the turbine within the exclusion from the definition of manufacturing equipment. 3 The town appears to have plucked 2', 'Notably, the town has not presented any argument—either before this Court or below—with regard to whether the portion of the statutory provision that excludes “non-regulated power producers * * * taking title to generating facilities on or after July 1, 1997[,]” G.L. 1956 § 44-3- 3(20)(i), is applicable to the DePasquale wind turbine. Thus, any argument in that regard is deemed waived. See Peloquin v. Haven Health Center of Greenville, LLC, 61 A.3d 419, 430-31 (R.I. 2013). 3', 'Because we conclude that the town’s argument is meritless, we need not address whether it was waived below. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that the only reference to this argument below', ""-4- this “sale at wholesale” language from the definition of non-regulated power producer in G.L. 1956 § 39-1-2(19). Specifically, § 39-1-2(19) provides, in pertinent part: “‘Nonregulated power producer’ means a company engaging in the business of producing, manufacturing, generating, buying, aggregating, marketing or brokering electricity for sale at wholesale or for retail sale to the public * * *.” However, the specific language of the exemption provided in § 44-3-3(20) does not exclude from it all non-regulated power producers as would be required to render the town’s argument worth merit. Rather, § 44-3-3(20) excludes from exemption only those “non- regulated power producers commencing commercial operation by selling electricity at retail or taking title to generating facilities on or after July 1, 1997[.]” In excluding only certain non- regulated power producers, § 44-3-3(20) is unambiguous; and, thus, we must give effect to the plain and ordinary meaning of its terms. See Olamuyiwa v. Zebra Atlantek, Inc., 45 A.3d 527, 534 (R.I. 2012) (“It is a well-established principle of statutory interpretation that ‘when the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, this Court must interpret the statute literally and must give the words of the statute their plain and ordinary meanings.’” (quoting Planned Environments Management Corp. v. Robert, 966 A.2d 117, 121 (R.I. 2009))). In drafting the exemption in this way, the Legislature chose to exclude from it only certain types of non- regulated power producers from property taxation. See id. (“In reviewing the language of a statute, ‘our ultimate goal is to give effect to the General Assembly's intent,’ and we have repeatedly observed that ‘[t]he plain statutory language is the best indicator of [such] intent.’” (quoting DeMarco v. Travelers Insurance Co., 26 A.3d 585, 616 (R.I. 2011))). Given that those was made by the trial justice in a colloquy with counsel for the DePasquales. We note that the town’s failure to press this argument below may have resulted in it being deemed waived, as it is questionable whether the hearing justice’s passing reference was sufficient to preserve the issue for appeal. See Peloquin, 61 A.3d at 430-31 (concluding that, pursuant to our well-settled “raise- or-waive” rule, an argument not presented when a party moved for summary judgment was deemed waived and not preserved for this Court’s review)."", '-5- brokering electricity “for sale at wholesale” were not included in this exclusion from the exemption, we find the town’s argument unconvincing.', 'The town’s second and final contention is based on § 44-3-21, which provides that “[t]he city or town councils of the various cities and towns may, by ordinance, exempt from taxation any renewable energy system located in the city or town.”', 'Citing that statute, the town argues that renewable energy systems are exempt from taxation only if a particular municipality enacts an ordinance to exempt them from taxation. In support, the town argues that § 44-3-21 reflects the legislative intent that renewable energy systems are generally taxable and that, in adopting this statute, the Legislature has given municipalities the authority to exempt such systems from taxation should the municipality desire to do so.', 'However, contrary to the town’s suggestion, § 44-3-21 merely grants the various cities and towns the authority to grant tax exemption to renewable energy systems in addition to the tax exemptions already provided within § 44-3-3. By no stretch can the language of § 44-3-21 be construed to suggest that the Legislature intended renewable energy systems to be exempt only if the various cities and towns enact such ordinances. Further, such an interpretation would render § 44-3-21 inconsistent with § 44-3-3, which, in defining “manufacturer,” expressly creates an exception for public utilities and certain non-regulated power producers. We note that “‘statutes relating to the same subject matter should be considered together so that they will harmonize with each other and be consistent’ with their general objective scope.” South County Post & Beam, Inc. v. McMahon, 116 A.3d 204, 215 (R.I. 2015) (quoting Such v. State, 950 A.2d 1150, 1156 (R.I. 2008)).

Here, the terms of § 44-3-21 and § 44-3-3 are consistent. Specifically, § 44-3-3 requires that certain property, including certain non-regulated power producers, be exempt from property tax; at the same time, § 44-3-21 permits a municipality to exempt from taxation renewable energy systems that may otherwise be taxable. Accordingly, in light of the language provided in § 44-3- 21, and reading it in conjunction with § 44-3-3, we cannot accept the town’s interpretation that renewable energy systems are exempted from taxation only upon municipal ordinance.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

The City of Pawtucket, its school department, and its school committee (collectively, defendants)1 appeal from a grant of summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs,2 sixteen retirees from nonteaching union positions with the school department. The plaintiffs had sought reimbursement of the health insurance co-payments that they paid after the defendants allegedly breached a series of collective-bargaining agreements (CBAs). This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issue raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further 1', 'The City of Pawtucket School Department was named a defendant by and through its superintendent, Patricia DiCenso; the Pawtucket School Committee was named a defendant by and through its members Michael Araujo, Gerard Charbonneau, Katherine McQuade, Kimberly Grant, Joseph Knight, and Erin Dube; and the City of Pawtucket was named a defendant by and through its finance director, Ronald F.

At the time of each plaintiff’s retirement, a CBA was in place between the union and the school committee. Because the sixteen plaintiffs retired over a period of eight years, they retired while four different CBAs were in effect.3 The health insurance benefits were provided in Article 19, and these benefits did not change from one CBA to the next. Article 19.5 of each CBA stated, in its entirety:', '“Upon retirement, an employee who has reached the age of fifty-', 'eight (58) years or more, and has been a member of the Pawtucket', 'School Department staff fifteen (15) years or more shall receive', 'Family coverage under Blue Cross/Blue Shield and Delta Dental', 'plans. This benefit shall extend until the retired employee is', 'eligible for coverage under Medicare.”', 'Until August 2007, plaintiffs were not required to contribute any co-payments related to their health insurance benefits.', 'Individuals who were actively employed by the school department also received fully-paid health insurance until August 2007, when an arbitrator ruled that active nonteaching employees should contribute to the cost of the health insurance policies.

Article 19 of 2007-2010 CBA contained a new provision; pursuant to Article 19.10, “bargaining unit employees” were required to contribute co- payments toward their health and dental insurance. Article 19.5 remained the same in the 2007- 2010 CBA, but the school department began billing plaintiffs for health insurance co-payments, and at least ten plaintiffs paid the co-payments billed to them.', 'The plaintiffs filed a complaint in Superior Court on November 12, 2008, seeking a declaratory judgment pursuant to G.L. 1956 chapter 30 of title 9 that: (1) they were entitled to free health insurance coverage until eligible for Medicare pursuant to the CBA that was in effect at the time of each plaintiff’s respective retirement, (2) defendants breached the CBAs by requiring plaintiffs to contribute to the cost of the health insurance coverage, and (3) defendants were obligated to reimburse plaintiffs for all co-payments paid since August 2007 (collectively, count 1). The complaint also set forth a count for breach of contract, seeking damages in the amount of the co-payments each plaintiff had paid since August 2007 (count 2) and a count for promissory estoppel (count 3).4', 'After the parties submitted memoranda of law addressing plaintiffs’ request for a declaratory judgment, a hearing justice of the Superior Court issued a decision in April 2010 declaring that “[p]laintiff[s’] rights to retiree health insurance benefits vested under the terms of the CBA in effect at the time of each individual’s retirement.” In light of the record before him, however, the hearing justice declined to declare that defendants had breached the CBAs when they billed plaintiffs for the co-payments.', 'Thereafter, plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment on their claims for declaratory judgment and breach of contract, and included, inter alia, a copy of each complete CBA in effect 4', 'The complaint named only the City of Pawtucket School Department (by and through its superintendent) and the school committee (by and through its members) as defendants, but was later amended to include defendant City of Pawtucket (by and through its finance director). The allegations and claims in the amended complaint remained the same as in the original complaint.', '-3- when each plaintiff retired as exhibits in support of their motion. The defendants objected to plaintiffs’ motion and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. A second hearing justice of the Superior Court rendered a decision on January 5, 2012, concluding that the CBAs unambiguously provided plaintiffs with free health and dental insurance as offered at the time of each plaintiff’s respective retirement until each plaintiff reached the age of eligibility for Medicare. The hearing justice granted plaintiffs’ motion, denied defendants’ cross-motion, and ordered a future hearing to assess plaintiffs’ damages. The parties subsequently entered a stipulation regarding the assessment of damages for each plaintiff. Soon thereafter, plaintiffs filed a motion seeking a supplemental order from the court that enjoined defendants from requiring any further payments from them for the maintenance of their health insurance benefits. The court granted plaintiffs’ motion. Final judgment entered in favor of plaintiffs on September 2, 2014 on their motions for: (1) summary judgment on the breach of contract and declaratory judgment claims, (2) assessment of damages, and (3) injunctive relief.5 The defendants timely appealed from the portion of the judgment granting plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“The grant of a motion for summary judgment is reviewed by this Court de novo, employing the same standards and rules used by the hearing justice.” The Law Firm of Thomas A.

Coordinated Health Partners, Inc., 852 A.2d 535, 542 (R.I. 2004)).', 'In the case at bar, each CBA in effect at the time of plaintiffs’ individual retirement dates contained the identical Article 19 entitled “Medical Insurance.” The plain and unambiguous language of Article 19.5 provided that employees “shall receive [f]amily coverage under Blue Cross/Blue Shield and Delta Dental plans” starting when the employee retired and continuing until the retired employee was eligible for Medicare, as long as the employee was at least fifty- eight years old at the time of retirement and had been “a member of the Pawtucket School Department staff” for at least fifteen years. That plaintiffs received this benefit at no cost to them until August 2007 is an undisputed fact. Article 19.5, however, does not contain any language to indicate whether this was a benefit to which retirees were expected to contribute a co-payment if requested, or whether the benefit was intended to provide retirees with free health insurance until they became eligible for Medicare.', 'In plaintiffs’ memorandum of law in support of their motion for summary judgment, they argued that the absence of language in Article 19 indicating that the terms of retiree benefits could change to match a negotiated or arbitrated change to the terms of the active employees’ benefits unambiguously meant that plaintiffs were entitled to free health insurance upon meeting the conditions in Article 19.5. In support of their argument, plaintiffs provided eleven affidavits attesting to the understanding by ten plaintiffs and the union’s business agent that the benefits', '-6- were intended to be provided to retirees at no cost, and had been provided at no cost until August 2007. In defendants’ memorandum of law in opposition to the motion for summary judgment, they argued that the CBAs had not promised plaintiffs free health insurance upon retirement and that past practice demonstrated that retirees were simply entitled to receive benefits according to the same terms as the benefits for active employees. In support of their argument, defendants provided two affidavits from Thomas Conlon, the longtime business administrator for the Pawtucket School Department. Mr. Conlon averred that, from 1996 to 2007, retirees had been permitted to participate in the same health insurance plans offered to the active employees, including plans from companies other than Blue Cross/Blue Shield (e.g., United Health). Mr. Conlon also averred that neither the union nor the school department ever expressed an intent to provide retirees with free medical benefits, but also that, to the best of his recollection, the issue of co-payment had not arisen during negotiations. Since the language of Article 19.5 is silent with respect to whether retirees were to be provided with free health insurance benefits or were expected to pay a co-payment for the benefit, coupled with evidence that the benefits actually provided to plaintiffs did not follow Article 19.5 to the letter, we conclude that Article 19 is “reasonably and clearly susceptible to more than one rational interpretation,” and is, therefore, ambiguous.

It is our opinion, therefore, that an issue of material fact exists regarding whether the defendants breached the CBAs when they billed the plaintiffs in 2007 for the health insurance co-payments. See Inland American Retail Management LLC, 68 A.3d at 465 (“summary judgment is inappropriate where references to extrinsic evidence and the surrounding circumstances must be relied on to discern the intent of the contracting parties”).

I dissent; I do so respectfully, but nonetheless most vigorously. I am entirely unable to reconcile the holding of the majority with fundamental principles of the Anglo-American law of contracts. The agreement before us is, in my judgment, completely clear and totally unambiguous. As such, I read it as imposing absolutely no co- payment requirement on the retirees who are the plaintiffs in this lawsuit.', 'Upon perusing the majority’s opinion, it quickly became clear to me that the underlying premise of the majority’s reasoning is that silence connotes ambiguity. However, there is no warrant in our law for saying that silence somehow creates ambiguity in a case such as the one presently before us. I am not aware of any opinion from this Court that stands for such a proposition, but I am aware that there is explicit language in cases from other jurisdictions that rejects that notion. See, e.g., Consolidated Bearings Co. v. Ehret-Krohn Corp., 913 F.2d 1224, 1233 (7th Cir. 1990) (“Silence creates ambiguity * * * only when the silence involves a matter naturally within the scope of the contract as written.

We are not confronted with a case where the maxim of “necessary implication” applies. The agreement at issue is fully self-explanatory in and of itself. It says what it says; and, it says nothing about a co-payment.', 'Since I consider the agreement at issue to be unambiguous, I next turn to one of the most basic principles of contract law which has been summarized as follows: “Under established contract law principles, when there is an unambiguous contract and no proof of duress or the like, the terms of the contract are to be applied as written.” Gorman v. Gorman, 883 A.2d 732, 739 n.11 (R.I. 2005) (emphasis added); see also Rivera v. Gagnon, 847 A.2d 280, 284 (R.I. 2004). When the terms of the contract at issue are applied as written, it is immediately clear that there is no requirement that plaintiffs pay a co-payment for their medical care.', 'The City of Pawtucket may have belatedly come to believe that its agreement with the retirees was overly generous.

For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Beginning in November 2007, Kirshenbaum represented Behroozi in post-final judgment divorce proceedings to recover arrearages in alimony payments owed to Behroozi by her ex-', '-1- husband. 1 In June 2009, Kirshenbaum withdrew as counsel with the Family Court’s approval.2 On April 13, 2012, Behroozi filed a complaint in Providence County Superior Court against Kirshenbaum, which she later amended, setting forth claims for legal malpractice, negligence, fraud, and breach of fiduciary duty.', 'After much back and forth between the parties and copious orders in the trial court, 3 on May 15, 2014, Kirshenbaum filed a motion for summary judgment as to Behroozi’s claims. He argued that, based on Behroozi’s representation to the court that she did not intend to engage an expert witness to testify with regard to her malpractice claims, she was unable as a matter of law to establish the applicable standard of care and a breach thereof, as is required to support a legal malpractice claim. He further argued that Behroozi’s malpractice claims were barred by the three-year statute of limitations.', 'Kirshenbaum also argued that Behroozi’s fraud and misrepresentation claims must fail because the allegedly fraudulent statements were made to the Family Court and not to Behroozi herself.', 'On June 16, 2014, the hearing justice heard the parties on Kirshenbaum’s motion for summary judgment. As to Behroozi’s malpractice claims, the hearing justice noted that this Court has required the need for a legal expert to establish the standard of care applicable to a lawyer and a breach of that standard. Given that Behroozi indicated that she had no intention of calling an expert witness, the hearing justice granted Kirshenbaum’s motion for summary judgment pertaining to Behroozi’s claims for malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty. Even 1', 'Behroozi retained Kirshenbaum through a volunteer lawyer program. 2', 'The Family Court heard Kirshenbaum on his motion to withdraw on June 4, 2009. An order reflecting the same was dated June 9, 2009; but, significantly, the order was not signed by the Family Court judge until June 23, 2009. 3', 'The Superior Court docket sheet for this case from its inception in April 2012 to its certification to this Court in January 2015 is seventeen pages long and contains entries for more than six dozen different orders.', '-2- further, the hearing justice went on to find that these claims were also barred by the statute of limitations, and that Behroozi had not demonstrated that the discovery rule should toll the limitations period because she was aware of and even complained about Kirshenbaum’s alleged wrongdoings during the course of his representation.', 'The hearing justice also granted Kirshenbaum’s motion for summary judgment on Behroozi’s fraud claim, finding both that the claim was barred by the statute of limitations and that the statements Behroozi was relying on as the bases for her claim were not sufficient to establish fraud because they were made to the Family Court and not to her directly.', 'Final judgment was entered in favor of Kirshenbaum on June 24, 2014. Behroozi timely filed a notice of appeal on July 1, 2014.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“[T]his Court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo.” Carlson v. Town of South Kingstown, 111 A.3d 819, 822 (R.I. 2015) (quoting Allstate Insurance Co. v. Ahlquist, 59 A.3d 95, 97 (R.I. 2013)). “Our function is to review ‘the evidence in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and we will affirm the judgment if we conclude that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.’” Id. (quoting Berman v. Sitrin, 991 A.2d 1038, 1043 (R.I. 2010)). “We have long recognized that ‘[s]ummary judgment is a drastic remedy, and * * * should be dealt with cautiously.’” Laplante v. Rhode Island Hospital, 110 A.3d 261, 264 (R.I. 2015) (quoting Beauregard v. Gouin, 66 A.3d 489, 493 (R.I. 2013)). “On the other hand, this Court has also clearly stated that ‘we will not hesitate to affirm a grant of summary judgment if the nonmoving party fails to make a showing', '-3- sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party’s case * * *.’” Id. (quoting Beauregard, 66 A.3d at 493).', 'III', 'Analysis', 'From what we can discern from Behroozi’s written submissions and oral argument, she raises three issues on appeal. First, Behroozi argues that the Superior Court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Kirshenbaum because the discovery rule and/or the doctrine of continuing representation tolls the statute of limitations in this scenario and because expert testimony was not necessary to support her claim for legal malpractice. Second, Behroozi claims that venue was improperly transferred from Providence County to Washington County when the case was assigned to a single hearing justice following Kirshenbaum’s motion for a protective order. Last, Behroozi claims that the hearing justice erred by ordering her to submit her medical records in response to Kirshenbaum’s discovery request. 4', 'a.', 'Behroozi’s Legal Malpractice and Fraud Claims', 'i.', 'Statute of Limitations', 'General Laws 1956 § 9-1-14.3 sets forth a three-year statute of limitations for legal malpractice claims. 5 See Sharkey v. Prescott, 19 A.3d 62, 66 (R.I. 2011). Behroozi retained Kirshenbaum sometime in November 2007, and he represented her until he withdrew in June 2009. However, Behroozi did not file her complaint until April 13, 2012. Therefore, any claims based on Kirshenbaum’s representation prior to April 13, 2009, are barred by the three-year 4', 'Behroozi also asks that we impose monetary sanctions on two Superior Court justices involved in this case and on Kirshenbaum’s attorneys. 5', 'General Laws 1956 § 9-1-14.3 provides, in pertinent part, that “an action for legal malpractice shall be commenced within three (3) years of the occurrence of the incident which gave rise to the action * * *.”', '-4- statute of limitations. The only viable timeframe within which Behroozi can base any of her malpractice claims is from April 13, 2009, through June 23, 2009, when the order entered allowing Kirshenbaum to withdraw as counsel. A review of the record shows that the only action taken during that period of time revolved around Kirshenbaum’s withdrawal as counsel.', 'Furthermore, in this context, Behroozi’s claim for fraud—which centers on alleged misrepresentations Kirshenbaum made to the Family Court, particularly with regard to her ex- husband’s income and the amount of alimony owed to her—is also subject to the three-year statute of limitations for a malpractice action because the fraud she alleges arises from her professional relationship with Kirshenbaum. See Martin v. Howard, 784 A.2d 291, 302 (R.I. 2001) (noting that the plaintiff’s fraud claim arose out of her personal injury claim, and thus was subject to the three-year statute of limitations for personal injury actions versus the ten-year statute of limitations for fraud). Thus, her fraud claim is barred by the statute of limitations as well. 6', 'Behroozi posits that she “did not appreciate that she had an [sic] legal malpractice claim against the defendant at the time of the occurrences” and seemingly attempts to invoke the 6', 'We note that Behroozi’s fraud claim, standing alone, also fails in two much more rudimentary respects. First, she did not rely on any of the allegedly fraudulent statements made by Kirshenbaum to the Family Court; to the contrary, she continually challenged Kirshenbaum on those issues. Because Behroozi cannot show she relied on the purportedly fraudulent statements, she cannot establish a prima facie fraud claim. See Parker v. Byrne, 996 A.2d 627, 634 (R.I. 2010) (“To establish a prima facie fraud claim, ‘the plaintiff must prove that the defendant made a false representation intending thereby to induce [the] plaintiff to rely thereon and that the plaintiff justifiably relied thereon to his or her damage.’” (quoting Bitting v. Gray, 897 A.2d 25, 34 (R.I. 2006))). Moreover, Behroozi has failed to produce any evidence—beyond mere allegations—to substantiate her claim that Kirshenbaum made any fraudulent misrepresentations to the Family Court. “[A] party ‘opposing a motion for summary judgment has the burden of proving by competent evidence the existence of a disputed issue of material fact and cannot rest upon mere allegations * * * in the pleadings, mere conclusions, or mere legal opinions.’” Toegemann v. City of Providence, 21 A.3d 384, 386 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Poulin v. Custom Craft, Inc., 996 A.2d 654, 658 (R.I. 2010)).', '-5- discovery-rule exception to the statute of limitations. “The discovery-rule exception serves ‘to protect individuals suffering from latent or undiscoverable injuries who then seek legal redress after the statute of limitations has expired for a particular claim.’’’ Sharkey, 19 A.3d at 66 (quoting Canavan v. Lovett, Schefrin and Harnett, 862 A.2d 778, 783 (R.I. 2004)).', '“The standard applied to this exception is objective: [I]t ‘requires only that the plaintiff be aware of facts that would place a reasonable person on notice that a potential claim exists.’” Id. (quoting Canavan, 862 A.2d at 784). As the trial justice pointed out, Behroozi continuously questioned Kirshenbaum about the adequacy of his representation, particularly with regard to Kirshenbaum’s accounting of her ex-husband’s income for purposes of calculating how much alimony was owed to her. Behroozi was clearly “aware of facts” that would lead her to believe she had a potential malpractice claim, and the trial justice did not err in concluding that the discovery rule did not toll the statute of limitations in this scenario.', 'For the first time on appeal, Behroozi also argues that the doctrine of continuing representation tolls the statute of limitations on her malpractice claims. “[I]n jurisdictions where [the continuing representation doctrine] applies, that doctrine, which ‘recognizes that a person seeking professional assistance has a right to repose confidence in the professional’s ability and good faith,’ * * * ‘tolls the statute of limitations while the defendant attorney [in a malpractice case] continues to represent the plaintiff.’” Mendes v. Factor, 41 A.3d 994, 1005 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Feddersen v. Garvey, 427 F.3d 108, 114 (1st Cir. 2005)). We need not delve into whether the continuing representation doctrine applies in this scenario because this Court has not adopted it. See id. Furthermore, because Behroozi never presented this particular argument to the hearing justice, in accordance with our well-settled raise-or-waive rule, her argument as to', '-6- this point is deemed to be waived. See, e.g., Warwick Housing Authority v. McLeod, 913 A.2d 1033, 1037 (R.I. 2007).', 'ii.', 'Need for Expert Testimony', 'More significantly, Behroozi’s malpractice claims necessarily fail because she has not retained an expert witness to testify in support of her case. On many occasions we have stated that “in a legal malpractice action, a plaintiff opposing a motion for summary judgment generally must present expert evidence, in the form of an affidavit or otherwise, establishing the standard of care.” Ahmed v. Pannone, 779 A.2d 630, 633 (R.I. 2001). It is undisputed that Behroozi has not produced any expert testimony to establish the standard of care purportedly applicable to Kirshenbaum’s representation; indeed, it is her contention that she need not provide any expert testimony because the “conduct and misrepresentations to [Behroozi] are so obvious * * * [that n]o specialized knowledge is needed for the trier of fact to understand the evidence or determine a fact at issue.” We disagree. Behroozi is correct in that there is an exception to the general rule requiring expert testimony to establish the standard of care “when the malpractice ‘is so obvious that the trier of fact can resolve the issue as a matter of common knowledge.’” Id. at 633 n.1 (quoting Focus Investment Associates, Inc. v. American Title Insurance Co., 992 F.2d 1231, 1239 (1st Cir. 1993)). However, this is not such a scenario. We have previously recognized that family law is a complicated facet of the law and that expert testimony is required to establish the standard of care in a legal malpractice claim in the family law context. See Cronan v. Iwon, 972 A.2d 172, 174 (R.I. 2009) (mem.). As such, summary judgment on Behroozi’s malpractice claims was also appropriate because she has not retained, and has unequivocally stated that she does not intend to retain, an expert witness to testify as to the applicable standard of care and any breach thereof.', '-7-', 'b. Behroozi’s Remaining Claims on Appeal', 'We need not tarry over Behroozi’s remaining claims on appeal. Suffice it to say, they are wholly without merit. First, venue was never transferred in this matter—the pretrial matters simply followed the hearing justice to whom the case had been assigned when she moved from Providence County to Washington County as part of her regular rotation. In addition, given that the hearing justice ultimately granted Behroozi’s motion for a protective order, Kirshenbaum never actually reviewed any of her medical records, rendering her claim as to the discovery order requiring her to produce them moot. See United Service and Allied Workers of Rhode Island v. Rhode Island State Labor Relations Board, 969 A.2d 42, 44 (R.I. 2009) (“[I]f ‘this Court’s judgment would fail to have a practical effect on the existing controversy,’ the question has become moot.” (quoting City of Cranston v. Rhode Island Laborers’ District Council, Local 1033, 960 A.2d 529, 533 (R.I. 2008))).', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

The plaintiff argues that the trial justice erred in denying her motion for a continuance and in dismissing her complaint with prejudice under Rule 41(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment and remand the case for a new trial.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On January 31, 2008, plaintiff filed a complaint in Superior Court against defendants alleging that, on February 6, 2005, she was shopping at the Walgreens store on Broad Street in Cranston when she was hit and injured by a ball that Dias, an employee of Walgreens, had', '-1- thrown. A second amended complaint, filed in June 2013, alleged that Dias had attempted to throw the ball to a co-worker. The case was eventually designated to court annexed arbitration, and an arbitration award was filed, but defendant Walgreen Eastern Co., Inc. rejected the award.1 On October 4, 2012, plaintiff’s attorney was allowed to withdraw and plaintiff proceeded pro se. After plaintiff failed to appear for a pretrial conference on February 22, 2013, her case was dismissed and a judgment entered in favor of defendants. On March 8, 2013, new counsel entered his appearance on behalf of plaintiff. Thereafter, plaintiff moved to vacate the judgment and the order granting same was entered on April 24, 2013.', 'This case was reached for trial on December 9, 2013. On December 10 and 11, 2013, the trial justice heard pretrial motions and held an extensive conference concerning the exhibits for the case, pursuant to Rule 16 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. After the exhibits were labeled, plaintiff’s counsel questioned the trial justice as to why he needed to make copies of the exhibits for the jury. The trial justice responded that during the Rule 16 conference she had “indicated to [plaintiff’s counsel] that [he] needed to get [his] exhibits ready, marked [and] have them here * * * numbered and [his] copies made,” and she reprimanded plaintiff’s counsel because he had not had his exhibits with him the previous day. The trial justice added that plaintiff’s counsel was more than half an hour late to court that day, the exhibits he had with him “were mixed up[, and] weren’t numbered,” and he had brought only one set of copies of the exhibits with him. On the record, the trial justice referenced the last trial she had with plaintiff’s counsel, stating, “we had a dreadful time * * * when I released your exhibits to you so you could have copies made for the jury.” The trial justice explained to plaintiff’s counsel that “[i]t’s to 1', 'In defendants’ prebriefing statement they assert that, following the arbitration, “it appeared that the parties agreed to a settlement,” but that plaintiff “withdrew her consent to settle * * *.” It is clear from the record, however, that defendant Walgreen Eastern Co., Inc. rejected the arbitrator’s award.', '-2- [counsel’s] benefit and [plaintiff’s] benefit to have the jurors really understand the case and to have them have their own copies of the exhibits * * *.” After plaintiff’s counsel stated that he did not have copies for the jury, the trial justice responded: “That’s fine. They’ll have copies of the defense exhibits and not yours. Nothing I can do about that.”2', 'The following day, plaintiff’s counsel arrived to court at approximately 9:50 a.m. When the trial justice inquired why he was late, plaintiff’s counsel responded that “nothing was put on the record * * * as far as what time [c]ourt was supposed to be.” He added, “I asked your clerk * * * [and] [h]e said come around quarter of ten.” The court clerk interjected, stating, “I didn’t say that.” Subsequently, the trial justice responded, “I met with you * * * in my chambers at the end of the day and I told you we had a real time issue with this case if we wanted to get it to trial. I told you to be here first thing at 9:30 * * *.” The trial justice continued to chastise plaintiff’s counsel in open court, stating “you’ve been late every day. You need to satisfy me very quickly that you’re trial ready and we can move this case expeditiously.” The trial justice added, “[y]ou haven’t had your exhibits ready; you’ve made no copies. * * * I need to know if I bring that jury panel in now, I need to know I can get this case finished and not have to declare a mistrial.” The plaintiff’s counsel responded “[y]es,” and the trial continued.', 'After the jury was empaneled and each side gave opening statements, plaintiff’s counsel and the trial justice discussed whether certain witnesses would be providing “live” testimony or whether affidavits would be introduced in their place. In the middle of the discussion, plaintiff moved to dismiss her attorney from the case. The plaintiff told the trial justice: “And, I’m serious, your Honor. I cannot. I can’t. * * * I apologize, your Honor. He doesn’t speak to me 2', 'We discuss the trial justice’s comments concerning plaintiff’s counsel merely to place the issue raised in this appeal in its proper context. Contrary to the suggestion of the dissent, we do not mean to imply that the trial justice’s comments were either improper or unwarranted.', '-3- about anything. He doesn’t even know what is going on in this case. * * * He doesn’t have a clue. I’m sorry.” The trial justice expressed concern that this was the third time the case had been “brought in” and stated that the case had been pending since 2005. The plaintiff responded that she could not move forward with her attorney unless he “can get it together.” The trial justice responded that she was “not disputing” that plaintiff’s counsel was disorganized, and she told plaintiff’s counsel that she could “see why [plaintiff] has concerns.” Thereafter, the court recessed for the day, allowing plaintiff time to further consider her motion to dismiss counsel.', 'The following day, plaintiff presented the court with a letter asking to terminate the engagement of her counsel and enumerating eight reasons in support of her request. She also entered an appearance on her own behalf. The defendants responded that, unless plaintiff could secure new counsel immediately or continue pro se, the discharge of her counsel should result in a mistrial because the case would need to start over with a new jury. The trial justice then opined that “[t]he only thing I could do for a continuance would be Monday or, possibly, the first Monday in January.”', 'The plaintiff’s counsel stated that he was ready for trial and indicated that a witness, plaintiff’s treating physician, was present to testify. However, the court discharged plaintiff’s attorney after granting plaintiff’s motion. The plaintiff then informed the court that she had reached out to two attorneys.', 'The plaintiff explained that she was hoping to retain one immediately, and she asked the court for a two-week continuance.', 'After confirming that plaintiff was not prepared to proceed pro se, the trial justice indicated that she was not inclined to continue the case with the same jury until after the holidays. She then suggested that her only options were to declare a mistrial or dismiss the case under Rule 41(b) “for failure to proceed at trial.” After further colloquy with the parties and a', '-4- recess, the trial justice rendered her decision on “defendant’s Rule 41(b) motion to dismiss and the plaintiff’s motion to pass the trial and reset a new trial date.”', 'In her bench decision, the trial justice noted that this case had been “reached for trial” on December 9, 2013; both attorneys having agreed to forty-eight hours prior notice to confirm the date. She further found that such notice had been given. On that morning, however, the trial justice had been informed by plaintiff’s counsel that he had filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court in an ill-fated attempt to seek a stay of the proceedings. The trial justice said that plaintiff herself was unaware of counsel’s efforts to delay the trial.', 'The trial justice continued that plaintiff’s counsel had insisted that his expert witnesses were not available on such short notice, but that he had declined her offer to entertain any motion for a continuance that he might file or the opportunity to videotape his experts’ trial testimony. Rather, plaintiff’s counsel “agreed that he would have his witnesses present and that he was ready to proceed.” The trial justice then explained how “disorganized and contrarian” plaintiff’s counsel was with respect to the trial exhibits. She noted that his behavior had been very similar in an unrelated proceeding in her courtroom a few weeks earlier, stating that “[i]t was all very torturous.”', 'The trial justice further found that plaintiff’s counsel was “chronically late,” and on one occasion “point[-]blank lying” about what time he had been told to be present. She chastised him for complaining about his client, stating that he “bordered on divulging protected information, privileged information.”', 'With respect to plaintiff’s request to discharge her attorney, the trial justice recognized that plaintiff “represented that she would move expeditiously to engage new counsel,” but that she was not prepared to proceed either that day', '-5- (Friday) “or within a reasonable period of time, say, on Monday.” The trial justice surmised that, if new counsel were retained, it would cause “significant and substantial delays.”', 'The trial justice said that she was “sensitive to the fact that the plaintiff may have lost faith in her attorney” and that she understood plaintiff’s concern, but she also noted that plaintiff had chosen him as her attorney. She also recognized that defendants would have to face additional delay, stating that “[e]very additional day of delay increases the risk of prejudice at this point.” The trial justice then concluded that “the [c]ourt’s need to manage its docket, the defendants’ need for closure, the potential cause for further delay, and the public’s need for expeditious resolution of litigation outweigh the desire to dispose of this particular case on its merits.” Whereupon, she dismissed the case pursuant to Rule 41(b)(1) and (2) with prejudice. The plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'It is well settled that abuse of discretion is “the applicable standard to be used by [this Court] when reviewing a trial justice’s dismissal of a civil action for lack of prosecution,” pursuant to Rule 41(b). Coates v. Ocean State Jobbers, Inc., 18 A.3d 554, 558 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Bergeron v. Roszkowski, 866 A.2d 1230, 1236 (R.I. 2005)). Thus, “this Court must determine ‘whether [the trial justice’s] findings are supported by the evidence or whether in making such findings [the trial justice] misconceived or overlooked any material evidence.’” Id. (quoting Harvey v. Town of Tiverton, 764 A.2d 141, 143 (R.I. 2001)).', '-6-', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, plaintiff argues that the trial justice erred in dismissing her action for lack of prosecution and in failing to grant her a continuance so that she might be afforded an opportunity to seek replacement counsel.', 'The plaintiff avers that the trial justice “overlooked or misconceived the evidence presented” and did not properly weigh the “conflicting interests” in dismissing her action.', 'The defendants counter that the denial of plaintiff’s motion to continue was “a proper exercise” of the trial justice’s discretion, and that plaintiff’s “dissatisfaction with counsel’s handling of her case is an insufficient basis” to reverse the trial justice’s decision.', 'The defendants also argue that, pursuant to agency law, any negligence of counsel imputes to plaintiff. Furthermore, defendants contend that the trial justice properly weighed the equities between the parties, and they maintain that it was within the trial justice’s discretion to dismiss the action.', 'Rule 41(b) sets forth the criteria for the involuntary dismissal of a civil action. It provides, in pertinent part, that (1) “[t]he court may, in its discretion, dismiss any action for lack of prosecution where the action has been pending for more than five (5) years, or, at any time, for failure of the plaintiff to comply with these rules or to proceed when the action is reached for trial,” and (2) “[o]n motion of the defendant the court may, in its discretion, dismiss any action for failure of the plaintiff to comply with these rules or any order of court, or for lack of prosecution as provided in paragraph (1) of this subdivision.”', '“In considering a dismissal motion, a trial justice ‘must weigh the equities between the parties.’” Coates, 18 A.3d at 560 (quoting Harvey, 764 A.2d at 143). “‘On the one hand is the', '-7- court’s need to manage its docket, the public interest in the expeditious resolution of litigation, and the risk of prejudice to the defendants from delay,’ and ‘[o]n the other hand, there is the desire to dispose of cases on their merits.’” Id. (quoting Harvey, 764 A.2d at 143). When weighing the equities, the court “need not view the evidence in a light most favorable to the plaintiffs.” Bergeron, 866 A.2d at 1237 (quoting Harvey, 764 A.2d at 143). Also, it is well settled in our jurisprudence that “[m]ere delay is not enough to warrant dismissal for lack of prosecution.” Harvey, 764 A.2d at 143 (citing Scittarelli v. Providence Gas Co., 415 A.2d 1040, 1042 n.1 (R.I. 1980)).', 'In her decision, the trial justice noted that the case was reached for trial on December 9, 2013, but that plaintiff’s counsel sought to stay the proceedings by filing a petition for writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court. The request for a stay was quickly denied and plaintiff’s counsel indicated that he was ready to proceed and that he would have his witnesses present in court. A pretrial conference was then conducted with respect to the trial exhibits, at which the trial justice found plaintiff’s counsel to be “disorganized and contrarian.” She further found him to be “chronically late” and critical of his own client’s claim for lost wages, suggesting that plaintiff’s counsel “bordered upon divulging” privileged information. The trial justice stated that it was at this point that plaintiff interrupted “to indicate she wanted to fire her attorney.” We agree with the trial justice that, under the circumstances, plaintiff’s concerns with her counsel’s performance were clearly understandable.', 'A mere delay, however, is not enough to warrant a dismissal for lack of prosecution. See Harvey, 764 A.2d at 143. There is no evidence here of deliberate delay or lack of good faith. Indeed, after a quixotic attempt to seek a stay in this Court, plaintiff’s counsel stated that he was ready to proceed on the day that the case was originally reached for trial. Several days later, a', '-8- jury was empaneled and opening statements were made, during which plaintiff lost faith in her attorney. There is no evidence on the record to suggest that plaintiff was being disingenuous in order to prejudice defendants. To be sure, the actions of counsel are imputed to his or her client under the laws of agency. See Bailey v. Algonquin Gas Transmission Co., 788 A.2d 478, 484 (R.I. 2002). Nevertheless, we concur with the First Circuit Court of Appeals that “[d]ismissal with prejudice ‘is a harsh sanction,’ * * * which runs counter to our ‘strong policy favoring the disposition of cases on the merits.’” Benjamin v. Aroostook Medical Center, Inc., 57 F.3d 101, 107 (1st Cir. 1995) (quoting Richmond v. General Motors Corp., 437 F.2d 196, 199 (1st Cir. 1971) and Zavala Santiago v. Gonzalez Rivera, 553 F.2d 710, 712 (1st Cir. 1977)).', 'In her decision, the trial justice cited several cases to support her dismissal under Rule 41(b)(1) and (2), all of which cases are distinguishable. In Tatro v. DiPanni, 712 A.2d 875, 876 (R.I. 1998) (mem.), this Court held that the situation involved more than mere delay where one of the defendants’ “key witnesses sustained a heart attac[k] during the period of delay and moved out of the jurisdiction.” In DeMascole v. Tatro, 673 A.2d 57, 60-61 (R.I. 1996), this Court upheld the trial justice’s dismissal under Rule 41(b)(2) and refusal to grant a further continuance in a case that had been pending for eight and one-half years where the plaintiff had made no effort to depose a witness during the three-month continuance that had been granted after the case had initially been reached for trial. A failure to take any action whatsoever for a period of five years resulted in the dismissal of the defendant’s counterclaims in DeCarli v. Webber, 784 A.2d 288, 291 (R.I. 2001). An eight-year complete hiatus of activity during which the two defendants died and one relocated led to a dismissal that we affirmed in Harvey, 764 A.2d at 143, 144, because “[t]he death or relocation of certain defendants who were key members of the alleged conspiracy demonstrated that the prejudice to the defense of this case involved more than', '-9- mere delay.” In Gosset v. Reid, 764 A.2d 138, 139 (R.I. 2001), the trial justice granted eight separate continuances to defer the trial due to the plaintiff’s chronic illness and inability to pay for experts. One of the plaintiffs had also refused to submit to a videotaped deposition of himself. Id. This failure “contributed as much to the dismissal of the case as did [the plaintiffs’] repeated failure to proceed when the case was reached for trial.” Id. at 141. The failure to engage an expert witness was the primary cause of the dismissal of the plaintiff’s case in a legal malpractice action in Bergeron, 866 A.2d at 1237. Finally, we have upheld the dismissal of a plaintiff’s complaint because of her failure to complete discovery. Coates, 18 A.3d at 561.', 'In light of the unusual circumstances of this case, we are satisfied that the trial justice abused her discretion in dismissing plaintiff’s complaint for lack of prosecution. This was not a situation involving a deliberate attempt to delay the trial or bad faith on the part of plaintiff or her counsel. After a very brief and unsuccessful effort to seek a stay of the proceedings, plaintiff’s counsel announced that he was prepared to proceed and in fact had an expert witness present in court to testify. Moreover, a jury was empaneled and opening statements delivered, after which plaintiff, in obvious exasperation, announced that she wished to discharge her attorney. The following day, she provided a letter to the court succinctly summarizing her reasons. In her decision, the trial justice said that she understood plaintiff’s concerns and characterized counsel’s behavior at times as “mercurial” and “erratic.” We also deem it significant that, in opposing any continuance and in ultimately moving for a dismissal, defendants pointed to no prejudice other than that inherent in any delay.', 'We can readily appreciate the frustration facing the trial justice in this case. We are of the opinion, however, that a dismissal with prejudice for lack of prosecution was too drastic a remedy under these circumstances. We hold, therefore, that the trial justice erred in granting the', '- 10 - defendants’ motion to dismiss under Rule 41(b) and in denying the plaintiff’s motion for a continuance and/or mistrial.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment and remand the case to the Superior Court for a new trial. The record of the case shall be returned to the Superior Court.', 'Justice Indeglia, dissenting. Because I am convinced that the trial justice acted within her discretion by dismissing the plaintiff’s case pursuant to Rule 41(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, I respectfully dissent.', 'A trial justice’s ability to manage each case in her caseload is crucial to the handling of a crowded calendar efficiently and effectively. This Court has recognized that “‘[t]he widest discretion must be given to calendar justices and trial justices’ in managing a trial calendar, a task that is ‘among the most difficult of all judicial assignments.’” Coates v. Ocean State Jobbers, Inc., 18 A.3d 554, 558 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Bergeron v. Roszkowski, 866 A.2d 1230, 1235 (R.I. 2005)). To take on such a task, the trial justice has, at his or her disposal, various tools to allow for efficient scheduling of cases and the weeding out of cases that are not moving forward toward trial. One such tool is Rule 41(b), which prescribes the circumstances in which a trial justice may dismiss a case for lack of prosecution.', ""In deciding whether to grant or deny a motion to dismiss under Rule 41(b), the trial justice is required to weigh conflicting interests: “On the one hand is the court's need to manage its docket, the public interest in the expeditious resolution of litigation, and the risk of prejudice"", '- 11 - to the defendants from delay. On the other hand, there is the desire to dispose of cases on their merits.” Hyszko v. Barbour, 448 A.2d 723, 726 (R.I. 1982). Here, in considering plaintiff’s discharge of her attorney and requested continuance, the trial justice properly performed this balancing test. Specifically, she recognized that “resolving cases on their merits is preferred[,]” but ultimately determined that “the [c]ourt’s need to manage its docket, the defendants’ need for closure, the potential cause for further delay, and the public’s need for expeditious resolution of litigation outweigh the desire to dispose of this particular case on its merits.”', 'The thrust of the majority’s opinion, citing Harvey v. Town of Tiverton, 764 A.2d 141, 143 (R.I. 2001), seems to be that “[a] mere delay * * * is not enough to warrant a dismissal for lack of prosecution.” However, the postponement in this case would create much more than a “mere delay.” While plaintiff’s requested two-week continuance after she discharged her lawyer may—at first blush—appear not to be excessive, a review of the record as a whole reveals that, given the circumstances, such a continuance would have been futile.', 'The request for a continuance was presented to the trial justice on December 13, 2013. As a matter of scheduling, the two-week continuance would turn into three weeks because of the court’s closure for the holidays.', 'Furthermore, the trial justice—employing her many years of experience on the bench—recognized,', '“No competent attorney could review the file, work up the case, and be ready for', 'trial in that short a time. Furthermore, new counsel might feel additional', 'discovery was needed, might opt for new or additional experts, and so on. It’s not', 'as simple as just picking up the file, reviewing it, reading it, and saying ‘Okay', 'let’s go.’” With all of this in mind, it becomes inescapable that plaintiff’s case was not going to be able to proceed in a timely fashion.', 'This Court has repeatedly recognized that “[t]he primary responsibility for moving a case on for trial rests with the plaintiff and his or her attorneys, not', '- 12 - the defendant[s] or the trial court.” Coates, 18 A.3d at 561 (quoting Bergeron, 866 A.2d at 1237). Here, it is abundantly clear that plaintiff failed in her responsibility to move the case forward not once, but twice.', 'Indeed, defendant had previously obtained a dismissal after plaintiff discharged prior counsel and, while acting pro se, failed to attend a pretrial conference.', 'Moreover, granting plaintiff additional time to proceed would have resulted in significant prejudice to defendant. The plaintiff’s claim had been filed in 2008 for an injury that occurred in 2005.', 'At this stage in the proceedings—three days into trial—the jury had already been empaneled, had been preliminarily charged, had heard opening statements from both parties, witnesses (including one of plaintiff’s expert witnesses) were present and prepared to testify, and the about-to-be-discharged attorney was still willing to proceed. It was not an abuse of the trial justice’s discretion to determine that this prejudice to defendant coupled with the trial court’s wide discretion to manage its calendar outweighed plaintiff’s request for a seemingly useless continuance.', 'The majority appears to suggest that delay must be deliberate or lacking in good faith for a trial justice to dismiss a case for lack of prosecution. However, this Court has never required those factors in order to warrant such a dismissal. Nevertheless, the majority places blame on plaintiff’s lawyer, suggesting that, in dismissing her lawyer, plaintiff acted in good faith pursuant to a legitimate concern for her counsel’s shortcomings.1 Somehow, the majority categorizes plaintiff as blameless and implies that this rendered her request for a continuance worthwhile. Interestingly, in treating plaintiff as a victim of her lawyer’s ineptitude, the majority ignores 1', 'The majority also speaks in some length about the trial justice’s criticisms regarding these shortcomings, suggesting—albeit indirectly—that there is some question as to whether the judge’s conduct in berating plaintiff’s counsel in her presence was proper. However, the record suggests that plaintiff was peeved with her attorney’s performance long before the trial justice’s comments.', '- 13 - plaintiff’s conduct with regard to this case. As noted above, the case had already been dismissed while she was acting pro se after discharging previous counsel.2 Here, the trial justice dismissed the case with full knowledge of the history of this plaintiff’s management of her case and, more importantly, of her attorneys. While dismissing the case may have produced a harsh result for plaintiff, the trial justice was within her discretion to do so.', 'Even more than having legal acumen, a successful trial judge must be a competent manager. A judge must struggle with the requests of attorneys on the verge of trial—additional discovery, requested continuances, unavailable witnesses, and more time to prepare.', 'The successful judge must do justice, but must do it decisively. Given the circumstances at play in this case—namely, the timing of the plaintiff’s request for a continuance, the stage of the proceedings, and the procedural history of the plaintiff’s claim—I cannot conclude that the trial justice abused her discretion in dismissing the case. Therefore, I respectfully dissent. 2', 'Ironically, it was her present counsel whom she was discharging in this matter who got the first dismissal vacated and the case reinstated.', '- 14 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'Linda Cotter v.

79,"CCF, LLC : v. : Wayne Pimental, in his capacity as the : Building Official for the Town of East Greenwich, Rhode Island et al.",non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. This appeal emanates from a dispute between competing fast-food restaurants over whether one of the restaurants was entitled to build and operate a drive-through window pursuant to the East Greenwich Zoning Ordinances.', 'The plaintiff, CCF, LLC, operates a Wendy’s restaurant at 2311 New London Turnpike in East Greenwich. One defendant, McDonald’s Corporation, had sought and received permission to build a new McDonald’s restaurant with a drive-through window on property located at 2500 New London Turnpike in East Greenwich (subject property). The other defendant, Wayne Pimental, was named in his capacity as the building official for the Town of East Greenwich. The plaintiff sought a mandatory injunction and a writ of mandamus from the Superior Court to prevent the construction of the drive-through facility unless and until McDonald’s first submitted a special-use permit application for the drive-through window to the Town of East Greenwich’s Zoning Board of Review (zoning board or board). A Superior Court justice resolved the dispute on cross-motions for summary judgment, denying the plaintiff’s motion and granting the defendants’ motion. A final judgment entered in favor of the defendants on all counts, from', '-1- which the plaintiff now appeals. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the Superior Court’s judgment.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'In April 2011, FKL New London, LLC (FKL) filed an application with the East Greenwich Planning Board for approval of a development plan for the construction and operation of a McDonald’s restaurant with a drive-through window (McDonald’s project). The planning board held two public hearings in December 2011 regarding the McDonald’s project. The plaintiff attended the second hearing, where its counsel voiced two main objections; one based on concerns about traffic congestion, the second based on plaintiff’s contention that the applicant was required—but had failed—to apply for a special-use permit before it could build and operate a drive-through window. The planning board granted approval to the McDonald’s project based in part on the fact that, in 2004, a previous owner of the subject property had received a special-use permit from the zoning board for the construction and operation of a restaurant with a drive-through window.1 The planning board’s approval is memorialized in two decisions: a “revised preliminary plan decision” filed with the town clerk on December 15, 2011, and a “final plan decision” filed on December 21, 2011. The plaintiff did not appeal from either decision.', 'On March 29, 2012, however, plaintiff sent an email to defendant Pimental requesting that, in his capacity as the zoning enforcement officer for East Greenwich, he review the 1', 'In January 2004, the East Greenwich Zoning Board of Review had granted a special-use permit to D & D Barkan, LLC for the construction of a Dunkin’ Donuts with a drive-through window at the subject property. In May 2010, FKL purchased the subject property at a foreclosure sale. The development plan that FKL subsequently submitted to the East Greenwich Planning Board was based on the D & D Barkan, LLC master plan for the Dunkin’ Donuts.', '-2- planning board’s decision to determine whether it had correctly “interpreted and complied with the provisions” of the zoning ordinances. The plaintiff asserted that the planning board had misinterpreted provisions of the applicable zoning ordinances and had erred by allowing McDonald’s to rely on the special-use permit that had been granted in 2004 to the previous owner of the subject property. The plaintiff was advised, however, that Pimental would not be responding to its email request; and, on May 2, 2012, plaintiff filed a “notice of appeal” with the zoning board requesting a similar determination from the board. The zoning board’s chairman responded in a letter dated June 14, 2012, stating that the board had neither the authority nor the protocol to consider plaintiff’s appeal.', 'Approximately two months later, plaintiff filed a verified petition in the Superior Court against Pimental in his capacity as the building official for the Town of East Greenwich. The plaintiff sought (1) a mandatory injunction barring the building official from issuing a building permit to FKL (the owner of the subject property) for the McDonald’s project and (2) a writ of mandamus compelling Pimental to deny FKL’s application for a building permit in reliance upon the 2004 special-use permit. The day after plaintiff filed its petition in Superior Court, Pimental issued a building permit granting FKL permission to install a foundation for the future construction of the McDonald’s restaurant; and, on August 16, 2012, he issued a second building permit granting FKL permission to construct the restaurant on the foundation.', 'The plaintiff sent another notice of appeal to the zoning board on August 21, 2012, appealing from the issuance of the August 16 building permit. In a letter dated August 23, 2012, the town solicitor responded, indicating that the town “does not acknowledge that [plaintiff] has the right to appeal the issuance of a building permit to the [zoning board],” nor did it agree “that the filing of the appeal stay[ed] all proceedings in furtherance of the actions which are the', '-3- subject of the [n]otice of [a]ppeal.” The plaintiff amended its petition to the Superior Court, requesting that the Superior Court issue both a mandatory injunction and a writ of mandamus ordering the building official to prevent FKL from building—or continuing to build—a restaurant with a drive-through window in reliance on the building permits without first submitting a special-use permit application to the zoning board for the drive-through window. McDonald’s filed a motion to intervene as a party defendant, which the Superior Court granted on October 11, 2012. CCF and McDonald’s subsequently filed cross-motions for summary judgment.2 After hearing oral argument on the cross-motions, the hearing justice issued a written decision denying plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment and granting McDonald’s cross- motion for summary judgment. Final judgment in favor of defendants entered in June 2013, and plaintiff timely appealed.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'This case presents us with a direct appeal from a judgment resolving cross-motions for summary judgment, which is not the typical posture when we are confronted with issues regarding the interpretation and application of zoning ordinances. The standard of review that we employ, therefore, is the standard applicable to an appeal from summary judgment and not the standard of review applicable to our review of a decision of a zoning board of appeals pursuant to a writ of certiorari. It is well established that “[t]his Court examines an appeal from cross-motions for summary judgment de novo.” Medical Malpractice Joint Underwriting Association of Rhode Island v. Charlesgate Nursing Center, L.P., 115 A.3d 998, 1002 (R.I. 2015). “Typically, the denial of a plaintiff’s summary-judgment motion is reviewable only 2', 'The defendant Pimental “adopt[ed] and incorporate[d] by reference the objection and cross- motion for summary judgment” filed by McDonald’s.', '-4- through a petition for certiorari, and is not appealable as a matter of right.” Peloquin v. Haven Health Center of Greenville, LLC, 61 A.3d 419, 422 n.1 (R.I. 2013). “However, this Court regularly consider[s] appeals from the denial of a motion for summary judgment when coupled with an appeal or cross-appeal of the granting of a motion for summary judgment.” Id. (quoting Avilla v. Newport Grand Jai Alai LLC, 935 A.2d 91, 94 n.4 (R.I. 2007)). “In those situations, the appeal is no longer interlocutory because the grant of summary judgment constituted a final and appealable judgment.” Id. (quoting Avilla, 935 A.2d at 94 n.4).', '“In reviewing the Superior Court’s judgment on the parties’ motions for summary judgment, we * * * apply the same standards as those used by the trial court.” Charlesgate Nursing Center, L.P., 115 A.3d at 1002 (quoting Quest Diagnostics, LLC v. Pinnacle Consortium of Higher Education, 93 A.3d 949, 951 (R.I. 2014)). “Thus, [s]ummary judgment is appropriate when, viewing the facts and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, the [C]ourt determines that there are no issues of material fact in dispute, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Id. (quoting Quest Diagnostics, LLC, 93 A.3d at 951).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'The plaintiff contends that the hearing justice made four errors of law when he denied its motion for summary judgment and granted defendants’ cross-motion for summary judgment. First, plaintiff argues that the hearing justice erred in deciding that plaintiff should have appealed the August 16, 2012 building permit to the local Building Code Board of Appeals (BCBA) instead of to the zoning board because, plaintiff asserts, the board has jurisdiction over appeals from the issuance of building permits when zoning issues are involved. Second, plaintiff argues', '-5- that the hearing justice erred in applying a standing requirement applicable to appeals to the BCBA. Third, plaintiff argues that the hearing justice erred by denying plaintiff’s request for injunctive relief because its appeal to the zoning board should have automatically stayed all construction pending the resolution of plaintiff’s appeal. Finally, plaintiff argues that the hearing justice erred by deciding that the current East Greenwich Zoning Ordinance allows drive-through facilities in a commercial highway zone as a matter of right. In opposition, defendants raise a plethora of procedural issues that we need not address because we conclude that plaintiff was not entitled to the relief it sought as a matter of law.', 'At the time of the hearings before the planning board in December 2011, apparently unbeknownst to plaintiff, defendants, and the town, the applicable zoning ordinance had been amended in 2007. According to an affidavit from the director of planning for the Town of East Greenwich that was presented by defendants in support of their cross-motion for summary judgment, “the [t]own did not realize that the [o]rdinance permitted a drive-through as a matter of right,” and the town’s reliance on the 2004 special-use permit was “unnecessary because the intervening 2007 [z]oning [o]rdinance [a]mendment permitted the drive-through as a matter of right.” Table 1 in chapter 260, Attachment 1 of the East Greenwich Code in effect at the time of the hearings identifies a variety of possible uses of land by the zone in which the land is situated as either permitted, not permitted, permitted only by a special-use permit, or permitted only as an accessory use (table of permitted uses). East Greenwich Zoning Ordinance 786.1, adopted on December 10, 2007, designates “drive-through uses” as permitted in a commercial highway zone. It is well settled that, when we are presented with an issue regarding the interpretation of an ordinance, we apply the rules of statutory construction. Cohen v. Duncan, 970 A.2d 550, 562 (R.I. 2009); Pawtucket Transfer Operations, LLC v. City of Pawtucket, 944 A.2d 855, 859 (R.I.', '-6- 2008); Mongony v. Bevilacqua, 432 A.2d 661, 663 (R.I. 1981). We therefore “give clear and unambiguous language in an ordinance its plain and ordinary meaning.” Cohen, 970 A.2d at 562. “[W]hen the language of a statute or a zoning ordinance is clear and certain, there is nothing left for interpretation and the ordinance must be interpreted literally.” Id. (quoting Mongony, 432 A.2d at 663).', 'The table of permitted uses (amended pursuant to Zoning Ordinance 786.1) clearly and unambiguously provides that a drive-through window in a commercial highway zone is a permitted use and does not require a special-use permit. As plaintiff emphasizes, however, this clear indication of the permitted use is indeed accompanied by a footnote, stating:', '“Two drive-through facilities shall be permitted in a [Commercial', 'Highway] Zone for a shopping center having greater than 100,000', 'square feet of gross floor area. The drive-through use shall be', 'limited to a financial institution (i.e., bank) only. The design of the', 'drive-through use shall provide for safe vehicular and pedestrian', 'circulation and function in a manner that complements the center', 'in which it is located.” Footnote 8(c) in Table 1 of chapter 260,', 'Attachment 1 of the East Greenwich Code. It is our opinion that this footnote may be literally interpreted to mean that a shopping center with more than 100,000 square feet of gross floor area located in a commercial highway zone is allowed to have two drive-through facilities, subject to the type of business and traffic design conditions. See Cohen, 970 A.2d at 562. We reject plaintiff’s interpretation, therefore, that the drive-through use in a commercial highway zone is “only permitted to the extent of the limitations and restrictions set forth in the applicable footnote.”', 'From the plaintiff’s first objection to the McDonald’s project raised before the planning board during the December 2011 public hearing until the issuance of the building permits, all parties had proceeded on an erroneous assumption regarding the permissibility of drive-through facilities in East Greenwich’s commercial highway zone as a use that requires a special permit', '-7- instead of simply being permitted as a matter of right. At the time of the December 2011 public hearings, the amended ordinance had been in effect for four years. After considering the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment, the hearing justice concluded that the defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law because “the amended East Greenwich [Z]oning [O]rdinance permits drive-through uses as a matter of right.” We agree because the operative table of permitted uses at the time FKL sought approval for the McDonald’s project permitted it to build and operate a drive-through window at the subject property as a matter of right.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

80,"IDC Properties, Inc., et al. : v. : Goat Island South Condominium : Association, Inc., et al.",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court.', 'The plaintiffs in this consolidated appeal, IDC Properties, Inc. (IDC) and Thomas Roos (Roos) (collectively, plaintiffs), appeal from an entry of summary judgment in favor of the defendants, Goat Island South Condominium Association, Inc. (GISCA), America Condominium Association, Inc. (America), Capella South Condominium Association, Inc. (Capella), Harbor Houses Condominium Association, Inc. (Harbor Houses), and Warren Galkin, Neal Smith, Cornelius Bond, Thomas O’Brien, Daniel Kinder, Shirley Mintz, Raymond Morrisette, and Reeder Fox, individually (collectively, defendants), on their five-count complaint in this ongoing chronicle surrounding the condominiums located at Goat Island South – A Waterfront Condominium (GIS Condominium) in Newport, Rhode Island. Likewise, Harbor Houses appeals from an entry of summary judgment in favor of GISCA on its cross-claim. This matter came before the Supreme Court on November 4, 2015, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised should not be summarily decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and reviewing the memoranda submitted on behalf of the parties, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown. Accordingly,', '-1- we shall decide the matters at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'We are rather familiar with the history of this case, as we have addressed various issues involving the parties on three prior occasions. Our first instance was in America Condominium Association, Inc. v. IDC, Inc., 844 A.2d 117 (R.I. 2004) (America I), which includes a full recitation of the facts underlying the initial dispute between the parties. As a refresher, in 1988, “Globe Manufacturing Co. (Globe), predecessor in interest of [plaintiffs], recorded a declaration of condominium designated as ‘Goat Island South—A Waterfront Condominium’ * * * in the Land Evidence Records of the City of Newport.” Id. at 120. The condominium area was located across twenty-three acres on scenic Goat Island. At the time, Roos was Globe’s director. The condominium area included “six defined parcels,” three of which were residential sub- condominiums with 154 total units combined: America, a forty-six-unit apartment building; Capella, an eighty-nine-unit apartment building; and Harbor Houses, which consists of nineteen waterfront, townhouse-style homes. Id. The other three parcels were undeveloped and were dubbed the West Development Unit, the South Development Unit, and the Reserved Area/North Development Unit. GIS Condominium is the master condominium, which was designed to manage the common elements shared by the sub-condominiums. Globe eventually transferred its interests in the GIS Condominium to IDC, Inc., which later transferred its interests to IDC.', 'In America I, America, Capella, and Harbor Houses filed an action against Roos, IDC, and IDC, Inc., asserting that Roos and IDC failed to exercise their developmental rights as to the undeveloped units, and, as a result, those undeveloped areas were owned by America, Capella,', '-2- and Harbor Houses. America I, 844 A.2d at 125. In addition, they asserted that the voting procedures under the GIS first amended restated master declaration (FAR) were invalid under the Rhode Island Condominium Act (the act), G.L. 1956 chapter 36.1 of title 34. America I, 844 A.2d at 125. While the Superior Court agreed that the voting procedures under the FAR were invalid and that the development rights of Roos and IDC had expired, America, Capella, and Harbor Houses nonetheless appealed the grant of partial summary judgment in their favor on the grounds that they should have also been granted title to the undeveloped parcels. Id. We affirmed the Superior Court’s ruling, but also held that “the hearing justice should have declared that title to the disputed property vested in the individual unit owners * * *.” Id. at 133. The case was ultimately reargued, and, following the rehearing, we clarified that the undeveloped parcels had always been common elements owned by the individual condominium unit owners from the creation of the GIS Condominium. America Condominium Association, Inc. v. IDC, Inc., 870 A.2d 434, 443 (R.I. 2005) (America II).', 'Following our decisions in America I and America II, the condominium unit owners crafted a second amended restated master declaration (SAR), which, in 2007, nearly 80 percent of the unit owners voted to adopt.', 'The basic structure remained the same—that is, GIS Condominium continued to serve as the master condominium and America, Capella, and Harbor Houses continued as sub-condominiums with their own declarations—but the ownership interests of the common elements were reallocated among the unit owners to include the undeveloped units in accordance with our decisions in America I and America II. The SAR also added a review process for proposed alterations to the Harbor Houses units.', 'Then came Sisto v. America Condominium Association, Inc., 68 A.3d 603 (R.I. 2013). In that case, the plaintiff owned a unit in the Harbor Houses, but wanted to expand the size of his', '-3- unit, thereby encroaching upon the surrounding land, which was “designated as a limited common element—meaning that it is ‘reserved for the use by one or more but fewer than all [u]nits, and intended for the exclusive use of such [u]nits.’” Id. at 606. The plaintiff argued that the plain terms of the SAR did not require him to obtain consent from the other 153 unit owners in the GIS Condominium community to expand his unit. Id. at 612.', 'We agreed that the terms of the SAR did not require unanimous consent, but we also said that the act’s requirement of unanimous approval from all unit owners for any expansion of a unit onto common elements superseded any contradictory provision of the SAR. Id. at 612-14. Thus, despite what the SAR said, we determined that the plaintiff needed to get unanimous approval from the other 153 unit owners before lawfully expanding his unit. Id. at 614.', 'In the midst of all of this litigation, in 2008 plaintiffs filed the instant action, seeking to invalidate the overarching GIS Condominium. This would result in America, Capella, and Harbor Houses moving forward as individual, independent condominiums “of their own accord.” They sought a declaratory judgment that the original master declaration creating the GIS Condominium was invalid and therefore land that was not part of the sub-condominiums— namely, the common elements—was owned by plaintiffs (count 1); that the FAR was invalid (count 2); and that the SAR was void ab initio (count 3). The plaintiffs also alleged that the individually named GIS executive board defendants breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing (count 4) and breached their duty of ordinary and reasonable care (count 5) by unilaterally adopting the invalid structure set forth in the SAR.', 'GISCA and the individual board members moved for summary judgment on all counts, which America and Capella joined; plaintiffs objected and cross-moved for summary judgment on counts one through three. Harbor Houses strategically jumped ship and amended its answer', '-4- to file a cross-claim against GISCA, also seeking a declaratory judgment that the SAR was invalid, and thus the GIS Condominium is not a valid condominium. Harbor Houses then moved for summary judgment on its cross-claim.', 'On February 10, 2014, the hearing justice heard oral arguments from both sides on the motions for summary judgment. GISCA argued that plaintiffs’ first two claims were barred by res judicata and estoppel by deed, that the SAR was valid, and that the claims against the individual board members were without merit. Relying on a portion of our decision in Sisto, Harbor Houses argued that the SAR was invalid under the act because it does not define boundaries for the individual condominium units. The plaintiffs also filed a motion to amend their complaint to add a claim to rescind the SAR due to mutual mistake (count 6), arguing that the parties that adopted the SAR thought that it created “a 3-unit condominium consisting of 3 airspace units,” but that our decision in Sisto had rendered this belief incorrect.', 'On March 27, 2014, the hearing justice issued a bench decision on the summary judgment motions and plaintiffs’ motion to amend. He first denied plaintiffs’ motion to amend, finding that the amendment was futile because they failed to allege fraud, misrepresentation, violence, or undue influence as a cause of the alleged mutual mistake. The hearing justice then granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on all plaintiffs’ claims. He ruled that counts 1 and 2 of plaintiffs’ claims were barred by res judicata because they could have been raised in the America litigation. He further indicated that the claims were barred by the doctrine of estoppel by deed because plaintiffs sold condominium units under the original and FAR declarations and warranted that the units were part of a valid condominium when they were sold, and were therefore barred from subsequently denying the validity of the condominium. The', '-5- hearing justice also determined that the SAR did not violate our decisions in America I and America II and thus was valid.', 'Moreover, the hearing justice rejected Harbor Houses’ reliance on Sisto for its argument that the SAR is invalid because it does not contain units or unit boundaries, and therefore does not create a valid condominium. Rather, he concluded that Harbor Houses took language from Sisto out of context, and that the SAR properly set up a structure of three sub-condominium units under a master condominium by incorporating the boundaries of the individual units by reference to each sub-condominium’s respective declaration. Therefore, the hearing justice also granted summary judgment against Harbor Houses on its cross-claim.', 'As to plaintiffs’ assertion that the reallocation of common element ownership set forth in the SAR required unanimous approval under the act, the hearing justice countered that unanimous approval was not required because the SAR used the same formula established by the original and FAR declarations to calculate ownership of the common elements.', 'Lastly, the hearing justice found no basis for plaintiffs’ claims against the individual board members given that the action taken to adopt the SAR was through the members of GIS, and not the executive board members individually.', 'Judgment was entered on April 21, 2014.

IDC and Roos were both named parties in America I and America II, and there is no question that they were subject to this Court’s jurisdiction.', 'The plaintiffs simply cannot avoid the fact that they were both parties to the prior litigation by asserting that they now represent different interests.', 'Next, the issue of ownership over the common elements within the GIS Condominium was clearly litigated in America I, 844 A.2d at 131-33, and was the primary focus of our clarified decision in America II, 870 A.2d at 443, where we said that title to the common elements had always been with individual unit owners, subject to any development rights. Furthermore, even though the validity of the original and FAR declarations was not directly litigated in America I and America II, plaintiffs’ claims are still barred because we have adopted the transactional approach to the “identity of issues” component. See Torrado Architects, 102 A.3d at 658. That approach “provides that a claim that is extinguished by a final judgment ‘includes all rights of the plaintiff to remedies against the defendant with respect to all or any part of the transaction, or series of connected transactions, out of which the action arose.’”', 'Id.

See America I, 844 A.2d at 120 n.4 (noting that neither the original nor the first amended declaration had been challenged).', 'Last, contrary to plaintiffs’ assertion, there was a valid final judgment. On May 27, 2005, the Superior Court entered a separate and final judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure 3 following America I and America II. While there may still be issues lingering in the America litigation (which, if any, are not pertinent to this appeal), there has at least been a final judgment entered following our decisions in America I and America II, which is all that is relevant to our res judicata analysis today.', 'Any claims of ownership that plaintiffs had to the common elements of the GIS Condominium, as well as their grievances with the original and FAR declarations, should have been raised in the prior litigation. As a result, plaintiffs cannot assert those claims now.', 'We also agree with the hearing justice that plaintiffs’ first two claims are alternatively barred by the doctrine of estoppel by deed. “Generally, the doctrine of estoppel by deed provides that equity will not permit a grantor, or one in privity with him or her, to assert anything in derogation of an instrument concerning an interest in real or personal property as against the grantee or his or her successors.” 28 Am. Jur. 2d Estoppel and Waiver § 5 at 469 (2011).

Barnum & Bailey, 40 R.I. 71, 77, 99 A. 1027, 1029 (1917) (quoting 10 Ruling Case Law, 675).', 'Here, plaintiffs and their predecessors in interest (i.e., IDC, Inc. and Globe) marketed and sold condominium units under both the original and FAR declarations, and warranted good title to the common elements to which they now claim ownership. Consequently, under the doctrine of estoppel by deed, they may not now proclaim that these declarations, which governed the units that they sold, are invalid. The hearing justice stated it best: “[p]laintiffs may not execute and deliver warranty deeds to purchasers of an interest in a condominium development, only to assert some 20 years later that the condominium structure never existed.” For the same reason, they cannot now claim ownership of the common elements or seek to invalidate the original declaration or the FAR. Thus, plaintiffs’ first two claims are barred under the doctrine of estoppel by deed as well.', 'B. The SAR', 'The plaintiffs also claim that the SAR is invalid. They argue that the allocation of voting interests in the SAR violates the act, that the SAR adopts the same structure from the original declaration and the FAR we deemed illegal in the America litigation and Sisto, and that the SAR was not adopted by unanimous consent as required by the act. Similarly, Harbor Houses argues that the SAR is invalid in light of our decision in Sisto. We disagree with each assertion and conclude that the SAR is valid.', 'The plaintiffs’ first point of contention with the SAR is that it “illegally allocates the voting interest in the GIS Condominium” among the 154 individual condominium unit owners.', '-11- According to plaintiffs, this is in contravention of § 34-36.1-1.03(2) of the act, which defines “allocated interests” as an “undivided interest in the common elements, the common expense liability, and votes in the association allocated to each unit.” The plaintiffs read the act as prohibitive of dividing the sub-condominium’s voting interest among its individual unit owners. However, the SAR employs precisely the type of voting scheme we called for in America I. In that case, we invalidated a previous voting structure that allowed only a board of representatives of the three sub-condominium units to vote on amendments to the declaration, stating that “[u]nder the act, unit owners are given the right to vote upon any amendments to special declarant rights * * *.” America I, 844 A.2d at 130. Since we found it to be clear under the act “that the owner of a sub-condominium unit constitutes a unit owner[,]” id., it necessarily follows that these owners are afforded a vote. Any voting scheme shutting them out would “deprive[] the individual unit owners of their statutory right to give consent.” Id. The voting scheme in the SAR is directly responsive to our holding in the America litigation and, thus, is valid.', 'Similarly, plaintiffs contend that unanimous consent from the unit owners was required to adopt the SAR because it altered the allocation of interest of the common elements. Section 34- 36.1-2.17(d) requires unanimous consent from the unit owners as to any amendment that, inter alia, “change[s] * * * the allocated interests of a unit.” However, as the hearing justice pointed out, the interest of the unit owners was merely adjusted to include the common elements using the same formula set out in the original and FAR declarations. The unit owners each got the same percentage share as they did under the original and FAR declarations; there was just more to apportion among them.', 'Thus, there was no change to the allocated interests requiring unanimous consent of the unit owners, and the amendment passed with votes well in excess of the 67 percent required by the act. See § 34-36.1-2.17(a).', '-12-', 'Next, plaintiffs argue that the SAR fails for lack of units following our decisions in America I and America II, because in those cases we stated that the undeveloped north, south, and west air space units were not valid units.', 'Specifically, plaintiffs contend that the condominium fails under § 34-36.1-2.01(b) of the act, which requires that units be “substantially completed” before a condominium declaration is filed.', 'To be sure, we did say that the undeveloped north, south, and west air space units were not units, thus leading to our eventual conclusion that they were part of the common elements. America II, 870 A.2d at 442. However, America, Cappella, and Harbor Houses were completed units at the time the SAR was filed, so plaintiffs’ argument as to this point fails as well.', 'Harbor Houses makes a similar argument in support of its cross-claim, namely that our holding in Sisto provides that the SAR does not describe valid units and boundaries as required by the act.', 'It cites § 34-36.1-2.05(a)(5) of the act, which provides that a condominium declaration must contain “[a] description of the boundaries of each unit created by the declaration[.]” In essence, Harbor Houses wants us to declare that the GIS Condominium is essentially a homeowner’s association that manages the property. However, Harbor Houses’ view of our holding in Sisto misses the mark. Indeed, in Sisto, 68 A.3d at 613, we did say that the master declaration “does not appear to include a specific definition of a unit[.]” But, we went on to say that “§ 1.18 [of the declaration] provides that a [GIS Condominium] unit refers to each of the three sub-condominiums—the America, Capella, and Harbor Houses Condominiums” and that “§ 1.27 [of the declaration] also states that a ‘unit owner’ is the ‘owner of a [r]esidence [u]nit’—meaning the owner of a unit contained within one of the three sub-condominiums.” Sisto, 68 A.3d at 613. While the declaration does not specifically define a unit, it identifies a unit both by referencing the sub-condominiums and the boundaries of units within the sub-', '-13- condominiums. Our statement in Sisto that the master declaration did not include a specific definition of a unit by no means purported to declare that the declaration did not contain a description of the boundaries of each unit in contravention of the act.', 'Harbor Houses’ opportunistic cross-claim is without merit.', 'We note that the bulk of the SAR is identical to the original and FAR declarations, and the only changes—which plaintiffs and Harbor Houses now strategically attack to get another proverbial bite at the apple—adapt to our holdings in America I and America II. In sum, we discern no issue with the validity of the SAR.', 'C. Claims Against the Individual Board Members', 'Next, plaintiffs argue that the hearing justice improperly granted summary judgment on their claims against the individual GIS board members. The plaintiffs contend that the board members “knowingly recorded a document that purported to create an illegal condominium that disenfranchised the interests of a minority group of sub-condominium unit owners * * * and that was adopted by less than unanimous consent in contravention of the [a]ct * * *.”', 'However, plaintiffs’ claims against the individual board members lack merit because, as discussed above, the SAR is valid and unanimous consent was not required. Furthermore, the action taken to adopt the SAR was by the members of GIS, not the individual board members, so there is no basis on this record for individual liability against the board members. Accordingly, summary judgment in favor of the board members on these claims was appropriate.', 'D. Plaintiffs’ Motion to Amend', 'Last, plaintiffs claim that the hearing justice erred in denying their motion to amend their complaint to add a claim to rescind the SAR on the grounds of mutual mistake. The plaintiffs assert that the motion, although presented late in the game, was not prejudicial to defendants and', '-14- did not require an allegation of fraud, misrepresentation, violence, undue influence, or the like to add a claim for mutual mistake.', '“Rule 15(a) declares that leave to amend ‘shall be freely given when justice so requires * * *.’” Lomastro, 56 A.3d at 95 (quoting Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962)). “If the underlying facts or circumstances relied upon by a plaintiff may be a proper subject of relief, he ought to be afforded an opportunity to test his claims on the merits.” Id. (quoting Foman, 371 U.S. at 182). However, we have recognized that a number of reasons—such as undue delay, bad faith, undue prejudice to the opposing party, or, most relevant to this case, futility of the amendment—may nonetheless warrant the denial of a motion to amend. Id. “Of course, the grant or denial of an opportunity to amend is within the discretion of the [hearing justice].” Id. (quoting Foman, 371 U.S. at 182).', 'The hearing justice denied plaintiffs’ motion to amend because it was futile, and we cannot say he abused his discretion in so doing. 4 The circumstances do not indicate that there was a mutual mistake in adopting the SAR, and for that reason, we agree that plaintiffs’ amendment would be futile.', '“[A] mutual mistake is one that is ‘common to both parties wherein each labors under a misconception respecting the same terms of the written agreement sought to be canceled.’” McEntee v. Davis, 861 A.2d 459, 463 (R.I. 2004) (quoting Rivera v. Gagnon, 847 A.2d 280, 284 (R.I. 2004)). “[I]t is not merely the existence of common error that creates mutual mistake. 4', 'The hearing justice reasoned that plaintiffs’ amendment would be futile because they failed to allege any type of “fraud, misrepresentation, violence, undue influence, or the like,” and thus could not make out a claim for rescission due to mutual mistake under the Rule 12(b)(6) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure standard. Although we ultimately use different reasoning to arrive at the same conclusion, we pause to note that “[w]e have long held that this Court can affirm the judgment of the Superior Court on grounds not actually relied upon by the trial court to justify its ruling.” Moseley v. Fitzgerald, 773 A.2d 254, 258 (R.I. 2001) (quoting State v. Lynch, 770 A.2d 840, 847 (R.I. 2001)).', '-15- Instead, ‘the parties’ intent is a determinative factor.’” Id. (quoting Nunes v. Meadowbrook Development Co., 824 A.2d 421, 425 (R.I. 2003)).', 'The plaintiffs argue that the SAR was adopted by the unit owners and the members of GIS under the “mistaken * * * belief that they had adopted a three-GIS [u]nit condominium- within-a-condominium structure”; that is, “[i]t was the unit owners’ express understanding that none of the sub-condominium units constituted units of the GIS Condominium under the SAR * * * when they voted on it.” However, there was no mutual mistake among the parties when they adopted the SAR. In fact, by the plaintiffs’ own assertion, the parties were actually on the same page as to the structure set forth in the SAR; they simply both ran the risk that this Court might interpret that structure differently. This type of misunderstanding is not what the doctrine of mutual mistake was meant to remedy. It is not the error as to the parties’ understanding of the structure that is determinative here; rather, it is the fact that both parties intended to adopt the same structure, regardless of whether it was later found to be problematic. Given that there is no indicia of mutual mistake surrounding the adoption of the SAR, the hearing justice did not abuse his discretion by denying the plaintiffs’ motion to amend on the grounds of futility. 5 5', 'We further note that the amendment would also be futile given plaintiffs’ failure to join indispensable parties. General Laws 1956 § 9-30-11 of the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act provides in pertinent part that “[w]hen declaratory relief is sought, all persons shall be made parties who have or claim any interest which would be affected by the declaration, and no declaration shall prejudice the rights of persons not parties to the proceeding.” Here, the condominium unit owners who voted on the SAR, and were allegedly mistaken as to its provisions, clearly have an interest that would be affected by the declaratory judgment plaintiffs are seeking. Thus, their failure to join the unit owners in this action renders the amendment futile. See Burns v. Moorland Farm Condominium Association, 86 A.3d 354, 358-60, 360 (R.I. 2014) (holding that failure to join indispensable parties in a declaratory judgment action is “fatal and that the judgment is null and void”).', '-16-', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'Some sixteen years and four appeals later, “[w]e are more than persuaded that the [parties to this case] have had their day in court—and then some.” Palazzo v.

81,Richard Audette : v. : Donald Poulin et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. The plaintiff, Richard Audette (plaintiff or Audette), appeals from the dismissal of his claims for negligence and breach of fiduciary duty against the defendant, David J. Correira, an attorney (defendant or Correira). This matter came before the Supreme Court on November 4, 2015, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised should not be summarily decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and reviewing the memoranda submitted on behalf of the parties, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown. Accordingly, we shall decide the matters at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Audette is a beneficiary of the Claire B. Martel Trust (the trust), a charitable trust that was established in 1993. Included within the trust was a provision allowing Audette to live rent- free in a property located at 30 Anthony Way in Tiverton, Rhode Island (the property), though', '-1- Audette was required to pay for utilities while he lived there. The trust further provided for Audette’s well-being through the use of trust income in the discretion of the trustee.', 'From 1999 through 2005, Donald Poulin (Poulin) served as trustee of the trust. Sometime in 2000, Audette exercised his right to occupy the property, even though Poulin allegedly objected to him doing so. Audette also wanted his elderly parents to live with him, but Poulin apparently objected to this as well. Poulin sought Correira’s advice on the issue; and, according to Audette, Correira advised Poulin that the terms of the trust did not permit Audette’s parents to live at the property with him, although it appears they moved in anyway.', 'Sometime thereafter, Poulin instituted legal action to evict Audette and his parents. In his complaint in the present case, Audette claimed that the eviction was motivated by “personal animus” and “not in furtherance of the overall intention of the [trust].” Correira represented Poulin in that matter until it was dismissed in 2005 by agreement between the parties. In 2006, Jerry Ims (Ims) took over as successor trustee of the trust.', 'On December 31, 2010, Audette filed a six-count complaint against Poulin, Ims, and the trust, which he was granted leave to amend on December 1, 2011 to add Correira as a defendant. 1', 'The claims against Correira, which are the only ones relevant to this appeal, sounded in negligence and breach of fiduciary duty. 2 The complaint first alleged that Correira’s advice to Poulin concerning Audette’s right to allow his elderly parents to live with him at the property was not in furtherance of the trust and was not undertaken with due care, diligence, or 1', 'The Attorney General was also named as an interested party pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 18-9-5, which requires notice to that office of all judicial proceedings affecting charitable trusts. It should be noted that, while the complaint was originally filed in Providence County Superior Court, the matter was eventually transferred to Newport County Superior Court. 2', 'The claims against Poulin, Ims, and the trust were settled by a consent judgment entered on March 6, 2014, in which Audette released them from all claims. In the consent judgment, Audette reserved the right to take the present appeal from the dismissal of his claims against Correira.', '-2- prudence.', 'Second, Audette alleged that Correira’s legal advice to Poulin with respect to administration of the trust as a charitable remainder trust, tax advice for the trust, and tax filings for the trust led to Poulin’s failure to properly administer the trust and maintain its tax status as a charitable remainder trust. Third, the complaint alleged that Correira negligently prepared at least one tax return for the trust by failing to file, prepare, and/or distribute the return and various other required documents to the IRS and the beneficiaries. Fourth, the complaint asserted that Correira failed to seek reformation of the trust, distribute proper tax and accounting information to the beneficiaries, make proper monetary disbursements to the beneficiaries, and rely on a spendthrift clause to pay utilities at the property.', 'Last, the complaint alleged that Correira, as well as the trustees, wasted the trust income and assets in “effectuating a crusade based upon personal animus towards [Audette].”', 'On December 30, 2011, Correira filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, in which he argued that he did not owe Audette a duty of care while he represented Poulin as trustee. Correira also argued that Audette’s claims were barred by the statute of limitations.', 'The hearing justice ruled on Correira’s motion to dismiss on March 5, 2012. He noted that this Court has not addressed the issue of whether an attorney representing a trustee owes a duty of care to the beneficiaries of the trust, but he sought guidance from other jurisdictions that have ruled on the issue as well as from our Supreme Court Rules of Professional Conduct. The hearing justice concluded that it “seem[ed] clear that there is a potential for conflicts between a trustee and the * * * beneficiaries and between the beneficiaries themselves that can negatively [affect] an attorney’s ability to zealously represent his client.” He further noted that this conflict was especially apparent in the present case given that Poulin hired Correira to advise and', '-3- represent him with regard to matters that were directly adverse to Audette. Accordingly, the hearing justice found that Correira did not owe a duty to Audette while he represented Poulin as trustee and granted the motion to dismiss Audette’s claims. 3 Audette filed a timely appeal.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“In reviewing the grant of a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), this Court applies the same standard as the hearing justice.” Ho-Rath v. Rhode Island Hospital, 115 A.3d 938, 942 (R.I. 2015) (quoting Woonsocket School Committee v. Chafee, 89 A.3d 778, 787 (R.I. 2014)). “Because the sole function of a motion to dismiss is to test the sufficiency of the complaint, our review is confined to the four corners of that pleading.” Id.

See id. at 1271 (citing Nisenzon v. Sadowski, 689 A.2d 1037, 1046 n.12 (R.I. 1997)). Furthermore, we have said that “[g]enerally, an attorney owes no duty to an adverse party.” Id. at 1270.', 'Audette does not argue that he had a direct attorney-client relationship with Correira, nor does he allege that Correira engaged in any fraudulent conduct during his advisement and representation of Poulin. Thus, under our general rule, Audette would be barred from recovering on a legal malpractice claim against Correira. Nonetheless, Audette argues that Correira owed him a duty of care as a beneficiary of the Martel trust while he advised and represented Poulin as the trustee, as well as with respect to carrying out the direct responsibilities relating to administering the trust.', '-5-', 'This Court has never squarely addressed the issue of whether an attorney of a trustee owes a duty of care to the beneficiaries of a trust. The closest we have come was in Groff, 996 A.2d at 1272, where we “recognize[d] that the liability of an attorney may extend to third-party beneficiaries of the attorney-client relationship if it is clear that the contracting parties intended to benefit the third party.” That case involved a transaction where the lawyer was retained by the borrower to conduct a real estate closing. Id. at 1273. We said that the legal services rendered by the attorney on behalf of the borrowers “were done for the direct purpose of providing [the lender] with a first secured mortgage,” thereby imposing a duty on the lawyer to diligently pay off any existing loans from the refinancing proceeds to ensure that the lender would be placed in first secured position. Id. at 1274. Although the attorney was retained by the borrower, and not the lender, we held that the lender “was at the very least an intended beneficiary of the contractual obligations between [the attorney] and his borrowers, and as such, the attorney owed [the lender] a duty of care.” Id. We did caution, however, that the third-party beneficiary exception had a “‘narrow scope.’” Id. at 1271.', 'Audette urges us to effectively extend the third-party beneficiary exception from Groff and “allow a cause of action to proceed against an attorney of a fiduciary at least in the limited circumstances where there exists an ‘identity of interest’ between [t]rustee and [b]eneficiary.” Even if we were to entertain Audette’s suggestion, his argument still has one fatal flaw: there was no “identity of interest” between Audette and Poulin in this setting. Rather, their interests were clearly adverse from the outset; and, because of the antagonistic nature of their relationship, it would have been difficult for Correira to adequately represent the interests of both Audette and', '-6- Poulin.4', 'At oral argument, Audette’s counsel suggested that, while Audette and Poulin may have been adversaries with regard to some matters, their interests were identical as to others, such as with regard to tax matters relating to the trust. While perhaps true, we cannot help but note that the bitterness between the parties – present from the beginning – so tainted their relationship that it would supplant any identity of interest the two may have had. Accordingly, even under the “identity of interest” theory Audette puts forth, we cannot conclude that Correira owed a duty to Audette on this set of facts.', 'Given our conclusion that Correira did not owe Audette a duty of care with regard to his representation of Poulin as trustee, Audette’s claims for malpractice must fail. See Ahmed, 779 A.2d at 633. As such, Correira’s motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) was properly granted.

82,State : v. : Francis Kolsoi. :,criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. Following a jury-waived trial before a justice of the Superior Court, the defendant, Francis Kolsoi, was convicted of five counts of stalking in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-59-2. The trial justice imposed a sentence of probation on each count to run concurrently. The defendant timely appealed his conviction to this Court. The matter came before us on October 7, 2015, under an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised by this appeal should not summarily be decided. After considering counsels’ oral and written arguments and examining the record, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that this case can be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons given below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'In the fall of 2011, as part of her morning routine, Allison, a student at Lincoln High School, would pick up her friends Brianna, Chloe, Danielle, and Emily on her way to school. 1 En route, the girls usually would stop at a local Dunkin’ Donuts for coffee. On four days in 1', 'We have employed pseudonyms to protect the privacy of the complainants.', '-1- September and October 2011, the girls and defendant crossed paths at Dunkin’ Donuts. Allison and Brianna testified that on those four occasions, Kolsoi engaged in disturbing behavior that was directed at them, including looking down their friend’s shirt, staring at them, appearing to photograph them with his cell phone, and following them in his vehicle after they left the coffee shop. Footage from the shop’s security cameras, which was admitted into evidence, captured most of what transpired inside the store. Also, on more than one occasion, Kolsoi tailgated the girls’ vehicle, flashed his car lights at them, or followed them to the school parking lot.', 'Allison testified that the group first encountered defendant on September 23, 2011, when defendant opened the coffee shop’s door for them as he was entering and they were leaving. As they passed through the door, Brianna observed him look down the front of Danielle’s shirt. The defendant did not go into the shop, but instead stood in front of Allison’s car, a black Volvo, “and just stared at [them] getting into the car.” According to Allison, Kolsoi then hurried to his car and “drove very fast to catch up” to them, almost striking her car in the process. Kolsoi continued to follow them very closely, switching lanes when Allison did, and flashing his lights. She testified that she was afraid that he might be trying to collide with her car or, even worse, planning to abduct one of them.', 'On September 30, 2011, when Allison and her friends again visited Dunkin’ Donuts, Brianna noticed that Kolsoi was already inside the shop. While they waited in line to be served, Brianna alerted the group to his presence and Allison noticed that Kolsoi was holding his cell phone in a manner that suggested that he was taking a video or pictures of her and her friends. Allison immediately said, “Let’s go” to her companions and they all ran out of the shop, except for Brianna, who stayed behind waiting for her order. Allison said that, when she returned to get her friend, Brianna was standing in line, looking frightened and holding on to an acquaintance.', '-2-', 'Brianna also testified; she said that she saw Kolsoi sitting at a table, pointing his phone at the girls. She also concluded that he was videotaping or taking pictures of them. She said that she held on to a friend in line because she was afraid that Kolsoi would grab her. When they returned to Allison’s car, they noticed that Kolsoi was already in his vehicle, relaxing with his hands behind his head, staring at them. This time, according to Allison, Kolsoi followed them all the way to school and “drove very slowly past [them] and was smiling and staring at [them] as [they] were standing in front of [her] car.” Brianna also said that, as he drove by the school parking lot, Kolsoi was looking at them and smiling, which caused her to feel “[c]reeped out.” Upset by what had just occurred, for a second time, Allison memorized his license plate number and reported both incidents to the school’s assistant principal.', 'On October 5, 2011, the girls were in the Dunkin’ Donuts when they looked outside and noticed Kolsoi in his car, parked near Allison’s black Volvo. Fearing for their safety, the girls called the police and waited for a police car to arrive before they returned to their car. Although Kolsoi chose not to follow them that day, a security video showed Kolsoi’s car leaving the parking lot behind the police car, shortly after the girls left.', 'On October 6, 2011, the girls again arrived at Dunkin’ Donuts before school. However, this time the Lincoln Police Department had informed them that plainclothes police officers would be inside the building to observe Kolsoi. The students purchased their items while Kolsoi sat in his car in the parking lot. After they backed out of their parking space and left the premises, Kolsoi again began to trail them. Allison said that, although he was two car lengths behind the girls when they left the lot, Kolsoi soon caught up to them and pulled up beside them on the road so that he could look inside their car. This last incident led to Kolsoi’s arrest on October 12, 2011.', '-3-', 'In an information dated January 19, 2012, the state charged defendant with five counts of felony stalking. The case came to trial in the Superior Court later that year. At the close of the state’s evidence, Kolsoi moved to dismiss the charges against him, pursuant to Rule 29(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. The trial justice reserved her decision on the motion until the close of all the evidence. Kolsoi then testified in his own defense, making an effort to explain his actions for each encounter with the young complainants. Kolsoi maintained that each situation was coincidental and he denied that he was aware of the girls for more than an instant when their paths crossed. He said that he was at Dunkin’ Donuts on those occasions for innocuous reasons, in particular, to connect with someone for part-time work. He testified that he drove closely behind the girls and flashed his lights because he was frustrated and rushing to get to work. With respect to the complainants’ contention that he appeared to be photographing them with his cell phone, he said that he was holding his phone in a way to avoid sun glare as he looked for a message.', 'The defendant said he went to Dunkin’ Donuts on September 23, 2011, but realized when he looked at the menu board that he did not have enough money to purchase anything and left, rushing to get to a job in Framingham, Massachusetts. He said that he recalled seeing the girls, but asserted that they did not stand out in his mind and he emphatically denied that he had stopped at their car to stare at them. He did admit to following their car very closely and to flashing his lights, but explained that he did that to more than one vehicle as he hurried to get to his job.', 'Kolsoi offered that on September 30, 2011, he went to Dunkin’ Donuts expecting to meet someone about a job. As he viewed the security footage from that day, which had been admitted as a full exhibit, he explained that he was looking at his phone and looking up periodically to see', '-4- if the person he was expecting had arrived and that he was sitting in a particular chair to avoid sun glare. He denied that he had recognized the girls. He did concede that he left the Dunkin’ Donuts right after the girls, but said he was not aware of them. In justifying his presence near the high school, Kolsoi said he was driving to a rental apartment that he owned to fix the toilet and that his route coincidentally brought him by the high school. 2 He said he did not see the girls in the parking lot, but that he did notice the black Volvo. He maintained, however, that he did not pay much attention to it. When asked to explain why he drove so slowly by the school, Kolsoi testified that he slowed down because he did not want to get a speeding ticket.', 'With respect to the incident that occurred on October 5, 2011, defendant said that he went to Dunkin’ Donuts, waited in his car for a phone call about a job, and checked his phone for messages. He said that when he did not receive a call, he left for home. He denied that he had seen the girls that day, saying, “I might have, but I wasn’t paying attention to them.” When he left the parking lot, there was a police car ahead of him; he said that he “might” have seen the black Volvo, explaining, “I think I was already then conscious of the black Volvo because of the 23rd when they blocked me, so I knew about the black Volvo and a bunch of kids.”', 'Finally, he said he went to Dunkin’ Donuts on October 6, 2011, after working a night shift because he thought someone might be contacting him about employment, so he waited for a phone call. He said that he did not recall having seen the girls on that day but, after viewing the security footage, he said, “I might have seen them but not conscious [sic] that these are the girls or any girls.” He denied that he followed the girls out of the parking lot that day but said, “I 2', 'Kolsoi’s tenant, Jacob Langley, said that Kolsoi’s toolbox had been left by the front door to his', 'apartment on September 30, 2011. He also said that Kolsoi would, on occasion, leave the', 'toolbox there to let him know that he had stopped by the rental apartment to make requested', 'repairs.', '-5- might have seen [a black Volvo], but it’s like I was conscious of the black Volvo but I wasn’t paying attention, I was minding my business.” Kolsoi went on to say that he was completely shocked and confused when he was arrested on October 12, 2011.', 'At the close of all the evidence, Kolsoi renewed his oral motion to dismiss, and the trial justice again reserved judgment. Then, on December 6, 2012, without having ruled on the motion to dismiss, the trial justice delivered her decision from the bench finding Kolsoi guilty of five counts of stalking. In support of the oral motions that he made during trial, Kolsoi also filed a motion to dismiss on January 8, 2013. On March 22, 2013, the trial justice heard Kolsoi on the motion to dismiss. Although a transcript of that hearing has not been provided to this Court, the trial justice summarized defendant’s arguments when she delivered her decision from the bench on April 26, 2013. It is apparent that defendant argued that the state had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that his actions were willful or malicious, that there was no evidence that he was formally notified that his activities were unwelcome, and that there was insufficient evidence on counts 3, 4, and 5 because there was no testimony from the complainants named in those counts. That motion was denied and defendant timely appealed.', 'On appeal before this Court, Kolsoi argues that: (1) the trial justice erred when she denied his motion to dismiss because he was “without knowledge that his actions were disturbing;” (2) the trial justice erred when she denied his motion to dismiss counts three through five because the state failed to call three of the five complainants to testify; (3) the trial justice erred when she denied his motion to dismiss because the state failed to prove that the complainants were in “reasonable fear of bodily injury;” (4) § 11-59-2 is unconstitutionally vague; and (5) that the failure to call three of the complainants violated his rights under the Sixth Amendment’s Confrontation Clause and article 1, section 10 of the Rhode Island Constitution.', '-6-', 'Analysis', 'We begin by noting that defendant waived his right to a jury trial and chose to be tried by a justice sitting without a jury. Therefore, to challenge the legal sufficiency of the evidence, the defendant must file a motion to dismiss under the provisions of Rule 29(a). See State v. Silvia, 798 A.2d 419, 424 (R.I. 2002). When ruling on a motion to dismiss in a jury-waived criminal trial, the trial justice acts as an independent factfinder. See State v. Albanese, 970 A.2d 1215, 1220 (R.I. 2009). Sitting in that role, the trial justice should:', '“weigh and evaluate the trial evidence, pass upon the credibility of the trial', 'witnesses, and engage in the inferential process, impartially, not being required to', 'view the inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, and against the moving', 'party. After so doing, if the trial justice in a criminal case setting concludes that', 'the trial evidence is sufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, he or', 'she denies the defendant’s motion to dismiss and, if both sides have rested, enters', 'decision and judgment of conviction thereon. If the evidence is not so sufficient,', 'he or she grants the motion and dismisses the case.” State v. McKone, 673 A.2d', '1068, 1072–73 (R.I. 1996). It is also significant that “[i]n a jury-waived criminal proceeding, this Court gives deference to a trial justice’s finding[s] of facts.” State v. Adewumi, 966 A.2d 1217, 1221–22 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. Forand, 958 A.2d 134, 138 (R.I. 2008)). Moreover, when we review these “determinations of credibility and findings of fact by a trial justice sitting without a jury, this Court will not disturb the trial justice’s findings unless they are clearly wrong or the trial justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence on a controlling issue.” Id. at 1222 (quoting State v. LaCroix, 911 A.2d 674, 679 (R.I. 2006)).', '1', 'Prior Knowledge', 'First, defendant argues that his motion to dismiss should have been granted because he was “without knowledge that his actions were disturbing.” He argues that, in the absence of', '-7- evidence that he approached the complainants, contacted them directly, or knew that his actions were disturbing or unwanted, his case should have been dismissed under the provisions of Rule 29. To buttress his argument, defendant cites to our previous stalking cases, including State v. Stierhoff, 879 A.2d 425 (R.I. 2005); State v. Breen, 767 A.2d 50 (R.I. 2001); and State v. Grayhurst, 852 A.2d 491 (R.I. 2004). In Stierhoff, 879 A.2d at 428, not only the complainant, but others as well, put the defendant on notice that his attentions were unwanted and unwelcome before any criminal charges were brought against him. Likewise, in Breen, 767 A.2d at 52-53, the defendant had been previously convicted of stalking the complainant and had been sentenced to one year of probation and subjected to a no-contact order. But shortly after his probation ended, he began to harass the complainant again. Id. at 53. Finally, in Grayhurst, 852 A.2d at 499-500, the complainant had sought and had been granted two restraining orders against the defendant before the defendant was later charged with stalking.', 'It is our opinion that these cases are not helpful to defendant. In our view, defendant misconstrues not only the holdings of these cases but also the language of § 11-59-2. Although it is true that each of the cited cases involved defendants who previously had been notified, at least informally, that their contacts with the complainants were unwelcome, there is utterly no foundation to support an argument that we created a hard-and-fast rule that notice must be given to a defendant before criminal stalking charges are justified. Indeed, we foreclosed that precise argument in Stierhoff, 879 A.2d at 436, where we said that “there is nothing in the language of § 11-59-2 to suggest that a criminal defendant must be first served with any such type of official warning before his alarming, annoying, or bothersome conduct falls within the ambit of the statute.”', 'It is significant that the statute prohibits “willfully, maliciously, and repeatedly follow[ing] another person with the intent to place that person in reasonable fear of bodily injury', '-8- * * *.” Section 11-59-2(a)(2) (emphasis added). Although the word “following” is not defined in the text of the statute, it has been judicially defined elsewhere. For instance, Connecticut construes the term “following” to require', '“that any following be willful * * * the following must have a predatory thrust to', 'it. [It] does not encompass following that is aimless, unintentional, accidental or', 'undertaken for a lawful purpose. Of course, following implies proximity in space', 'as well as time. Whether someone has deliberately maintained sufficient visual or', 'physical proximity with another person, uninterrupted, over a substantial enough', 'period of time to constitute following will depend upon a variety of differing', 'factors in each case. These are appropriate issues for the trier of fact to decide[.] ”', 'State v. Russell, 922 A.2d 191, 203 (Conn. App. Ct. 2007).', 'Based on the evidence presented at trial, the trial justice found that defendant’s “following” did menace and frighten the complainants, and that his testimony was merely “fabrication and justification” for the threatening behavior towards the girls. The defendant’s repeated actions over the course of four different days cannot be cast as mere coincidence. On each day, he placed himself at Dunkin’ Donuts so that he could see the girls, he arrived at the same time, he clearly knew the car in which they traveled, he was observed peering in the windows of the vehicle, he never purchased anything at the coffee shop, and he used his cell phone camera to intimidate the girls by indicating, or at least leading them to believe, that he was photographing them. Because § 11-59-2 neither imputes a requirement that the defendant be notified his actions are disturbing nor requires direct contact with a complainant, we discern no error.', '2', 'Failure to Call Three of the Five Complainants to Testify', 'Second, defendant contends that the state failed to prove that three of the girls were in reasonable fear because the state did not call them to testify. We do not agree.', '-9-', 'The trial justice rejected defendant’s argument that testimony by Chloe, Danielle, and Emily was necessary to establish that those complainants were in “reasonable fear of bodily injury.” Rather, she found that his intent regarding all five complainants was evident because the complainants were traveling in the same group. Based on the state’s assertion that the other three complainants would testify to the same facts as Allison and Brianna, the trial justice found that their testimony would have been cumulative and, therefore, unnecessary. “Cumulative evidence” is evidence that “tend[s] to prove the same point to which other evidence has been offered.” State v. Lynch, 854 A.2d 1022, 1032 (R.I. 2004) (quoting State v. Coleman, 478 N.W.2d 349, 358 (Neb. 1992)). “[T]o qualify as ‘cumulative,’ the evidence in question need not be introduced only after other evidence tending to prove the same point already has been admitted. Rather, the test is a retrospective one, administered at the close of all the evidence * * *.” Id. After reviewing the record, we agree that the testimony of the remaining girls would have been cumulative in light of Allison’s and Brianna’s testimony and would have added very little to the information the trial justice received in the course of trial.', 'Indeed, it is our opinion that the testimony of the remaining complainants was not necessary. We do not agree with defendant’s argument that § 11-59-2 creates a subjective standard that requires that a victim actually be in reasonable fear of bodily injury. Section 11- 59-2(a) defines the essential element of the crime in objective terms—whether the fear of bodily injury is “reasonable”—and the testimony of the three complainants was not necessary to establish it. Simply put, the complainant’s subjective fear is irrelevant: the statute requires only that the defendant intend to place another person “in reasonable fear of bodily injury” by “harass[ing]” or “willfully, maliciously, and repeatedly follow[ing]” that person. Id. (emphasis added).', '- 10 -', 'It has not been disputed that the same girls traveled together and that defendant’s actions were directed toward the entire group. The girls arrived at Dunkin’ Donuts in one car and entered and left together as a group. The testimony of Allison and Brianna, together with the surveillance footage, was sufficient evidence for the trial justice to find that defendant directed his actions towards all five complainants with the same intent to place all of them in a reasonable fear of bodily injury. The trial justice found that the surveillance video was “worth a thousand words” in establishing that defendant repeatedly correlated his movements with those of the group on at least four occasions over a span of two weeks. She found that defendant “trailed them in his car,” flashed his lights, and drove in a “frantic and menacing manner around” them. She found that he “placed himself” at Dunkin’ Donuts at the same time and smiled at all of them in a “creepy” manner, frightening them. She also found that defendant “made unwelcome gestures towards the girls in public,” including aiming his camera at them, and then following them, smiling, “in the midst of a clearly unwelcome pursuit.” We agree with the trial justice that all this evidence is sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant undertook these actions for the purpose of putting all five girls in reasonable fear of bodily injury.', '3', 'The Remaining Arguments on Appeal', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice erred when she denied his motion to dismiss because the state failed to prove that the two complainants who did testify were in “reasonable fear of bodily injury.” Specifically, defendant points to Allison’s and Brianna’s testimony in which they said, somewhat defiantly, that they would continue to go to Dunkin’ Donuts despite defendant’s behavior. However, nowhere in the record is it revealed that defendant raised this argument before the trial justice.', '- 11 -', 'Likewise, to the extent that the defendant challenges § 11-59-2 as unconstitutionally vague and contends that his constitutional right to confrontation has been violated, those issues are also not properly before us. A review of the record clearly demonstrates that the defendant did not raise those arguments at any time before the trial justice, including at the post-trial hearings on his motions to dismiss. At oral argument, the defendant’s appellate counsel candidly conceded this point. By failing to raise those arguments, the defendant denied the trial justice the opportunity to rule on these issues, and, for that reason, he cannot assert them now. See Thornley v. Community College of Rhode Island, 107 A.3d 296, 302 (R.I. 2014). This Court “will not entertain on appeal an issue that the aggrieved party did not specifically raise before the trial court.” Town of Richmond v.

83,: v. : Robert B. Saint et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The plaintiff, Cathleen Curreri, appeals from an entry of summary judgment in favor of the defendants, Robert and Linda Saint. The plaintiff contends that the hearing justice erred when she granted the defendants’ motion in limine to exclude a settlement stipulation that had entered in a prior District Court trespass and eviction action between the parties. The plaintiff argues that the hearing justice should have taken judicial notice of the stipulation and that summary judgment was not appropriate in this case. The matter came before this Court on November 3, 2015, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised by this appeal should not summarily be decided. After considering counsels’ oral and written arguments, and after a thorough review of the record, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that this case can be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons given below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'There is no serious dispute about the facts of this case. The defendants Robert and Linda Saint own a house that Cathleen Curreri rented from them. According to Curreri, the Saints allowed mold to grow in the house, rendering it uninhabitable and damaging her furniture, clothing, and other personal property. Curreri was also in arrears with her rent. As a result, the Saints filed an eviction action against her in the District Court. Eventually, the parties settled the eviction action by filing a stipulation that was signed by all parties and the District Court judge.

For that reason, she filed a negligence action in Superior Court, alleging that the Saints failed to maintain the house free from toxic mold and fungus. She also alleged that the Saints failed to inspect the property and failed to warn her about the mold.', 'The defendants responded by filing (1) a motion in limine to prevent Curreri from entering the parties’ District Court stipulation into evidence to prove causation in this negligence', '-2- action and (2) a motion for summary judgment, arguing that Curreri could not prove that defendants caused the mold that ruined her personal property.', 'A hearing on the motions was held before a justice of the Superior Court. At the hearing, plaintiff’s counsel acknowledged that he would not be presenting a causation expert in the case. Instead, plaintiff’s counsel argued that the District Court stipulation was a final judgment about which the Superior Court should take judicial notice under Rule 201 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. Counsel posited that the stipulation proved that the Saints had caused the damage to plaintiff’s property because the Saints had “admitted” in the stipulation that there was mold in the home and that defendants were to repair the property that had been damaged by the mold. The defendants countered by arguing that the stipulation in no way proved that they admitted that they caused the mold in the house and further that the stipulation was also inadmissible because it was under the ambit of Rule 408 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. 1', 'After hearing from both sides, the hearing justice issued a bench decision. She granted defendants’ motion in limine and barred the admission of the District Court stipulation because she found that the stipulation in the District Court was evidence of a compromised claim and therefore inadmissible under Rule 408. Having done so, the trial justice then ruled that because plaintiff could offer no other evidence of causation, summary judgment was appropriate as a matter of law. The plaintiff timely appealed to this Court. On appeal, plaintiff argues that the hearing justice erred because she was required to take judicial notice of the District Court 1', 'That rule prohibits the admission of settlement offers and agreements. Under Rule 408 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, “[e]vidence of (1) furnishing or offering or promising to furnish, or (2) accepting or offering or promising to accept, a valuable consideration in compromising or attempting to compromise a claim which was disputed as to either validity or amount, is not admissible to prove liability for or invalidity of the claim or its amount.”', '-3- stipulation under Rule 201 and that the hearing justice further erred when she granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court “review[s] a hearing justice’s grant of summary judgment de novo.” Sisto v.

The plaintiffs, Jazmine Wray and Reginald Green, appeal from a Superior Court judgment in favor of the defendant, Raymond Roy. This case stems from a negligence suit brought by the plaintiffs against the two defendants: Roy and Antonio Green, as a result of a three-vehicle rear-end collision. 1 This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issue raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On November 9, 2009, Wray, Roy and Antonio Green were driving eastbound on Hartford Avenue in Providence in their respective vehicles. Hartford Avenue is a two-way street 1', 'The complaint was subsequently amended to add a third plaintiff, Jason Taylor, a passenger in Wray’s vehicle at the time of the accident. This plaintiff is not part of the instant appeal.', '-1- with a single lane in each direction running east and west. At approximately 12:40 p.m., Wray’s vehicle stopped on Hartford Avenue as she waited in the lane of travel for an opportunity to make a left-hand turn into a parking lot. Roy’s vehicle came to a complete stop behind Wray’s vehicle as he waited for Wray to make the left-hand turn. Wray was stopped for several minutes and during this time she observed Roy’s vehicle stopped behind her. A third vehicle—driven by Antonio Green and with Reginald Green as a passenger—approached and rear-ended Roy’s vehicle. Wray heard the first impact of Antonio Green’s vehicle rear-ending Roy’s vehicle prior to Roy’s vehicle rear-ending her vehicle.', 'Both Antonio Green and Reginald Green acknowledged that Roy’s vehicle was stopped prior to the collision.', 'The plaintiffs filed a complaint in Superior Court against defendants alleging negligence and claiming that, as a result of the collision, they experienced pain and suffering and incurred medical bills and lost wages.', 'On December 10, 2012, Roy filed a motion for summary judgment. A hearing was held on February 19, 2013, in which Roy’s motion was granted over plaintiffs’ objection.

The record before this Court is devoid of any evidence regarding the proximity of Roy’s vehicle to Wray’s vehicle while the two were stopped prior to the collisions. Notably, during the hearing on Roy’s motion for summary judgment, counsel for plaintiffs conceded that, although he “believe[d] that there [wa]s [a question of fact]” regarding the proximity of the vehicles, there had not been a “specific document * * * by the plaintiff” or “any evidence as to how much space” was between the vehicles.

See Nationwide Property & Casualty Insurance Co., 59 A.3d at 110. However, the plaintiffs have presented no evidence that Roy breached that duty. Both plaintiffs and Roy attested that Roy’s vehicle was stopped prior to the collision. The co-defendant Antonio Green also conceded that Roy’s vehicle was stopped at the time his vehicle rear-ended Roy’s vehicle. Even when viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, the evidence does not support a finding that Roy breached his duty to operate his vehicle in a reasonably careful manner.', 'Moreover, the plaintiffs’ reliance on § 31-15-12 to establish that Roy breached his duty by not leaving sufficient space between the two vehicles is untenable for two reasons. First, there is no evidence of the distance between the two stopped vehicles prior to the impact, as previously noted. Second, § 31-15-12’s clear language applies to vehicles that are traveling. Section 31-15-12 explicitly provides that “[t]he driver of a motor vehicle shall not follow another vehicle more closely than is reasonable and prudent * * * and shall, whenever traveling * * * leave sufficient space so that an overtaking vehicle may enter and occupy the space without danger.” (Emphasis added.) Here, as noted, it is uncontested that Roy’s vehicle was stopped prior to the accident and, therefore, was neither “traveling” nor “follow[ing] another vehicle.” See § 31-15-12.', 'Consequently, the plaintiffs’ failure to present any evidence to prove an essential element of their negligence claim against Roy—specifically, that he breached his duty of care—renders summary judgment in Roy’s favor appropriate.', '-5-', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

85,"Twenty Eleven, LLC : v. : Michael J. Botelho et al. :",non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. The plaintiff, Twenty Eleven, LLC (plaintiff or Twenty Eleven), purchased a condominium unit at a condominium association lien foreclosure sale in August 2011. On April 18, 2013, the plaintiff filed suit in Superior Court seeking to quiet title to the unit in its name and also seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent a foreclosure by the prior owner’s first mortgage holder, the defendant, PNC Bank, National Association (defendant or PNC). 1 The plaintiff now appeals from the Superior Court’s dismissal of its complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. On appeal, the plaintiff asks us to address the novel question of whether a condominium foreclosure sale conducted pursuant to the Rhode Island Condominium Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 36.1 of title 34 (the act) extinguishes a prior-recorded first mortgage on the unit following the mortgagee’s failure to exercise the right of redemption provided for in § 34-36.1-3.21(c). After careful review of the record and of the parties’ written submissions and oral arguments, we answer that 1', 'The only defendants in this appeal are PNC Bank, National Association, the assignee of the first mortgage, and its servicer Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. We will refer to them collectively as “PNC” or “defendant.”', '-1- question in the affirmative. Thus, we reverse the Superior Court’s dismissal of the plaintiff’s complaint and remand this case for further proceedings.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The relevant facts pertaining to this appeal are fairly straightforward and largely undisputed.', 'On or about December 15, 2004, Michael J. Botelho (Botelho) purchased a condominium unit, Unit 905, in the Lockwood at Warwick Condominium development located at 3524 West Shore Road, Warwick, Rhode Island (the property). On the same day, Botelho also executed a promissory note in favor of First Franklin Financial Corp., d/b/a FFFC, Inc. (FFFC), in the amount of $114,400. The note was secured by a first mortgage on the property. Some time later, Botelho became delinquent on his condominium assessment fees. On July 19, 2011, the Lockwood at Warwick Condominium Association (the association) sold the property at a lien foreclosure sale due to the outstanding condominium assessment obligation owed by Botelho. A statutory condominium lien foreclosure deed conveying title to the property in exchange for payment in the amount of $21,000 was conveyed by the association to plaintiff on August 25, 2011.', 'Coincidentally, Botelho had also fallen behind on his first-mortgage payments, which had been assigned to defendant.', 'On January 18, 2013, plaintiff was notified by letter from defendant’s attorney that the property was to be sold at a mortgage foreclosure sale on March 14, 2013. The mortgage foreclosure sale was ultimately rescheduled; but, in the meantime, plaintiff instituted the present action on April 18, 2013, seeking to quiet title to the property in its name and also seeking a declaratory judgment that defendant had no further interest in the property. It', '-2- also sought an injunction permanently enjoining defendant from foreclosing on the property. 2 In addition to opposing plaintiff’s motion for injunctive relief, defendant filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff’s complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).', 'According to plaintiff, the act provides that the association’s lien for outstanding condominium assessments held a priority position over defendant’s first mortgage. Thus, when the association foreclosed on that lien, defendant’s mortgage was extinguished, subject only to its right to redeem within thirty days in accordance with § 34-36.1-3.21(c) of the act. Because defendant failed to redeem within the thirty-day period, plaintiff posits that it obtained title to the property free and clear of defendant’s mortgage.', 'In a bench decision, the hearing justice disagreed, and instead determined that plaintiff took title to the property subject to defendant’s mortgage, finding that “nothing in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute * * * would extinguish a first mortgagee’s priority position with respect to a subsequent condominium lien foreclosure deed.” Moreover, the hearing justice stated that “[n]othing in [the right to redemption] indicates that a first mortgage is extinguished absent timely redemption by the mortgagee. In fact, the word extinguish does not appear in the statute * * *.” As such, the hearing justice found that defendant’s mortgage survived the association’s lien foreclosure sale and that plaintiff took the property subject to its mortgage.', 'On August 28, 2013, the hearing justice entered an order granting defendant’s motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). 3 The plaintiff filed a timely appeal to this Court. 2', 'It is unclear from the record what the status of the foreclosure sale is at this time and whether it has been rescheduled. 3', 'On November 27, 2013, the Superior Court entered judgment of dismissal nunc pro tunc as of August 28, 2013.', '-3-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“The solitary purpose of a Rule 12(b)(6) ‘motion to dismiss is to test the sufficiency of the complaint.’” Tarzia v.

It is undisputed that, since the condominium in this case was built in 1985, the act applies. 4', 'A. The “Super-Priority” Lien', 'Section 34-36.1-3.16 of the act, titled “Lien for assessments,” is the statutory provision directly at issue in this case. Section 34-36.1-3.16(a) provides that “[t]he association has a lien on a unit for any assessment levied against that unit or fines imposed against its unit owner from the time the assessment or fine becomes due.” Section 34-36.1-3.16(b) goes on to establish the priority of the association’s lien as compared to other encumbrances on the unit. It provides as follows: 4', 'As a threshold matter, defendant argues that plaintiff does not have standing to assert the association’s statutory lien rights. However, plaintiff is not seeking to assert the association’s lien rights; rather, it is seeking to quiet title to the property in its name. “General Laws 1956 § 34-16-4 provides that any person claiming ‘any interest or estate, legal or equitable, in real estate, including any warrantor in any deed or other instrument in the chain of title to the real estate’ may bring a civil action against other people claiming any adverse interest in the property.” Arnold Road Realty Associates, LLC v. Tiogue Fire District, 873 A.2d 119, 130 (R.I. 2005). The plaintiff, which obtained a condominium lien foreclosure deed to the property from the association, certainly has sufficient interest in the property to bring an action to quiet title.', '-5-', '“(1) A lien under this section is prior to all other liens and encumbrances on a unit', 'except:', '“(i) Liens and encumbrances recorded before the recordation of the', 'declaration and not subordinated to the declaration,', '“(ii) A first mortgage or deed of trust on the unit recorded before the', 'date on which the assessment sought to be enforced became delinquent,', 'and', '“(iii) Liens for real estate taxes and other governmental assessments or', 'charges against the unit.” (Emphasis added.) Based on this statutory language, it would appear that a first mortgage recorded “before the date on which the assessment sought to be enforced becomes delinquent,” like defendant’s mortgage here, is senior to a condominium association’s assessment lien. The statute, however, does not stop there. Section 34-36.1-3.16(b)(2) further provides:', '“The lien is also prior to any mortgage or deed of trust described in', 'subdivision (b)(1)(ii) of this section to the extent of the common expense', 'assessments based on the periodic budget adopted by the [condominium]', 'association * * * which would have become due in the absence of acceleration', 'during the six (6) months immediately preceding the foreclosure of the interest of', 'the unit owner including any costs and reasonable attorney’s fees not to exceed', 'two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500), incurred in the collection of any', 'delinquent assessment or other charges by legal proceedings or otherwise and all', 'costs of foreclosure held pursuant to section 34-36.1-3.21, including, but not', 'limited to, publication, advertising and auctioneer costs, said foreclosure costs not', 'to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000) (for a total aggregate of attorney’s fees', 'and costs of seven thousand five hundred dollars ($7,500)).” It is this portion of the lien that is colloquially referred to as a “super-priority” lien. See 7912 Limbwood Court Trust v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 979 F. Supp. 2d 1142, 1147 (D. Nev. 2013). “Thus, the [a]ct effectively splits condominium-assessment liens into two liens of differing priority: (1) a lien for six months of assessments that is higher in priority than the first mortgage or first deed of trust * * * and (2) a lien for any additional unpaid assessments that is lower in priority than the first mortgage or first deed of trust.” Chase Plaza Condominium Association, Inc. v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., 98 A.3d 166, 173 (D.C. 2014) (Chase Plaza); accord Trustees of MacIntosh Condominium Association v. FDIC, 908 F.Supp. 58, 62-63 (D.

See Chase Plaza, 98 A.3d at 175 (citing UCA § 3-116, cmt.2).

We disagree. The phrase “to the extent of” in § 34-36.1-3.16(b)(2) only limits the value of the super-priority lien (up to six months of delinquent assessment fees, plus up to $7,500 in attorney’s fees and costs). “There is no indication that the words [‘to the extent of’] were intended to impose any other limit, much less to create a novel lien with higher priority and the right to foreclose, but without the ability to extinguish a lower priority lien.” Chase Plaza, 98 A.3d at 176.', 'Furthermore, “[i]f the super[-]priority piece of the [association’s] lien just established a payment priority, the reference to a first security holder paying off the super[-]priority piece of the lien to stave off foreclosure would make no sense.”', 'SFR Investments, 334 P.3d at 413.', 'The defendant also argues that extinguishing a first mortgage would render the language in § 34-36.1-3.21(b) meaningless.

For example, had the association foreclosed on the sub-priority portion of its lien (if there was one), defendant’s first mortgage would have priority over that portion of the association’s lien. Consequently, any purchaser at the foreclosure sale would take the property subject to the defendant’s mortgage. See, e.g., Armand's Engineering, Inc. v. Town & Country Club, Inc., 113 R.I. 515, 520, 324 A.2d 334, 338 (1974) (noting that foreclosure on a junior mortgage does not extinguish a senior mortgage, and a buyer at a junior foreclosure sale takes the property subject to the senior mortgage). Here, the association foreclosed on its priority portion of the lien, so § 34-36.1-3.21(b) offers defendant no reprieve. 8"", 'B. Right of Redemption', 'Following foreclosure of the super-priority lien, a first mortgagee has another opportunity to preserve its security interest. Section 34-36.1-3.21 of the act governs the foreclosure of a condominium lien. In 2008, the act was amended to include a right of redemption in favor of the holder of the first mortgage. It states as follows:', '“Any foreclosure sale held by the association pursuant to [this section],', 'shall be subject to a thirty (30) day right of redemption running in favor of the', 'holder of the first mortgage or deed of trust of record. The right of redemption', 'shall be exercised by tendering payment to the association in full of all', 'assessments due on the unit together with all attorney’s fees and costs incurred by', 'the association in connection with the collection and foreclosure process within', 'thirty (30) days of the date of the post-foreclosure sale notice sent by the', 'association * * *. Otherwise, the right of redemption shall terminate thirty (30)', 'days from the date of the post-foreclosure sale notice * * *.” 8', 'The defendant also asserts that extinguishing its mortgage contradicts the express language in plaintiff’s deed to the property, which states that it is “subject to mortgages of record, if any * * * which may survive the [foreclosure] sale.” (Emphasis added.) But, as stated above, there were no mortgages of record (including defendant’s) that survived the foreclosure sale.', '-12- The fact that the statutory scheme was amended in 2008 to include a right of redemption is indicative of the Legislature’s intent that foreclosure of a super-priority lien extinguishes a first mortgage, for it is true that one cannot redeem what it has not lost. 9', 'It is undisputed that defendant did not redeem the association’s lien within the statutory period. While defendant is correct in arguing that it was not required to redeem the association’s lien, nevertheless, by failing to do so, it forfeited its final opportunity to preserve its security interest in the property. At best, the right of redemption creates a conditional foreclosure: foreclosure of the super-priority lien extinguishes the first mortgage (and any other junior liens on the unit) unless the first mortgagee redeems within the statutory period. Here, defendant did not redeem and, as such, relinquished its last chance to save its security interest in the property.', 'Notably, there is no right of redemption in the UCA, and its absence further supports our interpretation of the statute. By amending the act in 2008 to include this right (as well as the notice provisions, discussed supra note 9), the Legislature took an affirmative step to offer more protection to lenders in recognition of the harsh reality that foreclosure on a condominium assessment super-priority lien could wipe out their security interests. 10 9', 'In addition to the right of redemption, several notice requirements were added to the act in 2008. First, the notice provision found in § 34-36.1-3.16(b)(4) requires the association to send a notice of delinquency, including the amount that is delinquent, to the unit owner as well as to the first mortgagee. Additionally, two notice provisions were added to § 34-36.1-3.21 (the foreclosure section) – subsection (a)(2) requires the association to mail notice to the unit owner and the first mortgagee of the time and place of the foreclosure sale at least twenty days prior to publishing notice of the sale, and subsection (a)(4) requires the association to send notice to the first mortgagee within seven days of the foreclosure sale. The addition of these provisions further indicates that it was the Legislature’s intent that foreclosure on a super-priority lien would operate to extinguish a first mortgage because it provides the first mortgagee with notice of the lien and an opportunity on the front end to satisfy the lien in order to avoid foreclosure (and, thus avoid losing its security interest), as well as after the foreclosure sale (to redeem). The defendant does not contest the sufficiency of any notice provided by the association in this case. 10', 'As an aside, we note that the association’s foreclosure sale extinguished only defendant’s security interest in the property, not the obligation stemming from the underlying note. See 7912', '-13-', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'In concluding, we are mindful of the implications of our holding today and the draconian nature of its effects. And yet, we are also reminded of the ancient maxim “dura lex sed lex,” which stands for the proposition that although the law may be harsh, it is still the law. Here, the defendant could have avoided such harsh results had it availed itself of any one of the options available to it before or after foreclosure of the association’s assessment lien. Unfortunately for the defendant, “[t]he inequity [it] decries is thus of its own making and not a reason to give [the statute] a singular reading at odds with its text and the interpretation given it by the authors and editors of the [UCA].” SFR Investments, 334 P.3d at 414.', 'It is not our task to rewrite the statute or circumvent the Legislature’s intent to achieve a more temperate result. Rather, our task is to interpret the legislation as it is written.

Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 979 F. Supp. 2d 1142, 1152 (D. Nev. 2013).

In fact, I believe that it merely adds to the lack of clarity in the statutory scheme at issue. 3', 'The majority opinion, with laudable candor, acknowledges its awareness of “the draconian nature” of the effects of its own holding. 4 But the very word “draconian” constitutes 3', 'A right of redemption is conventionally used to allow a debtor to redeem its property from a creditor.

The statutory scheme with which this Court is contending specifically grants a right of redemption to the holder of the first mortgage rather than the debtor. See G.L. 1956 § 34-36.1-3.21. Thus, while the language used by the General Assembly in the right of redemption section may be clear when viewed in and of itself, when viewed in light of the other provisions of the statutes at issue, it still lacks the clarity which I believe is necessary for the General Assembly to so radically alter the principles of the law of secured transactions. 4', '“Draconian” is defined as “[e]xceedingly harsh; very severe.” The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 543 (5th ed. 2011).', '- 17 - the nub of what prevents me from joining my colleagues in the majority.

Second, he contends that the trial justice abused his discretion in admitting hearsay evidence. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment.', 'Facts and Travel', 'In August 2004, Oliveira was living with his daughter, Barbara, her boyfriend, Richard, and their two young sons (defendant’s grandsons), six-year-old Phillip and one-year-old Thomas, in a two-bedroom apartment in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.1 Oliveira, Phillip, and Thomas all shared one of the two bedrooms; Thomas slept in a crib, while Phillip and defendant shared a bed.

Shortly after young Phillip went to bed that evening but before he fell asleep, Oliveira came into the bed and began rubbing Phillip’s upper thigh. Oliveira then pulled down Phillip’s pajama bottoms, and, according to Phillip, he inserted his finger into Phillip’s anus. When Phillip told Oliveira to stop because it hurt, defendant complied. Phillip pulled up his underwear and eventually fell asleep.', 'The next morning, Phillip awoke to the same disturbing touch. He once again told Oliveira to stop, and defendant did so; defendant got out of bed and left for work. Phillip testified that he went into the kitchen to wipe himself with paper towels because his anus felt “weird.” Richard observed Phillip’s activity and notified Barbara about it. A concerned Barbara summoned Phillip to her room and inquired about his behavior. Phillip responded that he felt like he needed to go to the bathroom, but the bathroom was occupied. Barbara explained to Phillip that this was inappropriate behavior and told him to return to his room. About fifteen to twenty minutes later, Barbara remained perplexed by Phillip’s unusual behavior that morning, and she went to his room to speak with him. In response to questioning from his mother, Phillip disclosed that Oliveira had inserted his thumb into Phillip’s anus. Barbara called the Pawtucket Police Department.', 'When then-Pawtucket Police Det. John McIlmail (Det. McIlmail) arrived at the apartment, Barbara explained Phillip’s disclosure to her that morning. With police officers present, Barbara called Oliveira at work and persuaded him to return to the apartment. Before Oliveira returned and at Det.

After speaking with Barbara, Dr. Barron ordered a forensic-evidence examination for this six-year-old, which included a rectal swab and a rectal smear. Subsequent testing by the Rhode Island Department of Health revealed the presence of seminal fluid in the rectal samples that matched Oliveira’s DNA profile.

I don’t want the issue to', 'develop down the line as to when the exact dates will be for --', 'when I will be ready.” The Superior Court hearing justice4 then inquired of Oliveira whether he was “comfortable slowing this down a little bit so [defense counsel] can adequately investigate.”', 'Oliveira responded, “Yes, sir, as long as it does not continue like the last time.” The hearing justice aptly this discrepancy in Oliveira’s favor, we assume for the purposes of our analysis that the Supreme Court docket sheet accurately reflects the record return date. 4', 'To distinguish between the several Superior Court justices and magistrate judges who presided over the hearings relating to Oliveira’s several pretrial motions and the Superior Court justice who presided over defendant’s retrial, we refer to each judicial officer who presided over the relevant pretrial hearings as “the hearing justice” and the justice who presided over Oliveira’s retrial as “the trial justice.”', '-4- captured the dilemma caused by defendant’s premature speedy-trial motion: “The [c]ourt is certainly inclined to move this along but let’s not go so fast as to overlook some things that need to be looked at.” The hearing justice therefore denied Oliveira’s speedy-trial motion without prejudice. The speedy-trial motion never was renewed. It was not until September 22, 2009 that defense counsel moved for discovery of evidence relating to DNA testing. The state provided the information on April 12, 2010.', 'On June 7, 2010, Oliveira filed a bevy of pro se motions, several of which asserted a violation of defendant’s constitutional right to a speedy trial. During the hearing on these motions on July 6, 2010, defense counsel set forth the reasons why he was not ready to proceed to trial on this case. According to defense counsel, since he last spoke with Oliveira in April 2010, all of his time was occupied by two capital cases that had recently been resolved in Superior Court. Defense counsel further proffered that, as was the case in May 2009, his current caseload was staggering, consisting of between ninety and one hundred cases. He indicated his belief that, during the hearing on Oliveira’s speedy-trial motion, “there was an agreement [with his client] not to go forward [at] that time.” Nonetheless, defense counsel assured Oliveira and the hearing justice that Oliveira’s case was now his “top priority.” He also explained why his pretrial efforts relating to the DNA evidence against defendant, which he averred were somewhat time-consuming, were in Oliveira’s best interest. Defense counsel represented that he would likely be ready for trial in October 2010. For its part, the state represented that it was ready for trial as of the date of the hearing. The hearing justice suggested to Oliveira that it would not be in his best interest to proceed to trial until his attorney was fully prepared. The hearing justice also noted the additional time that would be required to bring a new attorney up to speed on Oliveira’s case. In response to Oliveira’s concerns that he was unable to reach defense counsel,', '-5- the hearing justice explained that defense counsel was in court each morning until the afternoon and that, because this case was now defense counsel’s top priority, communication between Oliveira and defense counsel likely would be more frequent. The motions were passed, and the case was scheduled for a trial calendar call in October 2010. The hearing justice emphasized to Oliveira the importance of filing his motions through his appointed counsel.', 'Undaunted, less than a month later, Oliveira filed another batch of pro se motions on August 5, 2010, which included a motion that sought to discharge defense counsel and obtain new counsel. A hearing was held on September 10, 2010, but defense counsel was unable to attend; another attorney from the Office of the Public Defender appeared in his stead. The hearing justice was reluctant to decide the motion in defense counsel’s absence and therefore deferred ruling on Oliveira’s motion and directed counsel to instruct defense counsel to meet with his client.5 The hearing justice also informed Oliveira that his case was still on the trial calendar for October 2010.', 'A three-month period elapsed when, on December 21, 2010, Oliveira filed a pro se motion seeking recusal of the hearing justice who presided over the September 10, 2010 hearing because of his failure to consider defendant’s pro se motions.6', 'A hearing was held on this motion on January 31, 2011.7 Defense counsel again was not in attendance, but he requested, 5', 'Although the docket indicates that the motion was denied at the hearing, the transcript of the hearing does not appear so decisive. In any event, it is clear that the motion to discharge defense counsel was not granted. 6', 'In that motion, Oliveira stated that he had filed a disciplinary complaint against defense counsel. 7', 'Meanwhile, on January 26, 2011, Oliveira filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in federal court alleging violation of his right to a speedy trial. His habeas petition was dismissed because his speedy-trial claim was unexhausted for habeas purposes. See Oliveira v. Wall, C.A. No. 11-', '-6- through his proxy, a one-week continuance so that he could file a motion relating to Oliveira’s case. Because the hearing justice saw no merit to Oliveira’s pro se recusal motion, it was denied. A little over one week later, on February 11, 2011, defense counsel moved to withdraw. The motion was granted on February 16, 2011; new counsel entered his appearance the next day. At no point in his representation did new counsel move for a speedy trial, nor did he move to dismiss the indictment for violation of defendant’s right to a speedy trial. The defendant does not appear to challenge the period of delay from the date that new counsel entered his appearance to the commencement of his retrial on October 23, 2012.', 'At defendant’s retrial, the state presented the testimony of several witnesses, including Phillip, who was then fifteen years old, Barbara, Det. McIlmail, and Dr. Barron. Phillip told the jury that, before the August 2004 sexual abuse, he had a good relationship with his grandfather. He also testified about Oliveira’s conduct and, without objection, what he disclosed to his mother. In addition, the state also elicited, over defendant’s objection, testimony from Barbara, Det. McIlmail, and Dr. Barron about Phillip’s disclosures to his mother on August 12, 2004.', 'Because Oliveira claims on appeal that the trial justice abused his discretion in admitting that evidence, we recount the relevant testimony in some detail. Barbara testified that, when she first spoke to Phillip after he wiped himself in the kitchen, he looked “nervous” and “afraid” and was acting “standoffish” and “not typical.”', 'Barbara also testified that, when she went to Phillip’s room fifteen to twenty minutes later, “he was just so quiet,” which was not normal. She then testified as follows:', '“I just went up to him and I said, you know, [Phillip], something is', '-- I don’t think with your behind, you have to tell mom, you know', 'something hurts, or, you know if something is going on, anything, 024 ML, 2011 WL 2415343, at *2 (D.R.I. May 12, 2011), report & recommendation adopted, 2011 WL 2415342 (D.R.I. June 13, 2011).', '-7-', 'if anyone is touching you, you have to tell mom anything no matter', 'what it is; you are not going to be in trouble. You know, mommy', 'is not going to be mad at you but if you, if anything is going on', 'with your bum you have to tell me.” When Barbara was asked what Phillip said in response, defendant objected on hearsay grounds. The trial justice overruled the objection at a sidebar conference, explaining that, because Barbara had described Phillip as nervous, afraid, standoffish, and not acting normally, Phillip’s statement qualified as an excited utterance. See Rule 803(2) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. Barbara then testified that, after Phillip first expressed concern that Barbara was “going to be mad at grandpa,” he told her that Oliveira rubbed Phillip’s leg, pulled down Phillip’s underwear, and inserted his thumb into Phillip’s anus.', 'Phillip’s disclosure to Barbara was also recounted by Det. McIlmail and Dr. Barron. Detective McIlmail testified, over defendant’s objection, that, through conversations with Barbara and the responding officer, he learned that “[Phillip] had disclosed to his mother that in the prior evening his grandfather James Oliveira had been in bed with him, rubbed his leg, pull[ed] his underpants down[,] and inserted his finger into his anus.” He also testified, again over defendant’s objection, that Barbara informed him that Phillip complained of pain to her. Finally, Dr. Barron testified, over defendant’s objection, as follows:', '“The mother reported to me that [Phillip] had been baby-sat the', 'night before by his grandfather. That, he had gone to the bathroom', 'in the morning after she found him curled up like a ball under his', 'covers, got up, went and used the bathroom, came down to the', 'kitchen and actually pulled down his pants and underwear and was', 'attempting to wipe his bottom with [a] paper towel. She asked him', 'what he was doing and he disclosed sexual abuse by his', 'grandfather that occurred the night before.”', '-8-', 'The jury found Oliveira guilty of first-degree child molestation, and the trial justice sentenced him to life imprisonment.8 Oliveira timely appealed.', 'Analysis', 'Speedy Trial', 'Oliveira’s principal contention on appeal is that the forty-five-month delay between the return of the record to the Superior Court after Oliveira I and the commencement of his retrial violated his right to a speedy trial. We review this claim de novo. See Oliveira I, 961 A.2d at 317. Under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, section 10 of the Rhode Island Constitution, a criminal defendant is entitled to a speedy trial. See Bido v. State, 56 A.3d 104, 111 (R.I. 2012). “The speedy-trial right is ‘amorphous,’ ‘slippery,’ and ‘necessarily relative,’” and “[i]t is ‘consistent with delays and depend[ent] upon circumstances.’” Vermont v. Brillon, 556 U.S. 81, 89 (2009) (quoting Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 522 (1972)). In assessing a speedy-trial claim, this Court employs the familiar four-factor framework set forth by the United States Supreme Court in Barker: “(1) the length of the delay, (2) the reason for delay, (3) the defendant’s assertion of his [or her] rights, and (4) the prejudice to the accused.” Bido, 56 A.3d at 111 (quoting State v. Crocker, 767 A.2d 88, 91 (R.I. 2001)). We consider all four factors, with no single one accorded dispositive weight. Id. The governing framework “necessarily compels courts to approach speedy[-]trial cases on an ad hoc basis.” Brillon, 556 U.S. at 91 (quoting Barker, 407 U.S. at 530).', '1.', 'Length of Delay', 'The first factor—the length of delay—serves a gatekeeping function, separating cases involving delay that is lengthy enough to be considered “presumptively prejudicial,” for which 8', 'Oliveira is a recidivist child molester.', '-9- review of the remaining Barker factors is necessary, from those involving a shorter period of delay, for which no further analysis is needed. Bido, 56 A.3d at 111. As the state concedes, the forty-five-month delay in this case qualifies as “presumptively prejudicial” under our precedent. See id. (“[T]he line that demarks the ‘presumptively prejudicial’ boundary may be drawn at twelve months.” (quoting State v. Powers, 643 A.2d 827, 831 (R.I. 1994))).', 'Therefore, consideration of the remaining factors is required. We pause to note, however, that, although the delay in this case is “presumptively prejudicial,” “[t]he passage of time, standing alone, does not justify a holding that the guarantee to a speedy trial has been violated.” Powers, 643 A.2d at 833 (quoting State v. Rollins, 113 R.I. 280, 284, 320 A.2d 103, 106 (1974)).', '2.', 'Reason for Delay', 'The second factor—the reason for the delay—calls for an assessment of the relative “culpability of the parties in causing the delay.” Bido, 56 A.3d at 112 (quoting State v. Austin, 731 A.2d 678, 684 (R.I. 1999)); see also Brillon, 556 U.S. at 90 (“[I]n applying Barker, we have asked ‘whether the government or the criminal defendant is more to blame for th[e] delay.’” (quoting Doggett v. United States, 505 U.S. 647, 651 (1992))). Because “pretrial delay is often both inevitable and wholly justifiable,” Bido, 56 A.3d at 112 (quoting Doggett, 505 U.S. at 656), different weights are assigned to different reasons in the ad hoc speedy-trial analysis, see Barker, 407 U.S. at 531. Intentional delay undertaken to gain an advantage over the defendant weighs heavily against the state, while the state can be blameless for delay that might be occasioned by a valid reason. See Bido, 56 A.3d at 112. Delay caused by the state’s negligence lies in the middle of the culpability spectrum; and, “[a]lthough negligence is obviously to be weighed more lightly than a deliberate intent to harm the accused’s defense, it still falls on the wrong side of the divide between acceptable and unacceptable reasons for delaying a criminal prosecution once it', '- 10 - has begun.” Id. (quoting Doggett, 505 U.S. at 657). At the same time, delay caused by the defense, whether the result of action or inaction, is attributable to the defendant in the speedy- trial analysis. See Brillon, 556 U.S. at 90; Bido, 56 A.3d at 112. In performing this analysis, we are mindful that we are not assessing blame on the state’s defense bar or court-appointed counsel; nonetheless, a speedy-trial analysis requires us to allocate the reasons for the delay to one side or the other.', 'It is an inescapable conclusion that the controlling reason for the delay during defense counsel’s tenure in this case—from the time the record was returned to the Superior Court on January 20, 2009 until February 17, 2011, when new counsel entered his appearance for Oliveira—was that the defense was not ready for trial. At the outset, we note the absence of any transcripts or a developed evidentiary record that may have shed more light on the reasons for delay. Apart from two instances when the prosecutor was unavailable, two instances when defense counsel was unavailable, and one instance, in November 2009, when the case was continued for “consideration of disposition,” the docket reflects that the case was continued, in open court, on several occasions “pending further investigation”; no explanation for these continuances is given, nor has a transcript been provided. However, there is no mystery behind the dearth of record evidence: Neither of Oliveira’s defense counsel pressed a speedy-trial motion at any time, and no effort was made to develop an evidentiary record. Additionally, certain critical facts about the reasons for the delay emerge from the limited record in this case: defense counsel was not ready for trial at any point after the remand in early 2009 until he withdrew as counsel in February 2011, and the state was ready for trial for much of this time period. As early as March 2009, the state represented that it could be ready for trial in two months’ time. When defense counsel suggested in May 2009 that he might be ready for trial in', '- 11 - the fall of 2009, the state indicated that it had no objection to a fall trial date. The record is unclear concerning the precise point in time at which the state was ready for trial, but it is clear that, at least by the July 2010 hearing on Oliveira’s first round of pro se filings, the state was ready to proceed.', 'Although this Court cautioned in Powers, 643 A.2d at 831—a case involving a delay of nearly eleven years—that “[t]he state is ‘not entitled to sit back and rely on its pro forma notice of readiness [for trial],’” but “owe[s] the additional duty of monitoring the case and pressing the court for a reasonably prompt trial,” id. at 832 (quoting United States v. Vispi, 545 F.2d 328, 334 (2nd Cir. 1976)), it is clear that the state in this case was not resting on pro forma notices of readiness, but expressed genuine concern about the danger of commencing trial before defense counsel was ready. In May 2009, when the hearing justice articulated his concern that Oliveira’s desire for a prompt trial might result in an unprepared defense attorney proceeding to trial, the state indicated it had no objection to a trial in the fall of 2009. In July 2010, after another hearing justice once again advised Oliveira that it would be in his best interest to not proceed to trial before his attorney was prepared, the state once again expressed concern about rushing defense counsel and indicated that it stood ready for trial whenever defense counsel was ready. There is no suggestion in this record that the state’s representations of readiness for trial were in any way disingenuous.', 'In marked contrast to the state’s timely and unwavering readiness for trial, defense counsel remained unprepared for trial for much (and perhaps the entirety) of the period between January 2009 and February 2011. At the May 2009 hearing on the speedy-trial motion that defense counsel filed, he explained that he would not be ready for trial until the fall of 2009. However, he did not move for discovery of the DNA evidence until late September 2009. By', '- 12 - July 2010, defense counsel was still not ready for trial, and he indicated then that he could not be ready until October 2010.9 Critically, there is no indication that defense counsel was prepared for trial when he moved to withdraw in February 2011. Therefore, although the record does not indicate the precise reason that any of the several continuances were granted, defense counsel’s unpreparedness, when juxtaposed with the state’s early readiness for trial, leaves little doubt that defense counsel’s failure to prepare for trial precluded a speedier disposition of the charges pending against Oliveira. This delay is attributable to Oliveira in the speedy-trial analysis. See Brillon, 556 U.S. at 92 (“An assigned counsel’s failure ‘to move the case forward’ does not warrant attribution of delay to the State.”); id. at 94 (“[D]elays caused by defense counsel are properly attributed to the defendant, even where counsel is assigned.”).10', 'Before this Court, Oliveira seeks to disassociate himself from his defense attorney and strenuously challenges the suggestion by the state that he is responsible for delays caused by defense counsel. To support his position, he relies on the following passage from Oliveira I, 961 A.2d at 318: “[T]he defendant bears responsibility for defense counsel’s scheduling conflicts and requests for continuances when the defendant never moves to substitute counsel or dismiss the indictment prior to trial, and each continuance is granted in accordance with the legitimate needs of competent counsel.” He contends that, after the remand, he did precisely what this Court 9', 'In explaining why he would not be ready for trial until October 2010, defense counsel explained that July was “a difficult time of year” because he was court excused the following week and for the last week in July and the first week in August. Defense counsel indicated that he would visit his client when he returned from his vacation. 10', 'Oliveira does not contend—and there is no evidentiary basis for the position—that defense counsel’s failure to prepare for trial stemmed “from a systemic ‘breakdown in the public defender system.’” Vermont v. Brillon, 556 U.S. 81, 94 (2009) (quoting State v. Brillon, 955 A.2d 1108, 1111 (Vt. 2008), rev’d, 556 U.S. 81 (2009)).', '- 13 - faulted him for not doing in Oliveira I, such that the delay cannot be attributed to him. We reject this contention.', 'For starters, during the May 2009 hearing on the speedy-trial motion that defense counsel filed, Oliveira agreed to allow defense counsel time to adequately prepare for the retrial. It appears that the first action taken by Oliveira to indicate that he was no longer comfortable with defense counsel’s trial-preparation efforts occurred in June 2010, when he launched his first salvo of pro se motions, some of which purported to assert that he had been denied his right to a speedy trial. Thus, a period of seventeen months of the forty-five months complained of is properly attributed to Oliveira because the delay was caused by his attorney, who was not ready for trial. See Brillon, 556 U.S. at 92, 94.', 'Secondly, when Oliveira filed his June 2010 pro se motions, he was still represented by defense counsel. At this point, scheduling matters rested with defense counsel, and Oliveira was bound by those decisions. A decision of the United States Supreme Court in an analogous context is instructive on this point. In New York v. Hill, 528 U.S. 110, 111-12 (2000), a case involving the period in which a criminal defendant must be tried pursuant to the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (IAD), the clock began to run when the defendant requested disposition of the charges pending against him. Before the period had run, defense counsel agreed to a trial date beyond the time constraints in the IAD. See id. at 112-13. The defendant argued that the failure to commence his trial within the requisite time period necessitated dismissal of the indictment. See id. at 113. The Supreme Court rejected this contention, holding that the defendant had waived any argument as to the exclusion of the period between when his counsel agreed on the trial date and the commencement of his trial because “[s]cheduling matters are plainly among those for which agreement by counsel generally controls.” Id. at 115. The Hill', '- 14 - Court explained that “only counsel is in a position to assess the benefit or detriment of [a particular period of] delay to the defendant’s case. Likewise, only counsel is in a position to assess whether the defense would even be prepared to proceed any earlier.” Id.', 'Similarly, we flatly reject the argument that Oliveira is not responsible for delay caused by defense counsel because he filed pro se motions asserting his speedy-trial rights at the same time that his lawyer was not ready for trial. A defendant may not divorce himself from delay caused by his counsel by demanding a prompt trial through unauthorized pro se motions while simultaneously retaining the benefits of representation by counsel in other facets of the case. As we explained in State v. Austin, 462 A.2d 359, 362 (R.I. 1983), in the course of attributing delays caused by defense counsel to the defendant for speedy-trial purposes, “when an attorney- client relationship exists, the client may not pick and choose which of his attorney’s actions shall bind him.” In this case, it is undisputed that an attorney-client relationship existed between Oliveira and defense counsel at the time he filed his pro se speedy-trial motions in June 2010 and that his attorney was not prepared for trial at the time he filed these motions. Defense counsel explained at the hearing on those motions that he had recently been engaged in two capital cases and, consequently, was not prepared for trial in Oliveira’s case. Defense counsel indicated that he would not be prepared for trial until October 2010, and only he was “in a position to assess whether the defense would even be prepared to proceed any earlier.” Hill, 528 U.S. at 115. Upon learning of defense counsel’s status, Oliveira did not move for appointment of new counsel, and the hearing justice continued the matter in accordance with defense counsel’s legitimate pretrial preparation needs. See Oliveira I, 961 A.2d at 318. Because Oliveira was bound by his defense counsel’s decisions on scheduling matters, see Hill, 528 U.S. at 115, this delay is properly attributed to Oliveira in the speedy-trial analysis, at least until he filed his', '- 15 - motion to discharge counsel and for appointment of new counsel in August 2010, see Brillon, 556 U.S. at 92, 94.', 'After almost nineteen months had elapsed since the record was returned to the Superior Court, Oliveira launched his second salvo of pro se motions, including a motion to discharge counsel and for appointment of new counsel. In due course, a hearing was scheduled on this motion in September 2010; defense counsel was not present, and the hearing justice was reluctant to decide the motion without first hearing from defense counsel. The hearing justice therefore deferred ruling on the motion and directed that defense counsel meet with his client. The case remained scheduled for trial on the October 2010 trial calendar. The hearing justice’s reluctance to decide the motion without the benefit of defense counsel’s input was eminently reasonable, and he wisely elected to defer ruling on the motion “until [he was] able to get to the bottom of this.”', 'The next activity reflected in the docket is a filing on December 21, 2010 in which Oliveira moved to recuse the hearing justice for failure to take up his pro se motions. More time elapsed because of this filing.', 'Oliveira twice appeared in court on this motion: once on January 24, 2011, when the motion was continued, “pending further investigation,” and once again on January 31, 2011 for a hearing on the motion.11 On the latter date, defense counsel was absent once again, but he requested a one-week continuance in which to file a motion in Oliveira’s case.12 On February 11, 2011, defense counsel filed a motion to withdraw. That motion was granted, and new counsel entered his appearance on February 17, 2011. 11', 'Considering the time of year when Oliveira filed his motion, the lag time between the filing of the motion and its consideration by the hearing justice was not unreasonable. 12', 'The hearing justice denied the motion to recuse as meritless.', '- 16 -', 'Although more than six months elapsed between the filing of Oliveira’s motion to discharge defense counsel and his eventual withdrawal from the case, the state bears little, if any, responsibility for that period of delay. Hearings were held in a reasonably prompt fashion on both the motion for new counsel and the motion to recuse the hearing justice. Defense counsel was not available, and the decisions of two hearing justices to allow defense counsel to weigh in on both motions were not unreasonable. Much of the six-month delay between August 5, 2010 and February 17, 2011 was the more than three months between the hearing on Oliveira’s motion for new counsel on September 10, 2010 and the filing of the motion to recuse on December 21, 2010. The record is silent as to what, if anything, transpired during this three-month window. There is no indication that the state was not ready for trial, as it had been since at least July 2010. Although in the typical speedy-trial case an unexplained period of delay could be attributed to the state, we are reluctant to do so where defendant failed to develop a record showing periods of delays that truly are unexplainable and his counsel did not appear in court with his client after July 6, 2010 until he withdrew in February 2011.', 'Finally, an additional twenty months elapsed between new counsel’s entry of appearance and the commencement of trial. We readily acknowledge that this is a lengthy period of time and a cause for concern. However, save for including this time period in the calculation of the total period of delay, Oliveira does not appear to attack—or in any way address—the delay occurring during new counsel’s tenure. Because new counsel elected not to assert Oliveira’s speedy-trial rights, there is no indication in the record that new counsel was ready for trial during this time. He was, however, busy protecting his client’s right to a fair trial as an experienced defense attorney and respected member of the bar. The docket reveals that new counsel filed numerous motions on Oliveira’s behalf during this time. He filed a motion for further discovery', '- 17 - on February 28, 2011; the state provided its response to this motion on March 22, 2011. The case was then continued, “pending further investigation,” on three occasions before it was passed for trial on November 17, 2011; the trial date was vacated the next day.13 In mid-December 2011, new counsel filed a pretrial motion to suppress and a motion in limine. After December 2011, the docket reflects no activity until July 25, 2012, when the case again was passed for trial. Oliveira’s trial began in October 2012.', 'Significantly, new counsel stated on the record before trial that he had been engaged in plea negotiations of unspecified duration, and defendant conceded at oral argument before this Court that plea negotiations occurred in this case. Although little can be gleaned from the information in the docket, it appears that new counsel was preparing for trial at least until December 2011, when he filed the motion to suppress and a motion in limine. Cf. State v. Delahunt, 121 R.I. 565, 575, 401 A.2d 1261, 1267 (1979) (remarking, when commenting on the defendant’s motion to suppress identification testimony that was filed after the defendant filed two motions for speedy trial, that the “[f]ailure to complete such a basic step in trial preparation suggests that [the] defendant was not ready for trial during most of the period between indictment and trial[;] [t]hus, such procrastination dilutes the vitality of [the] defendant’s prior motions concerning speedy-trial rights”). At the same time, there is no indication that the state was not ready for trial during the twenty-month period from February 2011 to October 2012; indeed, the record indicates that the state was ready in July 2010, and there is no evidence that the state ever wavered in its readiness for trial.14 At least some of the twenty months that 13', 'We have not been provided with an explanation for this action. 14', 'The two instances in which the case was continued because the prosecutor was unavailable occurred in January and May 2010.', '- 18 - transpired during new counsel’s tenure as defense counsel are properly attributed to Oliveira. See Brillon, 556 U.S. at 92, 94.', 'In sum, although we do not embrace the delay in this case with approval, we nonetheless conclude that much of it was caused by defense counsel’s unpreparedness, and at least some of the delay that occurred during new counsel’s tenure—which Oliveira does not appear to challenge—arose from his reasonable trial-preparation and plea-negotiation efforts. The delay caused by defense counsel and new counsel is attributable to Oliveira. The state was ready for trial during much of that time period. Therefore, in the course of determining who is “more to blame,” Brillon, 556 U.S. at 90 (quoting Doggett, 505 U.S. at 651), we must conclude that Oliveira bears the brunt of the responsibility for the delay. Therefore, the second Barker factor weighs against him.', '3. Assertion of the Right', 'When assessing the third Barker factor—a defendant’s assertion of the right to a speedy trial—we search the record “for actions sufficiently aggressive to constitute the equivalent of ‘banging on the courthouse doors.’” Bido, 56 A.3d at 114 (quoting Crocker, 767 A.2d at 94). Oliveira asserts that his “vigorous” efforts in this regard require that the third Barker factor be “weigh[ed] heavily in his favor.” We disagree.', 'At the outset, we note that Oliveira’s first “assertion” of his speedy-trial right—the motion filed by defense counsel in April 2009—is entitled to no weight in the analysis. At the hearing on this motion, defense counsel explained that he had filed the motion solely to accommodate Oliveira’s request and that he was not ready for trial and would not be ready until the fall of 2009. A premature speedy-trial motion filed long before defendant is ready for trial does not constitute sufficient assertion of the right to a speedy trial. It is a nullity. See State v.', '- 19 - Perez, 882 A.2d 574, 592 (R.I. 2005) (noting, in the course of weighing the third Barker factor against the defendant, that the defendant conceded “that he was unprepared to proceed to trial” at the time that the speedy-trial motion was filed); cf. Delahunt, 121 R.I. at 575, 401 A.2d at 1267 (holding that two motions for speedy trial did not constitute sufficient assertion of the right where the motions were followed by a motion to suppress identification testimony); Ramsdell v. Langlois, 100 R.I. 468, 473, 217 A.2d 83, 86 (1966) (“It would seem that appellant is not entitled to blow both hot and cold—to seek dismissal based upon delay in trial, on the one hand; while at the same time, requesting and insisting upon further continuance or postponement of the trial.” (quoting State v. Thompson, 232 P.2d 87, 92 (Wash. 1951))). Moreover, at the same hearing, Oliveira acquiesced in the delay necessary to allow defense counsel to prepare for trial; when asked by the hearing justice whether he was “comfortable slowing this down a little bit so [defense counsel] can adequately investigate,” Oliveira agreed, although his acquiescence was somewhat qualified in nature. Therefore, not only was the April 2009 speedy-trial motion filed before defense counsel was ready for trial, both defense counsel and Oliveira effectively abandoned the motion during the hearing on May 21, 2009. Because the premature motion properly was denied, it does not approach a sufficiently aggressive assertion of Oliveira’s right to a speedy trial.', 'The pro se motions that Oliveira filed in June 2010 that purport to assert his speedy-trial rights come no closer to banging on the courthouse doors. For one thing, the hearing justice appropriately passed those motions because they were filed while Oliveira was represented by counsel.', 'Cf. United States v. Long, 597 F.3d 720, 729 (5th Cir. 2010) (holding that the defendant waived his right to dismissal under the Speedy Trial Act, even though he filed a pro se motion to dismiss, because he was represented by counsel, and the trial judge properly struck the', '- 20 - pro se motion). A criminal defendant has no right to “hybrid representation,” whereby some tasks are performed by counsel and others by the defendant on a pro se basis. See State v. Brown, 549 A.2d 1373, 1379 (R.I. 1988) (“A criminal defendant cannot claim his right to counsel and assert the right to represent himself in the same trial.”).', 'Moreover, even if we were to address Oliveira’s pro se motions, such filings would not constitute sufficient assertion of Oliveira’s right to a speedy trial. Even more problematic than the seventeen-month delay in the assertion of the right, the series of pro se motions that Oliveira filed in June and August 2010 hardly were limited to his speedy-trial rights. Oliveira also filed motions seeking relief ranging from expungement of dismissed or acquitted charges, to reconsideration of bail, to production of various items of evidence. By bundling a wide variety of pro se filings, Oliveira clouded the focus of the relief he sought, and this, in turn, diminished the force of the assertion of his rights. See Ramsdell, 100 R.I. at 472, 217 A.2d at 86 (“[W]hile the court was awaiting a report of the psychiatric evaluation ordered at [petitioner’s] request, petitioner simultaneously questioned the indictment, requested information to assist him in the preparation for trial, and demanded a speedy trial. The inconsistencies which inhered in the various requests and demands belatedly made by petitioner gave clear warrant to the trial justice to conclude that petitioner intended that action on his demand for a trial be deferred until after a disposition was made of the other matters.”).', 'Additionally, it is significant that new counsel did not seek to dismiss the indictment on speedy-trial grounds (or otherwise assert those rights) from the time he entered his appearance in February 2011 to the commencement of defendant’s retrial in October 2012. Similarly, after his pro se motions relating to his speedy-trial rights were denied in July 2010, there is no indication that Oliveira again asserted those rights in the more than two years that elapsed before his', '- 21 - retrial.15', 'The failure to reiterate a speedy-trial demand for more than two years does not constitute sufficient assertion of the right. Cf. State v. Hernandez, 641 A.2d 62, 68 (R.I. 1994) (“Hernandez asserted her constitutional right once in the two-year period. This assertion occurred very early in the proceedings, in fact one month after the information was filed. She did not bring her motion to dismiss until the first day of trial, some twenty-two months after first asserting her right. We believe Hernandez could have been more aggressive in asserting her right. The record reflects that she only ‘tapped lightly’ on the courthouse doors.”); Austin, 462 A.2d at 363 (“The facts that [the] defendant never made a written demand and that over three years elapsed between [the] defendant’s initial oral request for a speedy trial and any further demands clearly demonstrate a lack of effort on [the] defendant’s part in asserting his right.”).', 'For these reasons, we conclude that the third Barker factor does not weigh in Oliveira’s favor. “The lack of aggressive demand for a speedy trial does not alone constitute a waiver, but it is an important factor that militates against [the] defendant’s position, particularly when [the] defendant is at least partially responsible for the delay.” Austin, 462 A.2d at 363.', '4.', 'Prejudice', 'Finally, this Court turns to the fourth Barker factor: prejudice to the defendant. A defendant’s right to a speedy trial seeks to combat three general types of prejudice: “oppressive 15', 'In reaching this conclusion, we do not overlook Oliveira’s premature pro se habeas petition that he filed in federal court in January 2011. However, assuming, without deciding, that the pretrial filing of a habeas petition in federal court by a defendant awaiting trial on state charges can even constitute an assertion of the right to a speedy trial under Barker’s third factor, this ineffectual filing is entitled to scant weight in the analysis in this case because new counsel’s subsequent actions, including the filing of several pretrial motions, indicate that the defense was not ready for trial in January 2011. See Hakeem v. Beyer, 990 F.2d 750, 765 (3d Cir. 1993) (“[W]e think the weight to be given Hakeem’s December petition in the federal court is reduced by his apparent unreadiness to proceed to trial at any of the times he asserted the right. Where, through contrary actions, a defendant evidences an unwillingness to commence with the trial requested, the request carries minimal weight.”); see also State v. Delahunt, 121 R.I. 565, 575, 401 A.2d 1261, 1267 (1979).', '- 22 - pretrial incarceration, anxiety and concern of the defendant, and impairment of the ability to present a defense.” Bido, 56 A.3d at 115 (quoting Oliveira I, 961 A.2d at 319). Of the three, prejudice arising from the impairment of the ability to present a defense is the most concerning “because the inability of a defendant adequately to prepare his case skews the fairness of the entire system.” Id. (quoting Oliveira I, 961 A.2d at 319). Although marshaling “affirmative proof of particularized prejudice” would strengthen a defendant’s speedy-trial argument, such an undertaking “‘is not essential to every speedy[-]trial claim’ ‘because excessive delay presumptively compromises the reliability of a trial in ways that neither party can prove or, for that matter, identify.’” Id. (quoting Doggett, 505 U.S. at 655).', 'In this case, Oliveira does not contend—nor is there any suggestion in the record—that the delay impaired his ability to present a defense. Indeed, defendant conceded in his reply brief that the evidence adduced at defendant’s retrial was the same evidence admitted during his first trial, with the lone exclusion of the evidence that this Court deemed to be improperly admitted in Oliveira I. Although Oliveira claims to have suffered the other two types of prejudice identified in Barker, we are not persuaded. First, with respect to anxiety and concern resulting from the delay, Oliveira asserts, without any evidentiary support, that the delay “[u]ndoubtedly * * * caused him enormous anxiety and emotional strain” and “had to have been * * * extremely frustrating and stressful.” But “[m]ere allegations of mental trauma without more are insufficient to prove prejudice.” Austin, 731 A.2d at 685. Because there was no motion to dismiss filed or heard in this case, Oliveira failed to develop a sufficient evidentiary record on this type of prejudice.', 'Finally, even though Oliveira remained incarcerated awaiting retrial, this circumstance does not weigh heavily in his favor. See Oliveira I, 961 A.2d at 319 (“[T]o the extent that incarceration disrupts one’s freedom, employment, and familial associations, * * *', '- 23 - this disruption merely constitutes a prejudice inherent in being held while awaiting trial and is insufficient alone to satisfy the fourth and final Barker factor.” (quoting Perez, 882 A.2d at 592)). Therefore, the fourth Barker factor does not weigh in Oliveira’s favor.', '***', 'In sum, although the delay of forty-five months in this case was “presumptively prejudicial,” triggering a full-fledged Barker analysis, the remaining speedy-trial factors weigh against Oliveira. The primary reasons for the delay—defense counsel’s unpreparedness for trial and new counsel’s reasonable trial-preparation efforts—are properly attributed to Oliveira. Additionally, because (1) both attorneys failed to assert defendant’s speedy-trial rights, (2) Oliveira acquiesced in the first seventeen months of the delay caused by defense counsel, and (3) neither new counsel nor Oliveira asserted Oliveira’s speedy-trial rights in the period after new counsel entered his appearance, we are of the opinion that Oliveira failed to assert his right to a speedy trial with sufficient persistence. Finally, apart from the prejudice inherent in pretrial incarceration, Oliveira has failed to demonstrate prejudice. Under these circumstances, we are satisfied that Oliveira’s right to a speedy trial was not violated.', 'Hearsay', 'Oliveira also claims that the trial justice abused his discretion in admitting hearsay evidence during the testimony of Barbara, Det. McIlmail, and Dr. Barron.', 'Because the determination of whether a statement qualifies for admission under an exception to the hearsay rule is a matter “within the sound discretion of the trial justice,” this Court will affirm such a determination “unless clearly erroneous.”', 'Oliveira I, 961 A.2d at 314 (quoting State v. Bergevine, 942 A.2d 974, 978 (R.I. 2008)); see also State v. Pompey, 934 A.2d 210, 215 (R.I. 2007).', '- 24 -', 'It is hornbook law that hearsay evidence amounting to an out-of-court statement “offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted,” Rule 801(c) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, is generally inadmissible, unless a recognized exception applies, see Rule 802 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. Another foundational premise is that an out-of-court statement that is not offered for the truth of the matter asserted but for some other purpose—such as to show notice or the effect of the statement upon the listener—is not hearsay. See State v. Diefenderfer, 970 A.2d 12, 32 (R.I. 2009); State v. Crow, 871 A.2d 930, 936 (R.I. 2005).', 'Detective McIlmail began his testimony by explaining how he became involved in this case. He testified that, upon arriving at Barbara’s apartment, he spoke with Barbara and the officer on scene in order to familiarize himself with the case. He was then asked the following question: “And upon speaking with [Barbara] and the officer on scene what did you learn with regards to the allegations?” The defendant objected, and the trial justice overruled the objection and told Det. McIlmail, “You can answer that as to what [you] learned.” Detective McIlmail answered: “[Phillip] had disclosed to his mother that in the prior evening his grandfather James Oliveira had been in bed with him, rubbed his leg, pull[ed] his underpants down and inserted his finger into his anus.” Detective McIlmail then described his next steps after learning of Oliveira’s actions, including ordering photographs of the crime scene, requesting Barbara to convince Oliveira to return to the apartment, and suggesting that Barbara take Phillip to Hasbro for examination. When Det. McIlmail was asked why he suggested that Phillip be taken to Hasbro, the following exchange took place:', '“A.', 'Because he complained of pain to his behind as well as the', 'way he was acting, his demeanor and his lack of verbal', 'communication, I was concerned that he had been sexually', 'molested and I wanted him physically examined.', '- 25 -', '“Q.', 'Now you say that he was complaining in the period that', 'you spent with the family including [Phillip], was he', 'complaining about discomfort or pain in your presence?', '“A.', 'He told his mother that he was experiencing pain.” Defense counsel’s objection to this exchange was overruled.', 'On appeal, Oliveira contends that this testimony from Det. McIlmail contained inadmissible hearsay.', 'However, our review of the entirety of Det. McIlmail’s testimony convinces us that his testimony regarding Phillip’s disclosure that he was experiencing pain was not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Rather, the purpose of that testimony was to explain why Det. McIlmail urged Barbara to take the child to Hasbro. Accordingly, the out-of- court statement embedded within this portion of Det. McIlmail’s testimony was not hearsay, and the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in overruling Oliveira’s objection.', 'The same cannot be said for Det. McIlmail’s testimony about what he learned after speaking with Barbara and the officer on scene. His answer to this question related Phillip’s out- of-court statement that Oliveira had inserted his finger into Phillip’s anus, and a non-hearsay purpose of this testimony is not apparent from the record.', 'Therefore, this testimony was inadmissible hearsay. However, this error does not warrant reversal of Oliveira’s conviction. Even without this evidence, the state had overwhelming evidence of Oliveira’s guilt, including: Phillip’s testimony about Oliveira’s actions and that he relayed defendant’s actions to his mother; Oliveira’s written and oral confession to police; the letter he sent to Barbara apologizing for his conduct; and, most critically, evidence that Oliveira’s seminal fluid was found in Phillip’s anus. Under these circumstances, any error in admission of Det. McIlmail’s testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See State v. Momplaisir, 815 A.2d 65, 70 (R.I. 2003) (“[T]he admission of hearsay evidence is not prejudicial when the evidence is merely cumulative', '- 26 - and when [the defendant’s] guilt is sufficiently established by proper evidence.” (quoting In re Andrey G., 796 A.2d 452, 457 (R.I. 2002))).', 'Oliveira’s contention that the trial justice abused his discretion in ruling that Phillip’s statement to his mother concerning what Oliveira did qualified as an excited utterance, such that Barbara was permitted to relate that statement to the jury, fares no better. Under Rule 803(2), excited utterances are “statement[s] relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition.” “The test [under this exception] is whether, from a consideration of all the facts, the declarant ‘was still laboring under the stress of excitement caused by the event when he or she made the statement at issue.’” Oliveira I, 961 A.2d at 315 (quoting State v. Morales, 895 A.2d 114, 120 (R.I. 2006)); see also Pompey, 934 A.2d at 215. Although the length of time between the occurrence of the event and the utterance of the statement is one factor in the analysis, “the ‘statement need not be strictly contemporaneous with the startling event to qualify as spontaneous,’” so long as it was “made while the declarant was still laboring under the stress of the event.” Momplaisir, 815 A.2d at 70 (quoting State v. Mendez, 788 A.2d 1145, 1147 (R.I. 2002)). Moreover, “in cases of sexual assault[,] the time requirement is less demanding, especially when the victim is a child of tender years.” Oliveira I, 961 A.2d at 315. Additionally, the question of “[w]hether a statement was in response to an inquiry is a factor in determining spontaneity, but does not render the excited- utterance exception inapplicable.” Id.', 'After a careful review of the evidence, we cannot say that the trial justice abused his discretion on this score.16 Barbara testified that, at the time Phillip confided in her, he appeared 16', 'The state argues that, because this Court upheld the admission of Barbara’s testimony about what Phillip told her during defendant’s first trial in Oliveira I, consideration of defendant’s challenge to this aspect of Barbara’s testimony at his retrial is foreclosed by principles of res', '- 27 - “nervous” and “afraid” and was acting “standoffish” and abnormally quiet.17 Additionally, six- year-old Phillip’s disclosure on the morning of August 12, 2004 followed relatively closely on the heels of this child’s traumatic encounter with his grandfather—approximately twelve hours after the August 11, 2004 digital penetration, and even less time after Oliveira’s second assault the next morning.', 'See Morales, 895 A.2d at 116-17, 119-21 (affirming trial justice’s determination that statements made by seven-year-old-sexual-assault victim to her aunt and mother the morning after the crime occurred qualified for admission under the excited-utterance exception). Further, the mere fact that the statement was in response to questioning does not foreclose a finding of spontaneity; and, given Phillip’s relationship with Oliveira and his concern that Barbara would be mad at defendant, the trial justice did not act unreasonably in concluding that Phillip’s disclosure was spontaneous and made while he was still laboring under the stress of the events of the prior night and that morning. See Oliveira I, 961 A.2d at 316.', 'Finally, we turn to Oliveira’s claim of evidentiary error with respect to Dr. Barron’s testimony. Doctor Barron testified that, in accordance with her protocol of obtaining a history from a caretaker, she interviewed Barbara when Phillip and his mother arrived at Hasbro. The following exchange then occurred:', '“Q.', 'Is that [interview] for [the] purpose of medical diagnosis', 'and treatment?', '“A.', 'Yes, it is.', '“Q.', 'Now with regard to medical diagnosis and treatment of', '[Phillip] at this point in time, what specifically did', '[Barbara] tell you with regard to that particular area?”', '(Emphasis added.) judicata. Because we affirm the trial justice on the merits, we need not—and, therefore, do not— address this argument. 17', 'Additionally, Phillip testified that, when he disclosed Oliveira’s actions to his mother, he was crying and “excited to see her” because he “needed to tell her what happened.”', '- 28 - The defendant objected to this question, and the trial justice overruled the objection. Doctor Barron answered that Barbara reported to her that Phillip “disclosed [to his mother] sexual abuse by his grandfather that occurred the night before.”18 Thus, although the question did not call for hearsay, the answer included the identity of the alleged perpetrator.', 'On appeal, Oliveira complains that this portion of Dr. Barron’s testimony strayed from the confines of what is permissible under the medical-diagnosis-and-treatment-hearsay exception.19 See Rule 803(4). Even assuming, without deciding, that the trial justice abused his discretion in overruling Oliveira’s objection, any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because of the overwhelming other evidence of the defendant’s guilt. 18', 'In addition to the above-quoted passage of her answer, Dr. Barron also testified that Barbara “found [Phillip] curled up like a ball under his covers.” Oliveira argues on appeal that this testimony was both incompatible with Barbara’s testimony and unfairly prejudicial. However, Oliveira did not move to strike Dr. Barron’s answer or otherwise apprise the trial justice of this issue. Additionally, it is clear from the context of the general objection that was lodged to the question that preceded this answer that defendant was objecting on hearsay grounds. Therefore, Oliveira failed to preserve any argument other than his hearsay objection to this answer. See State v. Ucero, 450 A.2d 809, 815 (R.I. 1982) (“When at trial the introduction of evidence is objected to for a specific reason, other grounds for objection are waived and may not be raised for the first time on appeal.”). 19', 'The state claims that Oliveira failed to preserve the issue. Because the question called only for what Barbara told Dr. Barron “with regard to medical diagnosis and treatment of [Phillip],” the argument goes, the trial justice appropriately overruled the objection. See Rule 803(4) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. According to the state, by failing to move to strike Dr. Barron’s answer, request a cautionary instruction, or move for a mistrial, Oliveira failed to preserve any issue with respect to Dr. Barron’s answer. The state may well be correct that, where a litigant unsuccessfully objects to an unobjectionable question and the witness’s answer contains inadmissible evidence, it is incumbent on the litigant to also move to strike the inadmissible answer and that, in these circumstances, the objection to the unobjectionable question does not extend to the answer. See State v. Keller, 844 P.2d 195, 201 (Or. 1993); see also Gould v. Day, 94 U.S. (4 Otto) 405, 414 (1876).

At the time, Durham was under contract with the school department to provide transportation for Johnston public school students. A section of that contract, entitled “Driver Withdrawal,” provided:', '“It is understood that the Superintendent of Schools or designee reserves the right to withdraw, with or without cause, at any time, their approval of any driver. The contractor will immediately upon receipt thereof replace the driver.”', 'On January 18, 2008, Lomastro was driving a bus that was full of elementary-school children, without a bus monitor on board, when she broadcast over the radio that someone had shot at her bus and that the children were panicked. After an investigation was conducted, an employee disciplinary report was completed by a supervisor at Durham. In this report, the supervisor determined that Lomastro should be given a warning, but noted that this action was “[p]ending communication with [the] school [department].”', 'On January 23, 2008, Morris Bochner (Bochner), the director of transportation for Johnston schools, wrote a letter to Durham on behalf of the school department stating that it found Lomastro’s conduct “unacceptable.” The letter stated that, although Lomastro reported that the school bus was shot at, “[a]s the facts unfolded, the Providence Police responded along with Durham and School Department', '-2- personnel, [and] it was determined that this was not the case.” 1 The letter went on to state that “[b]roadcasting a hoax is * * * a violation of Federal Communications Commission – Section 73.1217 of 47 CFR 73.1217.”', 'In the letter, the school department also took issue with Lomastro’s “refusal to maintain radio contact, not utilizing her cellular telephone, placing students in harm[’]s way as a result of unwarranted panic, allowing a student to obtain names of who was on the school bus, and never attempting to maintain control or reassuring the students that they were safe * * *.” Citing the aforementioned “Driver Withdrawal” provision from its contract with Durham, the school department “formal[ly] request[ed] to not have [Lomastro] transport students of the Johnston Public Schools upon receipt of [the] letter.” Two days later, on January 25, 2008, a “Work Separation Form” was completed by Lomastro’s supervisor at Durham stating that Lomastro was being involuntarily terminated and listed as a reason: “Driver withdrawal at customer’s request.”', 'In her amended complaint, 2 Lomastro alleged that the school department’s letter “constituted an intentional interference with Contract as to [her] then employment with her then current employer * * * as well as intentional interference of prospective economic relations * * * with her employer[.]” In due course, defendants moved for summary judgment. In response, Lomastro argued that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether she was an at-will 1', 'The record does not indicate why the school bus was in Providence at the time of the incident. 2', 'In her original complaint, Lomastro alleged that defendants wrongfully requested that she be terminated from her employment at Durham. After some discovery had been completed, defendants moved for summary judgment. The hearing justice granted summary judgment in favor of the town, reasoning that there was no employer-employee relationship between Lomastro and the Town of Johnston and, thus, no claim for wrongful termination could lie against the town. At that point, Lomastro made an oral motion to amend her complaint to include a claim of tortious interference, which the trial justice denied. This Court determined that the hearing justice abused his discretion in denying her motion to amend her complaint in Lomastro v. Iacovelli, 56 A.3d 92, 96 (R.I. 2012). On remand, Lomastro’s motion to amend was granted, and it is the added claim of tortious interference that is now the subject of this appeal.', '-3- employee and whether the letter sent by the school department was based on truthful information.', 'The hearing justice determined that the school department was a customer of Durham and, as a customer, exercised a right that it had reserved in its contract with Durham to “indicate that [it] didn’t want a particular driver assigned to [the school department’s] route.” He further determined that Lomastro was not an employee of the school department, but an employee of Durham.

However, the issue of whether Lomastro was an at-will employee is not material.', 'Lomastro was employed by Durham which, in turn, contracted with the school department for transportation of the school students.

Baldelli, 653 A.2d 740, 753 (R.I. 1995)). “Therefore, to establish a prima facie case of intentional interference with contract, aggrieved parties must allege and prove not only that the putative tortfeasor intended to do harm to the contract but that they did so without the benefit of any legally recognized privilege or other justification.” Id. If the plaintiff establishes these prima facie elements, the burden then shifts to the defendant to prove that the contractual interference was indeed justified. Id.', 'Here, the sole issue is whether a genuine issue of material fact exists as to justification for the school department’s actions. In expounding upon the doctrine of intentional interference with contractual relations, we have recognized that one way in which a defendant’s actions may be justified is if that defendant interferes by making a good-faith assertion of a legally protected interest. See Belliveau Building Corp., 763 A.2d at 629. Specifically, we have declared that:', '“One who, by asserting in good faith a legally protected interest of his own or', 'threatening in good faith to protect the interest by appropriate means, intentionally', 'causes a third person not to perform an existing contract or enter into a', 'prospective contractual relation with another does not interfere improperly with', '-6-', 'the other’s relation if the actor believes that his interest may otherwise be', 'impaired or destroyed by the performance of the contract or transaction.” Id.', '(quoting Restatement (Second) Torts § 773 at 52 (1977)). The touchstone of our inquiry is the defendant’s good faith at the time that the defendant exercises its legally protected interest. See id. at 630 (noting that there was no evidence to show that, when the defendants asserted their legally protected interest, “they did not ‘honestly suppose[] such right to exist’”) (quoting Hopkins v. Drowne, 21 R.I. 20, 25, 41 A. 567, 568 (1898)). Indeed, this Court has repeatedly recognized that, even where a defendant’s assertion of a right ultimately turns out to be unfounded, “if at the time he [or she] spoke, he [or she] honestly supposed such right to exist, no action lies.” Id. (quoting Hopkins, 21 R.I. at 25, 41 A. at 568-69). Accordingly, so long as a defendant is acting in good faith at the time it asserts its interest, based on all information available to it at that time, the assertion of such interest is protected—even if it is later determined that the basis for the defendant’s action was invalid. See id.', 'We first recognize that there is no doubt that the school department had a legally protected interest in its contract with Durham. Indeed, such contract provided that the school department “reserve[d the school department’s] right to withdraw, with or without cause, at any time, their approval of any driver.” 4', 'Our inquiry next turns to whether the school department was justified because it invoked this provision in good faith. In the case at hand, there is nothing in the record to suggest that the school department was not acting in good faith at the time that it sent the letter to Durham exercising its right to remove Lomastro from routes within the town. In invoking this provision 4', 'Notably, in asking that Durham “not have [Lomastro] transport students of the Johnston Public Schools * * *,” the town did not ask that Lomastro be terminated from her employment at Durham. Durham was still free—if it chose—to assign Lomastro to another route in another city or town.', '-7- in its letter to Durham, the school department provided rational reasons for requesting that Lomastro not serve as a school bus driver for the town. Namely, the school department stated that Lomastro broadcast without basis that the school bus had been shot at and that such broadcast caused “panic and fear” to the student-passengers on the school bus. The school department also found various aspects of the way in which Lomastro handled the situation—such as her refusal to maintain radio contact or utilize her cellular phone after the broadcast—to be unacceptable.', 'Nevertheless, Lomastro contends that the school department’s letter to Durham asking that she be replaced creates a genuine issue of material fact as to justification because the letter stated that the broadcast was a hoax and, thus, it must be determined whether Lomastro had a basis to broadcast that the bus had been shot at. In support, Lomastro asserts that she was not criminally charged as a result of the incident and that the surveillance video from the bus at the time of the incident shows that she had a reasonable basis to believe she was being shot at.', 'Lomastro’s argument misses the mark: Whether it can be determined in hindsight that Lomastro had a basis to broadcast that the bus had been shot at is of no consequence. In assessing whether a defendant acted in good faith, what is relevant is the information available to that defendant at the time of the allegedly improper action. See Belliveau Building Corp., 763 A.2d at 630. At the time the school department sent the letter to Durham, all of the information available to it suggested that Lomastro had no basis for her broadcast. Specifically, the school department was aware that Lomastro had broadcast over the radio that her school bus had been shot at, but that the Providence Police, together with Durham and school department personnel, determined that this was not the case. Notably, Lomastro has not presented any evidence that, at the time that the letter was sent, the school department knew or had reason to know that she had', '-8- not been criminally charged as a result of the incident. Nor has Lomastro submitted any other evidence to show that, prior to sending the letter, defendants had any reason to know that Lomastro may have had a basis for her broadcast. While Bochner had viewed the surveillance video from the school bus prior to sending the letter, he testified that it was unclear from the video whether the students began declaring that the school bus was being shot at before or after hearing Lomastro’s broadcast. Thus, the school department’s decision to assert its contractual right in light of viewing this inconclusive video does not provide any evidence that the school department acted in bad faith in asking that Lomastro be removed from routes within the town. As recognized above, if the school department made a good-faith assertion of a legally protected interest based on all the information available to it at the time, then it cannot be held to have committed an intentional interference with the contract—even if, in hindsight, it is determined that Lomastro’s broadcast was entirely truthful. See Belliveau Building Corp, 763 A.2d at 630. Thus, whether Lomastro’s broadcast was in fact truthful or a “hoax” is not a material fact in the summary judgment determination.', 'It is Lomastro’s failure to provide evidence that the school department invoked its contractual right without justification that prevents her from establishing a prima facie case and, thus, causes her claim to fail. Accordingly, we hold that the hearing justice did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants.

On appeal, Snell contends that the hearing justice erred by rejecting his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on September 29, 2015, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After carefully considering the written and oral submissions of the parties, we are satisfied that this appeal may be resolved without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'This Court affirmed Snell’s convictions in State v.

In short, on 1', ""Prior to this appeal, Snell has filed three appeals with this Court. To avoid confusion, we will refer to his previous appeals as follows: (i) an appeal contesting a hearing justice's finding that"", '-1- January 11, 2001, Snell argued with his ex-girlfriend, Tanny Eisom (Tanny), about her plans to go out that night. Upon her return to her apartment early the following morning, Snell chased after Tanny and stabbed her and her brother, Slade Edmonds.', 'On March 19, 2001, Snell was charged with one count of felony domestic assault (count 1), two counts of assault with a dangerous weapon (counts 2 and 3), and one count of simple domestic assault after previously having been convicted twice of domestic assault (count 4). During Snell’s trial, in December 2001, both the state and Snell’s trial counsel stipulated in the presence of the jury that Snell had been “twice previously convicted of a domestic violence crime.” The trial justice then immediately instructed the jury that they were not to consider the previous convictions as evidence that Snell had a propensity to commit the charged offenses. Instead, the trial justice made clear that the jury was to consider the stipulation solely for the purpose of establishing an essential element of count 4, namely, that Snell had been convicted twice previously of domestic violence crimes. He further cautioned that the jury was to consider the stipulation for no other purpose.', 'The jury convicted Snell on all four counts, and he timely appealed those convictions to this Court. After reviewing the record, we affirmed his convictions on all counts on February 27, 2006. See Snell II, 892 A.2d at 123. On May 26, 2006, Snell timely moved for a reduced sentence, which the trial justice denied. We affirmed that decision in State v. Snell, 11 A.3d 97, 103 (R.I. 2011) (Snell III). On September 23, 2010, Snell filed an application for postconviction relief. In it, he alleged that his trial counsel was “constitutionally deficient because he failed to even attempt to prevent the jury from hearing that [Snell] had two prior convictions for domestic Snell violated his probation, see State v. Snell, 861 A.2d 1029, 1030 (R.I. 2004) (Snell I); (ii) an appeal contesting his convictions, see State v.

Snell’s trial counsel could not be located and therefore was unavailable to testify.', 'In his bench decision denying Snell’s application, the hearing justice noted that count 4 charged Snell with violating G.L. 1956 § 11-5-3 which, because it would be his third offense, “required [the state] to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that [Snell] had at least two prior convictions of domestic violence offenses.” See G.L. 1956 § 12-29-5. 3 The hearing justice considered the stipulation to be a tactical decision, reasoning that Snell’s trial counsel chose to stipulate to the existence of the prior convictions, “[r]ather than allow[ing] the jury to see or consider the certified copies of the convictions and to hear the details of the prior crimes * * * as well as the resulting sentences imposed for each of those prior convictions * * * .” The hearing justice further noted that “the trial court properly characterized the prior convictions as elements of crimes charged and cautioned the jury from considering or using [the stipulation] for any other purpose or in any other way.” As to Snell’s contention that his counsel should have stipulated to the convictions outside the presence of the jury, the hearing justice countered that counsel had no control with regard to “whether [the trial court] was going to read that stipulation to the jury[.]” 2', 'Snell also alleged in his application that his trial counsel was deficient by not timely objecting to the fact that he was wearing prison clothes, handcuffs, and leg shackles at trial. He does not press these issues on appeal. 3', 'The Domestic Violence Prevention Act, G.L. 1956 § 12-29-5, provides in pertinent part:', '“(c)(1) Every person convicted of an offense punishable as a misdemeanor', 'involving domestic violence as defined in § 12-29-2 shall:', '“(i) For a second violation be imprisoned for a term of not less than ten', '(10) days and not more than one year.', '“(ii) For a third and subsequent violation be deemed guilty of a felony and', 'be imprisoned for a term of not less than one year and not more than ten (10)', 'years.”', '-3- He also noted that “the Supreme Court upheld the conviction, including the fact that that stipulation was read to the jury.” 4', 'After three unsuccessful appeals, Snell is again before this Court, this time arguing that the hearing justice erred in denying his application for postconviction relief.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“The postconviction remedy, set forth in G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-1, provides that ‘one who has been convicted of a crime may seek collateral review of that conviction based on alleged violations of his or her constitutional rights.’” 5 Anderson v.

Wall, 941 A.2d 189, 193 (R.I. 2008)). To demonstrate a deficiency under the first prong of this analysis, the defendant must establish “that counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.” Rodriguez v. State, 941 A.2d 158, 162 (R.I. 2008) (quoting Brennan v. Vose, 764 A.2d 168, 171 (R.I. 2001)). “This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the ‘counsel’ guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.” Pelletier v. State, 966 A.2d 1237, 1241 (R.I. 2009) (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687). In analyzing counsel’s conduct under the deficiency prong, we are mindful that “there exists ‘a strong presumption [recognized by this Court] that an attorney's performance falls within the range of reasonable professional assistance and sound strategy * * *.’” Rice, 38 A.3d at 17 (quoting Ouimette v.

This prong can be satisfied only upon a showing that “there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.” Id. (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694)."", 'On appeal, Snell contends that his trial counsel was ineffective because he stipulated to Snell’s two prior convictions for domestic assault in the presence of the jury. Specifically, Snell claims that the existence of his two prior domestic assault convictions should have been taken into account as sentencing enhancements, not as elements of the offense, and so their admission for the jury’s consideration was improper.', 'Snell argues that his trial counsel’s failure to recognize that the prior convictions were sentencing factors rendered him deficient. In support of his claim, Snell cites to this Court’s decision in State v. Ramirez, 936 A.2d 1254, 1268 (R.I. 2007), in which the defendant challenged the enhanced sentence he received as a habitual offender on the grounds that his Sixth Amendment rights were violated because his sentence was based on prior convictions not found by the jury. Snell relies on dicta 6 from Ramirez, in which we noted that, in the context of the habitual offender statute, G.L. 1956 § 12-19-21, “a prior judgment of conviction as reflected in a genuine court document is sufficient proof and need not be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.” Ramirez, 936 A.2d at 1271.

Ramirez, 936 A.2d 1254, 1269 (R.I. 2007), we first held that the defendant’s Sixth Amendment challenge had not been raised at the time of sentencing and was, therefore, waived. This Court nevertheless went on to discuss the defendant’s arguments, after prefacing the discussion by stating that “were this argument properly before us, it is without merit.” Id.', '-6- offender statute, are not elements of the crime for which he was charged and need not be submitted to the jury. 7', ""Snell’s argument misses the mark. This Court has not yet had an opportunity to interpret the Domestic Violence Prevention Act, § 12-29-5, to determine whether the prior convictions required therein are elements of the underlying offense or merely sentencing factors and we need not do so today. The circumstances before the trial justice, at best, presented a novel issue. In fact, it is notable that all of the parties involved, including the trial justice and the prosecutor, treated the prior convictions as an element of the crime. Numerous state and federal courts have addressed the issue of whether a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel may be founded based on a novel legal argument or theory of defense, concluding that the “failure to advance novel legal theories or arguments does not constitute ineffective performance.” Ledbetter v. Commissioner of Correction, 880 A.2d 160, 167 (Conn. 2005); see Anderson v. United States, 393 F.3d 749, 754 (8th Cir. 2005) (“Counsel's failure to raise this novel argument does not render his performance constitutionally ineffective.”); People v. Reed, 556 N.W.2d 858, 863 (Mich. 1996) (“[D]efense counsel's performance cannot be deemed deficient for failing to advance a novel legal argument.”); see also United States v. Fusaro, 708 F.2d 17, 26 (1st Cir. 1983) (defense counsel's “failure to spot” a novel claim did “not render counsel's assistance below the range of competence of attorneys”); cf. Engle v. Isaac, 456 U.S. 107, 134 (1982) (“[T]he Constitution guarantees criminal defendants only a fair trial and a competent attorney. It 7"", 'Notably, Snell’s reliance on the dicta from Ramirez is misplaced. First, Ramirez considered stipulations outside of the presence of the jury in a wholly different context—the habitual offender statute. Thus, Snell’s trial counsel would not necessarily be deficient by neglecting to predict that we may interpret the Domestic Violence Prevention Act in a similar manner. Moreover, Snell’s trial counsel cannot possibly have been expected to rely on our decision in Ramirez in making his trial decisions in 2001, because our decision in Ramirez was not published until 2007.', '-7- does not insure that defense counsel will recognize and raise every conceivable constitutional claim.”). We agree with this view, and conclude that defense counsel’s failure to raise a novel legal issue does not render his performance deficient.', 'Snell also contends that his trial counsel’s conduct in stipulating to his prior convictions in the presence of the jury was objectively unreasonable. In support, Snell cites to Old Chief v. United States, 519 U.S. 172, 180-92 (1997), in which the Supreme Court held that, based on Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, the risk of unfair prejudice substantially outweighed the value of the prosecution introducing a record of conviction when a stipulation was available. Snell relies on the Court’s reasoning that evidence of a defendant’s prior conviction “generally carries a risk of unfair prejudice to the defendant”, Old Chief, 519 U.S. at 185, to support his argument that it was objectively unreasonable for his trial attorney to stipulate to the prior convictions in the presence of the jury.', ""Contrary to Snell’s assertions, however, merely because defense counsel may have the option of stipulating outside of the presence of the jury does not always require such conduct. In some instances, stipulating to facts in the presence of the jury may be considered trial strategy. Indeed, in a case such as this, where the prosecutor, trial judge, and defense attorney all considered the fact of prior convictions to be an element of the offense, it may have been sound trial strategy for the defense attorney to stipulate to the prior convictions rather than run the risk that the graphic details of the offenses might be presented to the jury. As we have previously recognized, “a choice between trial tactics, which appears unwise only in hindsight, does not constitute constitutionally deficient representation * * *.” Rice, 38 A.3d at 18 (quoting State v. D'Alo, 477 A.2d 89, 92 (R.I. 1984)). Therefore, we cannot say that Snell’s trial counsel was deficient."", '-8-', 'Accordingly, we hold that Snell has failed to meet his burden in seeking to prove his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Snell’s plaints can be categorized as either taking issue with his trial counsel’s failure to raise a novel legal issue or faulting counsel for making tactical decisions that an otherwise reasonably competent trial attorney would make. In either event, the trial counsel’s conduct cannot be said to be deficient; and, therefore, the hearing justice did not err in denying Snell’s application for postconviction relief.', 'Notably, even if Snell were able to establish that his trial counsel was ineffective for stipulating to his prior offenses in the presence of the jury, he would be unsuccessful in satisfying the “prejudice” prong of the Strickland test. The trial counsel’s mention of the existence of two prior domestic violence offenses pales in comparison to the evidence presented to the jury of Snell’s egregious behavior in the case at hand. Additionally, the trial justice gave a cautionary instruction to the jury, instructing them that they were not to consider the previous convictions as evidence that Snell had a propensity to commit the charged offenses. Therefore, we are satisfied that Snell’s right to a fair trial was not prejudiced by his trial counsel’s conduct.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

He didn’t understand basic boundaries, would get in people’s space, touch them inappropriately, go up to kids on the playground and get in their space, climb on the laps of kids in school * * *.” Dill further testified that Jake exhibited symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), including nightmares, flat affect, and “a lot of talk about death.” As to Lily, Dill testified that her physical neglect was “extreme. She was very, very weak, couldn’t climb stairs, very underweight, very difficult to understand her, her speech. * * * Emotionally she too was showing some signs of attachment disorder, and * * * again, boundary issues, climbing into anybody’s lap, running up and hugging anybody.”', 'Dill further testified that Lily’s PTSD symptoms included not going to sleep, screaming from bed, and deliberately wetting her pants during the day.', 'Jake and Lily were placed with their maternal aunt, and lived with their two cousins and their foster father. Dill testified that both children “wanted very much to immediately integrate with their new foster family.” Dill further testified that, after three to four months of therapy, it was “clinically striking” that both children did not “talk more about missing their mother, and it surprised [her] that they didn’t talk more about wanting to go home. They very much just wanted to be in the present. They were angry with their father.” Dill also relayed that Jake and', '-4- Lily referred to their foster parents as mom and dad within three days of living with them, and they referred to respondent as “bad dad.” After approximately fifteen months of living with their foster family, Dill testified that “[t]he kids were thriving in the home environment, very comfortable there, sleeping well, eating well, had gained activities of daily living skills, were not afraid anymore of most of the things they’d been afraid of before, were no longer talking about the trauma incident or constant talk of death and dying.” Dill opined that the children “would be best off staying in their current placement. It’s been a stable placement, and they seem to be very comfortable there and feel like part of the family now. * * * [I]t would be harmful to them to be moved out of that placement.”', 'Bethany Gregor, a social caseworker with DCYF, testified about the variety of both home-based and community services that had been provided to the children. Gregor testified that, based on her personal observations of the children in their foster home, the relationship between the children, their aunt, and their foster father was “very close” and “very bonded.” 4', 'On November 26, 2013, the trial justice held a permanency hearing, at which respondent testified.

Before she read her decision, she noted that the Family Court had been advised that respondent’s attorney, who had represented him during the trial, would not be able to appear for the bench decision because he was at a hearing in Superior Court; she added that he had indicated his intent to file a motion to withdraw because respondent had filed a disciplinary complaint against him as well as a lawsuit against him in federal court. 5 The trial justice asked another attorney “to sit in and to take notes on behalf of the respondent and to consult with the respondent if necessary regarding the decision.” Substitute counsel entered his appearance on behalf of respondent.

The trial justice stated that she found each of the four witnesses to be truthful and credible, and she made twenty-two formal findings of fact regarding respondent’s actions on January 22, 2012, and the consequences that emanated therefrom. Based on these findings of fact, she found that “respondent ha[d] indeed abused and neglected Lily and Jake [G.];” and she ordered that “Lily and Jake are now committed to the care, custody, and control of DCYF.”', 'The trial justice also found “that [respondent] ha[d] been in jail since January of 2012 and there [we]re no other viable members of * * * respondent’s family who could have the placement of the two children.”', 'The trial justice found “by clear and convincing evidence that the children’s lives ha[d] been enriched by placement with their aunt” and described the progress that Jake and Lily had made socially and educationally.

The trial justice also found as a fact that “it is in the children’s best interests to know that they can enjoy a permanent home with their loving aunt and her family.”', 'Ultimately, the trial justice terminated respondent’s parental rights to Jake and Lily in accordance with § 15-7-7(a)(2).

Nonetheless, the GAL addresses this issue by arguing that, even with a timely objection before the trial justice, any error would have been harmless because the trial justice advised substitute counsel that he would be granted “a lot of leeway” and asked him to pay close attention to what she said because he would have an opportunity to suggest corrections or additions. For its part, DCYF argues that the trial justice did not have an obligation to render her decision from the bench with respondent present as she could have issued a written decision instead. DCYF also argues that there are no specific due process rights associated with the manner in which a trial justice renders a decision on a TPR petition.', 'After carefully reviewing the record, we discern no error in the manner in which the trial justice proceeded to render her decision. Assuming without deciding that the issue has been properly preserved, we fail to see any due process rights that have been implicated. The trial justice in this case was not obligated to render her decision from the bench; she could have simply chosen to file a written decision. Thus her reading of the lengthy decision, comprising over seventy-two transcript pages, was essentially a formality.', 'Contrary to respondent’s contentions on appeal, the record discloses that the trial justice was being very solicitous of his rights.

Furthermore, respondent has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced in any way by either said attorney’s absence during the bench decision or by substitute counsel entering his appearance immediately prior to it.

This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties’ arguments (both written and oral), we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this appeal may be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'The other named defendant, United Investors Life Insurance Co. (United Investors), filed a “Motion for Leave to File a Counterclaim and Cross-Claim for Interpleader, to Deposit Funds into the Court Registry and to be Discharged.” The Superior Court issued an order on March 6, 2012, granting the motion filed by United Investors. Thus, after depositing the disputed funds in the registry of the Superior Court, United Investors ceased to be a party to this action and, accordingly, is not a party to this appeal.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In 2003, Robert Loppi purchased a life insurance policy from United Investors Life Insurance Co. (United Investors), in which, the parties agree, he initially named his wife, Marilyn Loppi, as the beneficiary. In 2008, Marilyn2 filed for divorce from Robert. On July 19, 2008, Robert was served with the summons and complaint in that divorce action. However, on July 17, 2008, before the service of the divorce summons and complaint, Robert had applied (through a signed written request) to United Investors to change the beneficiary on his life insurance policy; the new beneficiary was Robert’s uncle, David Loppi, who is the plaintiff in this action.3', 'On March 27, 2009, in the course of the divorce proceeding, an interlocutory order was entered in Family Court ordering that life insurance policies, annuities, and investment policies be “cashed in forthwith” and that the cash surrender value be divided equally between Robert and Marilyn. That interlocutory order instructed Robert and Marilyn to “execute any and all documents as needed to cash in said accounts, inclusive of any and all authorizations necessary for the attorneys to obtain information or for the policies to be liquidated and/or powers of attorney so that counsel for the parties may do so for the parties.” However, on May 28, 2009, before he had complied with that part of the just-referenced interlocutory Family Court order relating to the cash value of the life insurance policy at issue and before a final judgment was entered in the divorce action, Robert passed away. 2', 'Due to the fact that the persons involved in this case share the same last name, we shall refer to them by their first names. In doing so, we intend no disrespect. 3', 'It is important to note that the United Investors insurance policy states that changes in beneficiaries “take effect on the date the request was signed[.]”', '-2-', 'According to the complaint filed by David in Superior Court, after Robert’s death United Investors declined to pay the life insurance death benefit, the face amount of which was $375,000, to either David or Marilyn, even though United Investors acknowledged that David was the named beneficiary. In consequence, on October 21, 2009, David filed the instant action in Superior Court, seeking a declaratory judgment that he alone was entitled to the life insurance policy death benefit. On December 1, 2011, Marilyn filed a document which indicated that it constituted both an objection to David’s complaint seeking a declaratory judgment and a cross- motion for declaratory judgment. On March 8, 2012, David filed a “Motion to Close Record and Submit for Decision.”', 'On April 17, 2012, the hearing justice issued a bench decision. Subsequently, on April 25, 2012, final judgment was entered, granting David’s “Petition for Declaratory Judgment” and denying Marilyn’s “Cross-Motion for Declaratory Judgment.” The final judgment specifically stated that David was “entitled to 100% of the policy proceeds” and that Marilyn was “entitled to no portion of the proceeds of the life insurance policy.” Marilyn filed a timely notice of appeal on May 11, 2012.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'On appeal, Marilyn has opted not to submit a transcript of the April 17, 2012 bench decision rendered by the hearing justice in this case.

Additionally, she avers that, had Robert survived, the change in beneficiary on the life insurance policy “would certainly have been ruled invalid by the Family Court.” Moreover, according to Marilyn, the interlocutory Family Court order requiring a fifty-fifty division of the cash value of the life insurance policy is “akin” to an alimony or support order; and, on the basis of that predicate, she submits that equity mandates that she be awarded at least fifty percent of the death benefit. It is her contention that the Superior Court erred when it did', '-4- not give deference to the Family Court’s order concerning the division of the life insurance policy.', 'In response, David argues that, at the time of the change in beneficiary, the Family Court did not have jurisdiction over Robert; David further argues that, at that time, Robert was not subject to any automatic court orders prohibiting any altering or alienation of marital assets, since he had not yet been served with the divorce summons and complaint. He further avers that the divorce action and any interlocutory orders issued by the Family Court during the pendency of the divorce action abated upon Robert’s death. Accordingly, he contends that, as the named beneficiary, he is entitled to the entirety of the life insurance death benefit.', 'This case is by no means one of first impression. In Keidel v. Keidel, 119 R.I. 726, 729, 383 A.2d 264, 266 (1978), this Court held that “it is universally accepted that, divorce being a personal action, the death of one of the parties before the entry of the final decree thereon abates the action.” In Keidel, we then proceeded to a discussion of interlocutory orders issued during a divorce proceeding. Id. at 730-32, 383 A.2d at 266-67. We began our analysis with the fact that it was (and still is) well settled that the Family Court is a “statutory court of special jurisdiction” and its authority to act must be derived from statute. Id. at 731, 383 A.2d at 266; see also Rogers v. Rogers, 98 R.I. 263, 268-69, 201 A.2d 140, 143-44 (1964). Moreover, the Family Court’s jurisdiction over “real and personal property of the parties is ‘ancillary’ and an ‘adjunct to its divorce jurisdiction.’” Keidel, 119 R.I. at 731, 383 A.2d at 267 (quoting Rogers, 98 R.I. at 268- 69, 201 A.2d at 143-44). We also noted in our opinion in that case that there was “substantial authority to the effect that the death of one of the parties abates the entire divorce action, including all ancillary or interlocutory decrees, orders, etc.”', 'Id. at 730, 383 A.2d at 266. Ultimately, we looked approvingly upon that “substantial authority” and held that “[a]n', '-5- interlocutory decree to partition real estate, being ancillary to the court’s divorce jurisdiction, must abate when the divorce action itself abates.” Id. at 730, 732, 383 A.2d at 266, 267.', 'Several years later, in Centazzo v. Centazzo, 556 A.2d 560 (R.I. 1989), we clarified and reiterated our holdings in Keidel. We restated that “[i]n accordance with the maxim actio personalis moritur cum persona, the cause of action of divorce terminates on the death of one of the parties.”4 Id. at 562 (internal quotation marks omitted). Crucially, we then proceeded to address the question of whether the Family Court had jurisdiction over property matters in a divorce action when an interlocutory order involving property distribution had been issued but one of the spouses died before the final judgment of divorce was issued. Id. We cited Keidel for the principle that “an interlocutory judgment granting property rights [during a divorce proceeding] could not be enforced because the judgment’s temporary nature was statutorily prescribed.” Id. at 563. Accordingly, we held that the abatement of a divorce petition in Family Court results in the abatement of any “action with respect to the division of property” that is not encompassed in a final judgment of divorce. Id.', 'When we apply our clear precedent to the case before us, we come to the inescapable conclusion that the divorce action in the Family Court abated at the time of Robert’s death and that any interlocutory orders with respect to the division of property also abated. The instant case raises the same question that we answered in Keidel and Centazzo; it has been our consistent holding that, when a divorce action abates due to the death of one of the spouses, so too do any interlocutory orders with respect to property division. See Centazzo, 556 A.2d at 563; Keidel, 119 R.I. at 732, 383 A.2d at 267. Consequently, the March 27, 2009 Family Court 4', 'The Latin maxim quoted by the Court in Centazzo v. Centazzo, 556 A.2d 560, 562 (R.I. 1989), may be translated as follows: “A personal action dies with the person.”', '-6- order with respect to the division of the cash value of the life insurance policies held by Marilyn and Robert abated at the time of Robert’s death, when the divorce action itself abated.', 'It is further our opinion that Robert was within his rights when he changed the beneficiary of his life insurance policy on July 17, 2008 because he had not yet been served with Marilyn’s divorce complaint.', 'General Laws 1956 § 15-5-14.1(f) prohibits changing the beneficiary of a life insurance policy during the pendency of a divorce action, but that section does not take effect until service of the divorce complaint on the defendant—who in this case was Robert. See § 15-5-14.1(a). In the instant case, service of the divorce complaint on Robert occurred two days after he changed the beneficiary of the life insurance policy at issue. Moreover, under the terms of the life insurance policy itself, the beneficiary is “as stated in the application, unless subsequently changed by the Owner.” The policy requires joint action to change the beneficiary only when there is more than one owner. And the crucial fact is that Robert is the only listed owner of the policy. Accordingly, his change of beneficiary was within his rights as the sole policy owner. Therefore, David is the rightful beneficiary of the life insurance death benefit because Robert was completely within his rights to change the beneficiary on his life insurance policy at the time that he named David as beneficiary. And, in view of the ultimate abatement of the divorce action and of any interlocutory orders relative to the division of property, that change in beneficiary was not altered by anything which transpired in the Family Court prior to Robert’s death.', 'Marilyn contends that the Family Court order which required the liquidation of any life insurance policies and the fifty-fifty split in the cash value of any such policies was “akin” to an alimony or support order; and, on that basis, she argues that the order did not abate on Robert’s death. We need not address whether her contention has a valid legal basis since it does not have', '-7- a valid factual basis.', 'After a thorough review of the May 27, 2009 Family Court order addressing Marilyn and Robert’s life insurance policies, we are convinced that it is not, nor was it ever intended to be, an order of alimony or support. It is clear on its face that it is an order dealing with the division of property; the order addresses the sale of real estate and the cashing in of life insurance policies, annuities, and investment policies, but at no point does it reference support or alimony. Accordingly, it is our view that Marilyn has advanced no argument which convinces us that this case is not governed by our clear precedent. Therefore, we hold that the hearing justice did not err in granting David one hundred percent of the life insurance death benefit.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

The next morning, co-counsel addressed the court directly and stated that he believed he overheard the juror in seat six say to the juror in seat five, “if he can survive melanoma, he can survive this[,]” after the jurors had been dismissed the prior afternoon. The co-counsel explained that he had not thought to report the statement immediately, and he had not told lead counsel about it until late in the evening. Subsequently, plaintiffs’ lead counsel asked the trial justice to discharge the two jurors and allow the alternate jurors to deliberate. He expressed concern that, if the trial justice were to question the jurors, they would know that the statement had been brought to the court’s attention by someone sitting at plaintiffs’ counsel table because of the proximity of the table to the jurors. The trial justice responded that the clerk or court reporter could have reported the juror’s comment.', 'The trial justice interviewed the jurors in question separately, in chambers, and on the record. The trial justice first questioned juror No. 75, who was seated in seat six, about whether she ever stated, “[i]f he survived melanoma, he can survive this.” Juror No. 75 responded, “[n]o. I don’t -- no. On my children’s lives, I didn’t say -- I’m not even sure who -- survived -- no.” When asked whether there were any conversations regarding the case, juror No. 75 replied “[n]o, and let me say, we’re talking about food in there and we are getting along very well, but 100 percent no.” The trial justice then specifically asked juror No. 75 whether she spoke with the juror in seat 5, and she responded, “I asked her for some gum.”', '-2-', 'Thereafter, the trial justice interviewed juror No. 107, who was seated in seat five. The trial justice asked if juror No. 75 had said, “[i]f he survived melanoma, he can survive this.” Juror No. 107 responded, “I didn’t hear that at all.” Juror No. 107 explained that she gave juror No. 75 a piece of gum and added, “that’s it.” Juror No. 107 clarified that she had not had any conversations about the case, and had not made up her mind on the case. The trial justice asked if any other juror said, “[i]f he survived melanoma, he can survive this[.]” Juror No. 107 answered, “[n]o. I wouldn’t -- I’m a survivor. I--[,]” at which point the trial justice interrupted the juror.', 'Subsequently, the trial justice stated, “I’m satisfied based on my conversations with the two jurors that they were talking about gum,” and that “[i]f there were conversations, it [sic] must have been misunderstood.” The plaintiffs objected and made an oral motion to pass the case. The defendants objected to plaintiffs’ motion, noting that the jurors seemed generally surprised at the court’s questions. The defendants argued that speaking with the jurors was the appropriate method for the trial justice to determine whether the jurors should be excused.', 'The trial justice denied plaintiffs’ motion to pass the case, stating that she had observed the jurors and their demeanor and that “[t]hey were completely taken aback. I didn’t sense from them any apprehension. I thought that their answers were honest and open, and I believe that they were telling the truth.” The plaintiffs once again objected, arguing, “there’s an opportunity to cure the defect, those jurors should be excused and the alternates should take the [sic] place.” The trial justice responded that there was no defect and again stated she was “satisfied with what [she’d] heard” from the jurors.', 'Prior to releasing all of the jurors to begin their deliberations, the trial justice asked them whether any of the jurors had had any conversations regarding the case with anyone, including', '-3- other jurors, and they responded “[n]o.” After deliberating, the jury returned a verdict for defendants, and judgment was entered on January 31, 2014.

On July 19, 2013, a Providence County Superior Court jury found the defendant, Christopher Swiridowsky (defendant or Swiridowsky), guilty of three counts of first degree sexual assault in violation of G.L. 1956 §§ 11-37-2 and 11-37-3, guilty of one count of assault with the intent to commit a sexual assault in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-1, and not guilty of one count of kidnapping under G.L. 1956 § 11-26-1. On October 15, 2013, the trial justice sentenced the defendant. With respect to the first three counts, the defendant was sentenced to forty years imprisonment for each, with twenty-five years to serve and the remaining time suspended, with probation, to run concurrently. On count four, the defendant was sentenced to ten years imprisonment, with two years to serve and the remaining time suspended with probation, to run consecutively to the first three counts.', 'On appeal, the defendant contends that the trial justice erred in: (1) permitting the state to impeach him with a prior conviction for assault; and (2) denying his motion for a new trial. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The incident giving rise to defendant’s conviction occurred in the early morning of October 28, 2007, in Providence, Rhode Island. After the alleged sexual assaults occurring on that date, swabs were taken from the mouth and vagina of the complaining witness, Sarah. 1 Over three years later, on January 13, 2011, the DNA sample that had been taken from Sarah’s mouth was matched to defendant through a nationwide database of DNA profiles known as CODIS (Combined DNA Index System).', 'On December 1, 2011, defendant was charged by indictment with the above-referenced offenses. The defendant’s trial began on July 16, 2013. The state presented six witnesses,2 including Sarah, whose credibility defendant now contests on appeal. The defense presented five witnesses, 3 including defendant himself. During trial, it was undisputed that the paths of Sarah and defendant crossed on October 28, 2007. However, the testimony diverges as to exactly what happened prior to and during the encounter between them. The relevant portions of such testimony are summarized below. 1', 'We use a pseudonym to protect the privacy of the complaining witness. 2', 'The state’s other witnesses included the officer who responded to the call from Sarah’s roommates on the night of the incident, Officer Paul Principale; the registered nurse who attended to Sarah and administered the sexual assault evidence collection kit, Amy Corrado; Sarah’s roommate when the incident at issue occurred, Holly Marshall; the supervisor of the forensic biology DNA laboratory at the Department of Health who examined the swabs taken from Sarah, Cara Lupino; and the detective who worked on identifying the perpetrator of the sexual assault, Det. Douglas Allin. 3', 'The defense’s other witnesses were all character witnesses: Michael Guzman, Belinda Myers, Pastor Jose Rivera, and Cherie Castro.', '-2-', 'A', 'Conflicting Trial Testimonies', '1. Sarah’s Testimony', 'In October of 2007, Sarah was employed as a “salad and pizza cook” at Nordstrom’s Café at the Providence Place Mall. On October 27, 2007, she worked until 9 p.m., at which time she changed out of her work uniform and walked to the City Café, a place that she frequented three or four times per week. There, Sarah consumed about four vodka and cranberry juice drinks. At some point during her stay at the City Café, her friend, Matt, arrived and sat next to her until between one and two in the morning. Sarah then left the City Café and walked with Matt to his apartment.', 'The two remained at Matt’s apartment until “sometime before five o’clock in the morning,” when Sarah left because “[i]t was getting late, and the night was over.” Sarah testified that, although Matt offered her a ride home, she declined and decided to walk home because “[they] both had been drinking.” Before leaving, Sarah indicated to Matt that she would send him a text message when she arrived at her apartment to let him know that she had arrived safely. However, she testified that she actually sent him a text message letting him know that she was home and safe “about two and a half blocks, maybe three blocks from [her] house.” She explained that it was not uncommon for her to send such a message when she got close to home, rather than waiting until she arrived.', 'At trial, Sarah explained that, shortly after she sent the text message, a “dark-colored SUV” pulled up next to her, driven by a man with a shaved head who was wearing a white T- shirt. The driver asked if she wanted a ride, to which she replied, “No. I’m all set. Thanks.” She then continued to walk and the car came up next to her again, but this time the driver asked', '-3- if she “wanted to get high.” She testified that again she replied, “No. I’m all set. Thanks.” She explained at trial that the SUV then turned and she continued to walk, but “a few second[s] later, [she] heard someone yell, ‘Yo, yo,’ behind [her].” She further recounted that, when she went to turn, she was grabbed by the hair on the back of her head and was told: “Now you don’t have a choice.” She testified that she attempted to take her cell phone out of her pocket to call for help, but the man noticed what she was trying to do and grabbed her wrist. Sarah then testified that, after she promised that she would not try to call anybody, the man let her maintain possession of the phone. She recounted during trial that the man dragged her toward the dark-colored SUV, during which time she was attempting to get away and make it “as difficult as possible” for the man to drag her by “trying to move [her] hands * * * [and] tr[ying] to drop [her] weight to the ground.” She explained that, in response to her challenging gestures, the man struck her in the side of the head, after which she got into the vehicle.', 'Sarah then testified that, when she was placed in the SUV, the man walked around the car and got into the driver’s side. She further testified that she did not attempt to get out of the car, stating, “[a]t that point I was frozen, and the door – I heard the locks go, and I was just too scared to move.” Thereafter, according to Sarah’s testimony, the man drove “about a block and a half, two blocks [and w]hen the car finally stopped, [she] could see her apartment.” She next testified that, when the vehicle stopped, the man said, “[j]ust do what I tell you to do, and I’ll let you go home.” She explained that the man then told her that he wanted her to perform oral sex on him, but she repeatedly refused, causing the man to “pull[] out a gun, * * * put it in [her] mouth, and [tell her] to hand over [her] bag.” She recounted that she then handed her bag to him; and, after he removed her identification from her wallet, he stated that he had her address and, if she did not cooperate, “he would come and shoot [her] and whoever lived with [her].” Sarah testified', '-4- that he then forced her to perform oral sex on him. In her testimony, she stated that the man later pointed the gun at her again and told her that he wanted her to take her clothes off. She testified that she complied with his request. Sarah further testified that he then told her to get on top of him in the driver’s seat at which point he forced her to engage in vaginal intercourse. At trial, Sarah stated that the man then told her to perform oral sex on him again, which she did. She testified that the man then pushed her off and stated, “I’m not giving you evidence, bitch.” She further testified that the man then pushed her out of the passenger door, told her to lie on the sidewalk with her face down, and threw her belongings at her.', 'At trial, Sarah testified that once the SUV drove away, she ran screaming toward her house, “slam[med] on the door, and it woke up [her] roommates.” She recounted that when her roommates opened the door, she collapsed, and one of her roommates called the police. After the police arrived, Sarah was transported by ambulance to Women and Infants Hospital. Sarah testified that while at the hospital she gave a statement to police and a sexual assault evidence collection kit was administered, which included a swab of Sarah’s mouth and vagina. Sarah then testified that she was asked by the police to look at photos to identify the perpetrator, but she was unable to conclusively identify the person who committed the offenses.', 'On cross-examination, Sarah confirmed her earlier testimony from direct examination that the man did not pull the gun out while they were on the street. When questioned about statements that she made immediately following the accident, Sarah indicated that she did not remember telling the nurse, EMT driver, or the responding police officer that she was forced into the vehicle at gunpoint, as opposed to having the gun pulled out after she entered the vehicle.', '-5-', '2. Swiridowsky’s Testimony', 'At the close of the state’s case, defendant moved for judgment of acquittal, which the court denied. The defense then presented its case, calling defendant as its first witness. The defendant testified to a markedly different account of events occurring on October 27 and 28, 2007. He testified that he was at a Halloween party until approximately midnight, at which time he left and went to another party until about 4:30 a.m. There, defendant and a friend were using cocaine, smoking marijuana, and drinking alcohol. The defendant testified that, after leaving the second party, he was driving back to his house and his friend was following behind him in another vehicle. The defendant stated at trial that he came upon Sarah, who was walking down the street, and asked her if she needed a ride, which she declined. He explained that his friend then called him on his cell phone, stating, “Why don’t you pick up that girl? She’s out there at five o’clock in the morning. She’s obviously up to something.” The defendant next testified that he circled his car around and asked Sarah if she “want[ed] to get high?”', 'According to defendant’s testimony, this sparked an exchange in which Sarah told him she was already on her way to meet a friend for cocaine and directed him to pull into a nearby driveway to wait for her to return.', 'At trial, defendant next stated that he “got antsy sitting in the truck,” so he got out of the vehicle and walked to Admiral Street, where he saw Sarah walking back toward him. According to defendant’s testimony, Sarah had been unable to obtain any drugs, so the two went back to defendant’s vehicle to use the cocaine that he had in his possession. The defendant testified that the two then ingested cocaine in the car at the location where it had been parked. He then asked Sarah if she wanted a ride home, which she answered in the affirmative. The defendant further', '-6- testified that she gave him directions to her house and, when Sarah’s house was in sight, she directed him to stop the vehicle because she did not want her roommates to see them.', 'The defendant testified that she then asked for more cocaine before getting out of the truck. According to his testimony, he initially declined, but then offered her cocaine in exchange for what he “implied” was oral sex. He testified that the two then engaged in vaginal intercourse after he suggested that he would give her more cocaine if she agreed. He further testified that to avoid getting her pregnant, the encounter transitioned back to oral sex.', 'According to his testimony, he agreed to alert her before ejaculating, because she did not want him to ejaculate in her mouth. He testified that he did not so alert her and he ejaculated in her mouth, causing her to become very upset. He explained that she angered him by screaming while they were in a “quiet residential neighborhood,” so he refused to give her more cocaine and told her to get out of his vehicle. At trial, he stated that, after she refused to get out of the vehicle, he grabbed her clothing and other belongings and threw them out of the vehicle’s window into the street. According to defendant’s testimony, he reached across, pulled the door handle, and pushed her out of the vehicle.', 'B', 'Swiridowsky’s Prior Assault Conviction', 'Prior to trial, the court considered the admissibility of three of defendant’s prior criminal convictions: an assault conviction, a conviction for leaving the scene of an accident, and a larceny conviction.', 'Preliminarily, the trial justice determined that the assault and larceny convictions would be admissible, but the conviction for leaving the scene of the accident would not be allowed into evidence. However, before defendant testified, the trial justice revisited his ruling on the admissibility of defendant’s convictions. At that point, the trial justice ruled that all', '-7- three prior convictions were admissible, 4 noting that the prior convictions had “substantial probative value.” In ruling on the assault conviction, the trial justice noted:', '“[T]he Connecticut act * * * is a violent act. It’s a prior conviction, and it does', 'once again go to the defendant’s questionable conduct and outward violations of', 'the law. * * * [I]t certainly seems to go to his propensity to violate the law.', '“All of this is important for the jury to know in considering whether or not', 'he is answering the questions credibly. * * * [I]n State v. McWilliams, * * * there', 'is a line that contains the quote, ‘A jury has the right to weigh whether one who', 'repeatedly refuses to comply with society’s rules is more likely to ignore the oath', 'requiring veracity on the witness stand than a law-abiding citizen.’', '“By limiting the jury from being able to hear these prior convictions, the', '[c]ourt is concerned it’s creating a legal fix, in masking the truth about whether or', 'not the defendant can be truthful while on the stand, and the [c]ourt is hiding a', 'number of convictions which do have something to do with his compliance with', 'the law and his veracity.”', 'When defendant ultimately took the stand, defense counsel began eliciting responses about defendant’s past convictions. In so doing, defendant answered in the affirmative to a question posed by defense counsel asking whether defendant “plea[ded] to a charge of assault in Connecticut.” The defendant then recounted the details of the facts underlying the assault conviction.', 'Defense counsel objected when the state on cross-examination inquired into the facts underlying the Connecticut assault charge. In ruling on the objection, the trial justice stated, in the presence of the jury:', '“[L]et me tell the jury that when we’re talking about the defendant’s prior', 'convictions, it’s solely for your consideration in evaluating the defendant’s', 'credibility, any witness’s credibility. I’m instructing you that you may consider', 'that evidence of a prior conviction in evaluating credibility, and that there’s', 'usually no other purpose, no probative force as proof of this crime, the crimes', 'alleged in this indictment, the four charges before you.” 4', 'On appeal, defendant challenges only the trial justice’s decision to allow impeachment of defendant by evidence of his prior assault conviction. The defendant does not challenge the admissibility of his convictions for leaving the scene of an accident and larceny.', '-8- The state then proceeded to ask questions about the facts underlying the same convictions that had been delved into on direct examination.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“It is well settled in this jurisdiction that ‘[t]he trial justice is vested with a considerable degree of discretion in deciding whether or not to admit evidence of prior convictions to impeach a witness.’” State v. Gongoleski, 14 A.3d 218, 222 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Remy, 910 A.2d 793, 796 (R.I. 2006)). Accordingly, “this Court will not overturn such a decision on appeal unless there has been an abuse of that discretion.” State v. McRae, 31 A.3d 785, 789 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Gongoleski, 14 A.3d at 222).', ""In regard to the motion for a new trial, “this Court ‘accord[s] great weight to a trial justice's ruling on [such a motion] if he or she has articulated sufficient reasoning in support of the ruling.’” State v.

Cipriano, 21 A.3d 408, 429 (R.I. 2011)).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Impeachment with Assault Conviction', ""On appeal, defendant challenges the trial justice's midtrial ruling 5 permitting impeachment by admission of defendant’s prior conviction for assault. He asserts that the trial justice improperly balanced the probative value and the prejudicial effect of the conviction. He further contends that the trial justice’s error resulted in substantial prejudice to defendant, which was not cured by the trial justice’s “brief, bare-boned limiting instruction” given to the jury. We disagree."", 'As a threshold matter, the state asserts that this contention should be deemed to have been waived because evidence of the prior assault conviction was elicited during direct examination of defendant.', 'Notably, this Court has not had the opportunity to address whether such circumstances would preclude defendant from challenging on appeal the trial justice’s determination based on Rule 609 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. However, the state urges this Court to adopt a rule similar to the rule adopted by the United States Supreme Court in regard to Rule 609 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. See Ohler v. United States, 529 U.S. 753, 5', 'In his brief, defendant also argues that the trial justice erroneously based his pretrial decision on Rule 404 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, claiming that “the looping and often outright erroneous reasoning that led the trial court to its decision reveals a mosaic of prejudicial error that also highlights the improper way in which this jury likely considered that evidence.” However, defendant also recognized that only the final ruling by the trial justice, which happened midtrial, is the subject of this appeal. We agree, and so we do not address defendant’s Rule 404 argument as an independent contention. Instead, we consider the trial justice’s pretrial ruling only as it relates to his final ruling.', '- 10 - 760 (2000) (holding that, even where there has been an in limine ruling permitting impeachment by a prior conviction, “a defendant who preemptively introduces evidence of a prior conviction on direct examination may not on appeal claim that the admission of such evidence was error”). Because we are satisfied that the trial justice in this case did not abuse his discretion in permitting impeachment by introduction of defendant’s prior assault conviction, we need not make such a determination. We save for another day, therefore, the question of whether a defendant in a criminal case should be deemed to have waived his right to challenge a trial justice’s Rule 609 determination under the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence by delving into the conviction on direct examination.', 'Turning to the merits, Rule 609 provides for the admission of evidence of a witness’s prior convictions unless the trial justice determines that the prejudicial effect of the conviction substantially outweighs its probative value. 6 “In contrast to Rule 609 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, our Rule 609 provides that the prior conviction need not involve dishonesty, false statement, or a felony to be admissible [for impeachment purposes].” McRae, 31 A.3d at 792 (quoting Gongoleski, 14 A.3d at 222-23).', 'The rationale behind admission of all prior convictions for the purpose of impeachment, instead of only those involving dishonesty, “is that the jury should be able to consider whether or not a person who has previously broken the law 6', 'Specifically, Rule 609 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence states in pertinent part:', '“(a) General Rule. For the purpose of attacking the credibility of a witness,', 'evidence that the witness has been convicted of a crime shall be admitted if', 'elicited from the witness or established by public record.', '“(b) Discretion. Evidence of a conviction under this rule is not admissible', 'if the court determines that its prejudicial effect substantially outweighs the', 'probative value of the conviction.

In discussing the three prior convictions, the trial justice recognized that, “[e]ven though the [c]ourt was highly concerned about the prejudice before, the prejudicial value must be weighed with the probative value.” Concluding that there was “substantial probative value,” the trial justice determined that the prejudicial effect would not render the prior convictions inadmissible.', 'In addition, the trial justice discussed the conviction as being illustrative of defendant’s outward violations of the law and indicated that the jury may infer that defendant’s repeated refusals to comply with society’s rules may lead him to be more likely to ignore the oath and to testify falsely. Further, the trial justice noted that he was concerned with “masking the truth about whether or not the defendant can be truthful while on the stand * * * [by] hiding a number of convictions which do have something to do with his compliance with the law and his veracity.” The trial justice was within his discretion to conclude that defendant’s assault conviction was admissible to impeach defendant’s credibility.', ""The defendant argues that the admission of his two other felony convictions (one conviction for leaving the scene of an accident and one conviction for larceny) was sufficient for impeachment and rendered any probative value of introducing another conviction negligible. However, given the posture of defendant’s criminal history, we conclude that the admission of the assault conviction was highly probative, as it conveyed to the jury that defendant’s history of disregarding society’s rules has spanned more than just one year. It is well settled that the probative importance of a criminal conviction is derived from this Court’s recognition that “[a] jury has the right to weigh whether one who repeatedly refuses to comply with society's rules is"", '- 12 - more likely to ignore the oath requiring veracity on the witness stand than a law abiding citizen.” State v. McWilliams, 47 A.3d 251, 262 (R.I. 2012) (quoting State v. Mattatall, 603 A.2d 1098, 1118 (R.I. 1992)). Notably, defendant’s assault conviction occurred in 2006, while the other two convictions that were admitted for impeachment purposes both occurred in 2010. The disparity in dates would allow the jury to infer that defendant’s repeated refusals to comply with society’s rules were not isolated, but spanned a significant part of defendant’s past. Moreover, it was especially important for the jury to receive this information, since the case largely hinged on a credibility determination between Sarah and defendant.', 'Therefore, the probative value of defendant’s assault conviction was significant.', ""Further, the prejudicial effect of the testimony was not substantial. While defendant points to the similar nature of the prior conviction to the crime charged to argue that the prior conviction was highly prejudicial, 7 this Court has repeatedly recognized “that the similarity of the prior offenses does not render them per se inadmissible for the purpose of impeaching a testifying defendant's character for truthfulness.” State v. Whitfield, 93 A.3d 1011, 1018 (R.I. 2014). In the instant case, defendant’s prior conviction for assault was non-sexual in nature and clearly different from the sexual assaults for which defendant was charged. Indeed, on numerous occasions, we have upheld the admission of prior convictions that were much more similar to the charged crime than in the instant case. See id. at 1017-18 (affirming trial justice’s decision to 7"", ""Similarly, defendant argues that the trial justice also erred by attaching probative importance to the similar nature of the conviction and the charged crime when he noted that the previous conviction was a “violent act.” Our reading of the record, however, indicates that the trial justice merely noted that the prior assault was a violent act. Indeed, the trial justice was required to make such a finding. See State v. Mattatall, 603 A.2d 1098, 1117 (R.I. 1992) (“The trial justice must balance the remoteness of the conviction, the nature of the crime, and the defendant's disdain for the law as represented by the extent of his prior criminal record, to determine whether the relevance with respect to credibility outweighs the prejudicial effect to the defendant.” (emphasis added)). Accordingly, we find defendant’s argument unconvincing."", '- 13 - allow fourteen of the defendant’s prior convictions, including some for assault and battery, to impeach the credibility of the defendant, who was on trial for assault); Remy, 910 A.2d at 799 (affirming trial justice’s decision to allow the defendant’s prior convictions for simple assault and misdemeanor domestic assault to impeach the credibility of the defendant, who was on trial for assault with a dangerous weapon). The prior conviction for assault at issue in this case is no more prejudicial than the similar, and sometimes identical, prior convictions of the defendants in the cases cited above. Accordingly, the similarity between defendant’s prior conviction of assault and the charges for which he was being tried was simply not enough to produce such a prejudicial effect that substantially outweighed its significant probative value.', ""We note that the trial justice also gave a cautionary instruction, tempering any potential prejudice to defendant. The defendant contends that this cautionary instruction was ineffective because it was “brief [and] bare-boned,” and because the instruction was given only once during trial. 8 We are not convinced. When a trial justice decides to give a cautionary instruction, this Court must determine whether the instruction “can be fairly said to have removed from [the jurors' minds], when weighing the evidence properly before them, the taint represented by the enveloping smoke of a criminal record.” State v. Coleman, 909 A.2d 929, 936 (R.I. 2006) (quoting State v. Brown, 528 A.2d 1098, 1103 (R.I. 1987)). Here, the trial justice instructed the jury that the prior conviction might be considered “in evaluating credibility, and * * * there’s 8"", 'The defendant also takes issue with the fact that the prosecutor highlighted the convictions in closing arguments, asserting that a timely instruction from the court was necessary at this time to prevent the jury from using the prior convictions improperly. However, defense counsel did not object to the state’s closing arguments and did not request a cautionary instruction. The defendant’s argument that one should have been provided is, therefore, waived. State v. Portes, 840 A.2d 1131, 1141 (R.I. 2004) (“[F]or a defendant to preserve a question of prejudicial error in closing argument for our review, he [or she] must not only make an objection at the time, but must make a request for cautionary instructions * * *.”).', '- 14 - usually no other purpose, no probative force as proof of this crime.” We are satisfied that, with this concise instruction, the trial justice adequately delineated the limited purpose for which the evidence was admitted.', 'B', 'Denial of Motion for New Trial', '“When deciding whether to grant or deny a motion for a new trial, ‘the trial justice acts as a thirteenth juror.’” State v. Navarro, 33 A.3d 147, 156 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Pineda, 13 A.3d 623, 640-41 (R.I. 2011)). “The trial justice must (1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” Id. (quoting Pineda, 13 A.3d at 641). The motion for a new trial should be denied if, after conducting this independent review, “the trial justice concludes that reasonable minds could differ as to the result or if the trial justice reaches the same conclusion as the jury did * * *.” Pineda, 13 A.3d at 641 (quoting State v. Espinal, 943 A.2d 1052, 1058 (R.I. 2008)).', 'We perceive no error in the trial justice’s denial of the motion for a new trial. In conducting his review of the trial proceedings, the trial justice determined that “[Sarah] was credible, very credible, consistent and detailed.”', 'He also recognized that “she remained consistent and credible even through cross-examination.” After evaluating the testimony and credibility of the rest of the state’s witnesses, the trial justice turned to the testimony of defendant. He considered defendant’s testimony regarding his prior convictions, noting that defendant’s testimony on direct examination often left many details to later be exposed through cross-examination. The trial justice then concluded that he found defendant “not credible,', '- 15 - manipulative and self-justifying particularly in regards to his obvious past criminal behavior.” The trial justice also evaluated defendant’s character witnesses, determining that, “[a]lthough they all seem to be fine, compassionate people who actually cared about Mr. Swiridowsky * * * [t]hey did not know of [his] criminal history * * * and, therefore, the [c]ourt can’t give any significant weight to their testimony about what type of person Mr. Swiridowsky is.” Ultimately, the trial justice concluded that he was “far more inclined to find [Sarah] to be truthful and consistent than Mr. Swiridowsky, and [found] that the jury was well within its prerogative to find that the State ha[d] met its high burden of proving its case beyond a reasonable doubt.”', 'Nevertheless, defendant contends that the trial justice erred by failing to consider the weaknesses in Sarah’s account. Specifically, defendant points to Sarah’s testimony at trial that her attacker did not brandish a firearm until they were both in the vehicle and juxtaposes this against her initial report that she had been forced into the vehicle at gunpoint. In addition, defendant questions Sarah’s decision to remain in the vehicle, rather than attempting to flee, when defendant walked around the vehicle to get into the driver’s side. Finally, defendant asserts that it is simply too coincidental that defendant parked within a few houses of Sarah’s apartment, suggesting that Sarah directed him to the location.', 'However, the trial justice was not required to evaluate and refute each weakness in Sarah’s account. In deciding a motion for a new trial, the trial justice does not need to parse through every potential inconsistency or inaccuracy. See Kizekai, 19 A.3d at 589 (“In providing a rationale for a decision, * * * the trial justice need not refer to all the evidence supporting the decision[.]”). In the case at bar, the conflicting accounts between Sarah and defendant rendered the trial largely dependent on a credibility determination. The trial justice, after being present through the trial, assessed the evidence and the credibility of each of the witnesses and', '- 16 - determined that the jury’s verdict was supported by the evidence. Notably, the discrepancies in Sarah’s testimony pointed to by defendant were not so grave as to lead us to conclude that the trial justice “overlooked or misconceived material evidence” in crediting her testimony over that of defendant.', 'Accordingly, the trial justice’s determination, made in accordance with the procedures outlined in our case law, will not be disturbed by this Court. See id. at 590.', 'The defendant also claims that the trial justice’s credibility determination was flawed because he did not analyze defendant’s testimony about the events in question. Contrary to defendant’s assertion, however, the trial justice did consider defendant’s account of the incident. Specifically, the trial justice summarized defendant’s portrayal of the events, stating, “[h]e claimed he had never had difficulty acquiring sexual partners so he would have no need to commit a sexual assault, and he stopped only to offer help and drugs to [Sarah] while she walked the streets of Providence at 5 a.m.” The trial justice determined that defendant was not credible, leading him to dismiss defendant’s account. See Mattatall, 603 A.2d at 1109 (noting that, “when a defendant elects to testify, he runs the very real risk that if disbelieved, the trier of fact may conclude that the opposite of his testimony is the truth”).', ""We perceive no basis for concluding that the trial justice was either clearly wrong or that he misconceived or overlooked material evidence in denying the defendant's motion.

93,(02-2163-4) (02-2163-6) In re Shy C. et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. This case comes before the Supreme Court on an appeal by Jessica Charron contending that the Family Court erred when, on October 17, 2013, following a bench trial, it issued a decree terminating her parental rights to three of her children—Shy C., Mariah C., and Jah-nell B. She posits that both G.L. 1956 § 15-7-7 and this Court’s precedent with respect to the factors to be considered when addressing a petition for termination of parental rights violate her constitutional right to due process. For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the decree of the Family Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The October 17, 2013 Family Court decision issued in this case provides a lengthy, eighty-three page discussion of Ms. Charron’s case, in which the Family Court justice made numerous findings of fact and conclusions of law before ultimately terminating Ms. Charron’s parental rights to the above-referenced children.', 'The Family Court justice found that the', '-1- children had been removed from Ms. Charron’s care on May 19, 2009 after she tested positive for marijuana. He further found that there had been four case plans prepared by the Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) with the goal of reunifying Ms. Charron and her children and that Ms. Charron had been offered and did receive numerous services for mental health issues, substance abuse issues, domestic violence issues, and parenting issues. He then proceeded to find that Ms. Charron was unfit as a parent because she was “unable to complete” her case plans and that DCYF had made “reasonable efforts at reunification;” he concluded that the children had been in the care of DCYF for over twelve months and that there was not a “substantial probability” that the children would return safely to Ms. Charron’s care “within a reasonable period of time.” Finally, after making those determinations, the Family Court justice considered the placements of the children and the length of time that they had been in those placements before he determined that it was in the best interests of the children that Ms. Charron’s parental rights be terminated.', 'On appeal, Ms. Charron limits herself to a purely legal argument; she contends that § 15- 7-7(c) and this Court’s precedent, which regulate the termination of parental rights, “violate[] a parent’s due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment by requiring that the child’s best interests, and integration into the foster family, [be a] part of, and in the same proceeding as, the determination of [parental] ‘fitness.’” Ms. Charron posits that, as a matter of due process, the Family Court must first make a determination of parental unfitness and only after that determination is made may the court consider the best interests of the child before finally', '-2- deciding whether to terminate parental rights. Ms. Charron, by her own admission, did not raise this constitutional argument before the Family Court.1', 'II', 'Analysis', 'This Court has long adhered to an important jurisprudential principle commonly referred to as “the raise or waive rule.” See, e.g., State v. Gomez, 848 A.2d 221, 237 (R.I. 2004). That venerable rule provides that “an issue that has not been raised and articulated previously at trial is not properly preserved for appellate review.” Id. at 237 (internal quotation marks omitted); see State v. Ciresi, 45 A.3d 1201, 1212 (R.I. 2012) (noting that it is “well established” that the rule “precludes a litigant from arguing an issue on appeal that has not been articulated at trial”) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also DeMarco v. Travelers Insurance Co., 26 A.3d 585, 628-29 & n.55 (R.I. 2011). We have provided for one narrow exception to the rule that may be invoked “when basic constitutional rights are concerned.” State v. Russell, 890 A.2d 453, 462 (R.I. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). For the exception to apply, an appellant must show that “the error complained of [goes] beyond the level of harmless error. The record must be sufficient to permit a determination of the issue, and counsel’s failure to raise the issue must be premised upon a novel rule of law that counsel could not reasonably have known during the trial.” State v. Mastracchio, 672 A.2d 438, 446 (R.I. 1996) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Donato, 592 A.2d 140, 141-42 (R.I. 1991).', 'Ms. Charron’s claim does not fit within the exception to the raise or waive rule since the rule of law at issue (namely, the due process clause) could have been reasonably known at the 1', 'We confess to being concerned by the manner in which counsel for Ms. Charron has approached this appeal. Without seeking leave of this Court through a motion, he has expended his energies constructing a constitutional argument that was not even adumbrated at the nisi prius level—in the apparent hope that we would overlook our established law.', '-3- time of the trial in the Family Court. Indeed, Ms. Charron concedes on appeal that her argument does not fit within our raise or waive exception, but she avers that there are “good and sufficient reasons” for this Court to address the merits of her appeal.', 'However, upon a thorough review of the record and careful perusal of Ms. Charron’s argument on appeal, we perceive nothing in this case that would induce us to make an exception to our well-settled raise or waive jurisprudence. See, e.g., Pollard v. Acer Group, 870 A.2d 429, 433 (R.I. 2005) (“In our view, this case falls squarely within the raise or waive rule; and we perceive absolutely no exceptional circumstances here indicating that said rule should be disregarded.”). This is a classic waiver case. Nothing that has been argued before us convinces us to the contrary. Ms. Charron’s contention could have been raised before the Family Court, but it was not. As a consequence, we are deprived of the intellectual analysis that would have been provided by the Family Court justice and by such insights as the Office of the Attorney General might have articulated with respect to the constitutionality of the statutory provisions at issue. And we reiterate that it is our view that Ms. Charron has overlooked our venerable raise or waive doctrine in presenting her argument to this Court.', 'Accordingly, we hold that Ms. Charron’s contention on appeal has been waived.2 As such, we affirm the decree of the Family Court terminating Ms. Charron’s parental rights as concerns her children Shy C., Mariah C., and Jah-nell B. 2', 'We would also briefly note that we have specifically instructed the Family Court that, when applying G.L. 1956 § 15-7-7, a determination as to unfitness of the parent must be made before the best interests of the child are considered. See In re Kristina L., 520 A.2d 574, 582 (R.I. 1987); see also In re Amber P., 877 A.2d 608, 615 (R.I. 2005).

The defendant, Juan Gibson (Gibson or defendant), appeals from an adjudication by a justice of the Superior Court declaring him in violation of the terms and conditions of his probation. The defendant contends that the trial justice acted arbitrarily and capriciously in finding a violation. Having carefully reviewed the memoranda submitted by the parties and the arguments of counsel, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown, and the appeal may be decided at this time. We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'In the early morning hours of May 19, 2013, a violent home invasion occurred at 112 Dawson Street in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. According to the description related by the', '-1- complainant, Jeffrey Lebrun (Jeffrey),1 to the responding officers of the Pawtucket Police Department,2 the invasion was perpetrated by two males, dressed in black and wearing ski masks. Armed with a knife, the shorter of the two perpetrators grabbed Jeffrey’s neck from behind while he was sitting on his couch and began choking him. As Jeffrey struggled with his attacker for possession of the knife, the second assailant, whom Jeffrey later described as approximately five-feet-eight inches to five-feet-ten inches in height, pushed Jeffrey’s head down on the couch. During this struggle, Jeffrey called out to awaken his wife, Sheri, for help. Sheri got out of bed and ran down the stairs in time to see Jeffrey struggling with one of the intruders.3 Sheri then called 911, and the assailants fled.4', 'Shortly after Sheri’s 911 call, then-Pawtucket Police Patrolman (now Sergeant) Eric Bucka (Sgt. Bucka) received a radio description of the suspects, indicating that the perpetrators were “two males dressed in all black, with masks, black sweatshirts, black pants, black shoes.” Approximately one block from the crime scene, Sgt. Bucka encountered Gibson, who was wearing black sneakers, black pants, and a white shirt, but no sweatshirt. In response to Sgt. Bucka’s questioning, Gibson stated that he was coming from his girlfriend’s house in Attleboro, Massachusetts. After a few minutes, Sgt. Bucka and Gibson parted ways. 1', 'To distinguish Jeffrey Lebrun from his wife, we refer to the Lebruns by their first names. 2', 'By the time of defendant’s probation violation hearing, Jeffrey Lebrun had died. 3', 'Sheri testified that, unlike Jeffrey, she saw only one intruder. 4', 'A recording of Sheri’s 911 call was played for the trial justice, and both that recording and a transcript of it were admitted as full exhibits at Gibson’s probation violation hearing. However, after the hearing, the exhibits were permanently withdrawn for use at future proceedings. Consequently, the record before this Court contains neither the recording of the 911 call nor the transcript of that recording.', '-2-', 'In the aftermath of the tumultuous events at the Lebrun residence, several items attributable to the perpetrators were uncovered at the scene and in the surrounding neighborhood. Police obtained latex gloves outside of the home at 112 Dawson Street, and a backpack containing various break-in tools was found inside the dwelling. Additionally, police found the knife wielded by one of the assailants inside the home. Later that morning, Patrolman Carl Barovier (Ptlm. Barovier) was summoned to a home one and a half blocks away from the crime scene at 90 County Street, the same street on which Sgt. Bucka had stopped Gibson earlier that morning. When Ptlm. Barovier arrived, the residents informed him that, when they awoke that morning, a black sweatshirt was discovered on their lawn, inside their six-foot stockade fence. The sweatshirt was tossed back over the fence by the homeowners and was situated between the road and the fence at 90 County Street. Patrolman Barovier placed the sweatshirt into an evidence bag and returned to 112 Dawson Street to show it to the Lebruns. Both Jeffrey and Sheri confirmed that the black sweatshirt looked like the sweatshirt that one of the intruders was wearing.', 'All the evidence recovered by the Pawtucket Police investigators was sent to the Rhode Island Department of Health (DOH) for DNA testing.5 Tamara Wong (Wong), a forensic biologist employed by the DOH and an expert in DNA testing, explained the results of the DNA 5', 'The road to DNA testing of this evidence was a somewhat winding one. Shortly after the break-in in May 2013, the gloves found outside 112 Dawson Street were sent to the DOH. In July 2013, Jeffrey was murdered in his home, and, in August 2013, Pawtucket Police Detective Charles Devine (Det. Devine) was assigned to investigate both the murder and the home invasion. In connection with the investigation, Det. Devine ordered the transfer of the remaining items of evidence from the home invasion—the black sweatshirt, the knife, and the break-in tools from the backpack found at the crime scene—to the DOH. After Det. Devine learned that DNA extracted from the collar of the sweatshirt matched the DNA profile of a convicted offender named Juan A. Gibson from a DNA indexing system known as CODIS (Combined DNA Index System), he apprehended Gibson. A buccal swab was then taken from Gibson and transferred to the DOH for comparison analysis.', '-3- testing of this evidence. Wong testified that a saliva stain on the right shoulder of the black sweatshirt matched Jeffrey’s DNA profile. Additionally, DNA was extracted from the collar of the sweatshirt, and this extracted DNA matched Gibson’s DNA profile.6 Wong also testified that she examined other items found at the scene—the glove and a piece of cord or clothesline found in the backpack—and that the DNA profiles were consistent with Gibson’s DNA profile; she elaborated that twenty-one of the twenty-three loci in the profile found on both the glove and the piece of cord or clothesline matched Gibson’s DNA profile. During questioning from Det. Devine following Gibson’s apprehension in March 2014, Gibson told Det. Devine that, on the night of the home invasion, his car broke down while he was coming back from North Attleborough,7 he was walking home, and he had to call AAA to take care of the car.', 'Gibson was serving suspended sentences for three separate drug convictions and was on probation as a result. First, in 2005, Gibson entered a plea of nolo contendere to possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver and was sentenced to ten years at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI), two years to serve and the remaining eight years suspended, with probation.8 Second, in 2010, Gibson entered a plea of nolo contendere to possession of cocaine and possession of marijuana, and he was sentenced to six years at the ACI, one year to serve and 6', 'Wong testified that there is a mere one-in-fifty-six-trillion chance that the DNA from the sweatshirt collar does not belong to Gibson. On cross-examination, Wong testified that the DNA extracted from the sweatshirt collar was so-called “touch DNA,” which consists of “anything that comes in contact with skin or epithelial cells that can be shedded.” Wong acknowledged that the presence of Gibson’s touch DNA on the sweatshirt collar did not necessarily mean that he ever wore the sweatshirt; if he simply touched the collar, his touch DNA could have transferred to the collar. 7', 'Although Det. Devine remembers Gibson saying that he was coming back from North Attleborough, he acknowledged that Gibson could have said Attleboro instead. 8', 'Gibson had previously been adjudicated a probation violator on this sentence; at the time of the probation violation hearing in this case, eighty-two months remained on the 2005 sentence.', '-4- five years suspended, with probation. Finally, in 2012, Gibson entered a plea of nolo contendere to possession of an enumerated quantity of cocaine and was sentenced to nine years at the ACI, eighteen months to serve and ninety months suspended, with probation. Accordingly, on March 27, 2014, the state filed, pursuant to Rule 32(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, notices of probation violation in each of these three cases. At the probation violation hearing, in addition to the evidence recounted above, Sheri testified that she knew Gibson through a friendship with his wife and that, although Gibson had been to the back porch of the Lebrun home at 112 Dawson Street, he had never been inside the residence.', 'After considering the evidence, the trial justice was “more than reasonably satisfied” that Gibson violated the terms and conditions of his probation. The trial justice found that two aspects of the black sweatshirt that police had recovered—and that Sheri and Jeffrey identified as similar to the sweatshirts worn by the perpetrators—were indicative of defendant’s involvement in the break-in: (1) the discovery of the sweatshirt close to the crime scene, evidently discarded over a fence by one of the perpetrators; and (2) the fact that both Gibson’s and Jeffrey’s DNA were found on the sweatshirt. The trial justice was also “trouble[d]” that Gibson “told [Sgt.] Bucka one story and [Det.] Devine a different one.” He reasoned that, if Gibson’s car had broken down and he was waiting for AAA to assist him, then it was “odd” that he had not relayed these important facts to Sgt. Bucka. Although acknowledging Sheri’s testimony that she saw only one intruder, the trial justice found that there were two intruders. He noted that Sheri’s “911 recording makes it quite clear that she is speaking of two assailants.” Additionally, the trial justice did not deem the discrepancy between Gibson’s height—somewhere between six-feet-one and six-feet-two—and Jeffrey’s estimation of the height of the taller intruder—approximately five-feet-eight to five-feet-ten—to be significant. He noted the approximate nature of Jeffrey’s', '-5- estimation and reasoned that gauging an individual’s height while simultaneously fending off armed home invaders is a difficult task.', 'The trial justice (1) ordered that the eighty-two months that remained on the suspended sentence imposed in 2005 be served at the ACI; (2) removed the five years remaining on the suspended sentence imposed in 2010 and ordered that Gibson serve that time at the ACI, concurrent with the time to be served on the 2005 sentence; and (3) ordered that the ninety- month suspended sentence imposed in 2012 be continued, with the same conditions and terms. Gibson timely appealed.', 'Standard of Review', 'A probation violation hearing has a singular focus: determining whether the conditions of probation—namely, “[k]eeping the peace and remaining on good behavior—have been violated.” State v. Hazard, 68 A.3d 479, 499 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Gromkiewicz, 43 A.3d 45, 48 (R.I. 2012)). Unlike the burden of proof at a criminal trial, the state’s burden in the probation violation context is far less exacting; the state need only “prove to the reasonable satisfaction of the [trial] justice that the defendant has violated the terms and conditions of the previously imposed probation.”9 Id. (quoting Gromkiewicz, 43 A.3d at 48). We review a trial justice’s adjudication of probation violation deferentially, reversing only where the trial justice “acted arbitrarily or capriciously in finding a violation.” Id. (quoting Gromkiewicz, 43 A.3d at 48). Challenges to a trial justice’s credibility determinations typically are unavailing in this Court because the assessment of witness credibility “in a probation violation hearing is a function of the [trial] justice, not this Court.” Id. (quoting Gromkiewicz, 43 A.3d at 49). 9', 'Consistent with the sole purpose of a probation violation hearing, the reasonable-satisfaction standard is employed to determine only whether the terms and conditions of probation were violated, not whether defendant is guilty of the offenses that form the basis of the violation allegation. See State v. Hazard, 68 A.3d 479, 499 (R.I. 2013).', '-6-', 'Analysis', 'On appeal, Gibson offers several reasons why, in his view, the trial justice acted arbitrarily and capriciously in finding him to be a probation violator. None is persuasive. First, Gibson argues that the trial justice erroneously credited Jeffrey’s statements that there were two perpetrators over Sheri’s testimony that she saw only one. We discern no error in this regard. Jeffrey struggled with the two intruders from the outset of the home invasion, while Sheri witnessed the break-in only after Jeffrey awakened her with his calls for help. By the time Sheri arrived downstairs, one of the perpetrators may have fled, as did the assailant Sheri saw soon after she came downstairs. Additionally, in his decision, the trial justice did address Sheri’s testimony that she saw only one intruder, but he noted that she referred to two perpetrators in her 911 call. Because the trial justice considered all of the evidence, accepted Jeffrey’s version for plausible reasons, and rationally rejected the inference that Gibson sought to draw from Sheri’s testimony that she saw only one intruder, he did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in concluding that there were two intruders. See Gromkiewicz, 43 A.3d at 49.', 'Gibson next claims that, because he is at least four inches taller than the taller of the two intruders that Jeffrey identified, he could not have been involved in the break-in. The trial justice considered this argument and rejected it because of the approximate nature of Jeffrey’s height estimation and the difficulty in accurately pinpointing a person’s height in the midst of a frantic struggle. We are satisfied that discounting the significance of the height discrepancy for the reasons articulated by the trial justice does not lead to an arbitrary or capricious conclusion.', 'Gibson also faults the trial justice for placing too much reliance on the DNA evidence found on the black sweatshirt and on Gibson’s statements to Sgt. Bucka and Det. Devine; he contends that this evidence, although incriminating at first blush, does not establish that Gibson', '-7- was one of the intruders. With respect to the DNA found on the sweatshirt, Gibson argues that the touch DNA “might * * * have been transferred to the sweatshirt unremarkably, and innocently, in any number of different exchanges” between Gibson and Jeffrey prior to the night of the home invasion.', 'Finally, with respect to his statements, Gibson contends that the statements he gave to Sgt. Bucka and Det. Devine were not inconsistent: he was walking home from his girlfriend’s house in Attleboro, as he told Sgt. Bucka, because his car broke down on his way home, as he told Det. Devine. These contentions are unavailing. The weight of the evidence in a probation hearing rests with the trial justice.', 'Gibson was found approximately one block from the crime scene shortly after the police were called, and he was wearing black pants and black sneakers and no jacket or outerwear. However, a black sweatshirt—matching the description of the clothing worn by the suspects— was found within the same proximity of the crime scene, apparently thrown over a fence on the night of the break-in. That sweatshirt, which matched the sweatshirts worn by the perpetrators, contained Gibson’s DNA on the collar and Jeffrey’s DNA on the right shoulder. Although it is possible that there is an unremarkable and innocent explanation for how this evidence— containing both Gibson’s and the victim’s DNA—wound up behind a stockade fence near the crime scene, the trial justice properly rejected that speculation. He was not required to turn a blind eye to the highly probative and incriminating nature of this evidence. His conclusion that this evidence pointed towards Gibson’s involvement in the home invasion was neither arbitrary nor capricious. See State v. McLaughlin, 935 A.2d 938, 942 (R.I. 2007) (“The hearing justice can draw reasonable inferences from the evidence presented to determine whether the defendant violated the terms of his probation.” (quoting State v. Seamans, 935 A.2d 618, 621-22 (R.I. 2007))).', '-8-', 'The same can be said for the discrepancy between Gibson’s statements to the investigating officers. He told Det. Devine that his car broke down and that he needed to call AAA. The trial justice found it “odd” that, if car failure was the true reason for Gibson’s presence in the vicinity of the crime scene in the early morning hours of May 19, 2013, Gibson did not report his car troubles to Sgt. Bucka. Although one could reconcile Gibson’s statements to Sgt. Bucka and Det. Devine, the trial justice’s conclusion that Gibson told different stories to the two officers is reasonable. See McLaughlin, 935 A.2d at 942.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons articulated above, we are of the opinion that the trial justice did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in finding that the defendant violated the terms of his probation.

In this personal injury action, the plaintiff, Michaela Symonds (Symonds or plaintiff), appeals from an order granting summary judgment entered against her and in favor of the City of Pawtucket (city). Symonds contends that she sustained injuries when she received a splinter while playing on a wooden jungle gym at a park in the city. On September 29, 2015, this case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised should not be summarily decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and reviewing the memoranda submitted on behalf of the parties, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown. Accordingly, we shall decide the appeal at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On March 23, 2003, plaintiff, who was a minor at the time, was playing on a wooden jungle gym at Slater Memorial Park in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, when a sliver of the jungle gym', '-1- broke off and pierced her skin. The plaintiff contends that her injuries were caused by the poor condition of the jungle gym, which “had deteriorated to the point where the wood was frayed, split and slivered.”', 'The plaintiff’s mother, Rhonda Symonds (Rhonda), contacted the city’s Parks and Recreation Department (the department) and advised an employee of the plaintiff’s injury. According to Rhonda, the employee informed her that the department was unaware that it was responsible for maintaining the jungle gym or other objects in the playground area. Approximately twelve to sixteen months after Rhonda contacted the department, the wooden jungle gym was replaced with a jungle gym consisting of non-wood material.', 'On February 2, 2005, plaintiff, by and through her mother and natural guardian, Rhonda Symonds, filed a complaint sounding in negligence against the city and Ronald L. Wunschel, in his capacity as Treasurer and/or Finance Director of the city (collectively defendants). Some years later, 1 on July 19, 2010, defendants moved to amend their answer to include an affirmative defense of immunity under G.L. 1956 chapter 6 of title 32, the Recreational Use Statute (RUS). 2', 'On June 10, 2011, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that there were no genuine issues of material fact and that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the grounds that it was immune from suit because the playground had been opened to the public for recreational purposes and it did not act in a willful or malicious manner in failing to guard or 1', 'For reasons not made apparent by the record, the case was dormant for several years. 2', 'The Recreational Use Statute, G.L. 1956 § 32-6-3, provides:', '“Except as specifically recognized by or provided in § 32-6-5, an owner of land who', 'either directly or indirectly invites or permits without charge any person to use that', 'property for recreational purposes does not thereby:', '“(1) Extend any assurance that the premises are safe for any purpose;', '“(2) Confer upon that person the legal status of an invitee or licensee to whom a', 'duty of care is owed; nor', '“(3) Assume responsibility for or incur liability for any injury to any person or', 'property caused by an act of omission of that person.”', '-2- warn against any dangerous condition. The defendants reasoned that its lack of notice of any dangerous condition precluded a finding of willfulness. The plaintiff opposed the summary judgment motion, arguing that defendants’ actions were willful, thus mandating an exception to the RUS. 3', 'On October 11, 2011, the hearing justice determined that the city was qualified as a landowner that can be entitled to immunity under the RUS and that plaintiff “ha[d] produced no evidence to suggest that the wooden jungle gym was damaged, deteriorated or dangerous, and * * * [no] evidence to show any wanton or malicious conduct.” Accordingly, the hearing justice granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff appealed to this Court.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court reviews the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo, “apply[ing] the same standards and rules as did the motion justice.” Narragansett Indian Tribe v.

Gouin, 66 A.3d 489, 493 (R.I. 2013)). “We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.” Id. “Summary judgment is appropriate when no genuine issue of material fact is evident from ‘the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits if any,’ and the motion justice finds that the moving party is entitled to prevail as a matter of law.” Swain v.

Spino Brothers, Inc., 11 A.3d 645, 648 (R.I. 2011)).', 'III 3', 'On July 28, 2011, in response to defendants’ motion for summary judgment, plaintiff moved to amend her complaint, adding that defendants “negligently and/or willfully and/or maliciously failed to guard and/or warn and/or inspect, repair and/or maintain the premises free from defect and/or dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity after discovering the user’s peril * * *.”', '-3-', 'Discussion', 'Since the promulgation of the RUS by the General Assembly in 1978, this Court has had several occasions to interpret its provisions.', 'We have recognized that its purpose is to “encourage private landowners to make their land free and open to the public for recreational purposes.” Berman v. Sitrin, 991 A.2d 1038, 1043 (R.I. 2010) (Berman I) 4; see § 32-6-1. To accomplish this purpose, the RUS modifies the common law by treating users of public and private recreational properties as trespassers, thus greatly reducing the duty of care that owners owe to recreational users. See Smiler v. Napolitano, 911 A.2d 1035, 1038-39 (R.I. 2006). We have also noted that “it is clear from the unambiguous language of the 1996 amendment that the [L]egislature intended to include the state and municipalities among owners entitled to immunity under the statute.” Pereira v. Fitzgerald, 21 A.3d 369, 373 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Hanley v. State, 837 A.2d 707, 712 (R.I. 2003)).', ""However, we also have recognized that this immunity is not absolute. See Hanley, 837 A.2d at 713. Specifically, in an exception to the RUS, § 32-6-5(a)(1), the Legislature established that the RUS does not “limit[] in any way any liability * * * [f]or the willful or malicious failure to guard or warn against a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity after discovering the user's peril[.]” Accordingly, given the “trespasser” status produced by the RUS, landowners who open their land to the public for recreational use owe no duty to users of the property other than to refrain from willful or wanton conduct after a user of the property is discovered in peril. Berman I, 991 A.2d at 1043-44. 4"", 'We shall refer to Berman v. Sitrin, 991 A.2d 1038 (R.I. 2010), as “Berman I” to distinguish it from a more recent appeal stemming from the same facts, Berman v. Sitrin, 101 A.3d 1251 (R.I. 2014) (Berman II).', '-4-', 'On appeal, the plaintiff contends that the hearing justice erred in holding that no genuine issues of material fact existed and that defendants were entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. She insists that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether allowing the jungle gym to deteriorate to a “deplorable” state rises to the level of willfulness required by § 32-6-5(a)(1), thus placing her claim within the exception to the RUS. 5 To support her argument, plaintiff asserts that the notice accorded to the city in the case at hand is similar to the notice accorded to the City of Newport in Berman I.', 'In Berman I, 991 A.2d at 1042, the plaintiff was injured while visiting the Newport Cliff Walk when the ground beneath him gave way, rendering him quadriplegic. There, a majority of this Court held that the City of Newport had notice of the defective and dangerous condition of the Cliff Walk, as there had been several death-resulting falls caused by the ground giving way in the past. Id. at 1049-50. This Court concluded that a factfinder could determine that the City of Newport acted willfully by “voluntarily and intentionally fail[ing] to guard against the dangerous condition, knowing that there existed a strong likelihood that a visitor to the Cliff Walk would suffer serious injury or death.” Id. at 1052. Accordingly, because a jury could determine that the City of Newport acted with willful or malicious disregard of actual or constructive knowledge of the dangerous condition of the Cliff Walk, the exception to the RUS could be applicable. See id. at 1053.', 'In the case at bar, plaintiff has not set forth any evidence to show that the city had knowledge of the dangerous condition of the jungle gym. The plaintiff contends that the city had notice of the dangerous condition of the jungle gym, citing: 5', 'In her brief, plaintiff also posits that the jungle gym presented an attractive nuisance and that the RUS should not apply in such a context. During oral argument, however, plaintiff conceded that this argument was waived, as it was not properly presented in Superior Court.', '-5-', '“[T]he wooden material which the City allowed to compose[ 6] the bars, the', 'condition of the bars (missing bars and splintered wood), the fact that the City', 'acknowledged that it did not even believe it had a duty to maintain the gym, the', 'subsequent removal of the gym and the very fact that the gym was for children', 'like [the plaintiff] who were expected (and in fact attracted to such object) to use', 'such facility * * * .” The plaintiff claims that these circumstances provided notice to the city of the dangerous condition similar to that in Berman I, such that the city had knowledge of a strong likelihood that a user of the jungle gym would suffer injury.', 'However, plaintiff’s contention is misplaced.', 'In Berman I, 991 A.2d at 1051, we “emphasize[d] that we [were] not confronted with a single injury in a given location,” but instead, we were confronted with “multiple incidents of death and grievous injury * * *.” Unlike in Berman I, plaintiff’s injury on the wooden jungle gym was the first notice of any injury of this kind, and none of the evidence pointed to by plaintiff suggests that the city had actual knowledge of a dangerous condition prior to her injury. The presence of a dangerous condition alone is not enough to fall within the exception to the RUS. Compare Cain v. Johnson, 755 A.2d 156, 162- 64 (R.I. 2000) (holding that the City of Newport was immune under the RUS because it did not discover the plaintiff in a position of peril where it had no notice of a dangerous condition), with Berman I, 991 A.2d at 1051-53 (holding that the City of Newport was not protected by the RUS where it had notice of a dangerous condition based on prior reported incidents of death and serious injury). Instead, to constitute willfulness within the meaning of § 32-6-5(a)(1), the landowner must have knowledge of the danger and then fail to guard against it, to the extent that 6', 'Notably, the jungle gym at issue in this case was the result of a donation. It is unclear from the record whether the city chose the material of which the jungle gym was made.', '-6- additional injuries continue to occur. See Berman I, 991 A.2d at 1051-52. Unlike Berman I, this is not a case where several similar injuries had occurred prior to plaintiff’s injury, thus allowing knowledge of a dangerous condition to be imputed to the landowner. See id. at 1051 (“It is because of the multiple incidents of death and grievous injury that we conclude that the city may not successfully defend this claim based on an assertion that it had no specific knowledge of [the plaintiff] or any peril confronting him.”). Rather, this is a case where defendants were notified of the dangerous condition for the first time upon plaintiff’s reporting of the injury, rendering the exception to the RUS inapplicable. See, e.g., Carlson v. South Kingstown, 111 A.3d 819, 824-25 (R.I. 2015) (holding that the exception to the RUS was inapplicable where the plaintiff broke her leg when stepping into a divot in a park because the town had no knowledge of the existence of the particular hole that injured the plaintiff or of similar persons injured by similar defects in the park).', 'The record before us lacks any suggestion that defendants had any knowledge of the dangerous condition at the time of the injury. The wooden material of which the jungle gym was composed, even if such material was of inferior quality, is insufficient to provide the city with knowledge of a dangerous condition. Similarly, while plaintiff points to the defective condition of the wooden bars as a form of notice to the city, she does not provide any evidence that such condition was reported to the city prior to her injury. 7', 'The plaintiff contends that the city’s knowledge of the alleged dangerous condition is supported by the department employee’s acknowledgment that he did not believe that the city 7', 'The plaintiff also notes that the jungle gym was built for children who were expected to use it. However, the fact that the jungle gym was built for children suggests only that the city had knowledge that children would confront a jungle gym for recreation. This does not provide any suggestion that the city knew that the children would be forced to confront a dangerous condition upon using the jungle gym.', '-7- had a duty to maintain the jungle gym and by the subsequent removal of the jungle gym. However, each of these occurrences transpired after plaintiff’s injury. Significantly, our decision in Berman I was based on the property owner’s knowledge of a particular dangerous condition at the time of the alleged injury. See Berman I, 991 A.2d at 1051.', 'Recognizing notice of an alleged defect received after the fact as falling within the exception to the RUS would render meaningless the distinction that this Court made in Berman I: it would not provide the property owner with the opportunity to guard against the dangerous condition. See id. (distinguishing Berman I from cases in which “there was no evidence that the governmental entity knew of the danger and then failed to take any action to guard against it” (emphasis added)). Accordingly, plaintiff’s argument that the city’s knowledge of the defect is supported by these later occurrences is without merit.', 'Without knowledge on behalf of the landowner of either the particular defect or similar injuries, we cannot conclude that the landowner willfully disregarded a known risk of injury. Therefore, it was not error for the hearing justice to determine that the exception of § 32-6-5(a)(1) was inapplicable to the plaintiff’s case.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the grant of summary judgment for the defendant.', '-8-', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'Michaela Symonds, by and through her mother and natural', 'guardian, Rhonda Symonds v.

For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On June 19, 2013, at approximately 9:08 p.m., Providence Patrolman Michael Clary (Officer Clary) stopped a vehicle driven by Michael Clemente (Clemente) for failing to obey a yield sign while coming onto the Point Street Bridge and for crossing the center line of the road. 1 The defendant was a passenger in the vehicle, which belonged to Clemente’s girlfriend. Officer 1', 'Officer Clary also testified that the vehicle was traveling “at a high rate of speed” and “well over” the twenty-five-mile-per-hour speed limit.', '-1- Clary testified that as he approached the vehicle, he noticed defendant was “moving around a lot” and, more specifically, that defendant “made a movement towards the rear driver’s side towards the leg compartment” of the vehicle. Concerned for his safety, Officer Clary called for backup, to which Officer Robert Kells (Officer Kells) responded.', 'Upon Officer Kells’s arrival, the two patrolmen approached the vehicle – Officer Clary approached Clemente on the driver’s side and Officer Kells approached defendant on the passenger’s side. Officer Clary testified that Clemente appeared nervous, was sweating, and avoided eye contact, while Officer Kells testified that defendant also appeared to be nervous and sweating, and his “non-verbal body language” indicated that he was “hiding something.” When Officer Kells asked where they were coming from, defendant said that they were coming from his cousin’s house on Public Street; but, as Officer Kells noted, the vehicle was traveling in the “totally opposite direction” of Public Street.', 'Both men were ordered out of the vehicle and were subjected to a Terry 2 pat-down. 3 No weapons were found on either Clemente or defendant. The two were then placed in the back seats of separate patrol cars. Although they were not handcuffed, Officer Clary did testify that the back doors of the patrol cars were locked such that they could not be opened from the inside, so defendant and Clemente were, in effect, unable to get out of the cars. Officer Clary testified that neither Clemente nor defendant was under arrest at this time. A search of the rear driver’s side area of the vehicle – the area that Officer Clary observed defendant reaching into – revealed an Apple MacBook laptop and a Sony PlayStation 3 video game console. Officer Kells also observed a maroon pillowcase located underneath the front passenger seat where defendant was sitting. 2', 'Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968). 3', 'By this time, three more officers had arrived on scene to provide additional backup.', '-2-', 'When asked, Clemente said that the laptop belonged to his cousin, Bernardino, and, at Officer Clary’s request, he turned it on. Saved on the desktop of the computer was a résumé with the last name “Calcagni.” Officer Kells called the phone number listed on the résumé and spoke to a man who identified himself as Anthony Calcagni, a recent graduate of Brown University. Calcagni verified that he owned the type of laptop and video game console that were found in the vehicle. The officers agreed to meet Calcagni, who had left home sometime around 8:20 that evening, at his apartment on Power Street.', 'Upon arriving home, Calcagni and the officers noticed that the air-conditioning unit in the bay window of his apartment was pushed inward from the window and onto the floor, presumably from someone breaking in. Officer Clary showed Calcagni the items found in the vehicle, which Calcagni identified as his. Notably, the laptop was inscribed with the last six digits of Calcagni’s Brown University student identification number, and he was indeed missing a maroon pillowcase from his bedroom. Clemente and defendant were ultimately transported to the Providence police station.', 'Detective Charles Boranian (Det. Boranian), who had also responded to the scene earlier, testified that he read defendant his Miranda rights at the police station. Detective Boranian further testified that, while defendant was cooperative at first, he became increasingly less obliging, especially when Det. Boranian asked for his girlfriend’s contact information to verify his assertion that he was with her earlier in the evening before “a friend” called him to “go for a ride.” A criminal complaint was filed against defendant charging him with burglary.', 'A combined bail and violation hearing was held in Providence County Superior Court on September 6, 9, and 10, 2013. The hearing justice found that the stop was legal and that defendant lacked standing to challenge the search of the vehicle because he was merely a', '-3- passenger in it, neither he nor Clemente owned the vehicle, and he had never driven it or kept any personal property in it. Furthermore, the hearing justice found that, even if defendant did have standing to challenge the search, it was “certainly * * * justified” based on defendant’s “so- called furtive movements” and his reaching toward the area behind the driver’s seat and under the passenger compartment. This, the hearing justice stated, was “enough to raise a reasonable and articulable suspicion in [Officer] Clary’s mind that there may be [weapons] or contraband or evidence of a crime being hidden under the driver’s seat and/or under the passenger seat by * * * defendant.” This reasonable and articulable suspicion was then “further * * * solidified” by the nervous demeanor and evasiveness exhibited by both Clemente and defendant.', 'The hearing justice went on to hold that, based on the evidence presented, the items seized from the vehicle were “obvious[ly]” stolen from Calcagni’s apartment and that defendant was at the very least in constructive possession of those items. The hearing justice inferred that, based on defendant’s furtive movements in the vehicle – specifically those in which he reached toward the rear driver’s-side leg compartment and underneath his seat – defendant was “attempting to hide * * * the computer and the PlayStation under the driver’s seat and the pillowcase under the front passenger seat.”', 'In light of this evidence, the hearing justice was “reasonably satisfied that * * * defendant failed to * * * be of good behavior” and concluded that defendant violated the terms of his probation.

(quoting Quinlan, 921 A.2d at 109).', '“The determination of whether there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, and thus standing, is a two-tiered analysis: (1) the defendant must have a ‘subjective expectation of privacy,’ and (2) the expectation must also be ‘one that society accepts as objectively reasonable.’” Quinlan, 921 A.2d at 109 (quoting State v. Bertram, 591 A.2d 14, 19 (R.I. 1991)). We look at several factors, such as “whether the suspect possessed or owned the area searched or the property seized; his or her prior use of the area searched or the property seized; the person’s ability to control or exclude others’ use of the property; and the person’s legitimate presence in the area searched.” State v.

While he was a legitimate guest in the vehicle, he had no ownership or possessory interest in it, nor does he assert any prior use of the vehicle, nor could he control or exclude others from its use. The same reasoning applies to the items seized from the vehicle – defendant asserts no ownership or lawful possessory interest in any of the property seized, nor does he assert any prior use of the property, nor could he rightfully control or exclude others’ use of any of the property. 6 In Quinlan, 921 A.2d at 110, we recognized that the defendant “certainly had no expectation of privacy that society would recognize as objectively reasonable” in a vehicle that he was merely a passenger in, had never driven, or kept any personal property in. Neither does defendant here. As such, he lacks standing to contest the legality of the search of the vehicle.', 'While we may be able to resolve this matter based on defendant’s lack of standing alone, we nevertheless address his remaining arguments on appeal. The defendant challenges the “prolonged and unjustified seizure of his person” and argues that the fruits of such an unjustified seizure should be suppressed. He argues that the seizure continued long after the purpose of the traffic stop had come to a close, which, according to defendant, is when the investigation should have ended. Although defendant was not under arrest, he was clearly seized when he was removed from the vehicle, told not to leave, and was put in the back seat of Officer Kells’s police car. While he was not handcuffed, the police car did not have door handles on the inside, so, in effect, defendant was not free to leave the vehicle. See State v. Foster, 842 A.2d 1047, 1050 (R.I. 2004) (“A police officer has ‘seized’ a person, within the meaning of the Fourth 6', 'The defendant himself undermines his own standing by asserting that “none of the items [seized] were in the immediate physical possession of [defendant]: it was not his vehicle, he was not driving, it was unknown how long he had been riding in the car, the objects were not on his person, and there was nothing about the objects that connected them to him.”', ""-7- Amendment, when he restrains that person's freedom to walk away.”) (citing State v.

However, the seizure of defendant and Clemente beyond this point was nonetheless warranted “based on a reasonable suspicion that resulted from the events that [Officers Clary and Kells] observed [during and] after a routine traffic stop.” Foster, 842 A.2d at 1052. “[T]he Supreme Court held that in evaluating the constitutionality of a stop, the totality of the circumstances must be taken into account.” Id. at 1050-51 (citing United States v. Cortez, 449 U.S. 411, 417 (1981)). “Additionally, this Court has enumerated factors that contribute to a finding of reasonable suspicion, including ‘the location in which the conduct occurred, the time at which the incident occurred, the suspicious conduct or unusual appearance of the suspect, and the personal knowledge and experience of the police officer.’” Id. at 1051 (quoting State v. Keohane, 814 A.2d 327, 330 (R.I. 2003)).', 'Here, in view of the totality of the circumstances surrounding defendant’s detention, as well as the factors we have explicitly enumerated, Officers Clary and Kells, who were both veteran police officers, had “an articulable basis for suspecting criminal activity and * * * the isolation and detention of * * * defendant [was] reasonable under the circumstances” while they continued their investigation.', 'See Foster, 842 A.2d at 1052.', 'Furthermore, we note that defendant and Clemente were only detained for approximately one hour, and there is no indication that they were mistreated by the police or subjected to improper questioning. See id. at 1051.', '-8-', 'B', 'The Exclusionary Rule Does Not Apply to Probation Violation Hearings', 'Even assuming the police illegally obtained the evidence, the exclusionary rule offers defendant no relief. The exclusionary rule, when applicable, bars the introduction of evidence obtained from illegal searches and seizures. See, e.g., State v. Jennings, 461 A.2d 361, 368 (R.I. 1983). However, “the law is well settled that the exclusionary rule does not apply to probation- violation hearings.” State v. Campbell, 833 A.2d 1228, 1232 (R.I. 2003) (citing State v. Spratt, 120 R.I. 192, 194, 386 A.2d 1094, 1095-96 (1978)).', 'Because a violation hearing is civil in nature, “the defendant is not entitled to ‘the full panoply of rights’ inherent in a criminal trial.” Campbell, 833 A.2d at 1233 (quoting State v. Mendez, 788 A.2d 1145, 1147-48 (R.I. 2002)).', 'This “panoply of rights” includes the exclusionary rule. Indeed, “[i]n Spratt, we held that ‘the potential benefit to society from refusing to extend the exclusionary rule to revocation hearings outweighs any harm resulting from that refusal.’” State v. Texter, 896 A.2d 40, 43 (R.I. 2006) (quoting Spratt, 120 R.I. at 195, 386 A.2d at 1095-96).', 'The defendant argues that the exclusionary rule should have been applied to his probation revocation hearing because his prolonged seizure is sufficient to “shock the conscience of the Court.” The defendant cites this language from our decision in Spratt, where we left for a later day the question of whether the exclusionary rule would apply at a probation revocation hearing to evidence derived from “searches which are consciously directed toward or intended to harass probationers * * * or which shock the conscience of the court * * *.” Spratt, 120 R.I. at 195 n.2, 386 A.2d at 1095 n.2 (citing United States v. Winsett, 518 F.2d 51, 54 (9th Cir. 1975); People v. Atencio, 525 P.2d 461, 463 (Colo. 1974)). Because there is nothing in the record to suggest that', '-9- the officers’ conduct shocks the conscience, we see no need to address the question left unanswered in Spratt at this time. Here, Officers Clary and Kells had every reason and duty to investigate the situation beyond the traffic violations and continue to detain defendant (and Clemente) during that time. We are satisfied that their conduct in doing so was proper.', 'C', 'Constructive Possession', 'Lastly, defendant argues that there was insufficient evidence presented to the hearing justice to satisfy even the lowered “reasonable satisfaction” standard with respect to the finding that he was in possession of the stolen property found in the vehicle. The hearing justice found that defendant was at least in constructive possession of the laptop, PlayStation, and maroon pillowcase. “To find that a defendant constructively possessed illegal contraband, two elements must be satisfied.” Santiago, 799 A.2d at 287 (citing In re Vannarith, 731 A.2d 685, 689 (R.I. 1999)). “First, the defendant must have had knowledge of the presence of the contraband and, second, the defendant must have intended to exercise control over the item[s].” Id. “Both of these factors ‘can be inferred from a totality of the circumstances.’” Id. (quoting In re Vannarith, 731 A.2d at 689).', 'Specifically, and most relevant to the instant case, we have said that “knowledge of the existence and location of the contraband can be inferred from [the] defendant’s conduct in reaching toward the area where the contraband was located.” Id. at 288.', 'At the probation revocation hearing, the hearing justice “weigh[ed] the evidence and assess[ed] the credibility of the witnesses,” including Officers Clary and Kells. Based on that testimony and the totality of the circumstances – including the defendant’s furtive movements and noticeably nervous demeanor – the hearing justice could have easily inferred that the defendant had “knowledge of the presence of the contraband” and “intended to exercise control”', '-10- over the contraband by moving it, presumably out of the view of the approaching officers. Accordingly, there was more than enough evidence to meet the lowered “reasonably satisfied standard” with respect to the hearing justice’s finding that the defendant, at the very least, constructively possessed the stolen property found in the vehicle. Thus, it cannot be said that the hearing justice acted arbitrarily or capriciously in finding that the defendant violated his probation.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

97,Willie Battle et al. : v. : State of Rhode Island. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court.', 'This case came before the Supreme Court on October 1, 2015, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided.', 'The plaintiff, Willie Battle (plaintiff), appeals from the trial justice’s denial of his motion for a new trial, 1 following a jury verdict in favor of the defendant, the State of Rhode Island (state). After hearing the arguments of counsel and reviewing the memoranda submitted by the parties, we conclude that cause has not been shown and proceed to decide this appeal. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'This action arises from injuries plaintiff suffered as a result of a fall while he was incarcerated at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI). On February 14, 2007, plaintiff and 1', 'The plaintiff also challenges the denial of his motion for an additur following the jury verdict. However, we decline to address this issue. It is of no moment in this case because the jury returned a verdict for defendant on liability and plaintiff has not sufficiently developed this issue on appeal. See Article I, Rule 16(a) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure (“Errors not claimed, questions not raised and points not made [in the appellant’s brief] ordinarily will be treated as waived and not be considered by the Court.”).', '-1- approximately 150 of his fellow inmates were conducted on foot as part of a routine “movement” of inmates from the cellblocks to the ACI’s medium-security education facility. There, plaintiff had been scheduled to attend morning classes as part of a six-month rehabilitative program for inmates. That morning, however, plaintiff slipped and fell as he entered the building. The plaintiff seriously injured his back in the fall, which eventually required surgery. The plaintiff, who has since been released from the ACI, now walks with a limp and reports continuing discomfort. He filed a complaint in Providence County Superior Court on February 26, 2009, alleging negligence by the state in failing to reasonably maintain the premises. 2 The negligence action proceeded to trial on May 22, 2013.', 'The first two witnesses called by plaintiff to testify were David Melikian (Officer Melikian) and Roger Boccanfuso (Officer Boccanfuso), corrections officers who had seen plaintiff fall. Both recalled that there was inclement weather that morning; Officer Boccanfuso specifically remembered “severe downpours.” Both witnesses testified that inmate porters mop the floors near the building’s entrance to keep the area dry when it rains or snows. Both testified that, on such days, they or fellow ACI guards would caution inmates that the floors might be wet as they entered the building. Each witness testified that inmate porters would place “wet floor” signs in the area and that one or two large mats covered the floor at all times.', 'Next, plaintiff called Archangel Barboza (Ms. Barboza) to testify. Ms. Barboza stated that she works as a teacher for the Department of Corrections in the building where plaintiff fell. She recalled that she had slipped and injured her leg by the building’s entrance on a rainy day in 2006. She also said that, on or around the day plaintiff fell, she had slipped but avoided injury in an area near where plaintiff fell. 2', 'The complaint named a co-plaintiff whose claim for loss of consortium was later dismissed by agreement of the parties.', '-2-', 'The plaintiff also testified at trial. Recounting the moments leading up to the incident, he stated that it had been raining that morning and that newly fallen snow was melting on the ground. He told the jury, “[A]s we [were] going to the building, I didn’t think nothing of it * * *. I was just doing what I normally do, * * * and * * * when I got in the building, I didn’t think nothing.” The plaintiff stated that an object similar to a mat had been on the floor to wipe his feet on, but he insisted the object was not a mat. He did not recall hearing any warnings about wet floors from the corrections officers as he entered the building, yet he conceded on cross- examination that officers may have cautioned inmates on other rainy days. Similarly, plaintiff testified that he had not seen inmate porters cleaning the area prior to his fall, but he admitted on cross-examination that they might have been present.', 'The plaintiff rested, and the state did not present any witnesses. The plaintiff then moved for judgment as a matter of law, which the trial justice denied. On May 24, 2013, following deliberations, the jury found that the state was not negligent.', 'On May 31, 2013, plaintiff moved for the Superior Court to “vacate the jury verdict * * * and * * * grant a new trial and/or additur to the Plaintiff.” In support of the motions, plaintiff argued for the first time that, “not only was this a case of simply negligence and egregious conduct, it [was] also a case to be considered for strict liability.” The plaintiff contended that the state should be held strictly liable for his injuries because it had been engaging in an abnormally dangerous activity at the time plaintiff fell. According to plaintiff, the state engaged in such activity by forcing inmates to walk in a potentially slippery area that could not be made safer even with a floor mat, “wet floor” signs, continuous cleanup, or verbal warnings. The trial justice denied plaintiff’s motion, rejected plaintiff’s theory of strict liability, and concluded that', '-3- the jury acted reasonably in finding for the state on the negligence count. The plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal.', 'Standard of Review', '“A trial justice’s role in considering a motion for a new trial is that of a superjuror, who must weigh the evidence and assess the credibility of the witnesses.” Gomes v. Rosario, 79 A.3d 1262, 1265 (R.I. 2013) (quoting McGarry v. Pielech, 47 A.3d 271, 280 (R.I. 2012)). In doing so,', '“[t]he trial justice must consider, in the exercise of his [or her]', 'independent judgment, all the material evidence in the case, in the', 'light of his [or her] charge to the jury and pass on its weight and', 'the credibility of the witnesses, determine what evidence is', 'believable, and, decide whether the verdict rendered by the jury', 'responds to the evidence presented and does justice between the', 'parties.” Id. (quoting McGarry, 47 A.3d at 280). This Court will not disturb the trial justice’s decision absent a showing that he or she “overlooked or misconceived material and relevant evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.” Id. (quoting McGarry, 47 A.3d at 280).', 'Discussion', 'A. Motion for a New Trial', 'In support of plaintiff’s motion for a new trial, counsel argued in the Superior Court, and before this Court on appeal, that plaintiff had been part of a “forced march” in which guards rushed him and his fellow inmates from the cellblocks to the education facility without regard for their personal safety. He further argued that the jury had been biased against plaintiff because he had been incarcerated at the time of his injury.', 'Deciding plaintiff’s motion from the bench, the trial justice recounted the evidence introduced at trial and weighed the credibility of the witnesses.', 'He noted the testimony regarding the placement of both mats and “wet floor” signs by the door, the verbal warnings', '-4- routinely issued by guards as the inmates entered the building, and the assignment of inmate porters to mop the floors. The trial justice found Officers Melikian and Boccanfuso to be highly credible, cogent witnesses and found that their testimony was consistent. He found Ms. Barboza, the teacher who previously had slipped, to be credible as well, but he noted that the site of her accident was at least ten to fifteen feet away from where plaintiff had fallen. The trial justice also found plaintiff to be “consistent” in his testimony and “an extremely nice man,” but he stated that the case hinged on the issue of liability rather than plaintiff’s credibility. The trial justice further rejected the contention that plaintiff had been subjected to a “forced march” and observed that the description distorted reality and was “unfair.” He observed that the guards were merely transporting the inmates on foot from one building to another and that the inmates were not at gunpoint. The trial justice concluded that he agreed with the jury verdict and did not find that the state was negligent.', 'We conclude that the trial justice had a sufficient basis to find that the jury acted reasonably in rendering its verdict for the state. This Court previously has noted that, “[w]hen the trial justice has reviewed the evidence, in light of his charge to the jury, and concludes that he or she agrees with the verdict, the analysis is at its end.” Dawkins v. Siwicki, 22 A.3d 1142, 1159 (R.I. 2011). Accordingly, we need not venture further.', 'We pause to note that, after thoroughly reviewing the trial record, we are satisfied that the evidence introduced at trial does not substantiate the allegation that the transfer of inmates from the cellblocks to the education facility approached nefarious conduct. No testimony provided at trial, including that of plaintiff, suggests that any inmate was compelled by a guard to parade against his will from one location to another, nor does the evidence imply that the so-called', '-5- “forced march” was anything more than a routine movement of inmates within the institution. This claim simply lacks foundation.', 'B. Strict Liability', 'The plaintiff also cites to the Restatement (Second) Torts § 520 (1976) regarding abnormally dangerous activities 3 and suggests that the state should be held strictly liable for his injuries under this standard. However, our careful reading of the record in this case discloses that plaintiff raised the issue of strict liability for the first time only after the jury rendered its verdict. For this reason, the argument is barred by this Court’s well-established raise-or-waive rule. 4 See State v. Ciresi, 45 A.3d 1201, 1212 (R.I. 2012) (litigant may not “argu[e] an issue on appeal that has not been articulated at trial”, quoting State v. Brown, 9 A.3d 1240, 1245 (R.I. 2010)). 3', 'Section 520 of the Restatement (Second) Torts (1976) enumerates six factors for courts to consider when determining whether an activity is abnormally dangerous and thus whether those who engage in it should be subjected to strict liability:', '“(a) existence of high degree of risk of some harm to the person,', 'land or chattels of others;', '“(b) likelihood that the harm that results from it will be great;', '“(c) inability to eliminate the risk by the exercise of reasonable', 'care;', '“(d) extent to which the activity is not a matter of common usage;', '“(e) inappropriateness of the activity to the place where it is carried', 'on; and', '“(f) extent to which its value to the community is outweighed by', 'its dangerous attributes.” Splendorio v. Bilray Demolition Co., 682', 'A.2d 461, 466 (R.I. 1996) (adopting and quoting § 520 of the', 'Restatement). 4', 'However, even if the issue were properly before this Court, plaintiff’s argument lacks merit and his reliance on § 520 of the Restatement is misplaced. The examples of abnormally dangerous activities cited in the comments to § 520 include the use of atomic energy, the storage of explosives, a traction engine on a public highway, and blasting and oil drilling in well-populated residential areas. The activities recognized as abnormally dangerous in the Restatement clearly dwell in a different dimension than the commonplace activity of pedestrians tracking water into a building on a rainy day.', '-6-', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.
