The defendant, Luis Barrios, was convicted by a jury\non two counts of second-degree sexual assault, and he has appealed from that conviction. This\ncase came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and\nshow cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After a close\nreview of the record and careful consideration of the parties’ arguments (both written and oral),\nwe are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this appeal may be decided at this time.\nFor the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the Superior Court’s judgment of conviction.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On September 16, 2010, the state filed a criminal information charging defendant with\ntwo counts of second-degree sexual assault in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-37-4 and one count of\nsimple assault in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-3.1\n1', 'It is clear from the record that the simple assault charge related to the throwing of a cup\nof soda against the leg of the complaining witness.', '-1-', 'In due course, a jury trial was held over five days in October and November of 2011. We\nsummarize below the salient aspects of what transpired at that trial.', 'A', 'The Testimony at Trial', '1.', 'The Testimony of the Complaining Witness', 'The complaining witness, Anna,2 testified that, on July 22, 2010, she went to a pub in\nNorth Providence at approximately 10 p.m. with friends; one of those friends was a woman to\nwhom we refer as Cathy. It was the testimony of Anna that she shared two pitchers of beer with\nCathy and another friend and that, in addition, she and Cathy each consumed a shot of alcohol.\nAnna further testified that, although Cathy left the pub earlier in the evening, she remained there\nuntil shortly before the closing of the establishment at 1 a.m. (i.e., early in the morning of July\n23).', 'Anna testified that, upon leaving the pub, she commenced the approximately five minute\nwalk back to Cathy’s home at 43 George Street in North Providence, where she was then living.\nShe responded in the affirmative when asked on direct examination whether, when she left the\npub alone, she was “aware of [her] senses” and knew what was “going on around” her; and she\nresponded in the negative when asked if she had experienced any difficulty with her vision or\nwas “falling down.” She testified that, as she was walking along George Street in an area which\nshe described as being “well-lit,” a dark colored car approached; she added that there were\n“some boys” in the car, which was “inching along” beside her. She further testified that the\noccupants of the car were “propositioning” her and saying “sexual things” to her. She stated that\n2', 'In order to protect their privacy, we shall refer to the complaining witness by the\npseudonym “Anna” and to her friend by the pseudonym “Cathy.” See State v. Paola, 59 A.3d\n99, 101 n. 2 (R.I. 2013); State v. Adefusika, 989 A.2d 467, 470 n. 1 (R.I. 2010).', '-2-\nshe looked over at the car for “a second” and noticed that it contained two males—one in the\npassenger seat and the other in the driver’s seat, both of whom were unknown to her. She also\nstated that she was able to see the faces of the two occupants of the car and that she “just kept\nwalking away.”', 'Anna further testified that she then “heard a car door” and that, while she was in front of\n35 George Street (which she said was two houses away from Cathy’s home), someone came up\nbehind her and began walking alongside her. She stated: “I looked [at him]. He was talking to\nme, telling me that he wanted to take me home with him.” She testified that the man said that he\nresided on George Street.', 'She further testified that he was walking right next to her for\napproximately twenty seconds and that she concentrated on his face at that time. She stated that\nshe recognized him as one of the males whom she had seen in the car; she added that his hair was\n“really spiked” and that he “looked like an Asian * * * .” It was further her testimony that she\nwas “very nervous” and that she started walking faster. She described what happened next as\nfollows:', '“[I] told him I didn’t want anything to do with it. So he grabbed', 'me by my crotch over my clothes and, so I broke away from him.', 'He quickly grabbed me again, grabbed my chest. * * * I just', 'started running really fast * * * .”', 'Anna then went on to testify that, when she reached Cathy’s driveway, her attacker threw\na Taco Bell cup containing soda at her, striking her on the back of her leg. Anna testified that\nshe ran into Cathy’s George Street home whereupon a call was placed to 911.3 Anna stated that,\nwhen the police responded to the 911 call, she recounted the incident to them and provided a\ndescription of the person who she said had assaulted her. She testified that the police thereafter\n3', 'A recording of the 911 call at 1:01 a.m. on July 23, 2010 was entered as a full exhibit at\ntrial, over defense counsel’s objection.', '-3-\ndrove her to 35 George Street, where officers escorted a man (who, according to the testimony of\nDetective Frank DelSanto, was one Fernando Justiniano4) to the car and asked her if he was the\nperson who had attacked her. It was her testimony that she told the police that he was not her\nattacker but that she had seen him in the car with the person who attacked her.', 'She stated that the police then took her to a residence on nearby Morgan Avenue in North\nProvidence, where she observed the same car that had pulled up alongside her on George Street.\nShe testified that the police then brought a man from the residence to the driveway; she stated\nthat, even though the police shone a light on the man’s face, she could not identify him from the\nplace where the police car in which she was sitting was positioned. She further testified,\nhowever, that, when the police brought the man closer to the police car, she was able to identify\nhim as her attacker. At trial, she identified a photograph of defendant’s car and testified that it\nwas the same car that had pulled up alongside her on the night of the incident at issue; she also\nidentified a photograph of defendant as her attacker (the photograph having been taken on the\nmorning of July 23), but she was not asked to identify him in court.', '2.', 'The Testimony of Detective DelSanto', 'North Providence Det. Frank DelSanto testified that, on July 23, 2011, he was dispatched\nto 43 George Street for the purpose of investigating an alleged sexual assault. He testified that,\nupon arriving at that location, he spoke with Anna, whom he observed to be “hysterical,”\n“shaking,” and “very upset.” He stated that, although he could detect “a small slight amount of\nalcoholic beverage on her breath,” she did not have any difficulty speaking; he added that her\nspeech was not slurred and that he could understand her.\n4', 'The record indicates that Fernando Justiniano did not testify at trial. The defendant\ntestified that Mr. Justiniano had left the country after he (defendant) was arrested and that his\nrepeated attempts to contact Mr. Justiniano had been unsuccessful.', '-4-', 'Detective DelSanto testified that Anna described the vehicle driven by her attacker. He\nfurther testified that she described her attacker as being an “Asian male” with “spiked hair,”\nwhich was “heavily jelled [sic];” he also acknowledged that she answered in the affirmative\nwhen he asked her whether her attacker could have been Hispanic. Detective DelSanto testified\nthat it was he who drove Anna to the George Street and Morgan Avenue addresses, and he\ncorroborated her testimony with respect to her identification of defendant as her attacker (after he\nwas brought closer to the police car), stating that she manifested “no hesitation.”', 'The detective also stated that the police seized a Taco Bell cup from underneath a vehicle\nin Cathy’s driveway. He described that driveway as having been “sandy” and the cup as having\nbeen “wet” and “squashed;” and he then stated that, “based on [his] training and experience with\nrespect to surfaces and conduciveness of lifting prints,” he decided not to have the cup\nfingerprinted because of “the poor quality of the cup.” Detective DelSanto testified at trial that\ndefendant was the same man as Anna had identified on July 23 as her attacker.', '3.', 'The Testimony of Defendant', 'The defendant, Luis Barrios, testified in his own defense. He testified that, at some point\nin time late on July 22, 2010 or early on July 23, 2010, he drove his car with his former friend\nFernando Justiniano to a Taco Bell establishment. He further testified that, while he did not buy\nanything at the Taco Bell, Mr. Justiniano purchased both a meal and a soda; defendant added that\nhe then proceeded to drive Mr. Justiniano to the latter’s home at 35 George Street.', 'The defendant further testified that, while driving on George Street, after midnight, he\nsaw a female, who he believed to be intoxicated, walking along the street. He stated:', '“When I stopped at the stop sign on the first half of George Street,', 'a female approached my car and asked me, do I know you? * * * I', 'kept driving past the stop sign.”', '-5-\nThe defendant further stated:', '“[Mr. Justiniano] told me, ask her if she wants a ride, ask her if she', 'wants to come home with us. I looked at him like he was crazy. I', 'asked him why would I ever do that, and he just kind of stood', 'quiet.”\nIt was defendant’s testimony that he subsequently pulled the car into Mr. Justiniano’s driveway\nand that, after Mr. Justiniano exited the car (taking his soda from Taco Bell with him), he\nreturned home to Morgan Avenue. The defendant denied having sexually assaulted Anna.', 'The defendant also testified that, when the police arrived at his home approximately\nthirty to forty minutes after he went to bed, which he did shortly after arriving home, he was\nescorted by police officers to the “top of [his] driveway,” where they shone a light on his face.\nHe further testified that the police car was at the end of his driveway, roughly twenty feet from\nwhere he was positioned, and that he heard an officer step out of the police car and say, “She\ncannot I.D. him.” It was additionally his testimony that he was then brought closer to the police\ncar by the officers until he was roughly “three, three and a half feet” away from it; he stated that\nat that point he observed an officer sitting next to a woman whose hands were over her face and\nwhose head was in her lap.5 He testified that “one of the police officers whispered something in\nthe woman’s ear” and that he then heard an officer say “positive I.D.” He further stated that he\nwas “positive” that the woman did “not look at [him] for one second.”6 The defendant stated\n5', 'Detective DelSanto testified that he had instructed Anna to keep her head down and to\nthen raise her head when he told her to do so. He stated: “At that point when [defendant was\nmoved closer to the car], I said raise your head, look to the left, and that’s when he was\npositively identified.”\n6', 'Although defendant’s testimony with respect to Anna’s identification of him was\ncorroborated by the testimony of his stepsister, the state called as a rebuttal witness North\nProvidence Police Officer Christopher Puleo, who had observed Anna’s identification of\ndefendant at the latter’s residence on Morgan Avenue. Officer Puleo’s testimony was consistent\nwith the testimony of both Anna and Det. DelSanto. He testified that Det. DelSanto was in the', '-6-\nthat he was arrested at that time and that he then asked the police to fingerprint the Taco Bell cup\nwhich the police told him had been thrown at the complaining witness because he believed it\nmight exonerate him.', 'A photograph of Mr. Justiniano and defendant taken in 2010, in which they are shown\nstanding side by side, was entered into evidence at trial; after being shown that photograph,\ndefendant testified that he and Mr. Justiniano appeared “not much different” from each other\nphysically. He added that Mr. Justiniano was “maybe half an inch” taller than he and that, at the\ntime of the alleged attack, both he and Mr. Justiniano wore their hair in the style which he\ncharacterized as a “Mohawk.” He further stated that, early on the morning of July 23, 2010, he\nhad been wearing “dark jeans, pants [sic], dress shoes, [and a] purple dress shirt” and that Mr.\nJustiniano had been wearing a white dress shirt and jeans. However, he proceeded to testify that,\nby the time that Anna identified him in his driveway, he had changed and was then wearing a\nwhite shirt and jean shorts. The defendant has consistently contended that Anna mistakenly\nidentified him rather than Mr. Justiniano as her attacker. On appeal, defendant argues that they\nresemble each other physically—specifically, with respect to their “age, distinctive hair style,\nhair color, race, height, and weight.” He also emphasizes that, when he was identified by Anna,\nhe was wearing a white shirt, the same color shirt as Mr. Justiniano was wearing when defendant\ndropped him off at his home on the morning of July 23.\ndriver’s seat of the police car. He stated that Det. DelSanto never exited the police car and that\nhe did not see him whispering to Anna. He added that Anna was seated in the rear of the car by\nherself; he further testified that, although her head had been in her lap, there came a point in time\nwhen he saw her look up and identify defendant.', '-7-', 'B', 'The Verdict, the Motion for a New Trial, and the Sentencing', 'On November 2, 2011, a jury found defendant guilty on Counts One and Two (both\ncharging second-degree sexual assault), but it acquitted him on Count Three (charging simple\nassault).', 'Subsequently, on November 8, 2011, defendant moved for a new trial; defendant argued\nthat the “most significant” fact giving rise to reasonable doubt as to his guilt was the absence of\nan in-court identification of him by Anna. The defendant argued that the testimony of Anna,\nDet. DelSanto, Officer Puleo, and Cathy was contradictory. He also contended that the police\ndepartment’s investigation of the incident was flawed in that the police had not fingerprinted the\nTaco Bell cup and had not conducted a side by side identification process. The defendant\nmaintained that he was innocent and that, if anyone had attacked Anna, it was Mr. Justiniano.\nThe trial justice ultimately denied defendant’s motion. In due course, defendant was sentenced\nto concurrent three year terms of imprisonment on each of the two counts on which he had been\nfound guilty; the trial justice ordered that the sentences be suspended, with probation.', 'The defendant filed a timely appeal to this Court. On appeal, defendant challenges only\nthe trial justice’s denial of his motion for a new trial.', 'II', 'Analysis', 'On appeal, defendant contends that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new\ntrial because “reasonable minds could not differ regarding the evidence and the reasonable\ninferences drawn therefrom in this case” and because the evidence presented at trial was\ninsufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was the person who sexually', '-8-\nassaulted Anna. The defendant submits that the evidence tended to establish that Mr. Justiniano\nwas the “likely culprit,” and defendant asserts that what he considers to be Anna’s\n“misidentification” of him was caused by her consumption of alcohol and the similarity of his\nphysical appearance to that of Mr. Justiniano.', ""When a trial justice considers a motion for a new trial, he or she “acts as a thirteenth juror\nand exercises independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the\nevidence.” State v. Rosario, 35 A.3d 938, 947 (R.I. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted);\nsee also State v. Wray, 38 A.3d 1102, 1108 (R.I. 2012); State v. Morales, 895 A.2d 114, 121\n(R.I. 2006). In carrying out that role, “the trial justice must (1) consider the evidence in light of\nthe jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the\nevidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from\nthat reached by the jury.” State v. Silva, 84 A.3d 411, 416 (R.I. 2014) (internal quotation marks\nomitted); see also State v. Mitchell, 80 A.3d 19, 30 (R.I. 2013); State v. Perkins, 966 A.2d 1257,\n1260 (R.I. 2009). If, after conducting that three-step process of independent review, “the trial\njustice agrees with the jury's verdict or determines that reasonable minds could differ, then the\nanalysis is complete and the verdict should be affirmed.” State v. Harrison, 66 A.3d 432, 445\n(R.I. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Rosario, 35 A.3d at 947; State v.\nDeOliveira, 972 A.2d 653, 665 (R.I. 2009)."", 'This Court has “indicated that the record should reflect a few sentences of the [trial]\njustice’s reasoning on each point.” State v. DiCarlo, 987 A.2d 867, 870 (R.I. 2010) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). We have further stated that, “[i]n providing a rationale for a decision\n* * * the trial justice need * * * only cite evidence sufficient to allow this [C]ourt to discern', '-9-\nwhether the [trial] justice has applied the appropriate standards.” Id. (internal quotation marks\nomitted).', 'On appellate review, “[i]f the trial justice has complied with this procedure and\narticulated adequate reasons for denying the motion, his or her decision will be given great\nweight and left undisturbed unless the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence\nor otherwise was clearly wrong.” State v. Paola, 59 A.3d 99, 104 (R.I. 2013) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted); see also State v. Clay, 79 A.3d 832, 842 (R.I. 2013); Harrison, 66 A.3d at 445.', 'It is clear to us that the trial justice in the instant case set forth and applied the correct\nstandard in reviewing defendant’s motion for a new trial. First, the trial justice considered the\nevidence presented at trial in light of the jury charge, giving special attention to the testimony of\nthe complaining witness, Anna. The trial justice expressly acknowledged defendant’s contention\nthat this was a case of mistaken identity, and he recognized that “the verdict turned on the jury’s\nassessment of the credibility of the complaining witness * * * [,] in particular, the reliability of\nher identification of Mr. Barrios as the person who assaulted her * * * .” In accordance with the\nsecond step in the process of analyzing a motion for a new trial, the trial justice then\nindependently assessed the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence. The trial\njustice made comprehensive findings on the record setting forth his reasons for denying\ndefendant’s motion.', 'When addressing defendant’s claim that Anna was intoxicated and thus could not identify\nhim, the trial justice noted that “she insisted that despite her drinking, when this assault occurred,\nshe was possessed of all her senses;” the trial justice found that insistence on her part to be\ncorroborated by the testimony of Cathy and Det. DelSanto, as well as by the sound of Anna’s\nvoice on the 911 tape. The trial justice concluded that: “[N]either I nor the jury, apparently, was', '- 10 -\npersuaded that she had [drunk] to an extent that it rendered her perception of what occurred and\nwho did it on the evening in question unreliable.” With respect to Anna’s identification of\ndefendant, the trial justice stated that her identification of him was “unequivocal” and found as\nfollows:', '“The defendant fits the description, particularly when you view the', 'way he looked on the day of the incident as depicted by the', 'photograph that was displayed on the screen and [Anna] identified.', '* * * [I]t may be a bit unusual that no in-court identification was', 'proffered, but that doesn’t change the fact that there was evidence', 'that that was the photograph of Mr. Barrios and that was the way', 'he looked on the evening in question.”', 'The trial justice then considered the testimony of defendant and his stepsister with respect\nto the circumstances surrounding Anna’s identification of defendant as her attacker at\ndefendant’s home on Morgan Avenue. He ultimately found the testimony of both defendant and\nhis stepsister not to be credible, whereas he found the testimony of Detective DelSanto and\nOfficer Puleo “in terms of their relating of what transpired at Morgan Avenue, to be credible and\ntruthful.”', 'The trial justice significantly concluded pursuant to the third step of his independent\nreview that “reasonable minds could differ as to the defendant’s guilt or innocence.” Then, in\naccordance with well-established legal principles, the trial justice subsequently denied\ndefendant’s motion for a new trial. See State v. Guerra, 12 A.3d 759, 765 (R.I. 2011) (stating\nthat if, after conducting the required analysis, “the trial justice * * * determines that, based upon\nthe evidence, reasonable minds could differ as to the proper outcome, then the inquiry is at an\nend and the motion for a new trial should be denied”) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'In our judgment, the trial justice properly carried out his role as the metaphorical\nthirteenth juror, conducting the required three-step analysis before denying defendant’s motion', '- 11 -\nfor a new trial. Although defendant attempts to cast doubt on Anna’s identification of him,\nimportantly, the trial justice expressly found that, after considering Anna’s alcohol consumption,\nthe presence of street lights, her proximity to the assailant, and the description which she gave to\nthe police, he was not persuaded that her perception of what had occurred was unreliable. 7 In\nrendering his decision, the trial justice reviewed all of the testimony and evidence at trial, and he\nultimately found Anna to be credible.', 'As we have noted, the trial justice concluded that\n“reasonable minds could differ” as to defendant’s guilt and that, in his opinion, the jury’s guilty\nverdict was “supported by the evidence.”', ""This Court has stated on several occasions that we afford “a great deal of respect to the\nfactual determinations and credibility assessments made by the judicial officer who has actually\nobserved the human drama that is part and parcel of every trial and who has had an opportunity\nto appraise witness demeanor and to take into account other realities that cannot be grasped from\na reading of a cold record.” Paola, 59 A.3d at 106 (internal quotation marks omitted). Bearing in\nmind the deferential standard of review that governs our scrutiny of a trial justice's findings and\nconclusions in this context, we are unable to rule that the trial justice in this close and credibility-\nintensive case was either clearly wrong or that he overlooked or misconceived material and\nrelevant evidence in his denial of the defendant’s motion for a new trial. See Clay, 79 A.3d at\n842; State v. Adefusika, 989 A.2d 467, 481 (R.I. 2010). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial\njustice properly denied the defendant’s motion.\n7"", 'This Court has discussed the relationship between witness credibility and witness\nreliability.

We have specifically stated that, when ruling on a new trial motion, the\ntrial justice “must also determine to what extent reliability affects the witnesses’ credibility and\nwhat weight should be given to their testimony.” Luanglath, 749 A.2d at 6.

This case came before the Supreme Court on writ of\ncertiorari on January 22, 2015, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show\ncause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided.1 The defendant,\nWilson Rodriguez (defendant or Rodriguez), appeals from a judgment of conviction after a jury\nverdict finding him guilty of one count of delivery of a controlled substance, to wit cocaine.\nAfter the trial justice heard, and denied, the defendant’s motion for a new trial, he sentenced the\ndefendant to five years at the Adult Correctional Institutions, with one year to serve and four\nyears suspended with probation. Before this Court, the defendant raises a bevy of issues, all of\nwhich lack merit. The defendant argues that the trial justice erred in: (1) his denial of the\ndefendant’s motion in limine to bar the testimony of Detectives Louis Stravato (Det. Stravato)\nand Anthony Hampton (Det. Hampton); (2) his charge to the jury; (3) his failure to include\ncertain portions of testimony during a read back to the jury; (4) his denial of the defendant’s\nmotion for judgment of acquittal; and (5) his denial of the defendant’s motion for a new trial.\n1', 'The defendant filed a petition for certiorari after his appeal was dismissed by the Superior\nCourt for failure to properly perfect his appeal.', '-1-\nAfter hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we\nare of the opinion that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the appeal at this\ntime. We affirm the judgment of conviction.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On February 26, 2008, Providence Police Detectives Stravato and Hampton were\ninvestigating defendant for possible narcotics violations. Detective Stravato testified that they\nset up a surveillance because they “had information that [defendant] was * * * a narcotics dealer,\nspecifically crack cocaine.” The detectives observed defendant exiting a home on Barry Road in\nProvidence with an elderly gentleman—later determined to be defendant’s father—and drive off\nin a white Acura. The detectives proceeded to follow defendant.', 'Eventually, after passing through portions of Cranston and Warwick, the surveillance led\nthe detectives to the parking lot of the Rhode Island Mall in Warwick. The detectives parked\nthirty to forty feet away from defendant’s vehicle and saw another vehicle park next to\ndefendant’s vehicle; both vehicles were facing in the same direction. Detective Stravato then\nsaw the passenger of the second vehicle—later identified as Pamela Sherman (Sherman)—throw\n“crumbled currency, crumbled in a ball” into defendant’s car and then defendant threw what\nappeared to be cocaine into the car occupied by Sherman. The two cars then exited the parking\nlot, and the detectives followed the car in which Sherman was a passenger because, according to\nDet. Stravato, they had already “identified [defendant] so we weren’t concerned about, you\nknow, particularly apprehending him at that point.”', 'The Providence police detectives stopped the Sherman vehicle after it had entered West\nWarwick. Detective Hampton removed Sherman from the car and asked her about drugs in her\nvehicle. Sherman admitted that the drugs were in a pack of cigarettes inside the vehicle. The', '-2-\npack of cigarettes contained a bag of suspected crack cocaine. It was seized and turned over to\nDetective Sergeant Lavigne of the West Warwick Police Department. Sherman was arrested by\nthe West Warwick Police and charged with drug possession. The suspected narcotics were field-\ntested at the West Warwick police headquarters and tested positive for cocaine. 2 Eventually, on\nMarch 11, 2008, defendant was arrested by the Providence police on the basis of a Warwick\nPolice Department arrest warrant with an affidavit signed by a member of the Providence Police\nDepartment and was later transferred to the custody of the Warwick Police Department.', 'In a pretrial ruling, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion in limine to preclude trial\ntestimony of Detectives Stravato and Hampton on the grounds that the Providence police lacked\njurisdictional authority to conduct a surveillance outside of Providence’s city limits without\ninforming the local police departments, and that the Providence police had no authority to seize\nsuspected narcotics from Sherman. The trial justice rejected defendant’s argument, observing\nthat the detectives did not arrest defendant outside of Providence, but merely conducted\nsurveillance of defendant. Furthermore, the trial justice noted that there was no authority that\nsuggested that the detectives’ actions were in violation of state law.', 'The case was reached for trial on January 4, 2010. The state called several witnesses in\nsupport of its case, including Det. Stravato, Det. Hampton, and Sherman. The state rested on\nJanuary 5, 2010; and the next day, defendant moved for judgment of acquittal. The trial justice\ndenied the motion, concluding that the state had submitted evidence supporting all of the\nelements of the charged offense. The defense rested without presenting any evidence. After the\ntrial justice instructed the jury, defendant raised a number of objections to the jury charge, all of\nwhich were denied by the trial justice.\n2', 'The state crime laboratory later confirmed that the substance in the plastic bag was cocaine.', '-3-', 'During its deliberations on the afternoon of January 6, 2010, the jury submitted the\nfollowing question to the trial justice: “What body parts did the following witnesses say they saw\ncoming from the defendant’s car?”', 'The question listed Det.

The trial adjourned for the\nday to enable the stenographer to find the responsive testimony.', 'The next day, the trial justice read back the following two excerpts from the testimony of\nDet. Stravato: (1) Q: “Now, did you see any part of his body perform that action, is what I’m\nasking?” A: “Yes, his left hand.” and (2) Q: “Okay. Can you tell us what you observed next?” A:\n“I observed Mr. Rodriguez’s hand, um, come through his window of his vehicle and toss into her\nvehicle a, um, small bag of suspected crack cocaine.”', 'However, the trial justice refused\ndefendant’s request to read a portion of Det. Stravato’s cross-examination testimony in which he\ntestified that he did not see defendant’s hand outside of his car at a particular point in time. The\ntrial justice determined “that the request of the jury is specifically as to body parts coming from\nthe defendant’s car.” Therefore, the trial justice concluded that the read back requested by\ndefendant was “not in the positive. It’s not something coming from the car. He said he didn’t\nsee anything coming from the car at that time.” Thus, the trial justice declined to read back that\nportion of Det. Stravato’s testimony as it was not responsive to the jury’s question. Later that\nday, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on the charge of delivery of a controlled substance.', 'The defendant filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that the verdict was against the\nweight of the evidence and also that the trial justice had committed an error of law when he\nrefused to read back the requested portion of Det. Stravato’s testimony to the jury. The trial\njustice denied both bases of defendant’s motion. The defendant was later sentenced to five\nyears, with one year to serve and four years suspended with probation.', '-4-', 'Analysis', 'Motion in Limine', 'This Court “review[s] the grant or denial of a motion in limine for an abuse of\ndiscretion.” State v. Marte, 92 A.3d 148, 150 (R.I. 2014) (quoting Fravala v. City of Cranston ex\nrel. Baron, 996 A.2d 696, 702 (R.I. 2010)). “When reviewing the grant or denial of a motion in\nlimine, this Court will consider only whether the challenged evidence was proper and admissible\nand, if not, whether there was sufficient prejudice to constitute reversible error.” State v.\nScanlon, 982 A.2d 1268, 1274 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. Gomes, 881 A.2d 97, 111 (R.I.\n2005)).', 'The defendant asserts that the trial justice erred in denying his motion in limine seeking\nto exclude the testimony of Providence Detectives Stravato and Hampton because they were\noutside of their jurisdiction when they observed the alleged criminal conduct in Warwick. The\ndefendant argues that G.L. 1956 § 12-7-19 and G.L. 1956 § 45-42-1 impose an obligation upon\npolice to contact local authorities from the cities and towns when making an arrest outside their\njurisdiction. By extension, defendant contends that the same obligation applied to Detectives\nStravato and Hampton during their surveillance. Thus, defendant asserts that the surveillance\nwas illegal and the testimony derived therefrom should have been excluded.', 'This argument ignores our recent holding in State v. Morris, 92 A.3d 920, 926 (R.I.\n2014), where we stated “that the Pawtucket police could properly travel outside of their\njurisdiction without the accompaniment of Providence police in the course of investigating the\nrobberies.”', 'As Detectives Stravato and Hampton were merely conducting surveillance of\ndefendant—that began in Providence—and they did not arrest him at that time, the detectives', '-5-\nwere not required to contact the authorities of the cities and towns through which they traveled.\nSee id.', 'Furthermore, the detectives did not follow defendant out of the parking lot, but rather\npursued Sherman.', 'Thus, even if Sherman had been arrested outside of the detectives’\njurisdiction, defendant has no standing to challenge her arrest because the Fourth Amendment is\na personal right and defendant would have no expectation of privacy in the search that was\nconducted. See State v. Quinlan, 921 A.2d 96, 109 (R.I. 2007) (“A party has standing when he\nor she is found to have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the area searched or the thing\nseized.” citing State v.

Sivo, 809 A.2d 481, 488 (R.I. 2002).\n“A ‘trial justice is bound to ensure that the jury charge sufficiently addresses the requested\ninstructions and correctly states the applicable law.’” Long, 61 A.3d at 445 (quoting State v.\nSivo, 925 A.2d 901, 913 (R.I. 2007)).', '-6-', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice erred when he overruled defendant’s objection\nto the jury instructions focused on what he contends was insufficient instruction and use of the\nphrase “beyond a reasonable doubt” in various portions of the jury charge. We note at the outset\nthat defendant failed to specifically identify the portions of the jury instructions that he is\ncontesting on appeal.', 'The defendant’s argument contesting the jury charge has not been\nsufficiently developed for this Court to review. See State v. Day, 925 A.2d 962, 974 n.19 (R.I.\n2007). Nonetheless, from our review of the trial transcript, it is abundantly clear that the\ninstructions provided by the trial justice properly instructed the jurors on the applicable law and\nthe state’s burden of proof. It was not necessary that the term “beyond a reasonable doubt” be\nrepeated throughout the instructions, but rather, that the meaning of “beyond a reasonable doubt”\nmust adequately be conveyed to the jury. See State v. Imbruglia, 913 A.2d 1022, 1030, 1033\n(R.I. 2007) (holding that the trial justice is “not obligated to use the specific words requested by\n[the] defendant” so long as the trial justice “adequately cover[s] the law”). The instructions in\nthis case satisfied this requirement.', 'The Testimony Read Back to the Jury', '“The decision whether to read back to the jury a particular witness’s trial testimony—in\nresponse to a jury request—‘is committed to the sound discretion of the trial justice.’” State v.\nRos, 973 A.2d 1148, 1176 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. Dumas, 835 A.2d 438, 443 (R.I. 2003)).\n“The trial justice generally should honor such a request, ‘especially when it is practically\npossible to do so without consuming an inordinate amount of time and without misleading the\njury.’” Id. (quoting Dumas, 835 A.2d at 443). Furthermore, a read back must be both fair and\nimpartial; thus, “it should include all testimony pertaining to the subject matter of the jury\nrequest.” Id. (citing Dumas, 835 A.2d at 444).', '-7-', 'The defendant contends that the trial justice erred when, in response to the question posed\nby the jury, he did not read back the following excerpt: Q: “Was Mr. Rodriguez’s, I assume, left\nhand outside the window?” A: “Not at that point.” The trial justice determined that this excerpt\nwas not within the purview of the question posed by the jury because it did not relate to what\nparts of defendant’s body the witnesses “saw coming from the defendant’s car[.]”', 'We discern no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial justice in excluding the\nchallenged portion of Det. Stravato’s testimony. While the testimony implies that Det. Stravato\nsaw defendant’s hand at some other point, it was not responsive to the question that was posed\nby the jury. It is well settled that “[t]he trial justice has considerable discretion in how to\nrespond to a request.” Ros, 973 A.2d at 1176. Here, the trial justice determined that the\nchallenged testimony was not responsive, particularly in light of the fact that the question called\nfor an answer as to when defendant’s body parts were coming from the vehicle, and the\nchallenged testimony related to a point when defendant’s hand was not observed outside the\nvehicle. We previously have stated that “[w]hen a jury makes a request for information, the\nresponse should be tailored to the request.” Id. We are satisfied that the response provided by\nthe trial justice was appropriately tailored to the request of the jury, and it was within his sound\ndiscretion to decline to read back the portion requested by defendant.', 'Motion for a New Trial and Judgment of Acquittal', '“When ruling on a motion for a new trial, the trial justice acts as a thirteenth juror,\nexercising ‘independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the\nevidence.’” State v.

Stravato’s testimony. The defendant contends\nthat the detectives’ credibility was first called into question because they knowingly allowed\ndefendant to drive even though they had probable cause to arrest him for operating the vehicle\nwithout a valid license. Additionally, defendant asserts that there were inconsistencies between\nthe testimony of the detectives as to where in the parking lot the delivery took place.', 'Although the trial justice acknowledged the minor inconsistencies between the testimony\nof Detectives Stravato and Hampton, he also found that, to the extent the testimony was\ninconsistent, Sherman’s testimony established that she purchased cocaine from defendant at that\nlocation.

He concluded that it was\nnot error to decline to read back the portion requested by defendant.', 'We are of the opinion that the trial justice did not err in denying defendant’s motion for a\nnew trial.

When Sarah’s\nmother moved the blankets, she saw that her daughter’s jeans and underwear had been pulled\ndown below her waist. Sarah’s mother immediately took the child into her own bedroom, locked\nthe door, and asked her “Did he touch your cookie?”3 Sarah answered “yes[,]” and her mother\nsubsequently called the East Providence police. When the police arrived, Sarah’s mother\nexplained what had happened, and Sarah was taken to Hasbro Children’s Hospital (Hasbro) for\nan examination, which was performed by Dr. Goldberg. The following day the police arrested\ndefendant.', 'On March 18, 2011, a criminal information was filed against defendant in Providence\nCounty Superior Court, alleging one count of second-degree child molestation in violation of\nG.L. 1956 § 11-37-8.3 and § 11-37-8.4. A jury trial was held in September 2012.

Jones) of the East Providence police department was the first\nwitness. Detective Jones was on duty on January 29, 2011 and spoke with defendant the\nfollowing day, after defendant’s arrest. According to Det. Jones, he and another officer, Det.\nMichael Spremulli (Det. Spremulli), first spoke to defendant while in the department cellblock\nand, after he agreed to speak with them, defendant was moved to an interview room. Detective\nJones stated that he “asked [defendant] if he understood, if he could read English, if he could\nread period, and [defendant] said yes.” Detective Jones testified that he provided defendant with\na rights form and advised defendant of his constitutional rights, as set forth on the form. The\ndefendant then initialed each numerically listed item on the rights form and signed the form.', 'Next, Det. Jones testified that, although defendant was alert, he appeared “subdued but\nnervous[,]” which the detective characterized as normal behavior.', 'Detective Jones\nacknowledged that defendant stated that he had vomited some sleeping pills which he ingested\nprior to being arrested while purportedly attempting suicide, but the officer testified that he did\nnot observe anything that would suggest defendant had taken sleeping pills.

Then he said', 'when he saw her vagina he got curious as to what it would feel', 'like. So at that time, he said he touched her vagina, got nervous,', '-3-', 'realizing what he did was wrong, and then left the room.”\nAfter the interview, Det. Jones typed the statement, asked defendant to read the statement, and\nthen asked him if there were any inconsistencies in the statement or anything he wished to\nchange. Detective Jones testified that defendant never indicated that the statement was incorrect\nor that it was incomplete in any way. The defendant then signed the statement. Detective Jones\nnoted that at no time during his interaction with defendant did defendant ever ask to speak to an\nattorney, nor did defendant request that he be allowed to make a phone call.4', 'Detective Spremulli also testified at the suppression hearing. Detective Spremulli’s\ntestimony corroborated the testimony of Det. Jones. Specifically, Det. Spremulli testified that he\nwas present when defendant read the rights form, indicated to the officers that he understood the\ncontents of the form, and initialed and signed the rights form. Detective Spremulli’s recollection\nof defendant’s confession was substantially the same as that of Det. Jones. Detective Spremulli\nalso testified that he did not recall defendant asking for a lawyer, nor did he recall anyone\ncoming into the interview room to tell the officers about a telephone call.', 'The defendant’s version was at variance with the testimony of the police detectives.\nAccording to defendant, after he was first arrested and while still in handcuffs, ten to fifteen\nofficers “kept saying[,] * * * did you resist arrest? Did he resist arrest? * * * I hope he does, I\nhope he does, I’m really in the mood to mess him up. They kept saying, I want to mess him up, I\nwant to fuck him up.” He testified that the officers were “fingering their Billy clubs and putting\ntheir hands on their guns and stuff * * *.” The defendant stated that he “was afraid they were\ngoing to beat the hell out of [him]” and that he felt “intimidated.” The defendant testified that,\nwhen he arrived at the station, officers further threatened him about what he could expect from\n4', 'Detective Jones did, however, testify that the booking sheet was marked “phone call, no[,]”\nindicating, according to the officer, that defendant “didn’t choose to make a phone call.”', '-4-\nthe other inmates at the prison, which made him think that he “was going to die.” The defendant\nstated that, while at the police station, he asked an officer if he could make a phone call;\nhowever, because the telephone number of the person he wished to call was on his mobile phone,\nthe officer allowed defendant to make one phone call from his mobile phone. The defendant\ntestified that he called his mother and asked her to call his cousin and ask the cousin to obtain a\nlawyer for him.', 'The defendant’s testimony concerning the interview with Det. Jones and Det. Spremulli\nalso differed from that of the detectives. He testified that, numerous times before he was shown\nthe rights form, he asked for a lawyer. He testified that Det. Jones ignored his requests and kept\npestering him about the incident. The defendant testified that he signed the rights form because\nhe was scared, tired, and “afraid that the judge was going to decide [he] was guilty if [he] didn’t\ngive [his] side of the story.” He also told the court that, while being questioned, another officer\ncame into the room where he was being questioned and said something to Det. Jones about a\nphone call. The defendant admitted to giving a statement to the police and signing it, but he\nstated that he never read it and only signed it because he “was afraid not to.” However, on cross-\nexamination, defendant admitted that he understood he did not have to say anything to the\nofficers but spoke with Det. Jones anyway.', 'The defendant’s mother also testified at the suppression hearing. She testified that, on\nJanuary 30, 2011, she received a call from defendant, requesting that she obtain a lawyer for him.\nShe testified that she told defendant that she would contact his cousin to obtain a lawyer for him;\nshe then called defendant’s cousin, who agreed to help. The defendant’s cousin also testified and\nstated that she contacted Attorney Priscilla DiMaio (Attorney DiMaio), who agreed to represent\ndefendant.', '-5-', 'Lastly, Attorney DiMaio testified. Attorney DiMaio testified that, on January 30, 2011,\nat approximately 9:45 in the morning, she called the East Providence police department,\nidentified herself as an attorney who was trying to contact defendant, and asked to speak to a\ndetective. She stated that she also asked to speak with defendant, but her request was denied.\nShe testified that she told a detective “to let [defendant] know that [she had] called, and * * * not\nto give a statement.” We note that the record discloses that defendant signed the waiver of rights\nform at 9:40 that morning.', 'At the conclusion of testimony and after hearing counsels’ arguments, the trial justice\nrendered a bench decision. The trial justice denied the motion to suppress, declaring that, based\non the record before her, defendant’s statement was voluntary and that defendant had not been\ndeprived of his right to counsel. With respect to whether the statement was voluntary, the trial\njustice found defendant’s testimony “implausible,” “unbelievable,” and “far-fetched.” “Viewing\nall the evidence and under the totality of the circumstances[,]” the trial justice found that\ndefendant’s statement was not coerced and that defendant knowingly, intelligently, and\nvoluntarily waived his rights. Also, with respect to defendant’s argument that he was deprived\nof his right to counsel, the trial justice, citing State v. Burbine, 451 A.2d 22 (R.I. 1982), noted\n“that the effort by third parties to retain counsel for the defendant is entirely irrelevant to whether\nthe defendant asked for and was denied the right to counsel.” See id. at 27-28. The trial justice\nwent on to find “the detectives to be more credible than the defendant in testifying that the\ndefendant never did request counsel.” Specifically, the trial justice found “it incredible that such\nnumerous requests [for a lawyer] were made * * * and fell on deaf ears * * *.” The trial justice\ndetermined that the state had established by clear and convincing evidence that defendant did not\nrequest an attorney and, therefore, was not deprived of his right to counsel.', '-6-', 'Before this Court, defendant asserts that the trial justice erred in denying his motion to\nsuppress his statement to police, arguing that his statement was not voluntary. “Both the Rhode\nIsland and the United States Constitutions bar the use of a defendant’s involuntary statements in\na criminal trial.” State v. Bojang, 83 A.3d 526, 532 (R.I. 2014) (quoting State v. Bido, 941 A.2d\n822, 835 (R.I. 2008)). “In order for the trial justice to admit a defendant’s statement at trial, ‘the\nstate must establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that the defendant knowingly and\nintelligently waived his or her right against self-incrimination and that the statement was\nvoluntary.’” Id. at 533 (quoting State v. Monteiro, 924 A.2d 784, 790 (R.I. 2007)). “This inquiry\n‘requires an analysis of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation.’” Id.\n(quoting State v. Jimenez, 33 A.3d 724, 734 (R.I. 2011)). “This Court applies the following two-\nstep review of a trial justice’s finding of voluntariness:', '‘First, we review the trial justice’s findings of historical fact with', 'deference, and we will not overturn those findings unless they are', 'clearly erroneous. * * * Second, because this issue is of', 'constitutional dimension, we accept the historical facts and', 'credibility determinations, and we then conduct de novo review of', 'the trial justice’s conclusion that the confession was voluntary.’”', 'Id. (quoting Monteiro, 924 A.2d at 790).', 'After examining the record in this case, we are satisfied that defendant’s confession was\nvoluntary and that the trial justice did not err when she refused to suppress the confession. The\nevidence presented at the suppression hearing disclosed that Det. Jones advised defendant of his\nrights, both orally and in writing. The defendant initialed and signed the waiver of rights form\nthat was introduced into evidence. Detective Jones testified that defendant appeared alert, and\nboth Det. Jones and Det. Spremulli testified that defendant acknowledged that he understood his\nrights. Finally, defendant himself testified that he knew he did not have to say anything to the\ndetectives, but he nevertheless proceeded to speak with the detectives and then to sign the\nstatement.', '-7-', 'Although the trial justice set forth her decision in a comprehensive bench ruling, she did\nerr when she stated that “defendant never testified that his mother, aunt, and/or cousin were in\nthe process of retaining an attorney * * * [n]or did the defendant testify that he, in fact, had\nalready made a call to his mother requesting that she procure an attorney for him.” The record\nreveals that defendant did testify about the phone call to his mother. Nonetheless, this error was\nnot material and has no impact on our decision given the appropriate factual findings and\ncredibility determinations made by the trial justice in view of the totality of the circumstances.5\nThe trial justice specifically found that defendant did not invoke his right to counsel. The trial\njustice rejected defendant’s argument that the police officers threatened him or deprived him of\nhis right to counsel. The trial justice concluded, after analyzing the totality of the circumstances,\nthat defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his rights and spoke to the police.', 'In light of the trial justice’s findings of historical fact and credibility determinations,\nwhich we review with deference, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not misconceive or\noverlook material evidence, nor did she err in her conclusions. Our de novo review also satisfies\nus that defendant’s confession was given voluntarily.', 'Finally, we pause to note that defendant also argued that the trial justice erred in denying\nhis motion to suppress because he “was denied his right to a confidential phone call pursuant to\nR.I.G.L. § 12-7-20.” General Laws 1956 § 12-7-20 provides that a person who is arrested “shall\nbe afforded, as soon after being detained as practicable, * * * the opportunity to make use of a\ntelephone for the purpose of securing an attorney * * *.” Here, defendant testified that, after he\n5', 'The defendant testified that he was given an opportunity to make a phone call and did make a\nphone call. The detectives testified that the booking sheet was marked “phone call, no[,]”\nindicating that defendant “didn’t choose to make a phone call.” Whether or not the notation on\nthe booking sheet meant that defendant did not make a phone call from a police phone is\nirrelevant to our analysis. It is not disputed that defendant did in fact make a telephone call to his\nmother.', '-8-\nwas arrested and transported to the East Providence police station, he made a phone call to his\nmother and requested that she assist him in obtaining a lawyer by contacting a cousin.\nAccordingly, we deem this argument without merit.', 'Testimony of Dr. Goldberg', 'Next, defendant asserts that the trial justice erred when she allowed Dr. Goldberg to\ntestify regarding what defendant characterized as “physical examination, diagnosis, and\ntreatment of penetrative first degree sexual assault[,]” as contrasted with the second-degree\nsexual assault of which he was accused. During trial, the state sought to introduce the testimony\nof Dr. Goldberg, an attending physician in the Child Protection Program at Hasbro who had\nexamined Sarah on the night of the incident. At trial, Dr. Goldberg discussed her examination of\nthe child, presented certain disclosures that Sarah made during her examination, and explained\nwhat was meant by an examination that was found to be normal. Doctor Goldberg testified that,\non January 29, 2011, Sarah, in describing the incident and her physical condition, had told her\n“she felt wet,” a symptom which, Dr. Goldberg explained, prompted her to evaluate the child for\nan acute sexual assault. Next, Dr. Goldberg testified that Sarah had some redness in her genital\nexamination but that the rest of her physical examination appeared to be normal, which she\nexplained to the jury meant that she saw no specific abnormalities. Doctor Goldberg went on to\nexplain that a normal finding does not necessarily mean that the child was not abused. Although\ndefense counsel objected numerous times throughout Dr. Goldberg’s testimony, these objections\nwere grounded on lack of materiality. Significantly, the witness was asked, without objection:\n“[a]nd that normal examination in your mind at the time, can you say for certain whether or not\nshe was touched in the manner that you understood?” To which Dr. Goldberg replied, “[Sarah’s]\nnormal examination does not exclude the possibility of sexual abuse, or even penetration, in my', '-9-\nmind.” Not only was there no objection to this question, there was no motion to strike this\nanswer.', 'On appeal, defendant contends that the trial justice erred in admitting this testimony\nbecause it was irrelevant, beyond the scope of proper expert testimony, and substantially\nprejudicial. It is well settled that this Court will “review a trial justice’s decision admitting or\nexcluding evidence under an abuse of discretion standard.” State v. Covington, 69 A.3d 855, 862\n(R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Brown, 42 A.3d 1239, 1242 (R.I. 2012)). “We will reverse a trial\njustice’s ruling on the admissibility of evidence only where ‘it constitutes a clear abuse of\ndiscretion.’” Id. (quoting Brown, 42 A.3d at 1242).', 'After a thorough examination of the record, this Court concludes that defendant failed to\npreserve this issue for appellate review. We note at the outset that, prior to Dr. Goldberg’s\ntestimony, defense counsel expressly agreed that “[Dr. Goldberg could] testify as to what the\nabsence of any injuries means, and [could] also testify as to the result of her examination.”\nDuring Dr. Goldberg’s direct examination she was asked, “[a]nd that normal examination in your\nmind at the time, can you say for certain whether or not she was touched in the manner that you\nunderstood?” To which Dr. Goldberg answered, “[h]er normal examination does not exclude the\npossibility of sexual abuse, or even penetration, in my mind.” As noted, defense counsel did not\nobject to the question, or move to strike the answer. Therefore, according to this Court’s “raise-\nor-waive” doctrine, we deem defendant’s argument that the trial justice erred in permitting Dr.\nGoldberg to testify waived.6 However, were this issue properly preserved before the Court, we\nare convinced that Dr. Goldberg’s testimony—which was equivocal at best—was not unduly\n6', 'See Berard v. HCP, Inc., 64 A.3d 1215, 1219 n.2 (R.I. 2013) (noting that the Court “shall ‘not\nreview issues that were not presented to the trial court in such a posture as to alert the trial justice\nto the question being raised[.]’” quoting State v. Kluth, 46 A.3d 867, 876 (R.I. 2012)).', '- 10 -\nprejudicial or implied that defendant engaged in sexual penetration, as the trial justice instructed\nthe jury “that there is no evidence in this case of the type of conduct that this doctor just referred\nto * * *.” It is also significant that defendant was not charged with first-degree sexual assault\nand that he, through his confession, admitted to improperly touching Sarah, the act that led to the\ncharge of second-degree child molestation for which he was convicted.', 'In addition, “because the state bears the burden of proving each element of the charge\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, it has the right to present evidence establishing those elements in its\ncase in chief.” State v. Marmolejos, 990 A.2d 848, 852 (R.I. 2010). Here, the child’s disclosure\nto Dr. Goldberg, about feeling “wet,” prompted the physical examination about which the\nwitness testified.', 'Thus, the state was within its rights to present testimony about the\nexamination.', 'Motion for Judgment of Acquittal', 'Lastly, defendant asserts that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for judgment of\nacquittal. “When passing on ‘a trial justice’s denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal, this\nCourt applies the same standard as the trial justice.’” State v. Long, 61 A.3d 439, 445 (R.I. 2013)\n(quoting State v. Lynch, 19 A.3d 51, 56 (R.I. 2011)). “A motion for a judgment of acquittal\nshould be granted only if the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, is\ninsufficient to establish the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id. (quoting State v.\nHeredia, 10 A.3d 443, 446 (R.I. 2010)).', '“If, however, a reasonable juror could find the\ndefendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, the motion should be denied.” Id. (quoting Heredia,\n10 A.3d at 446).', 'Viewing the evidence “in the light most favorable to the state” and “giving full credibility\nto the state’s witnesses,” we conclude that sufficient evidence existed to prove, beyond a', '- 11 -\nreasonable doubt, that the defendant committed one count of second-degree child molestation, in\nviolation of § 11-37-8.3. See Lynch, 19 A.3d at 56. In this case, the six-year-old child took the\nstand at trial and testified that, on the night of the incident, she woke up, felt something on her\nvagina, and opened her eyes to the defendant standing at her bed. Sarah’s mother also testified at\ntrial and corroborated the child’s statements and the events of that night. According to Sarah’s\nmother, on January 29, 2011, she had put her daughter to bed with her jeans and underwear\npulled up to her waist. At approximately one o’clock in the morning, she saw someone leaving\nher daughter’s room; and, when she went into the room, she discovered that her daughter’s pants\nand underwear had been pulled down below her waist. She testified that she took Sarah into her\nroom, locked the door, and asked her if the defendant touched her, to which Sarah replied, “yes.”\nDoctor Goldberg testified that Sarah told her that the defendant had been in her room that night\nand that “she felt wet.” Further, Det. Jones also testified at trial and read the defendant’s sworn\nstatement, which stated:', '“On January 28, 2011, I was out drinking * * *. Then I went to', 'check on [Sarah]. I noticed that she had jeans on, and she looked', 'very uncomfortable. * * * I went over to [her] and pulled her jeans', 'down. The jeans were so tight that her underpants came down', 'with the jeans. * * * I was always curious if a young girl felt the', 'same as a woman. * * * After [Sarah’s] underpants came down', 'with her jeans, I saw her vagina. * * * So I touched the outside of', '[her] vagina with my hand.”', '“A person is guilty of a second degree child molestation sexual assault if he or she\nengages in sexual contact with another person fourteen (14) years of age or under.” Section 11-\n37-8.3. Because we are satisfied that the state presented ample evidence that Sarah was six years\nold when the defendant touched her vagina, in violation of § 11-37-8.3, we conclude that there\nwas sufficient evidence to withstand the defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal and to\nsupport the conviction. Accordingly, the trial justice did not err when she denied the defendant’s', '- 12 -\nmotion for a judgment of acquittal.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons articulated in this opinion, we affirm the judgment below.

The trial justice sentenced the defendant to twenty-five years—with nine\nyears to serve and sixteen years suspended, with probation—for setting fire to his place of\nbusiness, Physique Gym, during a severe snowstorm in the middle of the night on March 2,\n2009. This case came before the Supreme Court for argument on March 1, 2016. The defendant\nraises two issues on appeal: (1) he challenges the admission into evidence of a video recording of\nhis custodial police interrogation; and (2) he challenges the denial of his motion for a new trial\non the basis that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. After careful consideration\nof the defendant’s arguments and a thorough review of the record, we affirm the judgment of\nconviction.', '-1-', '1', 'Facts and Travel', 'The Fire and the Early Morning Investigation', 'During the early morning hours of March 2, 2009, in blizzard-like weather conditions, the\nPhysique Gym on York Avenue in Pawtucket became engulfed in flames. 1 At around 3:40 a.m.,\nthe Pawtucket Fire Department received a call and responded to the fire. The first officer to\narrive at the scene reported the fire to be “code red, fully involved,” meaning that it was “an\nactual active confirmed fire” and “more progressed than you would normally expect on a certain\narrival time.” Battalion Chief Timothy Mercer said that the fire was fought during “[s]ome of\nthe worst conditions [he’d] experienced,” with “single[-]digit cold, heavy snow and quite\nwindy.” Mercer described the conflagration as “quite extensive,” that “[f]lames were already\nshooting out the windows, [and a] heavy smoke condition [was] reducing the visibility in the\narea quite substantially.”', 'At about that same time, at 3:50 a.m., the gym’s proprietor, Gary Gaudreau, called the\npolice to report a breaking and entering at his home. Predictably, Mr. Gaudreau quickly became\nthe primary target of police interest for what was already suspected to be an intentional arson.', 'Officer David Dolan reported to Gaudreau’s home to investigate the reported breaking\nand entering. Because of the hazardous conditions, it took him approximately thirty minutes to\ngo the four miles from the police station to Gaudreau’s home. The officer said that he was\n“paying special attention” because he had been informed on his way to the investigation that\nGaudreau’s business was ablaze. Upon arrival, Officer Dolan observed only one set of tire\n1', 'As set forth in detail, infra, there were two jury trials. The first jury trial was held in November\n2012 and ended in a mistrial when the jury could not reach a verdict. The second trial was\npresided over by a different trial justice in September 2013. The facts presented here are derived\nentirely from testimony and evidence presented at the second trial, unless otherwise specified.', '-2-\nmarks on the snow-covered driveway and he did not see any footprints on the sidewalk, in the\ndriveway, or in the front yard. However, when he walked up the driveway toward the detached\ngarage, Officer Dolan did see one set of footprints leading from the garage to the back porch\narea.', 'When Officer Dolan reached the back door of the home, he noticed a broken Plexiglas\nwindow, with glass on the ground, both outside and inside the door. Gaudreau admitted the\nofficer into the kitchen and living room. At that time, Gaudreau told him that he had left his\nhouse at approximately 1:30 a.m. and drove around for a couple of hours because he was unable\nto sleep. He said that he returned home at approximately 3:40 or 3:50 a.m. and called the police\nabout the break-in. Gaudreau also told the officer that the only thing that was missing from his\nhome was a “fanny pack” that had been on an ottoman in the living room. He said that the fanny\npack contained his keys to the gym, his wallet, and an unloaded handgun. Dolan did not\ninvestigate the rest of the house, relying on Gaudreau’s statement that he had searched the house\nand had found no one present and no other broken windows. Gaudreau also showed the officer\nan alarm-type system in his living room, explaining that “[w]hen it registers a noise, such as\nglass break [sic], there is a delay and then an alarm sounds.” Gaudreau explained that he\nbelieved that whoever had broken in came through the rear window, became spooked by the\nalarm, and grabbed the fanny pack before leaving through the same window.', 'At Officer Dolan’s request, Gaudreau showed him the garage, where the officer inspected\nthe interior and exterior of the car, finding nothing of interest except that, when he touched the\nhood of the car, it felt cold. Officer Dolan explained that Gaudreau was helpful, cooperative, and\neven talkative throughout his investigation, but that he appeared to be “walking very slowly and\ndeliberately,” or “gingerly.” Officer Dolan said that he was at Gaudreau’s house for about ten', '-3-\nminutes, but Gaudreau did not mention that he was aware that his business was on fire until the\nend of the investigation. At that time, Gaudreau told the officer that he was going to drive over\nto the scene of the fire at his gym.', 'Meanwhile, the battle to fight the blaze continued; the fire had progressed to a “third\nalarm,” meaning that the battalion chief had twice called for additional apparatus and manpower\nfrom within Pawtucket, as well as “mutual aid” from other communities. David Curran, a fire\ninvestigator with the State Fire Marshal’s office, arrived and photographed the scene in those\nearly morning hours.', 'Detective Scott Feeley of the Pawtucket Police Department, the lead detective on the\ncase, spoke to firefighters at the scene and contacted the property owner, George Gardinar.\nMr. Gardinar informed Det. Feeley that he leased the property to Gaudreau for use as a gym and\nthat he had allowed his insurance policy on the building to lapse a few years earlier. Detective\nFeeley then contacted Gaudreau and asked to speak with him at the police station about the fire\nand the breaking and entering. Around 7 a.m., he and Det. Robert Matook informed Gaudreau of\nhis Miranda rights and informed him that, although he was a suspect, the interview was\nvoluntary; the interview was not recorded. 2 Gaudreau told the detectives that he left the gym the\nnight before at approximately 9:30 p.m., stopped at a bank on his way home, and made a deposit.\nHe said that he was at home for a few hours and then he went for a drive at about 1:30 a.m.\nbecause he could not sleep. He said that he drove into and around Seekonk, Massachusetts,\nbefore returning home around 4 a.m. Detective Feeley said that Gaudreau told him that someone\nhad broken into his house while he was out driving and that whoever broke into his home had\ntaken his fanny pack containing his gym keys, his wallet, a firearm, and cash.', 'After the\n2', 'Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).', '-4-\ninterview, Det. Feeley searched Gaudreau’s car, house and garage, but nothing was seized, and\nGaudreau returned home.', 'However, when Det. Feeley returned to the station, he was notified that a witness had\ncontacted law enforcement at the scene of the fire. Paul Richard, a snowplow driver, met Det.\nFeeley at the police station and told him that he had seen Gaudreau at the Physique Gym earlier\nthat night when he was plowing snow. He gave the detectives a signed statement explaining that\nhe was called into work at about 9 or 10 p.m. that night to plow in the area of the gym. He said\nthat he saw Gaudreau, with his car backed up to an open door at Physique Gym with the trunk\nopen, at approximately 1:45 a.m. Mr. Richard explained that he was familiar with Gaudreau and\nwith his car because he was a member of Physique Gym. About 15 minutes later, Mr. Richard\nrecalled seeing Gaudreau in his car at the intersection of Newport and Columbus Avenues;\nindeed, he recalled flashing his lights for Gaudreau to go through the intersection. Mr. Richard\nalso identified Gaudreau from a photo array.', 'The Interrogation', 'Not surprisingly, after he was identified by Mr. Richard, Gaudreau was asked to return to\nthe police station around noon. Gaudreau voluntarily returned, again waived his Miranda rights,\nand was interviewed again.', 'The second interview was videotaped.', 'At trial, the video\ninterrogation was played for the jury during Det. Feeley’s testimony. The interrogation began\nwith the detectives asking Gaudreau to once again explain his whereabouts during the preceding\nnight and early morning. After Gaudreau essentially repeated the same story that he related to\nOfficer Dolan and during his 7 a.m. interview at the police station, the detectives asked him\ndirectly, “You had nothing to do with starting this fire?” Gaudreau responded, “Nothing to do\nwith starting this fire.”', '-5-', 'Detective Feeley then said, “Well, now that we have that taped, I want to read the\nstatement we have –.” He then read from Mr. Richard’s sworn statement explaining that he had\nseen Gaudreau at the gym around 1:45 a.m. Detective Feeley said he “showed him eleven\npictures and guess who he picked out as the guy who was coming out the door at 1:45 a.m.?”\nGaudreau responded, “Not me.” Gaudreau also denied the detectives’ accusations that “the jig is\nup,” that it was Gaudreau who set the building on fire, that there was a witness who knew him,\nand that Gaudreau was lying. The detectives repeatedly told Gaudreau that he was lying, that he\nmade false statements to the police, that he made up the “cockamamie” story about his house\nbeing broken into, and that they were sure they would find his fanny pack at the gym.', 'Gaudreau steadfastly refused to change his story, saying, “The guy might have seen me\nearlier, but he didn’t see me anywhere near that time.”', 'When he continued to deny any\ninvolvement in setting the fire, Det. Feeley finally said, “You’re being charged with second\ndegree arson. This is your last chance to be remorseful and give us a reason.” But after they\nfailed to wrest a confession out of Gaudreau, the detectives left the room.', 'Curran, the fire inspector, who was also at the Pawtucket police station to meet with\ndetectives and Gaudreau, advised the police that, because the building had been occupied within\nthe past six months, the appropriate charge would be first-degree arson. When the detectives\nreturned to the interrogation room a few minutes later, they informed Gaudreau that he would be\ncharged with first-degree arson, a capital offense. Detective Feeley said, “So, is there anything\nyou want to say? Because this is the last time we’re ending the interview. We’re going to bring\nyou downstairs.” Gaudreau said, “No,” and was placed under arrest.', '-6-', 'The Post-Arrest Investigation', 'After Gaudreau was arrested, the detectives brought him to the cellblock to process him\nand to seize his clothing, so that they could be tested for accelerants. When Gaudreau’s clothes\nwere removed, the detectives observed large sores on his lower legs and slight injuries on his\nhands.', 'When asked what had happened to his legs, Gaudreau replied that it was a rash.\nGaudreau was brought to the hospital to be treated for his obvious injuries; Det. Feeley was\ninformed by medical personnel that the sores were second-degree burns.', 'Detective Feeley then obtained warrants to search Gaudreau’s home for a second time,\nthe garage, and the gym. In addition, the detective sought assistance from Sgt. Michael Peters of\nthe Massachusetts State Police, a certified accelerant detection canine handler, who was brought\nin the next day. Sergeant Peters worked with a dog trained to search a fire scene and alert to the\npresence of petroleum products, or “flammable liquids that are carbon-based, gasolines,\nkerosenes, diesel fuels.”', 'There were no alerts from Gaudreau’s car, residence, or the clothing that had been\nconfiscated at the time of his arrest. However, the dog did alert to four areas at the scene of the\nfire. Upon excavating, or de-layering, two of the areas, burned paper towels and the melted\nremains of what appeared to be a thirty-gallon Rubbermaid-type barrel were discovered. Also, a\nstrong odor consistent with gasoline, one cap from a gas can, and rubber mats covering the floor\nwere found. The other two areas also were de-layered and washed down, and irregular and “very\nsignificant burn pattern[s]” were discovered, consistent with “flammable liquid being poured out\nof a container and then ignited.”', 'At each of the four alert sites, fire inspector Curran collected samples in certified\nevidence cans to send to the state crime lab. Outside the building, near an entryway, a fanny', '-7-\npack and what appeared to be the remains of a coat were found on the ground. Investigators\nrecovered a scarf and fanny pack wrapped inside a charred “puffy type” winter coat and a set of\nkeys to the premises that was “still in the lock.” The fanny pack contained a loaded handgun and\nGaudreau’s wallet, driver’s license, pistol permit, eyeglasses, a cigarette butt, and about $493.\nThe jacket pockets contained a small can of lock deicer, business cards, and a lighter. Burned\nmatter and charred debris in tissues in a bathroom wastebasket were also seized from Gaudreau’s\nhome, even though the accelerant detection dog never alerted to anything in the house.', 'Curran later testified that it was his opinion that, to a reasonable degree of scientific\ncertainty, there were four separate areas of origin for the fire and the cause was an intentional act\nof fire setting. He opined that:', '“the gasoline had been introduced into the trash cans, and even the', 'gas cans were left behind within these trash cans. And at that', 'point, a piloted flame or a match or a cigarette lighter, more than', 'likely a match, * * * was brought into contact with the contents of', 'the trash cans and the gasoline.”', 'When he was cross-examined at trial, Det. Matook 3 admitted that, although he seized\nseveral items—a gas can, rag, and burned fabric found in the car; the tissues and burnt matter\nfound in the bathroom; a cigarette butt found in the burned jacket—he had not submitted any of\nthose seized items to the state crime lab for analysis for accelerants or for DNA testing. He also\nconceded that the police did not dust for fingerprints at Gaudreau’s house; they had not obtained\nfinancial documents from defendant’s house or contacted Citizens Bank about Gaudreau’s bank\naccount; they never investigated whether he was current on his mortgage, nor had they sought to\nobtain security footage from gas stations that were located near Gaudreau’s home and business.\n3', 'Detective Feeley retired shortly after the gym fire and Det.

The defendant proposes several grounds for his claim that the trial justice erred in\ndenying his motion to suppress or redact those portions of the interrogation that feature the\npolice challenging defendant’s veracity about what he said he was doing the night of the fire.\nFirst, he argues that the evidence is inadmissible credibility testimony.

Finally, defendant\nmaintains that the statements of the detectives should have been excluded under Rule 403\nbecause they were highly prejudicial due to the fact that the jury heard the same detective, who\nwas on the stand while the video was played, repeatedly yell at defendant, call him a liar, and\ndeclare that his story was made up.\n7', 'See Lanham v. Commonwealth, 171 S.W.3d 14, 28 n.57 (Ky. 2005) (Rule 105 of the Kentucky\nRules of Evidence says, “When evidence which is admissible as to one (1) party or for one (1)\npurpose but not admissible as to another party or for another purpose is admitted, the court, upon\nrequest, shall restrict the evidence to its proper scope and admonish the jury accordingly. In the\nabsence of such a request, the admission of the evidence by the trial judge without limitation\nshall not be a ground for complaint on appeal, except under the palpable error rule.”).\nKentucky’s Rule 105 is different from Rhode Island’s Rule 105 in that the Rhode Island Rule\ndoes not contain the second sentence on review under the palpable error rule.

Viewing the prejudice\nagainst the tapestry of the factual evidence and bearing in mind the conduct, tone, and length of\nthis particular interrogation, we cannot conclude that the passions of the jury would have been\n“so inflame[d] * * * as to prevent their calm and dispassionate examination of the evidence.”\nGomes, 764 A.2d at 136 (quoting Fernandes, 526 A.2d at 498).', 'Although we conclude that the videotaped interrogation admitted against this defendant\nwas not so prejudicial as to require a new trial, we believe such evidence should be judiciously\nconsidered for its probative value when, as here, the defendant makes no inculpatory statements.\nWe echo the observation of the Supreme Court of Kentucky that there is a real concern that these\ntypes of interrogations have the potential to lead to substantial prejudice, see Lanham, 171\nS.W.3d at 28, and trial justices should be alert to the danger of potential abuse, such as the\nintroduction of manufactured evidence that would not be admitted at trial. See Kitchen, 730\nA.2d at 521 n.5 (“if the Commonwealth had no witnesses to produce in the instant case, then any\ncomments to Appellee, on the videotapes, relating to witnesses would have to be redacted; the\ndeception would be permissible, but it could not be displayed before the jury since the police\ncomments would be irrelevant and prejudicial”).

The defendant’s new (and last) trial was held in 1988, and he was found guilty again\nof second-degree murder. He was sentenced to sixty years’ imprisonment, with fifty years to\nserve and ten years suspended, with probation. The defendant also received an additional\nsentence of twenty years to serve as a habitual offender, which, importantly and as expected, was\nordered to be served consecutively to the sentence for second-degree murder. The habitual\noffender sentence was to be nonparolable for the first eighteen years of the sentence. This Court\naffirmed defendant’s conviction in 1992. State v.

At that point, defendant had been incarcerated for more than thirty-two\nyears. However, the minutes from that parole board hearing reflect uncertainty concerning\nwhether defendant was eligible for release or whether he was to be paroled to begin serving the\nnonparolable eighteen-year habitual offender sentence. The parole board concluded that, if\ndefendant’s eligibility had not been calculated in the aggregate, then defendant would be paroled\nto his consecutive sentence as a habitual offender in August 2015. However, the parole board\nalso decided that, if it was determined that his eligibility had been calculated in the aggregate and\nhe therefore no longer had consecutive time to serve, then he would be paroled in January 2016\nto a residential substance-abuse treatment program.', 'In October 2015, the parole board chairperson, by letter to defendant, informed him that\nthe parole decision would be applied to the sentence for the murder conviction and that he was\nparoled to the consecutive nonparolable sentence as a habitual offender, a sentence over which\nthe parole board did not have jurisdiction. Therefore, after serving thirty-two years of a fifty-\nyear sentence for second-degree murder, defendant was paroled to the habitual offender\nsentence, and will serve a total of at least fifty years in prison.', 'In 2016, defendant filed a motion to correct an illegal sentence under Rule 35 of the\nSuperior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, as well as an application for postconviction relief.\nOn July 25, 2018, a hearing was held in the Superior Court on the Rule 35 motion and the', '-4-\napplication for postconviction relief. Both the application and the Rule 35 motion were denied.6', 'In the Superior Court, Mattatall conceded that the sentence imposed in 1988 was not an\nillegal sentence under Rule 35(a), but that the error arose from the manner in which the sentence\nwas executed. The defendant contended that the oral pronouncement of the sentence reflected\nthat the habitual offender sentence was ordered to be served consecutively to the sentence for the\nmurder conviction. Thus, under the law in effect at the time, G.L. 1956 § 13-8-13, he was\neligible to appear before the parole board in 1993, after ten years’ imprisonment. But it was not\nuntil 2001 that he was first deemed eligible to appear before the parole board—after the precise\nlength of the nonparolable sentence, which was eighteen years.', 'Unquestionably, in 1988, the trial justice sentenced defendant to sixty years at the ACI\nfor second-degree murder, with fifty years to serve.', 'He also sentenced defendant to a\nconsecutive term of twenty years’ imprisonment and ordered that eighteen years of that sentence\nwas nonparolable. There is no dispute that the trial justice orally ordered that the habitual\noffender sentence be served consecutively to the sentence for the murder conviction. However,\nthe written judgment for the murder conviction directs that the sentence is “to run consecutive to\nhabitual offender sentence[,]” and the judgment for the habitual offender sentence mandates that\nsentence “[t]o run consecutive with count 1.”', 'Although defendant conceded before the trial justice that the sentence was not an illegal\nsentence under Rule 35, he argued that its execution was illegal and constituted a violation of his\ndue-process rights because it deprived him of his right to appear before the parole board for\neighteen years, which was eight years longer than § 13-8-13 provided.7 The defendant correctly\n6', 'The trial justice’s denial of defendant’s application for postconviction relief is not before the\nCourt in this present appeal.\n7', 'Although defendant acknowledged before the trial justice that he was denied parole in 2002', '-5-\nargues that the judgment of conviction contains an error because it specifically recites that the\nsentence for murder shall “run consecutive to the habitual offender sentence.”', 'The state argued that the trial justice did not have the authority to adjust defendant’s\nparole eligibility because, even if the Department of Corrections improperly calculated his parole\neligibility, this error did not render the sentence illegal for Rule 35 purposes.8 The state also\nargued that there was no prejudice from defendant seeing the parole board after eighteen years\nrather than ten years, because the reasons for the board ultimately denying parole were not\nrelated to defendant’s conduct at the ACI.', 'Despite the quandary created by the error in the judgment and the erroneous calculation\nof defendant’s parole-eligibility date, the trial justice was careful not to “play Super Parole\nBoard” in making his decision. He found that the sentence being served by defendant―as a\nhabitual offender―was a nonparolable term that could not be altered unless the trial justice first\nfound that it was an illegal sentence. Because, as the parties agreed, defendant’s sentence was\nnot an illegal sentence under Rule 35, the trial justice concluded that it was not subject to\ncorrection. However, the trial justice was “nonetheless troubled by the circumstances” presented\nby defendant’s situation. The trial justice denied defendant’s application for postconviction\nrelief and his Rule 35 motion, ruling in favor of the state. Before this Court in this appeal,\ndefendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his Rule 35 motion.\npartly because of his institutional record, he contends that he was prejudiced because, had he\nappeared before the parole board eight years earlier, he would have received the rehabilitative\ndirection from the parole board that triggered his eventual turnaround in behavior which led to\nhis eventual parole. According to defendant, it was his initial appearance before the parole board\nin 2002 that gave rise to the realization that he could one day be released on parole.\n8', 'The state also argued harmless error and asserted that the reasons for the denial of his parole\nafter the initial 2002 appearance indicated that, had defendant seen the parole board eight years\nearlier, he might not have been released.', '-6-', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court follows a “strong policy against interfering with a trial justice’s discretion in\nsentencing matters.” State v. Barkmeyer, 32 A.3d 950, 952 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Chase, 9\nA.3d 1248, 1254 (R.I. 2010)). Therefore, this Court’s “review of a trial justice’s decision on a\nRule 35 motion is extremely limited.” Id.

Goncalves, 941 A.2d 842, 847 (R.I. 2008)).', 'Analysis', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion to correct an\nillegal sentence. Because the judgment of conviction does not conform to the oral sentence,\ndefendant contends, the sentence is illegal. With no citation to authority, defendant also contends\nthat the judgment of conviction imposed an unauthorized form of punishment. We deem this\nincorrect. The defendant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment upon conviction for second-\ndegree murder. Prison is where convicted murderers are sent; an unauthorized form of\npunishment for an offense such as this in this state would be the death penalty or a public\nflogging, for instance.', 'On the other hand, the state argues that the trial justice did not err in denying defendant’s\nRule 35 motion for several reasons, including that the motion was “procedurally infirm” because\ndefendant was not seeking to correct an illegal sentence within the meaning of Rule 35(a).\nInstead, as defendant conceded before the trial justice, he was challenging the execution of his\nsentence, not its legality. Additionally, the state argues that any correction to the judgment\nwould not alter Mattatall’s current parole-eligibility date. According to the state, notwithstanding', '-7-\nthe erroneous calculation of the date when Mattatall became eligible to apply for parole, he was\neventually afforded the opportunity to appear. According to the state, Mattatall has failed to\nestablish any prejudice from this delay. We decline to engage in this speculation, and we confine\nour analysis to the record.', 'We observe that, once defendant began the parole process, the reasons for which the\nparole board denied parole are in line with the board’s standards for evaluating parole\napplications in accordance with § 13-8-14.1, and accurately mirror the statutory release criteria\nset forth in § 13-8-14, the first of which is a prisoner’s institutional disciplinary record. The\nother factors include the seriousness of the offender’s crime and whether release would\n“depreciate the seriousness of the prisoner’s offense or promote disrespect for the law[.]”\nSection 13-8-14(a)(2). The reasons for denying Mattatall’s parole application clearly relate to\nthe murder conviction, for which release on parole was granted in 2016. At that point, Mattatall\nhad been incarcerated for thirty-two years and faced another eighteen years without parole. The\nminutes of his last appearance before the board on July 13, 2015, indicate that the board was\n“uncertain if Mr. Mattatall’s parole eligibility on his two sentences has been calculated in the\naggregate.” However, the board decided that, if Mattatall “no longer has consecutive time to\nserve, then the [b]oard votes to parole Mr. Mattatall in January 2016 to [a] residential substance\nabuse treatment program[.]” Thus, as of July 2015, the parole board was of the opinion that his\nrelease on parole was appropriate. However, Mattatall faced either another six months in prison\nor an additional eighteen years.', 'This Court’s jurisprudence recognizes a difference between illegal sentences under\nRule 35 and clerical mistakes in judgments under Rule 36. Relief under either rule is not\navailable to this defendant. First, as he conceded in Superior Court, the trial justice did not', '-8-\nimpose an illegal sentence. As the Reporter’s Notes to Rule 35(a) provide, “an ‘illegal sentence’\nis one which has been imposed after a valid conviction but is not authorized under law.” This\nwould include a sentence in excess of that provided by law or an unauthorized form of\npunishment, such as the death penalty. Unfortunately, the clerical mistake in the judgment of\nconviction was not discovered until defendant had served thirty-two years, and may have\nresulted in adverse consequences.', 'The trial justice was not without sympathy. He agreed that “somebody dropped the ball”\nand that Mattatall “was not seen by the [p]arole [b]oard when he lawfully was entitled to see the\n[p]arole [b]oard.” The state did not disagree that Mattatall’s parole eligibility was improperly\ncalculated. However, the trial justice also recognized that defendant currently was serving a\nnonparolable term of imprisonment over which the parole board had no authority. He also\ncorrectly acknowledged that, in the context of this case, the law does not permit the court to alter\nthe sentence without a finding that it was illegal. The trial justice pointed that out, and added:\n“But I am nonetheless troubled by the circumstances.”', 'Neither the trial justice nor this Court can turn back time, nor can we speculate, one way\nor the other, on what the parole board would have done had Mattatall timely appeared before the\nboard after he had served ten years of the sentence for second-degree murder. This unfortunate\ncircumstance cannot be corrected. We deem it appropriate, however, to exercise our supervisory\njurisdiction and afford defendant an opportunity to seek relief from the trial justice who has\npatiently presided over this case for three decades. We fully recognize that “the exercise of\nour supervisory jurisdiction is an extraordinary measure.” State v. Barros, 24 A.3d 1158, 1166\n(R.I. 2011) (brackets omitted) (quoting State v. Feng, 421 A.2d 1258, 1273 (R.I. 1980)).\nHowever, “this Court under its general supervisory powers can exercise its inherent power to', '-9-\nfashion an appropriate remedy to serve the ends of justice.” Bates-Bridgmon v.

For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On June 19, 2013, at approximately 9:08 p.m., Providence Patrolman Michael Clary\n(Officer Clary) stopped a vehicle driven by Michael Clemente (Clemente) for failing to obey a\nyield sign while coming onto the Point Street Bridge and for crossing the center line of the road. 1\nThe defendant was a passenger in the vehicle, which belonged to Clemente’s girlfriend. Officer\n1', 'Officer Clary also testified that the vehicle was traveling “at a high rate of speed” and “well\nover” the twenty-five-mile-per-hour speed limit.', '-1-\nClary testified that as he approached the vehicle, he noticed defendant was “moving around a\nlot” and, more specifically, that defendant “made a movement towards the rear driver’s side\ntowards the leg compartment” of the vehicle. Concerned for his safety, Officer Clary called for\nbackup, to which Officer Robert Kells (Officer Kells) responded.', 'Upon Officer Kells’s arrival, the two patrolmen approached the vehicle – Officer Clary\napproached Clemente on the driver’s side and Officer Kells approached defendant on the\npassenger’s side. Officer Clary testified that Clemente appeared nervous, was sweating, and\navoided eye contact, while Officer Kells testified that defendant also appeared to be nervous and\nsweating, and his “non-verbal body language” indicated that he was “hiding something.” When\nOfficer Kells asked where they were coming from, defendant said that they were coming from\nhis cousin’s house on Public Street; but, as Officer Kells noted, the vehicle was traveling in the\n“totally opposite direction” of Public Street.', 'Both men were ordered out of the vehicle and were subjected to a Terry 2 pat-down. 3 No\nweapons were found on either Clemente or defendant. The two were then placed in the back\nseats of separate patrol cars. Although they were not handcuffed, Officer Clary did testify that\nthe back doors of the patrol cars were locked such that they could not be opened from the inside,\nso defendant and Clemente were, in effect, unable to get out of the cars. Officer Clary testified\nthat neither Clemente nor defendant was under arrest at this time. A search of the rear driver’s\nside area of the vehicle – the area that Officer Clary observed defendant reaching into – revealed\nan Apple MacBook laptop and a Sony PlayStation 3 video game console. Officer Kells also\nobserved a maroon pillowcase located underneath the front passenger seat where defendant was\nsitting.\n2', 'Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968).\n3', 'By this time, three more officers had arrived on scene to provide additional backup.', '-2-', 'When asked, Clemente said that the laptop belonged to his cousin, Bernardino, and, at\nOfficer Clary’s request, he turned it on. Saved on the desktop of the computer was a résumé\nwith the last name “Calcagni.” Officer Kells called the phone number listed on the résumé and\nspoke to a man who identified himself as Anthony Calcagni, a recent graduate of Brown\nUniversity. Calcagni verified that he owned the type of laptop and video game console that were\nfound in the vehicle. The officers agreed to meet Calcagni, who had left home sometime around\n8:20 that evening, at his apartment on Power Street.', 'Upon arriving home, Calcagni and the officers noticed that the air-conditioning unit in\nthe bay window of his apartment was pushed inward from the window and onto the floor,\npresumably from someone breaking in. Officer Clary showed Calcagni the items found in the\nvehicle, which Calcagni identified as his. Notably, the laptop was inscribed with the last six\ndigits of Calcagni’s Brown University student identification number, and he was indeed missing\na maroon pillowcase from his bedroom. Clemente and defendant were ultimately transported to\nthe Providence police station.', 'Detective Charles Boranian (Det. Boranian), who had also responded to the scene earlier,\ntestified that he read defendant his Miranda rights at the police station. Detective Boranian\nfurther testified that, while defendant was cooperative at first, he became increasingly less\nobliging, especially when Det. Boranian asked for his girlfriend’s contact information to verify\nhis assertion that he was with her earlier in the evening before “a friend” called him to “go for a\nride.” A criminal complaint was filed against defendant charging him with burglary.', 'A combined bail and violation hearing was held in Providence County Superior Court on\nSeptember 6, 9, and 10, 2013. The hearing justice found that the stop was legal and that\ndefendant lacked standing to challenge the search of the vehicle because he was merely a', '-3-\npassenger in it, neither he nor Clemente owned the vehicle, and he had never driven it or kept\nany personal property in it. Furthermore, the hearing justice found that, even if defendant did\nhave standing to challenge the search, it was “certainly * * * justified” based on defendant’s “so-\ncalled furtive movements” and his reaching toward the area behind the driver’s seat and under\nthe passenger compartment. This, the hearing justice stated, was “enough to raise a reasonable\nand articulable suspicion in [Officer] Clary’s mind that there may be [weapons] or contraband or\nevidence of a crime being hidden under the driver’s seat and/or under the passenger seat by * * *\ndefendant.” This reasonable and articulable suspicion was then “further * * * solidified” by the\nnervous demeanor and evasiveness exhibited by both Clemente and defendant.', 'The hearing justice went on to hold that, based on the evidence presented, the items\nseized from the vehicle were “obvious[ly]” stolen from Calcagni’s apartment and that defendant\nwas at the very least in constructive possession of those items. The hearing justice inferred that,\nbased on defendant’s furtive movements in the vehicle – specifically those in which he reached\ntoward the rear driver’s-side leg compartment and underneath his seat – defendant was\n“attempting to hide * * * the computer and the PlayStation under the driver’s seat and the\npillowcase under the front passenger seat.”', 'In light of this evidence, the hearing justice was\n“reasonably satisfied that * * * defendant failed to * * * be of good behavior” and concluded that\ndefendant violated the terms of his probation. The hearing justice removed the suspension from\ndefendant’s sentence and ordered him to serve five years in prison. Bail was also set on the\nburglary complaint. 4', 'On September 12, 2013, defendant filed a timely appeal to this Court.\n4', 'To date, no indictment or information charging defendant with burglary or any other crime has\nbeen filed.', '-4-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“The sole issue for a hearing justice to consider at a probation violation hearing is\nwhether or not the defendant has breached a condition of his or her probation by failing to keep\nthe peace or remain on good behavior.” State v.

(quoting Quinlan, 921 A.2d at 109).', '“The determination of whether there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, and thus\nstanding, is a two-tiered analysis: (1) the defendant must have a ‘subjective expectation of\nprivacy,’ and (2) the expectation must also be ‘one that society accepts as objectively\nreasonable.’” Quinlan, 921 A.2d at 109 (quoting State v. Bertram, 591 A.2d 14, 19 (R.I. 1991)).\nWe look at several factors, such as “whether the suspect possessed or owned the area searched or\nthe property seized; his or her prior use of the area searched or the property seized; the person’s\nability to control or exclude others’ use of the property; and the person’s legitimate presence in\nthe area searched.” State v.

While he was a legitimate guest in\nthe vehicle, he had no ownership or possessory interest in it, nor does he assert any prior use of\nthe vehicle, nor could he control or exclude others from its use. The same reasoning applies to\nthe items seized from the vehicle – defendant asserts no ownership or lawful possessory interest\nin any of the property seized, nor does he assert any prior use of the property, nor could he\nrightfully control or exclude others’ use of any of the property. 6 In Quinlan, 921 A.2d at 110,\nwe recognized that the defendant “certainly had no expectation of privacy that society would\nrecognize as objectively reasonable” in a vehicle that he was merely a passenger in, had never\ndriven, or kept any personal property in. Neither does defendant here. As such, he lacks\nstanding to contest the legality of the search of the vehicle.', 'While we may be able to resolve this matter based on defendant’s lack of standing alone,\nwe nevertheless address his remaining arguments on appeal. The defendant challenges the\n“prolonged and unjustified seizure of his person” and argues that the fruits of such an unjustified\nseizure should be suppressed. He argues that the seizure continued long after the purpose of the\ntraffic stop had come to a close, which, according to defendant, is when the investigation should\nhave ended. Although defendant was not under arrest, he was clearly seized when he was\nremoved from the vehicle, told not to leave, and was put in the back seat of Officer Kells’s police\ncar. While he was not handcuffed, the police car did not have door handles on the inside, so, in\neffect, defendant was not free to leave the vehicle. See State v. Foster, 842 A.2d 1047, 1050\n(R.I. 2004) (“A police officer has ‘seized’ a person, within the meaning of the Fourth\n6', 'The defendant himself undermines his own standing by asserting that “none of the items\n[seized] were in the immediate physical possession of [defendant]: it was not his vehicle, he was\nnot driving, it was unknown how long he had been riding in the car, the objects were not on his\nperson, and there was nothing about the objects that connected them to him.”', ""-7-\nAmendment, when he restrains that person's freedom to walk away.”) (citing State v. Bennett,\n430 A.2d 424, 427 (R.I. 1981))."", 'Indeed, by the time defendant was removed from the vehicle, the investigation into the\ntraffic violations had come to a close. However, the seizure of defendant and Clemente beyond\nthis point was nonetheless warranted “based on a reasonable suspicion that resulted from the\nevents that [Officers Clary and Kells] observed [during and] after a routine traffic stop.” Foster,\n842 A.2d at 1052. “[T]he Supreme Court held that in evaluating the constitutionality of a stop,\nthe totality of the circumstances must be taken into account.” Id. at 1050-51 (citing United\nStates v. Cortez, 449 U.S. 411, 417 (1981)). “Additionally, this Court has enumerated factors\nthat contribute to a finding of reasonable suspicion, including ‘the location in which the conduct\noccurred, the time at which the incident occurred, the suspicious conduct or unusual appearance\nof the suspect, and the personal knowledge and experience of the police officer.’” Id. at 1051\n(quoting State v. Keohane, 814 A.2d 327, 330 (R.I. 2003)).', 'Here, in view of the totality of the circumstances surrounding defendant’s detention, as\nwell as the factors we have explicitly enumerated, Officers Clary and Kells, who were both\nveteran police officers, had “an articulable basis for suspecting criminal activity and * * * the\nisolation and detention of * * * defendant [was] reasonable under the circumstances” while they\ncontinued their investigation.', 'See Foster, 842 A.2d at 1052.', 'Furthermore, we note that\ndefendant and Clemente were only detained for approximately one hour, and there is no\nindication that they were mistreated by the police or subjected to improper questioning. See id.\nat 1051.', '-8-', 'B', 'The Exclusionary Rule Does Not Apply to Probation Violation Hearings', 'Even assuming the police illegally obtained the evidence, the exclusionary rule offers\ndefendant no relief. The exclusionary rule, when applicable, bars the introduction of evidence\nobtained from illegal searches and seizures. See, e.g., State v. Jennings, 461 A.2d 361, 368 (R.I.\n1983). However, “the law is well settled that the exclusionary rule does not apply to probation-\nviolation hearings.” State v. Campbell, 833 A.2d 1228, 1232 (R.I. 2003) (citing State v. Spratt,\n120 R.I. 192, 194, 386 A.2d 1094, 1095-96 (1978)).', 'Because a violation hearing is civil in nature, “the defendant is not entitled to ‘the full\npanoply of rights’ inherent in a criminal trial.” Campbell, 833 A.2d at 1233 (quoting State v.\nMendez, 788 A.2d 1145, 1147-48 (R.I. 2002)).', 'This “panoply of rights” includes the\nexclusionary rule. Indeed, “[i]n Spratt, we held that ‘the potential benefit to society from\nrefusing to extend the exclusionary rule to revocation hearings outweighs any harm resulting\nfrom that refusal.’” State v. Texter, 896 A.2d 40, 43 (R.I. 2006) (quoting Spratt, 120 R.I. at 195,\n386 A.2d at 1095-96).', 'The defendant argues that the exclusionary rule should have been applied to his probation\nrevocation hearing because his prolonged seizure is sufficient to “shock the conscience of the\nCourt.” The defendant cites this language from our decision in Spratt, where we left for a later\nday the question of whether the exclusionary rule would apply at a probation revocation hearing\nto evidence derived from “searches which are consciously directed toward or intended to harass\nprobationers * * * or which shock the conscience of the court * * *.” Spratt, 120 R.I. at 195 n.2,\n386 A.2d at 1095 n.2 (citing United States v. Winsett, 518 F.2d 51, 54 (9th Cir. 1975); People v.\nAtencio, 525 P.2d 461, 463 (Colo. 1974)). Because there is nothing in the record to suggest that', '-9-\nthe officers’ conduct shocks the conscience, we see no need to address the question left\nunanswered in Spratt at this time. Here, Officers Clary and Kells had every reason and duty to\ninvestigate the situation beyond the traffic violations and continue to detain defendant (and\nClemente) during that time. We are satisfied that their conduct in doing so was proper.', 'C', 'Constructive Possession', 'Lastly, defendant argues that there was insufficient evidence presented to the hearing\njustice to satisfy even the lowered “reasonable satisfaction” standard with respect to the finding\nthat he was in possession of the stolen property found in the vehicle. The hearing justice found\nthat defendant was at least in constructive possession of the laptop, PlayStation, and maroon\npillowcase. “To find that a defendant constructively possessed illegal contraband, two elements\nmust be satisfied.” Santiago, 799 A.2d at 287 (citing In re Vannarith, 731 A.2d 685, 689 (R.I.\n1999)). “First, the defendant must have had knowledge of the presence of the contraband and,\nsecond, the defendant must have intended to exercise control over the item[s].” Id. “Both of\nthese factors ‘can be inferred from a totality of the circumstances.’” Id. (quoting In re Vannarith,\n731 A.2d at 689).', 'Specifically, and most relevant to the instant case, we have said that\n“knowledge of the existence and location of the contraband can be inferred from [the]\ndefendant’s conduct in reaching toward the area where the contraband was located.” Id. at 288.', 'At the probation revocation hearing, the hearing justice “weigh[ed] the evidence and\nassess[ed] the credibility of the witnesses,” including Officers Clary and Kells. Based on that\ntestimony and the totality of the circumstances – including the defendant’s furtive movements\nand noticeably nervous demeanor – the hearing justice could have easily inferred that the\ndefendant had “knowledge of the presence of the contraband” and “intended to exercise control”', '-10-\nover the contraband by moving it, presumably out of the view of the approaching officers.\nAccordingly, there was more than enough evidence to meet the lowered “reasonably satisfied\nstandard” with respect to the hearing justice’s finding that the defendant, at the very least,\nconstructively possessed the stolen property found in the vehicle. Thus, it cannot be said that the\nhearing justice acted arbitrarily or capriciously in finding that the defendant violated his\nprobation.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.\nThe record in this case may be returned to that tribunal.', '-11-', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet\nTITLE OF CASE:', 'State v.

He testified that the SUV drove past the other police cruisers and came to a stop in\nfront of them; he added that the guardrail on the right side of the bridge was approximately three\nor four feet from the passenger’s side of the vehicle.

At trial, he identified defendant as the right rear passenger of\nthe SUV. Trooper Pereira stated that, after all four occupants of the SUV were in custody,\nanother trooper directed his attention to the area below the bridge to the right side of where the\nSUV was stopped.

At trial, Trooper Hernandez identified defendant as the right rear passenger.', 'Trooper Hernandez testified that he then spoke to Trooper Pereira, who informed him\nthat he had “observed the occupant throw something out of the vehicle and it went over the side', '-4-\nof the bridge.” Trooper Hernandez stated that he went “down around to the intersection of\nTockwotton Street and South Water Street” in order to investigate the area that was below the\nbridge and perpendicular to the passenger’s side of the SUV. In response to being asked why he\nfocused on that area, he stated:', '“Because it was below the vehicle. Lined up. It made sense. If', 'something was thrown from a vehicle, it would -- it could --', 'likelihood that it would land there.”\nTrooper Hernandez testified that, after climbing up to the second tier of the bridge abutment, he\nfound a handgun lying on its side approximately fifteen to twenty-five feet below and ten to\nfifteen feet perpendicular to the part of the bridge where the SUV was positioned; he added that,\nfrom where he was standing when he discovered the handgun, he could see the SUV. He\ntestified that there were four or five live ammunition rounds around the handgun and that there\nwas one “spent cartridge that was half in the cylinder of the revolver.” He testified that, although\nthe abutment was dirty and sandy, the handgun was not. Trooper Hernandez identified the\nhandgun shown to him at trial as being the same one that he had observed on the abutment.', 'C', 'The Testimony of Corporal John Grassel', 'Rhode Island State Police Corporal John Grassel also testified at trial, after first having\nbeen qualified by the trial justice as an “expert in crime scene evidence collection.” He testified\nthat, on the morning of September 13, 2010, he was called to assist other troopers at a crime\nscene located at “South Water and Tockwotton Street * * * in the area of the Iway Bridge.” He\nstated that at that crime scene he recovered from the bridge abutment a .38 caliber revolver, one\ncartridge casing which was partially inside one of the chambers of the gun, and five cartridges in\nthe immediate vicinity of the weapon; he identified the handgun entered into evidence at trial as', '-5-\nbeing the same handgun that he observed on September 13, 2010. When he was shown at trial a\nphotograph of the handgun lying on the abutment, Corporal Grassel pointed out that the\nphotograph showed a glass bottle near the handgun, and he testified that he had observed that\nglass bottle when he recovered the handgun near the abutment. Corporal Grassel stated that,\nwhile there was debris including sand, gravel, and cigarette butts on the abutment where he\nrecovered the gun, “the firearm was relatively clean, as far as soot or soil,” whereas the bottle\n“had a layer of soot or sand on it.”', 'According to Corporal Grassel’s testimony, the firearm was tested for fingerprints\napproximately six months after it was seized. He further testified that there were no latent\nfingerprints on “the cartridges, the cartridge, the cartridge casing, or the weapon;” however, he\nadded that the chance of finding fingerprints “would definitely be less after six months.”\nCorporal Grassel stated that the bottle was neither seized nor processed for fingerprints. He also\nstated that it was determined that the firearm had been lawfully purchased in Maine; it was his\ntestimony, however, that he never inquired of the registered owner (who was not defendant) as to\nhow the firearm came to be located on the bridge abutment.', 'D', 'Stipulations and the Defendant’s Motion for a Judgment of Acquittal', 'Following Corporal Grassel’s testimony, it was then stipulated: (1) that, on September\n13, 2010, defendant did not have a duly issued license to carry or possess a firearm; and (2) that\nthe firearm at issue was operable on that date. At the close of the prosecution’s case, defense\ncounsel moved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Rule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of\nCriminal Procedure. The trial justice found that the evidence, when viewed in the light most\nfavorable to the state, was sufficient to warrant a jury verdict of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt', '-6-\non Count One and, therefore, automatically, on Count Two. In denying defendant’s motion, the\ntrial justice stated:', '“The evidence, if viewed in that regard, together with all', 'reasonable inferences, the testimony is that the officer viewed the', 'individual, later to be identified by him as your client, in the right', 'rear passenger seat of the vehicle throwing a metal object, as he', 'described it, out of the window of the vehicle over the wall of the', 'bridge. Later, the area was inspected below that parapet. The only', 'thing that was found was a firearm and an old bottle, the inference', 'fairly being that this was the object that was thrown from the', 'vehicle and thrown by your client.”\nAfter the trial justice’s denial of defendant’s Rule 29 motion, the defense proceeded to present its\ncase.', 'E', 'The Testimony of Lina Leav', 'The driver of the SUV, Lina Leav, testified for the defense. She testified that she was\ndriving her 2002 Toyota Rav4 SUV westbound on Interstate 195 on the night of September 12\nand the early morning hours of September 13, 2010. Ms. Leav testified that Rafael Ferrer, a\nfriend of her boyfriend, was a passenger in the SUV and that he was seated in the rear seat on the\ndriver’s side (the left side); she added that a man named Pablo, whom she had met that night and\nwhose last name she did not know, was sitting in the rear seat on the passenger’s side (the right\nside). She further testified that, as she was entering Providence near the Iway Bridge, she was\npulled over by a State Police cruiser. It was her testimony that she drove past the police cruisers\nthat were already positioned in the breakdown lane and parked on the bridge; she added that the\npolice cruiser which signaled her to pull over then stopped approximately one car length behind\nher SUV—at an angle so that the cruiser was “closest to the driver’s rear quarter” of her SUV.\nShe stated that the trooper told her and the other occupants to put their hands on the ceiling and', '-7-\nthen asked them to “roll” down the windows. She also testified that the trooper told the\npassengers to exit the SUV one by one, opening the car doors by extending their arms through\nthe open windows. According to her testimony, Pablo, who occupied the rear passenger’s seat,\nwas the first person to exit the SUV, followed by defendant, Rafael Ferrer.', 'Ms. Leav testified that no one threw anything out of the SUV when it was being pulled\nover because the windows were rolled up. She further testified that she did not see anything\nthrown out of the windows when the trooper requested that the windows be rolled down. It was\nher testimony, however, that her attention was focused “only” on the state trooper, and her\ntestimony indicated that she observed him by using her “driver door mirror.” She answered in\nthe affirmative when asked on cross-examination if she was not paying attention to the backseat\npassengers.', 'F', 'The Defendant’s Renewed Motion for a Judgment of Acquittal, the Jury Instructions, and', 'Defense Counsel’s Closing Argument', 'At the close of defendant’s case, defense counsel renewed his motion for a judgment of\nacquittal; the trial justice again denied the motion “for the reasons given previously by the\ncourt.”', 'The trial justice proceeded to instruct the jury. Among the instructions given to the jury,\nthe trial justice stated that the jury should not consider punishment in its deliberations because\npunishment “should never be considered by the jury in any way in arriving at an impartial\nverdict.”', 'Defense counsel thereafter made his closing argument to the jury, during which the\nfollowing exchange occurred between defense counsel, the prosecutor, and the trial justice:', '-8-', '“[Defense Counsel]: There should be some corroboration of the', 'facts of this case.

Caprio, 983 A.2d 841, 844 (R.I. 2009). In\nreviewing “a trial justice’s denial of a motion for a judgment of acquittal, we employ the same\nstandards as the trial court.” State v.

This Court, like the trial justice, “is\nrequired to evaluate only that evidence that the prosecution claims is capable of supporting proof\nof guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” Lopez, 78 A.3d at 781 (internal quotation marks omitted);\nsee also Cardin, 987 A.2d at 250. Drawing all inferences in favor of the state, we are convinced\nthat the testimony of Troopers Pereira and Hernandez as well as that of Corporal Grassel was\nsufficient to support the conviction.', 'It was adduced at trial that Trooper Pereira saw an individual, later identified by him as\ndefendant, who was seated in the right rear passenger’s seat of the SUV, throw a “grayish\nmetallic” object out of the window of the SUV; according to Trooper Pereira’s testimony, the\nobject went over the guardrail of the bridge. Trooper Hernandez corroborated Trooper Pereira’s\ntestimony that defendant was the right rear passenger in the SUV; and he stated that, when he\ninspected an abutment below the bridge and perpendicular to the passenger’s side of the SUV, he\nobserved a firearm. Although defendant notes that Ms. Leav’s testimony with respect to the\npositions of the passengers in the car was contradictory to the testimony of Troopers Pereira and\nHernandez, this Court has stated that we “[do] not pass upon the credibility of witnesses in\ndetermining whether a judgment of acquittal was warranted.” State v.

Accordingly, it is our opinion that the state produced sufficient evidence\nfrom which a jury could infer beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant possessed the handgun.3', 'After a careful review of the evidence presented in the instant case and considering that\nevidence in the light most favorable to the state, giving full credibility to its witnesses and\ndrawing all reasonable inferences consistent with defendant’s guilt, it is clear to us, as it was to\nthe trial justice, that there was more than sufficient evidence submitted at trial to support a\nverdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. See Lopez, 78 A.3d at 781; State v. Rolon, 45 A.3d\n518, 524-25 (R.I. 2012); State v. Cipriano, 21 A.3d 408, 421-22 (R.I. 2011).

It is well settled, however, “that the conduct\nof a trial in the Superior Court is within the sound discretion of the trial justice.” Barnes v.\nQuality Beef Co., 425 A.2d 531, 534 (R.I. 1981). And, “[i]t is a long-standing rule of law that\nthe trial justice sitting in a jury trial may, in the exercise of his [or her] sound discretion, limit the\nscope and extent of counsel’s closing argument.” Id. at 535; see also State v. Frost, 161 P.3d\n361, 365 (Wash. 2007) (en banc) (“It is well established that trial courts possess broad\ndiscretionary powers over the scope of counsel’s closing arguments.”). In State v. Ellis, 619\nA.2d 418 (R.I. 1993), we expressly alluded to the broad discretion accorded to the trial justice\nwith respect to ensuring that closing argument “does not stray unduly from the mark, or\notherwise impede the fair and orderly conduct of the trial.” Id. at 422 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). The following passage from Ellis is directly relevant to the instant case:', '“This is not to say that closing arguments in a criminal case', 'must be uncontrolled or even unrestrained. The presiding judge', 'must be and is given great latitude in controlling the duration and', 'limiting the scope of closing summations. * * * He may ensure that', 'argument does not stray unduly from the mark, or otherwise', 'impede the fair and orderly conduct of the trial. In all these', 'respects he must have broad discretion.” Id. (quoting Herring, 422', 'U.S. at 862).', 'It is defendant’s first contention that defense counsel, during the first objected-to portion\nof the closing argument, was seeking to draw attention to the dearth of corroborative evidence\ntying defendant to the handgun found below the bridge.4', 'The defendant argues that the\n4', 'It will be recalled that the prosecutor interposed an objection after defense counsel had\nuttered the following two sentences: “There should be some corroboration of the facts of this', '- 14 -\n“rhetorical question regarding the wrongly convicted was in reference to the lack of evidence\nagainst [him] and was not an improper comment on sentencing,” and he then contends that the\ntrial justice erred “by sustaining the state’s objection to this permissible comment on the dearth\nof direct evidence against [defendant].”', 'A review of the record, however, reveals that the trial justice did not sustain the state’s\nobjection to defense counsel’s statement, nor did he strike that statement from the record. The\ntrial justice instead admonished defendant that issues relating to punishment should not\n“continue to be part of [his] comments,” and the trial justice referred to his explicit prior\ninstruction to the jury that punishment “should never be considered by the jury in any way in\narriving at an impartial verdict.” It is worth noting that the entire colloquy took place in the\npresence of the jury; and, therefore, the jury heard defense counsel’s clear argument regarding\nwhat he contended was a lack of corroborating evidence in the case at bar. In our judgment, the\ncautionary language of the trial justice with respect to defense counsel’s mention of “people who\nare serving 20 years in jail” cannot be construed as a limitation on defendant’s closing argument;\nit was simply a reminder to counsel that punishment was not a permissible topic. Accordingly,\nwe see no merit in the first of defendant’s contentions as to the violation of his right to the\nassistance of counsel.', 'The defendant’s second contention in relation to the closing argument is that the trial\njustice improperly curtailed defense counsel’s opportunity to present the case to the jury by\nsustaining the state’s objection to defense counsel’s statement “pointing out the undisputed fact\nthat the gun had been in the custody of the Rhode Island State Police since the date of the alleged\noffense.” Immediately after the colloquy with the court that we discussed in the preceding\ncase. How many times have you heard recently in the news people who are serving 20 years in\njail for a rape or murder they didn’t commit?” See Part I.F., supra.', '- 15 -\nparagraph, defense counsel proceeded to state in the presence of the jury: “The defense never had\nthe opportunity to have that weapon fingerprinted. It was in the custody of the State Police.” At\nthat point, the prosecutor objected, which objection was sustained by the trial justice. It is\ndefendant’s argument on appeal that “[d]efense counsel was entitled to argue that[,] without\nfingerprints, Mr. Ferrer could not, unfortunately, be exonerated by scientific evidence” and that\nhis assertion that the firearm had been in the custody of the police “tied in with defense counsel’s\nargument that the state may have greatly reduced the likelihood of successful fingerprinting by\nwaiting to test until six months after the gun was seized, test-fired, and repeatedly\nhandled * * * .”', 'We do not find defendant’s argument to be at all persuasive. We agree with the state’s\nassertion in its written submission to this Court that defense counsel’s statement tended to imply,\nmisleadingly, to the jury that the state “had acted deliberately to violate [defendant’s] rights.”\nNothing in the record indicates that defendant at any point sought to have a fingerprint test\nperformed on the firearm or was prevented by the state from doing so. It was well within the\ntrial justice’s discretion to sustain the state’s entirely proper objection in order to ensure that the\nclosing argument did “not stray unduly from the mark.” Ellis, 619 A.2d at 422 (quoting Herring,\n422 U.S. at 862).', 'It is our definite opinion that no limitation on closing argument occurred at the time of\nthe first objection and that the trial justice properly sustained the state’s subsequent objection to\ndefense counsel’s statement with respect to the fingerprinting of the handgun.

Trooper Alboum testified that he\nproceeded to that location; he said that, at the Walgreens, there were law enforcement officers\nfrom several police departments all “standing around.” In his testimony, Trooper Alboum\nestimated that there were around fifteen to twenty officers in uniform at the scene.\n6', 'We omit from our discussion the testimony of Trooper Ernest Adams, Trooper Luke\nShatz, and Trooper Herbert Tilson, as their testimony has no direct bearing on defendant’s\ncontentions on appeal. In addition, we reference only where necessary the testimony of two\nforensic scientists, Paul Breault and Paul Steven Iwuc. The forensic testing undertaken by those\nscientists, performed in order to identify the substances found in defendant’s car, need not be\nrevisited in detail here. The parties do not dispute on appeal that both MDMA and marijuana\nwere discovered in defendant’s vehicle, nor do the parties dispute the amounts found therein.', '-3-', 'Next, Trooper Alboum testified that, while he was standing in the Walgreens parking lot,\nhe observed a black Nissan Maxima drive past. Trooper Alboum testified that he could see that\nthe driver of the Nissan Maxima was a woman and that in the car there were two male\npassengers, both dark-skinned and wearing white T-shirts. Trooper Alboum also testified that\nthe driver of the Nissan Maxima was “staring straight ahead” as she passed the Walgreens\nparking lot and that her two passengers were “slouching down,” while also “looking straight\nahead.” Trooper Alboum further testified that the behavior of the occupants of that car stood out\nin contrast to what was transpiring in the other cars passing by, in that the occupants of the latter\ncars were turning their heads in the direction of what Trooper Alboum testified was a “large\npolice presence” in the parking lot.', 'Trooper Alboum then testified that, after observing the occupants of the Nissan Maxima,\nhe proceeded to “run an inquiry” on the vehicle’s license plate and discovered that the license\nplate affixed to the Nissan Maxima “came back [registered to] a 2000 silver Toyota.” Trooper\nAlboum stated that “the registration [did not] match the vehicle.” It was Trooper Alboum’s\ntestimony that, after that discovery, he started his cruiser and began to follow the Nissan\nMaxima. He further testified that he “clock[ed]” it as traveling at 45 miles per hour in a 25 mile\nper hour zone. Trooper Alboum stated that the Nissan Maxima proceeded to enter Route 146\nand that, as it did so, it entered “right behind [another] vehicle, nearly striking it.” Trooper\nAlboum testified that, as he followed the Nissan Maxima onto Route 146, he activated his lights\nand siren; he added that the Nissan Maxima nonetheless continued without stopping. Trooper\nAlboum stated that it was only after another police cruiser passed the Nissan Maxima in the high\nspeed lane, positioned itself in front of the vehicle, and slowed down, that the Nissan Maxima\nslowed and eventually stopped.', '-4-', 'Trooper Alboum then testified that, after exiting his cruiser, he approached the Nissan\nMaxima and that, as he did so, he could smell “the odor of fresh marijuana” emanating from the\nback of that vehicle. He further testified that he approached the driver’s side of the car and asked\nall of the occupants to “put their hands up;” Trooper Alboum stated that he made this request in\norder to “see everyone’s hands to make sure they didn’t have any weapons in their hands * * * .”\nHe testified that, although all of the occupants initially complied, he observed that Mr. Espinal,\nthe passenger seated behind the driver’s seat, was “starting to put his hands down.”7 It was\nTrooper Alboum’s testimony that he asked Mr. Espinal to step out of the car, searched him for\nweapons, and handcuffed him, before finally placing him in the back of the police cruiser.', 'Trooper Alboum testified that he then returned to the Nissan Maxima and approached the\ndriver’s side. It was Trooper Alboum’s testimony that, at that point in time, he could detect the\nodor of burnt marijuana coming from inside the vehicle. He testified that he asked defendant, the\ndriver of the car, for her license and that, when she began to reach toward the floor of the car, he\nasked her to step out of the car.8 He said that he made that request because “it’s not normal that\npeople reach for their licenses on the floor of the vehicle.”', 'Trooper Alboum further testified that, after defendant stepped out of the car, he “sent her\n* * * towards the other troopers;” he added that he did not handcuff her himself, because his “set\nof handcuffs was on Mr. Espinal.”9 Trooper Alboum next testified that he checked under the\n7', 'During his testimony at trial, Trooper Alboum identified the person seated behind the\ndriver as co-defendant Jonathan Espinal.\n8', 'During Trooper Alboum’s in-court testimony, he identified defendant as being the driver\nof the car on the night of July 26, 2010.\n9', 'Although Trooper Alboum was not able to testify specifically as to the details of\ndefendant’s arrest because he neither arrested defendant personally nor observed another officer\neffectuating the arrest, it is apparent from the record that the arrest occurred after Trooper', '-5-\nfloor mat on the driver’s side (where defendant had been sitting) and found a “clear plastic baggy\nwith a half a blue pill” inside.10 He added that Officer Raymond Reall of the North Providence\nPolice Department searched the other passenger, Mr. German, and in the course of that search\nfound a “plastic bag” containing what appeared to be marijuana.11 It was Trooper Alboum’s\ntestimony that, following that discovery, he embarked on a more thorough search of the car with\nthe assistance of another law enforcement officer—namely, Officer Reall, who had accompanied\nhim in a separate cruiser in the pursuit of the Nissan Maxima onto Route 146.', 'Trooper Alboum stated that, in the course of the more thorough search, he opened the\ntrunk of the Nissan Maxima and immediately observed “two rectangular objects that had a\nclearish green plastic baggy on it [sic].” In addition, Trooper Alboum noted that the odor of\nfresh marijuana “increased * * * significant[ly]” once he had opened the trunk. According to\nTrooper Alboum’s testimony, a complete search of the trunk yielded six such “rectangular\nobjects” (which he described as “bales”) covered in “greenish clear cellophane wrap.” Later\ntestimony at trial by one of the state’s forensic scientists was to the effect that the bales contained\nmarijuana and that the total weight of the marijuana was approximately thirty kilograms.12', 'Trooper Alboum further testified that, on July 27, 2010 (the morning after the arrests of\ndefendant, Mr. German, and Mr. Espinal), Mr. German agreed to make a statement, and he was\nAlboum asked defendant to step out of the car and sent her in the direction of the other law\nenforcement officers at the scene.\n10', 'One of the forensic scientists who testified for the state indicated that his testing\ndemonstrated that the blue pill contained MDMA.\n11', 'When Officer Reall testified during defendant’s trial, he stated that the marijuana was\nfound during a patdown of Mr. German’s clothing.\n12', 'One kilogram is the equivalent of approximately 2.2 pounds in the system of weights\ncommonly used in this country. See The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language\n966 (5th ed. 2011). Accordingly, the bales referred to in the text weighed approximately sixty-\nsix pounds.', '-6-\nadvised of his constitutional rights at that time.', 'The trooper testified that his subsequent\ndiscussion with Mr. German lasted approximately twenty to thirty minutes; he added that the\ndiscussion was thereafter memorialized in a six-page “formal typed statement” (hereinafter “the\nunsigned statement”). Trooper Alboum stated that Mr. German initialed each of the first five\npages of the unsigned statement, but did not sign it or check a box indicating that the “above\nstatement was true to the best of [his] knowledge.” Trooper Alboum further testified that he\n(Trooper Alboum) thereafter changed the last line of the unsigned statement and that the\nresulting version of the statement was read and signed by Mr. German (hereinafter “the signed\nstatement”). According to Trooper Alboum’s testimony, the two statements were substantively\nidentical, with the exception of the last line.', 'Trooper Alboum first testified concerning the contents of Mr. German’s unsigned\nstatement. He stated that, in the course of his conversation with Mr. German about the events\nleading to defendant’s arrest, Mr. German told him that defendant had come and picked up Mr.\nEspinal and Mr. German around 6 or 7 p.m. on what would be the night of the arrest. Trooper\nAlboum then testified that Mr. German said that a friend named Felix had called and told Mr.\nGerman that he had marijuana and wanted to know if Mr. German could “get rid of it.” Trooper\nAlboum further testified that Mr. German also told him that Felix then said that he had\n“something for Ellie”13 and that Mr. German should “come get it.” Trooper Alboum stated that\nMr. German then said that defendant, who was in the car with Mr. German and Mr. Espinal,\ncould hear the phone conversation between Mr. German and Felix and that Mr. German\nsubsequently directed defendant to drive to the location where they would meet Felix.\n13', 'It was Trooper Alboum’s testimony that Mr. German “specifically used the word ‘Ellie’\nto refer to the defendant.”', '-7-', 'It was Trooper Alboum’s further testimony that he asked Mr. German why defendant\nwould be the one to “get rid” of the marijuana and that Mr. German replied: “Because she [(Ms.\nMendez)] is the one that sells it.” Trooper Alboum stated that Mr. German said that defendant\nwas “fully aware” that there was a large amount of marijuana in her car on the night of her arrest.\nFinally, Trooper Alboum testified that, when he asked Mr. German whether he had anything to\nadd to his first statement, Mr. German stated: “It was not my weed. It was Elizabeth’s weed.”\nTrooper Alboum testified that Mr. German refused to sign anything at that point in time.', 'Finally, Trooper Alboum testified that, after Mr. German opted not to sign the first\nstatement (the unsigned statement), Trooper Alboum prepared another statement (the signed\nstatement) in which he asked Mr. German the same series of questions, and Mr. German replied\nwith exactly the same answers, with one exception. Trooper Alboum explained that, as he\nfinished preparing the signed statement, he again asked Mr. German whether he had anything to\nadd, and Mr. German replied: “The marijuana was all mine, and I am taking the hit for it all.”\nTrooper Alboum stated that, after the just-quoted assertion by Mr. German as to the marijuana\nbeing “all his” was added, Mr. German signed the second statement.', '2. The Testimony of Officer Diego Mello', 'Officer Diego Mello of the East Providence Police Department also testified for the state.\nHe testified that, on the day of defendant’s arrest, he was working as the Vice Unit sergeant in\nthe North Main Street area of Providence and that he responded to a BOLO14 concerning a “blue\nKia minivan” that had been reported as having been carjacked by “two Hispanic males with\nguns.” Officer Mello testified that he heard on the police radio that the carjacking occurred in\nthe Hawkins Street area of Providence and that the minivan was last seen heading towards\n14', 'Officer Mello testified that the acronym “BOLO” stands for “be on the lookout.” See\nalso State v. Austin, No. 2013-77, 2015 WL 1954726 at *8 n. 4 (R.I. May 1, 2015).', '-8-\nBranch Avenue. He stated that he responded to that area and “[t]ried to figure out the fastest\nroute out of Providence,” which, in his opinion, “would be the route that they [the carjackers]\nwould have taken.” Officer Mello testified that he determined that the fastest route would be\nCharles Street, heading outbound towards North Providence; he stated that he proceeded to drive\nalong that route, eventually discovering the blue Kia minivan parked in the Walgreens parking\nlot. It was his testimony that, after he located the minivan, he “contacted dispatch” with the\nvehicle’s description, and it was confirmed that the vehicle which he had discovered was the\ncarjacked Kia minivan.', 'Officer Mello further testified that he stayed at the scene and continued to pay attention\nto the ambient activity; in particular, he said that he could observe the cars that were passing by\nand that he “looked in every one.” He indicated that it was a “sunny summer day” and that he\ncould see the people inside the passing cars. He also testified that he was “able to see which way\nthe drivers of those [passing] cars were looking[.]” Officer Mello added that there was a “heavy\npolice presence” at the Walgreens parking lot; he specified that there were “about 12 police\nofficers, [and] maybe a half dozen police cars [with] their lights on * * *.”', 'Officer Mello next testified that he observed a Nissan Maxima pass by the parking lot\nand that he could see its occupants. He noted that the passengers were Hispanic males, matching\nthe description in the BOLO that he had heard earlier. It was Officer Mello’s testimony that the\noccupants of the Nissan Maxima acted in a way that “raised a major red flag” for him; he said\nthat, as the Nissan Maxima approached the Walgreens parking lot, in which there was the above-\ndescribed “heavy police presence,” the occupants “were just fixated straight ahead.” Officer\nMello elaborated on this observation as follows:', '“Everyone else was looking in our direction wanting to see what', 'was going on, just like [when] you pass a car accident, everyone', '-9-', 'looks to see what’s going on. In this case every single person in', 'the [Nissan Maxima] was just fixated straight ahead. They acted', 'as though we weren’t even there.”\nOfficer Mello proceeded to testify that he observed Trooper Alboum and Officer Reall depart to\nfollow the Nissan Maxima, while he stayed at the scene and participated in a search of the Kia\nminivan.', '3. The Testimony of Officer Raymond Reall', 'Officer Raymond Reall of the North Providence Police Department also testified for the\nstate. He stated that, on the night of defendant’s arrest, he heard a BOLO concerning a stolen\nvehicle taken at gunpoint; he added that this information brought him to the Charles Street area\nin North Providence, where he was joined by Trooper Alboum. Officer Reall further testified\nthat the stolen vehicle was recovered in a Walgreens parking lot and that he was “dispatched” to\nthat location. It was Officer Reall’s testimony that, once there, he and Trooper Alboum made\n“sure there was nobody inside of [the vehicle].” He testified that, as he waited with Trooper\nAlboum for the arrival of Providence law enforcement, he observed “[q]uite a few” more police\nofficers come to the scene. He stated that “every single car that * * * stop[ped] at the red light\n[on Charles Street] looked over to see what was going on due to the fact [that] there [were]\nseveral police cars and people running around over there.” He further testified, however, that he\nnoticed one car whose occupants did the opposite; specifically, he testified as follows:', '“There was a vehicle that was stopped at the red light on Charles', 'Street; and I noticed that there was a person sitting in the passenger', 'seat front [of the vehicle] with a white T-shirt, and there was also', 'a[] Hispanic male in the back with a white T-shirt; and that was the', 'description given from the BOLO from Providence. * * * [T]hey', 'would not look over at the parking lot where the police were.”\nOfficer Reall next testified that, after making that observation, he entered his police cruiser and\nattempted to catch up to the just-referenced vehicle so that he could stop and question its', '- 10 -\noccupants. His testimony mirrored that of Trooper Alboum as he recounted the details of his\npursuit of the Nissan Maxima and his eventual success at pulling the Nissan Maxima over into\nthe breakdown lane of Route 146.', 'Officer Reall stated that, once the Nissan Maxima was on Route 146, it continued to\ntravel “at a high rate of speed;” he added that he “went into the left lane * * * passed Trooper\nAlboum’s car, passed the [Nissan] Maxima, and got in front of the [Nissan] Maxima and slowed\nit down * * *.” He said that his cruiser and the Nissan Maxima “veered off into the breakdown\nlane,” eventually coming to a stop. Officer Reall testified that he and Trooper Alboum exited\ntheir cruisers to approach the Nissan Maxima.', 'It was Officer Reall’s testimony that he\napproached the Nissan Maxima on the passenger side and told the front-seat passenger and the\nother occupants of the car to “put their hands on the roof.” Officer Reall testified that he later\nlearned that the name of the front-seat passenger was Osvaldo German.', 'Officer Reall proceeded to testify that he took “the passenger [(Mr. German)] out” of the\nNissan Maxima and searched him. He stated that, upon searching Mr. German, he discovered\nmarijuana in Mr. German’s front pocket.15 Officer Reall then testified that, following that\ndiscovery, he “released [Mr. German] to the custody of the Rhode Island State Police * * *\n[because] [t]hey ha[d] jurisdiction.” Officer Reall stated at trial that, after releasing Mr. German\nto the custody of the State Police, he helped the State Police search the Nissan Maxima. He\ntestified that he searched the front passenger area, but did not find anything; he added, however,\nthat he became aware of a “strong odor of marijuana coming from the vehicle,” which odor he\nstated was that of “fresh” marijuana. Officer Reall further testified that, when the trunk of the\n15', 'Subsequent testimony for the state by Paul Steven Iwuc, a forensic scientist with the\nDepartment of Health, indicated that the substance discovered in Officer Reall’s search of Mr.\nGerman was, in fact, marijuana.', '- 11 -\nNissan Maxima was opened, the odor of marijuana “increased.” Officer Reall concluded his\ntestimony on direct examination by stating that, although he was not present when the contents\nof the trunk were unloaded, he did observe marijuana inside the trunk as he assisted in the search\nof the Nissan Maxima.', '4. The Testimony of Osvaldo German', 'Mr. German, one of the co-defendants, also testified as a witness for the state. He stated\nthat defendant is the mother of his son, who was about two years old at the time of trial. Mr.\nGerman further testified about the events that took place on the night of defendant’s arrest—July\n26, 2010.', 'Specifically, Mr. German testified that, on that night, he was a passenger in\ndefendant’s black Nissan Maxima; he said that they were traveling on Charles Street towards\nRoute 146 and that, when the car reached the highway, he observed “cops behind [them] with the\nlights on.” It was Mr. German’s testimony that the Nissan Maxima eventually stopped on Route\n146 because they were “getting pulled over.” Mr. German stated that law enforcement officers\napproached the Nissan Maxima “with their guns drawn telling [him and the other occupants of\nthe car] to get out, put [their] hands up.” Mr. German further testified that the law enforcement\nofficers “took [them] out of the car” and that he was searched—during which search “a small\namount of weed” was discovered. It was Mr. German’s testimony that, after that discovery, law\nenforcement officers “put the cuffs” on him and then put him into a police car.', 'Mr. German proceeded to testify concerning what took place at the Rhode Island State\nPolice barracks, where he was taken after his arrest. He stated that, on the night of July 26,\n“there [were] a whole bunch of cops there [at the barracks] that [were] asking me questions;” he\nadded, however, that he “didn’t answer them.”', '- 12 -', 'Mr. German went on to testify that, on the morning of the next day, July 27, he was\nbrought into a room and was asked “more questions.” In particular, when asked whether he\nrecalled speaking with any police officers, Mr. German testified that he thought he remembered\nspeaking to Trooper Alboum, whom he identified sitting at counsel table,16 as well as another\npolice officer who had been in the courtroom earlier that day.', 'Mr. German next stated that he did not remember what he and the officer talked about,\nbut he added that he did remember that the officer “was typing” during their discussion.\nHowever, Mr. German added that the officer “wasn’t typing what I was saying.” Mr. German\nalso stated that the officer “was just asking questions.” When asked what the officer’s questions\n“dealt with,” Mr. German responded: “[F]irst they went from a van, then they went [to] the\nweed.” The prosecutor’s questions then turned to the details of “the weed,” asking Mr. German:\n“And the five kilograms of weed, what did the [officer] ask you about it?” In response to that\nquestion, Mr. German testified that, when the officer had asked him whether the weed was his,\nhe responded in the affirmative. However, when the prosecutor asked whether claiming the\nweed as his own was what Mr. German had “first told” the officer, Mr. German testified that he\ndid not know what he first told the officer.', 'At that point in his testimony, after stating that he was not sure what he “first told” the\nofficer, Mr. German recounted his version of events with respect to the unsigned and signed\nstatements. Specifically, Mr. German stated:', '“[W]hen I first talked to [the officer], he went and print out [sic] a', 'paper, and when he brung the paper back, it was not what I had\n16', 'It will be recalled that Trooper Alboum testified that he interviewed Mr. German on July\n27.

And I told him I take full responsibility for everything,', 'that the weed was all mine; and I didn’t talk to him after that.”17\nYet when asked by the prosecutor about the second statement (the signed statement), which\ncontained the above-referenced assertion by Mr. German that “the weed was all [his],” Mr.\nGerman testified that he did not remember what he (Mr. German) was talking about at that time.\nIn addition, when asked by the prosecutor: “[I]s that exactly what you said, ‘The weed’s all\nmine’?” Mr. German responded: “I don’t remember what I said.” Mr. German’s testimony\ncontinued in that vein, with Mr. German frequently answering “I don’t remember” to questions\nwith respect to his discussion with the officer and with respect to the unsigned and signed\nstatements.', 'Mr. German was then given the opportunity to review his signed statement, and he\nthereafter stated that he remembered “saying that the marijuana’s all [his] and [he’ll] take full\nresponsibility for everything,” but that he “didn’t say [he’ll] take the hit for it all.” In Mr.\nGerman’s testimony, he characterized the difference between what he said and what was\nreflected in the signed statement as “the same issue with the other paper [the unsigned\nstatement], why [he] didn’t sign; because [the officer] was typing, [Mr. German would] say one\nthing, [and the officer would] put another.”', 'With respect to the events of the night of defendant’s arrest, Mr. German testified that it\nwas he who put the marijuana in the car and that, as far as he knew, defendant “didn’t know\nanything about it.” In addition, when engaged in a colloquy with the prosecutor concerning the\ndetails of his plea agreement, Mr. German indicated that he had believed at the time that he\nentered into the agreement that Ms. Mendez “was out of the indictment;” he said that he “would\n17', 'It is readily apparent from Mr. German’s testimony that his reference to “the paper” is\nmeant to refer to the unsigned statement; Trooper Alboum testified that it was the first document\nthat he drafted during their discussion, which document Mr. German did not sign.', '- 14 -\nhave signed [the plea agreement] as long as the charges [were] dropped against her.” The\nfollowing exchange between the prosecutor and Mr. German is in the same vein:', '“Q', 'What was most important to you, you would have signed', 'anything as long as the defendant, her name wasn’t brought', 'into it?', '“A', 'Yes, cause she had nothing to do with it.”\nIn sum, Mr. German’s testimony at trial indicated that he remembered very little about the\nconversations that resulted in the unsigned and signed statements and that the only thing he\nremembered was stating that he would take “full responsibility” for the marijuana.', 'B', 'The Defendant’s Case', 'Following the conclusion of the state’s case in chief, defense counsel moved, pursuant to\nRule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, for a judgment of acquittal, in light\nof what defense counsel characterized as the “inconsistent testimony” proffered by the state. The\nstate objected to the motion, citing an array of evidence presented during the state’s case in chief\nthat provided “ample evidence” of Ms. Mendez’s “possession,” including testimony regarding\nthe odor of marijuana emanating from her car and the unsigned statement made by Mr. German\nthat had been brought out during the testimony of Trooper Alboum. After hearing from both\nparties, the trial justice denied the motion for judgment of acquittal.', 'The defense then put on its case. Jennysa Ayala was the sole witness for the defense. It\nwas her testimony that she was with defendant at an apartment at 99 Rugby Street in Providence\n“all day” on the day of defendant’s arrest.

Those instructions included the following language relative to the crime of\npossession of a controlled substance:', '“In order to prove that first element of the offense, the State', 'must show that the defendant possessed the controlled substance in', 'question. The law recognizes two different types of possession,', 'actual and constructive. A person has actual possession of', 'something if he or she has direct physical control over it with', 'knowledge of its nature. A person has constructive possession of', 'something if she or he does not have physical control over it but', 'knowingly has both the power and the intent at a given time to', 'exercise dominion and control over it either by himself, herself, or', 'through another person.', '“The mere presence near something or mere knowledge of', 'its location by itself is not enough to prove the possession of', 'something. The State must persuade you that the defendant knew', 'the nature of what she possessed; and in this regard the very', 'possession of an item may give rise to the inference that the person', 'who possesses the item knows the nature of what he or she', 'possesses. Although you are permitted to draw that inference,', 'you’re not required to do so. As always, you decide what weight', 'to assign the evidence that you’ve already heard and seen, and', 'what inferences, if any, that you choose to draw from the evidence.', '“* * *', '“To establish the second element of this offense, the State', 'must show that the possession was knowing and intentional.

The jury then returned to its\ndeliberations.', 'The next morning, April 5, before the jury reconvened, defense counsel requested that the\ntrial justice give an alternative instruction in response to the jury’s question; counsel contended\nthat his newly minted alternative instruction was preferable to the supplemental instruction that\nhad been given by the trial justice the previous day. Specifically, defense counsel requested that\nthe jury be instructed as follows:', '“‘The State may not rely upon a defendant’s ownership and control', 'of a vehicle to prove that the defendant knew that she possessed', 'marijuana. While these are factors you may consider, the State', 'must prove that there is other evidence indicating the defendant’s', 'guilty knowledge of marijuana hidden in the vehicle.’”\n18', 'The quoted question was the second that the jury posed to the trial justice. The first\nquestion asked by the jury during its deliberations is not at issue in the instant appeal.', '- 17 -\nThe state objected, pointing to the fact that defense counsel had previously had the opportunity to\nreview the court’s jury instructions and the fact that the supplemental instruction simply referred\nback to the original jury instructions, which were not objected to. The trial justice declined\ndefense counsel’s alternative instruction, and the jury continued its deliberations.', 'D', 'The Verdict and Sentencing', 'Later on April 5, the same day that defense counsel had requested that the trial justice\ngive the alternative instruction, the jury returned its verdict. The defendant was found guilty on\nthe possession of marijuana charge (Count 1) and not guilty on the charges of conspiracy to\npossess marijuana (Count 2) and possession of MDMA (Count 4). Subsequently, the trial justice\nsentenced Ms. Mendez to twenty years of imprisonment, with five years to serve and fifteen\nyears suspended with probation.', 'E', 'The Motion for a New Trial', 'On April 13, 2012, defendant moved for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33 of the Superior\nCourt Rules of Criminal Procedure.

This Court erred in denying the defense motion for a directed', 'verdict of acquittal and the conviction is based on insufficient', 'evidence of guilt in violation of defendant’s due process', 'rights;', '“3.

The verdict is contrary to the weight of the evidence and fails', 'to do substantial justice.”', '- 18 -', 'At the hearing on the motion, defense counsel focused on the supplemental instruction\nthat the trial justice gave in response to the jury’s question, stating that the motion for a new trial\nwas brought “first and foremost * * * over the concern with regard to the jury instruction.”\nDefense counsel contended, inter alia, that the jury “may have been somewhat confused” with\nrespect to the supplemental instruction given in response to the question concerning possession.\nCounsel pointed to the fact that the jury convicted defendant of possessing over five kilograms of\nmarijuana while acquitting her of conspiracy to commit the same crime. He argued that, if the\njury believed the evidence that was consistent with finding defendant guilty of the underlying\ncrime of possession, it would not have been possible for the jury to simultaneously acquit her of\nconspiracy to commit that crime. Defense counsel contended that the court’s supplemental\ninstruction caused the jury to think that “as long as drugs were in [defendant’s] car or found in\nthat car, that’s it,” meaning that the jury would be required to find defendant guilty of the\npossession charge in spite of their findings with respect to the conspiracy charge. In addition,\ndefendant argued that this Court’s decision in State v. Berroa, 6 A.3d 1095 (R.I. 2010), was\nauthority for the proposition that the alternative instruction proposed by defendant was in fact the\ncorrect statement of the law as it related to possession (and presumably would have dispelled the\njury’s confusion). In the end, however, the trial justice denied the motion for a new trial. We\nshall in due course describe more fully the reasoning which underlay that denial.', 'II', 'Analysis', 'On appeal, defendant contends: (1) that the trial justice erred in failing to provide the\nalternative instruction, which defendant contends would have been the “correct” supplemental\ninstruction (as opposed to the supplemental instruction that was actually given); (2) that the trial', '- 19 -\njustice erred in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial; and (3) that defendant’s twenty-year\nsentence is violative of Article 1, Section 8 of the Rhode Island Constitution. We shall address\nthose arguments in the same order, referencing the applicable standard of review where\nnecessary.', 'A', 'The Supplemental Jury Instruction', 'The defendant first argues on appeal that the trial justice erred in declining to give the\nalternative instruction that defendant proposed on the morning of April 5. The state responds\nthat the trial justice did not err in this regard because a jury is presumed to understand\ninstructions as given; the state further contends that, in view of the fact that the jury did not seek\nfurther clarification after having heard the trial justice’s supplemental instruction, the jury should\nbe presumed to have understood. For the reasons set forth below, we hold that defendant has\nwaived any argument which she may have had relative to the trial justice’s declining to give the\nalternative instruction because that argument was not raised in a timely manner before the trial\njustice.19\n19', 'While defense counsel did lodge an objection to the trial justice’s proposed supplemental\ninstruction on April 4 (the day on which the trial justice gave the supplemental instruction), he\ndid so on grounds that are utterly different from those reflected in the alternative instruction that,\non the following day, he argued was appropriate.', 'The transcript reveals that, on April 4, after the trial justice shared with counsel his\nproposed supplemental instruction in response to the jury question, defense counsel lodged an\nobjection to “anything beyond” the first seven words of the instruction (i.e., anything beyond this\ndirective to the jury: “‘You need to consider the Court’s instructions.’”) When the trial justice\nasked what defense counsel found “prejudicial” in the remaining portion of the trial justice’s\nproposed supplemental instruction, defense counsel responded as follows:', '“What I think is prejudicial, your Honor, is that they might forget', 'to consider the elements of the charges with that specific', 'instruction. If they just find the facts, associate some type of', 'weight with them, and then apply the law, I know that they’re', '- 20 -', 'We have long abided by the principle that we may not “consider[] at the appellate level\nissues not properly presented before the trial court.” State v. Merida, 960 A.2d 228, 236 (R.I.\n2008); see also State v. Clements, 83 A.3d 553, 564 (R.I. 2014); State v. Gomes, 881 A.2d 97,\n113 (R.I. 2005). That principle, commonly referred to as the raise or waive rule,20 is a “well-', 'suppose[d] to apply the elements, but without that specifically', 'being instructed to them, I think that a step in that process, so to', 'speak, may not take place and they may forget to actually -- the', 'specific elements have to be analyzed as well.”\nThe trial justice proceeded to give a thoughtful and considered response to defense counsel’s\nconcern, and further cited his own concern that referencing the elements specifically may result\nin “cut[ting] out a great deal of the 26 pages of text” that comprised the jury instructions. The\ntrial justice referred back to his earlier admonishment to the jury during his initial instructions:\nthat the jurors ought to “consider the instructions in their entirety” and not to single out any one\ninstruction. Following the above statements, the trial justice added that he would send “an\nadditional six copies” of the jury instructions up to the jury deliberation room, in addition to the\nsix copies which had been previously sent up to the jury.', 'We recount the above exchange between defense counsel and the trial justice to illustrate\nthat defense counsel’s objection was clearly on different grounds from those raised before this\nCourt in the instant appeal.', 'Furthermore, to the extent that defendant argues before us that her April 4 objection on\nthe above-referenced grounds—namely, that the trial justice erroneously gave the entire\nsupplemental instruction, rather than just the seven words thereof as requested by defendant in\nher initial objection—we deem that argument to be waived. See Wilkinson v. State Crime\nLaboratory Commission, 788 A.2d 1129, 1131 n. 1 (R.I. 2002). Although defendant alludes to\nthe issue in her briefing before this Court, she makes no meaningful argument with respect to\nwhether the trial justice erred in giving the entire supplemental instruction; instead, she limits\nherself to advocating for the alternative instruction, which she proposed on the morning of April\n5. Our precedent requires more than an allusion to an issue for it to become the proper subject of\nappellate review. See id. (“Simply stating an issue for appellate review, without a meaningful\ndiscussion thereof or legal briefing of the issues, does not assist the Court in focusing on the\nlegal questions raised, and therefore constitutes a waiver of that issue.”); see also Hines Road,\nLLC v. Hall, 113 A.3d 924, 931 n. 6 (R.I. 2015); State v. Day, 925 A.2d 962, 974 n. 19 (R.I.\n2007).', 'Finally, we note that we consider the alternative instruction later proposed by defendant\nto act as a further objection to the supplemental instruction, see Perry v. Alessi, 890 A.2d 463,\n470 (R.I. 2006) (“He then objected to the trial justice’s failure to give eleven of his proposed\ninstructions * * *.”); Butera v. Boucher, 798 A.2d 340, 348 (R.I. 2002), and it is this latter\nobjection that we address more fully in our analysis of defendant’s arguments on appeal.\n20', 'Our cases have recognized a narrow exception to this Court’s raise or waive rule. For\nthat exception to be applicable, however, “the alleged error must be more than harmless, and the', '- 21 -\nestablished maxim,” Thornley v. Community College of Rhode Island, 107 A.3d 296, 302 (R.I.\n2014), and it “imposes upon litigants a duty to raise all their claims for relief in the trial court and\nproperly articulate them to a judge for a ruling.” D’Alessio v.

Huntress, Inc., 94 A.3d 467, 483 (R.I.\n2014) (describing this Court as being “especially rigorous in the application of the [raise or\nwaive] rule when considering objections to jury instructions”) (internal quotation marks\nomitted); State v.

Accordingly, we have\nemphasized that “[c]ounsel’s objection to the jury instruction must be made before the jury\nretires because once alerted to the perceived error in the instruction that has been given, the trial\njustice has an opportunity to cure the alleged deficiencies before the jury retires for\nexception must implicate an issue of constitutional dimension derived from a novel rule of law\nthat could not reasonably have been known to counsel at the time of trial.” State v.

Acer Group, 870 A.2d 429, 432,\n433 (R.I. 2005). To the extent that defendant seeks an appeal on such constitutional grounds, we\nperceive absolutely no basis for concluding that this narrow exception could properly be invoked\nin this case.', '- 22 -\ndeliberations.” State v. Viveiros, 45 A.3d 1232, 1243-44 (R.I. 2012) (emphasis added) (internal\nquotation marks omitted); see also State v. Palmer, 962 A.2d 758, 766 (R.I. 2009); cf. DiFranco\nv. Klein, 657 A.2d 145, 147 (R.I. 1995) (discussing parallel rule of civil procedure and\ndescribing the rationale for the rule as “allow[ing] the trial justice an opportunity to make any\nnecessary corrections to his or her instructions before the jury begins its deliberations”)\n(emphasis added). We note that the foregoing principles are equally applicable in the context of\na trial justice giving a jury a supplemental instruction as distinguished from the initial charge to\nthe jury. See, e.g., State v. Vega, 789 A.2d 896, 898 (R.I. 2002) (“After giving both of these\nsupplemental instructions, the trial justice asked the attorneys whether they had any objections to\nthese charges. Both counsel replied in the negative and they also failed to suggest any different\nor supplemental instructions. * * * [B]y failing to object at trial to the above-referenced\ninstructions, [the] defendant has failed to preserve any alleged inadequacies or errors relating to\nthese supplemental instructions and he is precluded from raising such arguments for the first time\non appeal.”). We now turn to the instances in which defendant claims that she has properly\npreserved her objections.', 'The defendant first asserts that the alternative instruction was correct and that the jury\ndeserved to have it presented to them; in addition, she contends that it “was preserved for direct\nappeal by [defense] counsel’s timely objection,” in the form of the alternative instruction.\nSpecifically, defendant contends that defense counsel “objected and requested the correct jury\ninstruction shortly after the trial justice answered [the jury question].”', '(Emphasis added.)\nHowever, the record clearly reveals that contention to be entirely without any foundation in fact.\nFirst, and significantly, defense counsel did not contemporaneously object to the supplemental\ninstruction on the grounds that are now presented in his brief to this Court—namely, in the form', '- 23 -\nof the alternative instruction. In our view, it is inaccurate for defendant to claim that his\nproposed alternative instruction was brought to the trial justice’s attention “shortly” after the trial\njustice gave his own supplemental instruction in response to the jury question. Significantly,\nafter the trial justice gave his supplemental instruction, the jury resumed its deliberations; and it\nwas only the next morning that counsel requested the alternative instruction. We note that our\nprecedent emphasizes that “it is imperative that a focused objection specific enough to alert the\ntrial justice as to the nature of [the trial justice’s] alleged error in giving any jury instruction * * *\nmust be made on the record after the jury is instructed and before it retires to deliberate.”\nBerman v. Sitrin, 101 A.3d 1251, 1266 (R.I. 2014) (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). In view of that clear precedent, and in light of the amount of time that elapsed between\nthe trial justice’s supplemental instruction and defense counsel’s alternative instruction, we are\nnot persuaded that defendant’s objection was timely.', 'The defendant argues that our opinion in State v. Fetzik, 577 A.2d 990 (R.I. 1990),\nsupports her contention that her objection (which came in the form of an alternative instruction)\nwhich was articulated on the day after the trial justice gave his supplemental instruction was\nsufficient to preserve the issue for appellate review. However, we are not persuaded by that\nargument. In Fetzik, 577 A.2d at 992-93, the defendant proposed an instruction with respect to\nthe defendant’s physical condition at the time of the crime to the trial justice before the trial\njustice charged the jury, albeit after the close of evidence. Pursuant to Rule 30 of the Superior\nCourt Rules of Criminal Procedure, “when a defendant relies upon an affirmative defense or\njustification or a matter in mitigation he or she must advise the court no later than the close of\nevidence.” Fetzik, 577 A.2d at 992 (emphasis added). However, we stated in Fetzik that,\n“[a]lthough the instruction was technically late, the trial justice appears to have had an adequate', '- 24 -\nopportunity to consider this instruction” regarding the defendant’s physical condition, especially\nin light of extensive testimony documenting said condition, and that “[t]he requested instruction\nwas one that could easily have been included with those that were given.” Id. at 993. Those\ncircumstances are clearly distinguishable from those at issue in the instant case. Here, the trial\njustice had no opportunity to consider the substance of defense counsel’s alternative instruction\nbecause the proposal did not arrive until the next morning, after the supplemental instruction had\nbeen given and the jury had resumed deliberations. For similar reasons, defendant’s alternative\ninstruction could not have easily been included with the supplemental instruction. Simply put, in\nthe instant case, the objection (in the form of the alternative instruction) was not timely, and our\nopinion in Fetzik does not support the contention that the issue was somehow preserved.', 'The defendant argues that, even if the argument relative to the proposed alternative\ninstruction was not preserved during the actual trial, it has been “preserved for direct appeal as it\nwas included in the Rule 33 New Trial Motion and ruled on by the Trial Court on the merits.”\nBut that argument flies in the face of our precedent. In State v. Flori, 963 A.2d 932, 938 (R.I.\n2009), we specifically stated: “Although * * * [R]ule [33] allows the court to grant a new trial if\nrequired in the interest of justice, it does not circumvent or override contemporaneous objection\nrules, such as Rule 30.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) We see no reason to deviate from\nthat principle in the instant case; defendant did not timely object because she did not timely\nprovide her alternative instruction, and her failure to do so was not cured by her decision to raise\nthe issue in her motion for a new trial.', 'Third, defendant claims that the issue is “properly before the Court as the State failed to\nobject to the timing of counsel’s objection.” We are not persuaded by this argument. The state\ndid not need to present an objection to defendant’s untimely proposal for an alternative', '- 25 -\ninstruction where the trial justice explicitly ruled against giving that instruction; defendant’s\nargument in this regard is meritless, and we summarily reject it.', 'Finally, we note that a trial is one-directional in nature; it moves forward from beginning\nto end. And essential to the trial process is the requirement that objections be made at the time\nwhen an event occurs that counsel deems objectionable. See Rule 51 of the Superior Court\nRules of Criminal Procedure (“Formal exceptions to rulings or orders of the court are\nunnecessary; but for all purposes for which an exception has heretofore been necessary it is\nsufficient that a party, at the time the ruling or order of the court is made or sought, makes\nknown to the court the action which the party desires the court to take or his or her objection to\nthe action of the court * * *.”) (emphasis added); see also In re Jazlyn P., 31 A.3d 1273, 1280\n(R.I. 2011) (“An issue is properly preserved—and, as a result, may be raised before this Court on\nappeal—if the litigant’s objection was both ‘timely and appropriate.’”) (emphasis added)\n(quoting State v. Brown, 9 A.3d 1240, 1245 (R.I. 2010)); see generally Thomas v. Ross, 477\nA.2d 950, 953 (R.I. 1984) (“Trial on an installment-plan basis cannot be countenanced * * *.”).\nIn addition, it is required that the objecting party not only voice the objection contemporaneously\nwith the perceived error, but it is further required that all grounds for the objection be brought to\nthe attention of the presiding judicial officer at that time. See State v. Hallenbeck, 878 A.2d 992,\n1007 (R.I. 2005); see also State v. Figuereo, 31 A.3d 1283, 1289 (R.I. 2011). In the instant case,\nas soon as the question posed by the jury had been addressed by the trial justice, the jury\ncontinued deliberating. For the court on the next morning to have given a further supplemental\ninstruction might well have unduly been perceived by the jurors as a sort of red flag, causing\nthem to infer that the trial justice was imparting some sort of cryptic message.', '- 26 -', 'Accordingly, we hold that defendant has failed to preserve her objection to the\nsupplemental jury instruction.', 'B', 'The Motion for a New Trial', 'The defendant next argues on appeal that the trial justice erred when he denied her\nmotion for a new trial. She contends: (1) that the trial justice erred in crediting Mr. German’s\nunsigned statement, which was testified to by Trooper Alboum; and (2) that her conviction was\nbased on insufficient evidence. Specifically, she claims that the jury did not find Mr. German’s\nunsigned statement to the police to be credible—whereas, if the jury found the statement to be\ncredible, it could infer that defendant knowingly possessed the marijuana. Indeed, she argues\nthat the unsigned statement was so undermined by Mr. German’s criminal record, his purported\nconnection to the carjacking earlier that day, and his subsequent contradictory statements, that no\njury could have found that the unsigned statement was worthy of credence. In addition, she\nclaims that it was not reasonable to conclude that she could have smelled the fresh marijuana in\nthe trunk in view of the evidence that Mr. German, sitting in the front passenger’s seat, “reeked”\nof burnt marijuana. Therefore, she argues it could not be properly inferred that defendant knew\nthat there was marijuana in the trunk. We hold, for the reasons set forth below, that the trial\njustice properly denied defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'Preliminarily, we note that defendant’s appeal utilizes the language of both a motion for a\nnew trial based on the weight of the evidence and a motion for a new trial based on the\nsufficiency of the evidence. As we have explained in State v. Perkins, 460 A.2d 1245, 1247 (R.I.\n1983), the two motions are different, and each requires its own distinct legal analysis. See also\nState v. Karngar, 29 A.3d 1232, 1235 (R.I. 2011); State v. Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 569-71 (R.I.', '- 27 -\n2009). It is not entirely clear to this Court whether defendant intends to argue both bases for the\nmotion. However, to the extent that she in fact seeks to raise both, we shall address each basis.', 'When a defendant moves for a new trial based on both the weight of the evidence and the\nsufficiency of the evidence, it is the practice of this Court to first address the motion based on the\nweight of the evidence. See State v. Robat, 49 A.3d 58, 72 (R.I. 2012) (stating that this Court\nreviews a motion for a new trial before reviewing a motion for a judgment of acquittal); State v.\nRichardson, 47 A.3d 305, 317 (R.I. 2012); see also Clark, 974 A.2d at 570 (“The difference in\nnomenclature of a motion for a new trial based on the insufficiency of the evidence and a motion\nfor judgment of acquittal does not mean that courts must review these motions differently.”).\nWe proceed in that manner because a defendant seeking to prevail on a motion for a new trial\nbased on the sufficiency of the evidence bears a heavier burden than does a defendant seeking to\nprevail on a weight of the evidence argument; unless a defendant can demonstrate that the\nevidence failed to support his or her conviction based on the weight of the evidence standard, he\nor she will necessarily be unable to establish entitlement to a new trial based on insufficient\nevidence. See Robat, 49 A.3d at 72.', 'When a trial justice considers whether a verdict is against the weight of the evidence, he\nor she “acts as a thirteenth juror and exercises independent judgment on the credibility of\nwitnesses and on the weight of the evidence.” State v.

In carrying out his or her role as the\n“thirteenth juror,” it is incumbent upon the trial justice to “(1) consider the evidence in light of\nthe jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the\nevidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from', '- 28 -\nthat reached by the jury.” State v.

First, he considered the evidence in light of the jury\ncharge regarding constructive possession of marijuana; he expressly noted that it was clear from\nhis jury instruction that, “in order to find the defendant guilty * * * the State had to prove beyond\na reasonable doubt that the defendant possessed the [marijuana], * * * and did so knowingly and\nintentionally.” While the trial justice did not refer to every single piece of evidence, he focused\non all of the evidence relevant to the issue of defendant’s knowledge. See Robat, 49 A.3d at 71.\nThat evidence consisted of the testimony of Mr. German and Trooper Alboum, and Mr.\nGerman’s unsigned and signed police statements.', 'Proceeding to the second step of the analytical process, the trial justice independently\nassessed the credibility of the witnesses and weighed the relevant evidence. He began this\nsecond step of the process by focusing on Mr. German’s credibility, noting that Mr. German was\na “hostile” and “evasive” witness who sought to “undermine whatever he had put in writing at an\nearlier time.” Nonetheless, the trial justice independently concluded that there was “some\ncredibility” to Mr. German’s unsigned statement, which indicated that the marijuana belonged to\nMs. Mendez. In contrast, he stated on the record that he “specifically * * * disbelieve[d]” those\nportions of Mr. German’s signed statement in which he indicated that the marijuana was all his\nand that he would be “‘taking the hit for it.’”', '- 30 -', 'The trial justice then carried out the remainder of the second analytical step by\nidentifying several specific facts weighing in favor of the jury’s verdict. Those facts included:\n(1) the “strong” smell and sheer “bulk” of the marijuana bales that the state introduced as\nevidence; (2) Trooper Alboum’s testimony that Ms. Mendez did not look at the large police\npresence surrounding the carjacked van; and (3) Trooper Alboum’s testimony regarding the\nefforts of Ms. Mendez to avoid being pulled over. With regard to the smell and size of the\nmarijuana (the marijuana having been admitted as a full exhibit at trial), the trial justice noted:', '“The State’s attorney flung the marijuana around on the witness', 'stand and the boxes in front of the Court. The Court noticed it.', 'The jury noticed it. * * * This is not the same as a small package', 'of controlled substances that can be secreted in a foot locker or', '* * * under a spare tire, in a jacket, or even in a bag.”\nThe trial justice concluded that those facts, coupled with Mr. German’s “statements [that] all\nallowed for a reasonable inference that [defendant] knew about the marijuana or knew that there\nwas marijuana in the back of her car,” clearly supported the jury’s verdict.', 'Third and finally, the trial justice concluded the three-step analytical process by explicitly\nstating that he agreed with the jury’s verdict. In light of the trial justice’s proper execution of the\nthree-step analysis and his agreement with the jury verdict, he was not required to do anything\nfurther. See Hie, 93 A.3d at 977.', 'The trial justice properly undertook the required steps to rule upon a motion for a new\ntrial, but we pause to note that, in the course of making his ruling, the trial justice distinguished\nthe instant case from two cases that defendant relied upon heavily in both her briefing and\nargument on the motion below and before this Court. The two cases are State v. Berroa, 6 A.3d\n1095 (R.I. 2010), and United States v. Chadwick, 393 F. Supp. 763 (D. Mass. 1975), aff’d, 532\nF.2d 773, 785 (1st Cir. 1976), aff’d, 433 U.S. 1, 16 (1977). The defendant cited those opinions', '- 31 -\nin support of her argument that the jury could not properly infer her knowledge of the marijuana\nbecause the evidence relied upon by the state to indicate that she had such knowledge was\nsubject to equally plausible, noncriminal explanations.

The defendant in that case then allegedly showed signs of nervousness while police\ninvestigated the car. Id. We vacated the judgment of conviction because the evidence “simply\n[was] not sufficient to affirm the conviction,” even though the facts could have led to\n“speculation or conjecture” regarding the defendant’s involvement with a sophisticated drug-\ntrafficking scheme. Id. at 1102, 1104.', 'In the second case, Chadwick, 393 F. Supp. at 766, 768, a defendant was arrested on\nsuspicion of drug trafficking because he was found in the presence of two people who possessed\na footlocker containing marijuana.', 'The United States District Court for the District of\nMassachusetts determined that the police did not have probable cause to arrest the defendant\nbecause “a non-criminal explanation * * * [was] at least as likely as one indicating that an\noffense [had] been or [was] being committed.” Id. at 768 (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'In the instant case, defendant argues that, similar to the facts in Berroa and Chadwick, the\n“facts and circumstances” of her case, taken together, are “consistent with a reasonable\nhypothesis that she is innocent”—i.e., that the facts and circumstances are consistent with\nignorance of, rather than knowledge of, the presence of marijuana in her car. However, in ruling\non the motion, the trial justice pointed to specific facts indicating otherwise, such as Mr.\nGerman’s unsigned statement implicating defendant’s knowledge of the marijuana, the strong\nsmell and sheer bulk of the marijuana in the car operated by defendant, Trooper Alboum’s\ntestimony that defendant did not look at the police presence surrounding the carjacked van, and', '- 32 -\nTrooper Alboum’s additional testimony that defendant attempted to avoid being pulled over.\nThe trial justice then stated: “I am sure that lightning didn’t strike twelve times in the same place\non that day when this case occurred. Any one of [the facts] by themselves might have been\ninsignificant, but it would appear that there were a number of places here where the inferences\ncan be drawn in light of the instructions I told the jury.” Furthermore, in her briefing to this\nCourt, defendant concedes that only “[o]nce the incredulous [sic] statements of Osvaldo German\nand smell issues are set aside” would her case be “on point” with Berroa and Chadwick. As we\nhave already discussed, the trial justice concluded that Mr. German’s incriminating original\nunsigned statement and the smell of the marijuana were both highly relevant to the determination\nof defendant’s guilt in this case.', 'We see no reason to disturb the trial justice’s findings. He considered all of the relevant\nevidence as he applied the three-step analytical process and he articulated sufficient reasoning to\nsupport his decision to deny the motion.', 'In light of the fact that defendant could not successfully prevail on her motion for a new\ntrial based on the weight of the evidence, we need not address her challenge to the sufficiency of\nthe evidence. See Richardson, 47 A.3d at 317; Clark, 974 A.2d at 570. Accordingly, we affirm\nthe trial justice’s denial of defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'C', 'The Sentence', 'The defendant’s final argument on appeal is that her twenty-year prison sentence is\n“manifestly excessive” and “violates the constitutional requirement that ‘all punishments ought\nto be proportioned to the offense.’” See R.I.

Veronica and Pina then walked across the street to talk to\ndefendant, who was standing in his yard. Veronica hugged defendant. The defendant then sat on\na pile of shingles, and Veronica sat on his lap. According to Veronica, she sat on defendant’s\nleft leg with her legs inside defendant’s legs and defendant’s left hand against her back. When\nher father went to look at defendant’s Chevrolet El Camino, which was parked in his driveway,\nout of defendant’s sight, defendant put his right hand under Veronica’s skirt and touched her\nvagina, over her underwear. Veronica testified that defendant “tapped” her vagina and then she\nfelt his finger go inside of her. Veronica testified that she was scared and uncomfortable, and\nshe devised an excuse to get off defendant’s lap. According to Veronica, defendant smiled at her\nbut said nothing.', 'Veronica did not immediately tell Pina about the assault because she thought he would be\nupset. Later that evening, Veronica told her grandmother, Helene Johnson (Helene), about the\nincident because it was easier to talk to her grandmother and Veronica did not think that the\ndisclosure would upset her.', 'Helene called Kathryn at work and told her what happened.\nKathryn left work and went to Helene’s house to talk to Veronica—who, according to Kathryn,\nappeared scared and confused.

Pina did not\ncall the police, however, “[b]ecause the way I asked [Veronica], she agreed with the way I asked\nher and to me I took it as it was a mistake. It was an accident.” Veronica testified that initially\nshe thought the touching could be an accident, but after meeting with her counselor, she realized\nthat it was not accidental.', 'In September 2015, about a month after the assault, Pina witnessed a raid at defendant’s\nhouse by multiple state troopers; he later learned on social media that it was a police\ninvestigation into defendant for possession of child pornography. Pina called Kathryn and told\nher about the raid, and that prompted her to report the assault to the Warwick police.', 'On November 17, 2015, a grand jury indicted defendant for one count of first-degree\nchild molestation sexual assault, in violation of § 11-37-8.1.

The defendant filed a timely appeal.', 'Issues on Appeal', 'Before this Court, defendant advances four assignments of error. The defendant argues\nthat the trial justice erred: (1) in denying defendant’s motion for a mistrial based on a police\nofficer’s reference during his testimony to a polygraph examination; (2) in denying defendant’s\nmotion for a mistrial based on the prosecutor’s comments during closing argument about', '-3-\ndefendant’s courtroom demeanor at trial; (3) in admitting testimony about the arrest and\nprosecution of defendant for possession of child pornography; and (4) in failing to safeguard\ndefendant’s right to a fair trial based on various claims related to the presence of members of a\nmotorcycle group known as “Bikers Against Child Abuse” (BACA) in the courtroom during\ntrial. We address each contention in turn, and we will provide additional facts and procedural\nhistory as necessary.', 'Motions to Pass the Case', 'Standard of Review', '“When ruling on a motion to pass, the trial justice must assess the prejudicial impact of\nthe statement in question on the jury and determine whether the evidence was of such a nature as\nto cause the jurors to become so inflamed that their attention was distracted from the issues\nsubmitted to them.” State v. Lastarza, 203 A.3d 1159, 1165 (R.I. 2019) (quoting State v.\nCipriano, 21 A.3d 408, 428 (R.I. 2011)).', '“The trial justice makes this determination by\nexamining the witness’s statement or remark in its factual context.” Id. (quoting State v. Werner,\n830 A.2d 1107, 1113 (R.I. 2003)). “Moreover, we previously have held that even prejudicial\nremarks do not necessarily require the granting of a motion to pass.” Id. (quoting Roma v.\nMoreira, 126 A.3d 447, 449 (R.I. 2015)).', '“[A] trial justice’s decision on a motion to pass the case is addressed to the sound\ndiscretion of the trial justice, and this Court will not disturb the ruling on such a motion absent an\nabuse of discretion.” Lastarza, 203 A.3d at 1165 (quoting State v. Rosado, 139 A.3d 419, 423\n(R.I. 2016)). “We give great deference to the trial justice in this regard because he or she has a\nfront-row seat at the trial and is in the best position to determine whether a defendant has been\nunfairly prejudiced.” Id. (quoting Rosado, 139 A.3d at 423).', '-4-', 'Reference to the Polygraph Examination', 'Before the facts of this case were known to the Warwick police, defendant was\ninterviewed by the police on two occasions concerning the child pornography investigation.\nDuring the second interview at the state police barracks, defendant underwent a polygraph\nexamination. The circumstances of the police interviews and an inadvertent reference to the\npolygraph examination by a witness at trial are issues in this case.', 'Before trial, defendant filed a motion in limine to preclude evidence of the polygraph\nexamination at trial. During a hearing on that motion, the court recognized that the state had\n“agreed on the record to * * * redacting out anything that makes reference to a polygraph\nexamination.”', 'Indeed, the prosecutor stated: “The state does not intend to introduce any\nevidence related to the polygraph. I have no issue redacting anything * * * relating to a\npolygraph or any mention thereof[.]” At trial, however, Detective Kevin Petit, the police officer\nwho had administered the polygraph examination to defendant, referenced the polygraph while\ntestifying on cross-examination. Detective Petit testified that he initially interviewed defendant\nat his home, and then conducted a follow-up interview at the state police barracks. Defense\ncounsel then asked Det. Petit how long the follow-up interview lasted, and the following\ncolloquy ensued:', '“[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Do you know how long that interview', 'took place?', '“[DETECTIVE PETIT]: A couple of [sic] three hours I believe. In', 'the interim there was a polygraph exam given so I didn’t have—', '“[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection.', '“THE COURT: Sustained. The jury will disregard.”\nDefense counsel requested a sidebar and immediately moved to pass the case, arguing that the\npolygraph reference warranted a mistrial, and that a curative instruction would not be sufficient\nto cure the prejudice caused by its reference. The state argued that a curative instruction would', '-5-\nbe sufficient because Det. Petit did not reveal the results of the polygraph examination, but only\nthat one had been administered to defendant.', 'The trial justice declined to grant a mistrial, stating:', '“Counsel, the [c]ourt is going to decline your motion to pass. You', 'have preserved the record at this point. The [c]ourt will at some', 'point give a curative instruction and has instructed the jury to', 'disregard the answer.”\nThe defendant did not object to the failure to give an immediate cautionary instruction, nor did\nhe proffer any suggestions about the substance of the instruction. After the cross-examination,\nredirect, and recross of Det. Petit concluded, the trial justice gave the following curative\ninstruction to the jury:', '“[A]t the very beginning of the trial I told you that when the', '[c]ourt has an objection and will overrule or sustain it. When I', 'overrule an objection, it’s very easy. You can consider the answer', 'as evidence. If I sustain an objection to a question that was not', 'answered, you’re never hearing the answer so there is no evidence', 'to consider, and, as I told you, you can’t read into the question', 'itself. There have been times during this witness’ testimony and', 'others where the witness said something, there was an objection', 'afterwards and I sustained the objection. I want to remind the jury', 'again, as I did initially, you cannot consider either the question or', 'the answer given by the witness. It cannot have any weight or any', 'evidentiary value one way or another. You can’t make any', 'inferences as to what you heard. You must and this jury must', 'completely disregard any answer to a question that was sustained', 'by the [c]ourt even if an answer was given, and you heard that', 'numerous times over the course of the testimony.”\nThe defendant did not object to the timing or adequacy of the instruction or otherwise ask the\ncourt to provide additional language.', 'Because we are vacating the judgment of conviction on other grounds, we decline to\nreach these questions regarding the polygraph reference.', '-6-', 'The Prosecutor’s Closing Argument', 'During closing argument, the prosecutor stated:', '“This man, Henry Bozzo, molested that young girl. It wasn’t a', 'mistake. He did it intentionally. He stared at her as she was', 'walking out of the courtroom. He stared her down. I saw it. It', 'was right there. That is no mistake there.” (Emphasis added.)\nThe defendant immediately objected. The trial justice reserved ruling on the objection. The\nprosecutor continued: “You know there is no mistake there. He knew what he was doing.” After\nthe prosecutor concluded his closing argument, the trial justice called for a sidebar, and\ndefendant moved to pass the case, arguing that the prosecutor was “basically testifying[,]” and\nmaking an “absolutely a hundred percent improper argument.” The defendant contended that the\nprosecutor improperly referred to that which he had personally observed, rather than to facts that\nwere in the trial record. The defendant also argued that the prejudice caused by the statements\nwas so significant that it could not be cured by an instruction. The state responded that the\nprosecutor’s remarks stemmed from defendant’s conduct and demeanor when Veronica left the\nstand—all of which occurred in the presence of the jury. The state further argued that, even if\nthe remarks were inappropriate: “It’s only argument. I think the [c]ourt can instruct on that. I\nthink a curative instruction would be fine. The [c]ourt is going to give an instruction that it’s\nonly an argument. It’s not to be considered as evidence.”', 'The trial justice made the following ruling:', '“First of all, the [c]ourt finds that it was improper. The jury is', 'instructed from the beginning they can only consider answers to', 'questions from the witness stand and the exhibits. They cannot', 'consider anything else. Clearly, the prosecutor bringing up what', 'he observed or his observations is improper. The [c]ourt declines', 'to grant a mistrial. The [c]ourt will give a curative instruction to', 'the jury. The jury is aware closing arguments are not evidence.', 'The [c]ourt will instruct the jury to disregard. The [c]ourt', 'disagrees with defense counsel there is no other way to cure this.', '-7-', 'The [c]ourt has dealt with this exact issue and the [c]ourt will give', 'a curative instruction.”\nThe trial justice proceeded to give the following curative instruction to the jury:', '“Members of the jury, before we take a brief break and come back', 'and give you the instructions, there was a comment made by the', 'prosecutor during the closing argument that dealt with an', 'observation of staring down or something to that [e]ffect. You', 'know what I’m referring to. First of all, as I told you before the', 'closings are not evidence. The defense closing is not evidence and', 'the [s]tate’s is not evidence. It’s what you heard from the witness', 'stand. I have also told you that the evidence is what you heard', 'from the witness stand and the statements. It’s not nothing [sic]', 'else that occurs in the courtroom itself. So I am going to instruct', 'you specifically that you must disregard that statement. Now as I', 'said, you wouldn’t be considering it as evidence anyway because', 'the closing is not evidence. But I am specifically going to instruct', 'you that you must disregard that statement. It’s up to you, the jury,', 'in terms of the witnesses, the evidence, the weight that you give', 'that and so I give you that instruction.”\nThe defendant did not object to the instruction.', 'Analysis', 'On appeal, defendant submits that the trial justice abused his discretion in failing to pass\nthe case after the prosecutor’s statements during closing argument about defendant’s courtroom\ndemeanor and behavior toward Veronica. The defendant argues that there is no evidence in the\nrecord to support the prosecutor’s representation that defendant glared at Veronica when she left\nthe witness stand, and that the prosecutor inserted his personal observations into the record,\nwhich deprived defendant of his right to have his guilt or innocence determined solely on the\nevidence presented at trial. Moreover, defendant argues that the instruction that was given could\nnot cure the prejudice that this remark generated. We agree.', 'A criminal trial is a search for the truth. State v. Pacheco, 161 A.3d 1166, 1177 (R.I.\n2017). “The purpose of closing argument is ‘to sharpen and clarify the issues for resolution by', '-8-\nthe trier of fact in a criminal case.’” State v.

(brackets omitted) (quoting Boillard, 789\nA.2d at 885). “The probable effect of the prosecutorial statements on the outcome of the case\nmust be evaluated by examining the remarks in the context in which they were made.” Id.\n(quoting Boillard, 789 A.2d at 885).', 'On numerous occasions, this Court has been called upon to examine purportedly\nimproper statements by a prosecutor during closing argument. See, e.g., Lastarza, 203 A.3d at\n1165; State v. Clements, 83 A.3d 553, 561 (R.I. 2014); State v. Vieira, 38 A.3d 18, 21 (R.I.\n2012); Boillard, 789 A.2d at 884. In Boillard, the defendant was convicted of first-degree and\nsecond-degree child molestation. Boillard, 789 A.2d at 882. One of the victims testified that she\nhad witnessed the defendant’s daughter performing a sexual act on the defendant. Id. at 884. The\nvictim also testified that, when she confronted the defendant’s daughter about what she had seen\nand whether it happened often, the daughter responded, “only when I see my [d]ad.” Id. During', '-9-\nthe daughter’s testimony, however, she denied ever having sexual contact with her father. Id. In\nclosing argument, the prosecutor specifically addressed the daughter’s testimony and suggested\nthat she may have “repressed” the memories or did not remember them. Id.

Id. at 884-85.\nOnce again, the defendant objected, and the trial justice overruled the objection. Id. at 885. We\nheld that the trial justice did not err in overruling the defendant’s objections because the\nprosecutor’s statements suggesting possible explanations for the obvious inconsistencies in the\ntestimony of the witnesses, “though conjectural, were within the array of reasonable inferences\nthat could be drawn from the facts presented at trial, and they were neither extraneous nor\ninflammatory.” Id. at 885-86.', 'More recently, in Lastarza, we examined the issue of allegedly improper comments made\nby the prosecutor during closing argument. Lastarza, 203 A.3d at 1165. There, the prosecutor\nmade several statements during closing argument related to the defendant’s acts of dishonesty\nand criminal history; the prosecutor called the defendant a “thief,” a “career thief,” a “scam\nartist,” and a “con artist.” Id. This Court concluded that the statements did not warrant a mistrial\nbecause they “were based in large part upon the evidence and testimony adduced at trial.” Id. In\nthat case, the defendant took the stand at trial, placing his credibility before the jury, and\nvolunteered information about his past crimes and acts of dishonesty. Id. at 1166. Thus, we\ndetermined that the trial justice did not err in denying the defendant’s motion to pass the case\nbecause the prosecutor’s statements were not “totally extraneous to the issues in the case,” and\nbecause the “remarks specifically addressed defendant’s performance on the witness stand[.]” Id.\n(brackets omitted) (quoting Boillard, 789 A.2d at 885).', '- 10 -', 'In both Boillard and Lastarza, the prosecutor’s remarks were directed to information and\nfacts that had been revealed on the witness stand in the presence of the jury. The prosecutor’s\nstatements in the case at bar diverge from our holdings in the Boillard line of cases because they\nwere not based on the evidence or testimony at trial. Indeed, the prosecutor’s remarks about\ndefendant’s demeanor have no support in the record, because defendant did not place his\ncredibility at issue by testifying at trial. Cf. Lastarza, 203 A.3d at 1166 (where the prosecutor’s\nremarks “specifically addressed the defendant’s performance on the witness stand”). Nor did\ndefendant have an opportunity to refute the prosecutor’s allegation that defendant “stared her\ndown” as she was walking out of the courtroom. Moreover, the prosecutor’s statements were not\n“within the array of reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the facts presented at trial”;\nrather, the statements were based solely on the prosecutor’s own observations. Boillard, 789\nA.2d at 886. As a result, the prosecutor’s statements—which placed the purported conduct of\ndefendant before the jury without any evidentiary support—impacted defendant’s Fifth\nAmendment right not to testify at trial and may have influenced the jury’s verdict. Additionally,\nthe context in which the remarks were made is notable because the prosecutor’s comments struck\nat the heart of the defense’s theory at trial—that the alleged assault was an accident. The\nprosecutor pointed to defendant’s courtroom demeanor as evidence that defendant’s actions were\nnot accidental or mistaken. This is simply not allowed.', 'We are of the opinion that the prosecutor’s statements exceeded the “considerable\nlatitude” he was allowed because his statements were not based on evidence or testimony\nadduced at trial, were extraneous to the issues in the case, and had the potential for unfair\nprejudice. Lastarza, 203 A.3d at 1166. We are also satisfied that a curative instruction could not', '- 11 -\novercome the prejudice in this case. Thus, we conclude that the trial justice erred in denying\ndefendant’s motion to pass the case.', 'Rule 404(b) Evidence', 'After the police raid and child pornography investigation, defendant was charged with\none count of possession of child pornography. On May 9, 2016, he entered a plea of nolo\ncontendere to that charge and received a four-year suspended sentence.', 'Before the trial in the present case, defendant filed motions in limine to preclude the state\nfrom introducing evidence or testimony concerning the child pornography case against defendant\nin accordance with Rule 403, Rule 404, and Rule 609 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence\nand, further, to preclude the state from introducing the statements made by defendant to Det.\nPetit in the course of the child pornography investigation. The state countered that statements\nmade by the accused were admissible because they were admissions, and that the child\npornography evidence was admissible under Rule 404(b) to establish intent, absence of mistake,\nand defendant’s lewd disposition toward Veronica. The trial justice ruled that defendant’s prior\nconviction of possession of child pornography was admissible to show intent under Rule 404(b),\nbut reserved ruling on the remaining evidence in defendant’s motions in limine.', 'The parties thereafter filed a written stipulation concerning defendant’s plea of nolo\ncontendere to the possession of child pornography charge. During trial, the trial justice read the\nstipulation to the jury:', '“So the stipulation is: ‘The parties hereby stipulate to the', 'following:', '“‘(1.) That on May 9, 2016, Henry Bozzo before a justice', 'of the Superior Court pled nolo contendere to one count of', 'possession of child pornography and was sentenced to four years', 'suspended sentence and four years of probation with specific', 'conditions of the sentence and probation.’', '- 12 -', '“It also states, ‘Agreed to by the parties on 10/26/16,’ and', 'it’s signed by both the [s]tate and the defense attorneys. Also', 'attached to that stipulation is a document referred to as a judgment', 'of conviction and commitment, which basically just goes through', 'what I read to you here.”\nThe trial justice then instructed the jury to consider the stipulated evidence only for determining\nthe element of intent. The instruction was as follows:', '“Now, in certain cases the jury is allowed to hear and consider', '[evidence] about a prior conviction of the defendant on trial, but I', 'specifically inform you that you cannot use the fact that someone', 'was convicted on a prior occasion as evidence of what we call', 'propensity, and what that basically means is for the jury to say', 'because someone did something one time, they m[u]st have done it', 'this time as well. So you cannot use it for that purpose. However,', 'the law does allow the jury to use it to make certain determinations', 'in the case. In this case the jury is going to need to determine what', 'is referred to as intent. Intent to commit a crime or intent to', 'commit the acts charged. The jury is permitted to take this into', 'consideration when making their determination in terms of', 'intent[.]”', 'Later at trial, Det. Petit gave lengthy testimony about the child pornography\ninvestigation, including the statements made by defendant and the nature of the evidence\nobtained in the course of the investigation. Detective Petit testified that, at the time of the assault\non Veronica, he was assigned to the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force (ICAC), an\nagency made up of local, state, and federal law-enforcement officers charged with investigating\ncrimes against children. He then described how the ICAC investigates child pornography cases.', 'At that point, the trial justice called the parties to sidebar. The defendant objected to the\nadmission of any child pornography evidence, stating:', '“We want to have excluded the fact of exactly that it was not the', 'nature of a video that was found on Mr. Bozzo’s computer. We', 'stipulated to the fact that he admitted to possessing child', 'pornography, but we never said what that child pornography was.”\nThe trial justice disagreed and ruled that the evidence was admissible under Rule 404.', '- 13 -', 'The state proceeded to present detailed and highly prejudicial testimony about this\nunrelated case. Detective Petit indicated that the ICAC received four tips about a certain IP\naddress that was linked to child pornography, and that they determined that the IP address was\nlinked to defendant, which led to the search of defendant’s residence on September 2, 2015.2\nDetective Petit testified that the first interview of defendant occurred at his home after his arrest.\nDetective Petit then discussed the statements about child pornography made by defendant during\nthat interview.

At trial, Officer Lorince identified defendant as\nthe individual who exited from the driver’s side, and he stated that he later learned that the\nindividual who exited from the passenger’s side was Mr. Sajous. It was Officer Lorince’s\ntestimony that, as Mr. Sajous exited the Maxima, he “was holding his waist like he was holding\nsomething or his pants were going to fall off when he ran.”2 Officer Lorince testified that he\nthen pursued both individuals on foot and that, assisted by additional officers who had responded\nto the scene, he apprehended them in the parking lot of a nearby Marriott Hotel. Officer Lorince\nfurther testified that, after the two individuals were arrested, the police found a firearm in a trash\ncan which Officer Lorince had seen Mr. Sajous run past during the chase; he acknowledged,\nhowever, that he had not seen defendant pass that same trash can while he was being chased.\n2', 'The testimony of Providence Police Officer Donald Castigliego with respect to what\noccurred on the evening of May 2, 2011 was largely consistent with that of Officer Lorince.\nNotably, Officer Castigliego testified that, as Mr. Sajous was exiting the vehicle, “he was\nclutching his waist as if he was concealing something;” Officer Castigliego added that, based on\nhis training and experience, he believed that the “something” could be a “firearm or a weapon.”', '-3-', 'B', 'The Testimony of Det.

It was Ms. Perou’s further\ntestimony that defendant then asked her if she could “get [him] one” because, as he informed her,\nhe would not be able to obtain a gun permit due to a previous arrest. She stated that she assented\nto defendant’s suggestion that she use her permit to purchase a gun and have it “transfer[red] to\nhis name.”', 'Ms. Perou testified that, later that same day (May 2), she drove defendant to the\nWoonsocket gun store called Bullseye.

Ms. Perou testified that she then tried calling defendant by\nphone but that she was not able to reach him until later that day, at which point he assured her\nthat nothing would happen with her gun.

Ms. Perou further testified at trial that, after becoming somewhat “scared” when the ATF\nagents told her that they thought she was lying to them and that, if she was lying, they would\ncharge her with a crime, she gave a second recorded statement; in that statement she told the\nATF agents that her gun could have been stolen by defendant, by “Beans,” or by a third man who\nwore “braids”—in view of the fact that all three of them had been at her home for a party in\nApril.

The record indicates that the trial justice first properly\nconsidered the evidence in light of the jury charge. Moving next to the second step, the trial\njustice proceeded to independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the\nevidence. With respect to the credibility of Ms. Perou, the trial justice stated as follows:', '“I recognize that Miss Perou [gave] inconsistent statements, but', 'I’m satisfied that as she went through the testimony, she did', 'explain why they were inconsistent, and when she got to the', 'bottom line, it was clear to me, as a front-row observer, of', 'watching her and listening to her, that her inconsistent statements', 'were really borne [sic] of a concern for her own situation with', 'immigration or with the ATF. She didn’t want to get herself in', 'trouble. She obviously didn’t want to get [defendant] in trouble', 'either, at least not at first.”', '- 10 -\nIn contrast, the trial justice found Mr. Connolly to be an “overearnest witness looking too hard to\nplease law enforcement, particularly the ATF.” The trial justice further found that Ms. Perou’s\ntestimony “reflected * * * defendant’s clear desire to get his hands on a handgun,” and he stated\nthat he had “no difficulty in accepting her rendition that it was [defendant] who had [her] gun\nand introduced that gun into the vehicle that night.” Based on the evidence presented at trial, it\nwas the opinion of the trial justice that a fair inference could be drawn that, when defendant\nentered the vehicle, he had sole possession of the firearm at issue in this case; and, although he\nnoted that, “at one point, [Mr.] Sajous picked it up and used it,” he found that “the gun was\nshared by both of them that night.” The trial justice then concluded, pursuant to the third step in\nthe analytical process, that he would have reached the same result as the jury, stating:', '“I’m well satisfied that * * * defendant was properly convicted', 'beyond a reasonable doubt of unlawfully carrying a firearm in a', 'motor vehicle without a duly-issued license or permit * * * .”\nAccordingly, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial with respect to that\ncharge. See State v. Guerra, 12 A.3d 759, 765 (R.I. 2011) (stating that if, after conducting the\nrequired three-step analysis, the trial justice agrees with the jury’s verdict, “then the inquiry is at\nan end and the motion for a new trial should be denied”).', 'The defendant contends that, without the testimony of Ms. Perou, whose testimony he\nasserts was lacking in credibility, “[t]here was absolutely no evidence of any statements or\nconversations which indicated [that the defendant had actual possession of the gun or] that [he]\nwas aware that [Mr.] Sajous possessed a gun prior to [Mr.] Sajous’ discharge of the weapon.”\nAfter a careful review of the record in this case, it is clear to us that the defendant’s contention\non appeal amounts to nothing more than a disagreement with the trial justice’s assessment of the\ncredibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence. See State v. Gonzalez, 56 A.3d 96,', '- 11 -\n103 (R.I. 2012) (stating that “[t]he mere fact that [a] defendant disagrees with the trial justice’s\nconclusions about credibility is not a sufficient basis to warrant the granting of a motion for new\ntrial”) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Clay, 79 A.3d at 842; State v. Ferreira, 21\nA.3d 355, 367 (R.I. 2011). The trial justice recognized that Ms. Perou had given inconsistent\nstatements to the police and the ATF; however, he was satisfied by her explanation as to why she\nhad done so, and he ultimately chose to accept her in-court testimony with respect to the events\nof May 2, 2011. We have stated on more than one occasion that “the presence of some\ninconsistencies between or among utterances of a witness or witnesses at different points in time\ndoes not ipso facto render the testimony unworthy of belief.” State v. Jensen, 40 A.3d 771, 781\n(R.I. 2012); see also Rosario, 35 A.3d at 948-49. We are unable to conclude that the trial justice\noverlooked or misconceived material evidence or was clearly wrong in crediting Ms. Perou’s\ntestimony that the defendant had taken her handgun. See Paola, 59 A.3d at 106 (“[T]his Court\naffords a great deal of respect to the factual determinations and credibility assessments made by\nthe judicial officer who has actually observed the human drama that is part and parcel of every\ntrial and who has had an opportunity to appraise witness demeanor and to take into account other\nrealities that cannot be grasped from a reading of a cold record.”) (internal quotation marks\nomitted); see also State v.

The defendant was tried by a jury over three consecutive days in March', '-1-\nand April 2014 in the Providence County Superior Court. The state presented six witnesses;\ntheir pertinent testimony and the evidence admitted at trial are summarized below.', 'In June 2011, Michael Naylor was a detective with a local Drug Enforcement Agency\n(DEA) task force. Sergeant Naylor 1 testified that, during May and June 2011, he conducted\nsurveillance of an apartment building located on First Avenue in East Greenwich. Sergeant\nNaylor testified that, on June 1, 2011, he observed a “Hispanic male arrive in a gold Acura,”\nenter the specific apartment under surveillance, “stay[] for awhile,” and then exit the apartment\nwith a female who had been the target of the surveillance at that apartment. Sergeant Naylor\nidentified defendant as the Hispanic male whom he had seen at the apartment building on First\nAvenue on June 1, 2011. However, Sgt. Naylor also testified that, on June 1, 2011, he had not\nknown defendant’s identity. To ascertain the identity of the Hispanic male he had observed at\nthe East Greenwich apartment building, Sgt. Naylor testified, he had “requested that one of the\nEast Greenwich police officers stop the vehicle and identify the driver.” Sergeant Naylor\nadmitted that defendant’s vehicle was subsequently pulled over using a “pretext stop” for the\nsole purpose of ascertaining defendant’s identity. He further testified that he subsequently\nconfirmed that the gold Acura was registered to defendant and that defendant owned residential\nproperty located on Montgomery Avenue in Providence (the target property). Sergeant Naylor\nalso testified that, from May 18, 2011, through June 2011, he observed defendant at the East\nGreenwich property approximately fifteen times and that he was in contact with detectives from\nthe Cranston Police Department during the surveillance operations conducted in June 2011.\nSergeant Naylor also testified that the female target of the East Greenwich apartment’s\nsurveillance drove a Nissan Maxima.\n1', 'At the time of the trial, Sgt. Naylor was working as a police sergeant with the patrol division of\nthe Newport Police Department.', '-2-', 'Warren Henseler, a detective in the special investigations unit of the Cranston Police\nDepartment and a member of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s “Safe Streets Violent Crimes\nTask Force,” testified that, in June 2011, he was investigating the distribution of cocaine in the\ncity of Providence.', 'On June 3, 2011, based on information received from a confidential\ninformant (CI), Det. Henseler conducted undercover surveillance of the target property.\nDetective Henseler testified that, during the surveillance, he saw an individual known to him as\nMichael White exit a vehicle that was driven by the CI and parked near the target property.\nDetective Henseler saw White meet with defendant in front of the house, walk up the driveway\ntowards the house, then disappear from his view for approximately five minutes before both men\nreturned to the detective’s line of vision. Detective Henseler further testified that he then saw\nWhite depart in the vehicle driven by the CI and defendant remain at the target property.\nDetective Henseler testified that he had seen defendant and White walk and talk only, and that he\nhad not observed an actual transaction for the sale of drugs. When the vehicle with the CI and\nWhite drove away from the target property, Det. Henseler followed it to the City of Warwick.\nDetective Henseler testified that White was dropped off at a residence and that he continued\nfollowing the CI’s vehicle to the DEA’s office in Providence.', 'Ronald Fuoroli, a detective in the narcotics unit of the Cranston Police Department,\ntestified regarding his undercover surveillance of the target property on June 23, 2011. Detective\nFuoroli testified that he saw defendant arrive at the target property in a gold Acura, park across\nthe street, and walk up the driveway towards the house with a cooler on his shoulder. Detective\nFuoroli further testified that he saw defendant leave the target property half an hour later in the\nsame vehicle, then return to the target property approximately five minutes later. Detective\nFuoroli then saw defendant exit the gold Acura and meet up with White—who had arrived in a', '-3-\nvehicle driven by a CI shortly before defendant returned. The two men met on the street, then\nproceeded to walk together up the driveway of the target property towards the house. Detective\nFuoroli lost sight of the two men for “two to three minutes” before White reappeared into his\nview and White and the CI drove away. After White and the CI drove away, Det. Fuoroli\nobserved defendant departing in the gold Acura. Detective Fuoroli further testified that he\nfollowed the gold Acura and he saw the vehicle pull over to the side of a road where he met with\nsomeone in “either a green or gray Maxima.”', 'Kevin Antonucci, a detective sergeant and commanding officer of the narcotics unit with\nthe Cranston Police Department, testified about the execution of a search warrant for the target\nproperty on June 29, 2011. Detective Antonucci testified that he was one of the law-enforcement\nofficers who had conducted the search of the master bedroom in the residence. From the master\nbedroom, Det. Antonucci seized a passport issued by the Dominican Republic to defendant, bank\nstatements with defendant’s name and address, and a digital scale. From a dresser drawer, Det.\nAntonucci seized “nine clear plastic bags containing what [he] believed to be cocaine” as well as\n“some empty bags.” Detective Antonucci also seized a “large machete-type knife” from under\nthe bed. He further testified that he turned over all of the items seized to Det. Juan Robles of the\nProvidence Police Department, who, according to Det. Antonucci, served as the “evidence\ncustodian” during the execution of the search warrant. Although Det. Antonucci testified that he\nhad searched for physical evidence or records of sale, he stated that he had not found any\nevidence of the actual sale of illegal substances such as ledgers or receipts.', 'Juan Robles, a police officer with the Providence Police Department’s narcotics unit and\npart-time member of the DEA’s task force, testified that he was also present on June 29, 2011,\nduring the execution of the search warrant at the target property. Officer Robles testified that his', '-4-\nrole during the execution of the search warrant was to “keep[] an eye on everybody while the\nsearch was being done, and at the same time try[] to speak with [defendant].” Officer Robles\nfurther testified that he observed a detective conduct a search of defendant’s person and seize\nnarcotics from defendant’s pocket. One of the bags seized from defendant’s pocket contained a\nstraw within it. Officer Robles also testified that he performed a chemical field test on the\nnarcotics seized from defendant’s pocket and that the test result was positive for cocaine.', 'Michael Liberto, a principal forensic chemist at the Rhode Island Department of Health\nForensic Drug Chemistry Laboratory, was the last witness to testify. Mr. Liberto was qualified\nto testify as an expert witness in the field of narcotics analysis and identification. He testified\nthat the Providence Police Department had submitted a total of fourteen bags of suspected\nnarcotics in July 2011 and that the suspected narcotics had tested positive for cocaine salts. Mr.\nLiberto further testified that the combined weight of the cocaine salts that he received from the\nProvidence Police Department for testing totaled 33.43 grams.', 'At the close of the state’s evidence, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on the\nbasis that there was insufficient evidence of defendant’s intent to deliver. After the trial justice\nsummarized the evidence presented by the state for each of the elements required to prove the\ncharge of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, the trial justice denied\ndefendant’s motion, concluding that there was “sufficient evidence which a jury could find the\n[s]tate proved the four elements of this offense.” The trial justice then heard defendant’s\nobjection to the state’s previously submitted request to include “simple possession of cocaine” as\na lesser-included offense in the instructions to the jury. The defendant objected to instructing the\njury on this lesser-included offense because he had not anticipated the state’s request during his\npreparation for trial and had focused his defense strategy on the sufficiency of the evidence', '-5-\nregarding the intent element of the offense charged. The trial justice acknowledged defendant’s\nchosen trial strategy and denied the state’s request.', 'The jury returned a guilty verdict on April 2, 2014, on the one charge of possession of\ncocaine with the intent to deliver it. On May 22, 2014, the trial justice sentenced defendant to\nfifteen years’ imprisonment with five years to serve and ten years suspended, with probation, as\nwell as drug abuse treatment, 200 hours of community service and a $5,000 fine.

Discussion', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice erred by denying his motion for judgment of\nacquittal at the close of the state’s evidence because the state failed to present sufficient evidence\nof defendant’s intent to deliver. The defendant was convicted of violating G.L. 1956 § 21-28-\n4.01(a)(1), which states in pertinent part that “it shall be unlawful for any person to * * * possess\nwith intent to * * * deliver a controlled substance.” We have previously stated that, pursuant to\nthis statute, an individual is guilty of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver\nwhen the state proves beyond a reasonable doubt that “a defendant was in possession of drugs,\nhad the requisite control over them, and intended to deliver the drugs to others.” State v.\nOliveira, 882 A.2d 1097, 1112 (R.I. 2005) (quoting State v. Williams, 656 A.2d 975, 978 (R.I.\n1995)). Since defendant’s appeal from the denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal is\nbased solely on his assertion that the state provided insufficient evidence of the intent element of\nthe crime charged, we will limit our review of the evidence to that from which a jury could have\ninferred that defendant intended to deliver the cocaine found in his possession. See Rolon, 45\nA.3d at 524.', 'With respect to the intent element of defendant’s charge, we have previously held that a\njury may “infer an intent to deliver illegal narcotics solely on the basis of the amount of the drugs\nfound.” State v. Rodriguez, 10 A.3d 431, 435 (R.I. 2010) (quoting Williams, 656 A.2d at 978).\nNevertheless, we have also deemed 34.5 grams of cocaine, without any other evidence of intent\nto deliver, such as scales or packaging materials, to be insufficient to sustain a conviction for', '-7-\npossession with intent to deliver. State v. Eiseman, 461 A.2d 369, 381, 383 (R.I. 1983),\nabrogated on other grounds by, Horton v. California, 496 U.S. 128 (1990). “By so holding,\nhowever, we in no way intimate[d] that possession of a large amount of a controlled substance\nmay not suffice to justify an inference of intent to deliver beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id. at 383.', 'We also bear in mind that “circumstantial and direct evidence should be given equal\nweight.” State v. Brown, 9 A.3d 1232, 1237 (R.I. 2010) (quoting State v. Wilshire, 509 A.2d\n444, 452 (R.I. 1986)). Accordingly, we have held that, when “police conducted surveillance of\n[a] defendant and observed individuals arriving at [the] defendant’s apartment, staying for a few\nmoments, and then leaving,” “were aware that neighbors had complained about visitors coming\nand going from the apartment at all hours,” and had “two confidential informants [telling them]\nthat [the] defendant was selling crack cocaine at his apartment,” “combined with [thirty-seven]\nindividually wrapped cocaine packets seized from the defendant’s apartment,” there was\nsufficient evidence to withstand a motion to dismiss for lack of probable cause on a charge for\npossession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver. State v. Reed, 764 A.2d 144, 147 (R.I.\n2001).', 'Here, five law enforcement officers who were directly involved in the investigation of\ndefendant and one expert in the field of narcotics analysis and identification testified during the\ntrial. Two of the law enforcement officers testified to observing defendant meeting with the\nsame individual on two separate days outside of defendant’s residence and then disappearing\nfrom view for only a few minutes before that individual departed. One of the law enforcement\nofficers testified that, on approximately fifteen occasions in less than a two-month period, he had\nobserved defendant visiting an apartment in East Greenwich that had been under investigation\nfor selling narcotics. In addition, the exhibits presented at trial included a digital scale, nine clear', '-8-\nplastic bags containing cocaine and some empty clear plastic bags that had been seized from\ndefendant’s bedroom during the execution of the search warrant at defendant’s residence. The\nstate also presented a bag of cocaine with a straw inside that had been seized from defendant’s\npocket during the search of his house as an exhibit. The expert witness testified that the\nsubstances submitted to the state laboratory all tested positive for cocaine salts. Based on the\nexpert witness’s testimony regarding the weight of cocaine that had been seized from both\ndefendant’s person and from his dresser drawer during the execution of the search warrant and\nsubsequently submitted for testing, the total weight of cocaine seized during the search on June\n29, 2011 was 33.43 grams. According to testimony from Det. Antonucci that one gram of\ncocaine had an estimated street value of $100, approximately $3,300 worth of cocaine was seized\nfrom defendant and his residence during the search.', 'Reviewing all of the testimony and considering the direct and circumstantial evidence in\nthe light most favorable to the state, giving full credibility to the state’s witnesses, and drawing\nall reasonable inferences consistent with guilt, we conclude that the state presented sufficient\nevidence from which a reasonable juror could find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant\nintended to deliver the cocaine.

On appeal, the defendant contends that he is entitled to a new trial\nbecause the trial justice committed what the defendant submits were three evidentiary errors—\ntwo of which relate to the admissibility of certain testimony, and one of which relates to the trial\njustice’s having allowed a specific line of questioning by the prosecution as to whether the\ndefendant’s wife had contacted the alleged victim or his family.', 'This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to\nappear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided.\nAfter considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we\nconclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further', '-1-\nbriefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the\nSuperior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On May 1, 2015, the state filed a criminal information charging defendant with one count\nof second-degree sexual assault in violation of §§ 11-37-4 and 11-37-5. In due course, a jury\ntrial was held in Kent County Superior Court over three days from October 17 through October\n19, 2016. We summarize below the salient aspects of what transpired at that trial.', 'A', 'The Testimony of the Complaining Witness', 'The complaining witness, Jacob,1 testified that, on February 2, 2015, he and his mother\nwere driving home when they saw defendant, their neighbor, shoveling snow in his driveway.\nJacob stated that he got out of the car to assist his neighbor in clearing the snow. Having been\nneighbors for a few months, Jacob and defendant knew each other. Jacob was then fifteen years\nold, and defendant was in his mid-seventies. It was further Jacob’s testimony that, after the two\nfinished shoveling the snow, they both entered the shed located in defendant’s backyard so that\nJacob could return the shovel which he had been using. According to Jacob, once they were both\ninside the shed, defendant shook Jacob’s hand and then “pulled [him] into a * * * two-handed\nhug * * * and kissed” his cheek. Jacob testified that defendant then asked “if he was moving too\nfast” and that, when Jacob said no, defendant told him that “he knew how [they] felt about each\nother.” Jacob further testified that he had said no when defendant asked “if he was moving too\n1', 'In order to respect the privacy of the complaining witness and that of his family, we refer\nto the complaining witness pseudonymously as “Jacob.”', '-2-\nfast” because defendant had “recently” told Jacob that “his son had died and [Jacob] reminded\nhim of his son, so [Jacob] thought he kissed [him] seeing [him] as a son figure.”', 'Jacob proceeded to testify that defendant then “cupped [Jacob’s] penis with his hand”\nover Jacob’s jeans for five to seven seconds. According to Jacob, as defendant was acting in that\nmanner, defendant asked if it felt good, to which Jacob responded in the negative. After the two\nof them left the shed, defendant asked for Jacob’s cell phone number, which Jacob gave him.\nJacob testified that he then returned home, told his parents what had happened, and they went to\nthe police station to give a statement.', 'During his cross-examination of Jacob, defense counsel asked him: “Now, did you seek\nprofessional help for any reaction that you might have had?” The prosecutor objected, the trial\njustice sustained the objection, and defense counsel immediately requested a sidebar, which was\ngranted.', 'At sidebar, the trial justice asked defense counsel: “How is that relevant to the\nelements?” Defense counsel responded:', '“Part of the discovery was whether he had gone for counseling and', 'I was provided the name of a counselor that he went too [sic]. I', 'got my notes, like one page. I just wanted to make sure I have all', 'the correct information. It’s important whether he was telling the', 'truth and whether he gave the correct information to the', 'prosecutor. I just wanted the name.”\nThe trial justice then asked defense counsel: “Do you want to ask him questions before the jury\nto make sure there’s [sic] no other medical providers[?]” Defense counsel responded: “I want to\nmake sure there is no other person that he saw for counseling. That’s all. I believe they asked\nhim and his family.” In response, the trial justice said: “That was something under the rules you', '-3-\ncould have even compelled at deposition if you wanted to under the criminal rule. The Court\nwill not allow that to play out in front of the jury.”2', 'B', 'The Testimony of Defendant', 'The defendant testified that, while he and Jacob were in the shed, defendant “gave him a\nhug” with “[j]ust [his] left arm” because elevating his right arm “hurt so much from days of\nshoveling that it was hard to pick it up.” He further testified that his right hand “must have\ntotally by accident brushed against [Jacob].” Also, referring to the hug, he testified that he asked\nJacob if he liked it. He testified that he did not kiss Jacob on the cheek or ask him if he was\nmoving too fast.', 'C', 'The Testimony of Defendant’s Wife', 'In her testimony, defendant’s wife, Johanna MacNeil, indicated that, at her husband’s\nrequest, she had given him money to pay Jacob for having assisted with the snow shoveling and\nthat she told her husband to ask Jacob for his phone number in case they might need help again.\nIn the course of his cross-examination of Mrs. MacNeil, the prosecutor asked her if she ever tried\nto go to speak to Jacob or his parents after February 2, 2015. She responded that she had not\n2', 'In the course of pretrial discovery, defense counsel had, on March 28, 2016, filed a\nmotion seeking to compel the prosecution to provide the name and address of the counselor\nwhom the prosecution previously disclosed Jacob had seen. Defense counsel sought this\ninformation through the motion to compel because, when the state had previously provided the\nrequested information to defendant, “the name and address of the counselor that the alleged\nvictim has seen as noted” was “illegible.” The state complied with the motion to compel on\nApril 11, 2016. On April 18, 2016, the trial justice additionally granted defense counsel’s oral\nmotion to issue a subpoena to that counselor and ordered that the counseling records be\nreturnable on April 27, 2016 for an in camera review by the court. However, the record\nindicates that defense counsel did not pursue the matter further before trial, which began six\nmonths later.', '-4-\ndone so and that the MacNeils had been “told not to have any contact” with Jacob and that she\n“assumed [they] were not allowed to” talk to his parents. The prosecutor then asked: “You live\nacross from an elementary school; correct?” Mrs. MacNeil responded, “On the side.” Defense\ncounsel then objected on relevance grounds, and the trial justice overruled the objection, noting\nthat the fact of the proximity of the elementary school was already in evidence.3', 'D', 'The Verdict', 'On October 19, 2016, the jury returned a guilty verdict, and Mr. MacNeil filed a timely\nnotice of appeal.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court accords great “latitude to a trial justice’s rulings made during examination of\nwitnesses at trial.” State v. Vargas, 991 A.2d 1056, 1060 (R.I. 2010) (internal quotation marks\nomitted). We will “overturn such rulings only when there has been an abuse of discretion or\nsubstantial injury to a defendant.” Id. at 1062 (internal quotation marks omitted). The scope of\ncross-examination is subject to the exercise of the trial justice’s sound discretion. State v.\nAnthony, 422 A.2d 921, 924 (R.I. 1980); see also State v. Husband, 162 A.3d 646, 655 (R.I.\n2017) (“[I]t is well settled that [this Court] review[s] a trial justice’s decision admitting or\nexcluding evidence under an abuse of discretion standard.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nHowever, “the exercise of this discretion must not unduly restrict a defendant’s right to cross-\nexamine. It is the essence of a fair trial that reasonable latitude be given the cross-examiner.”\n3', 'In the course of his testimony on the first day of the trial, Jacob indicated that there was\nan “[e]lementary school about a house away from him” in response to a question asking him to\ndescribe defendant’s neighborhood.', '-5-\nAnthony, 422 A.2d at 924. As we noted in State v. Lomba, 37 A.3d 615 (R.I. 2012), “[a] trial\njustice’s exercise of discretion to limit the scope of cross-examination is not reviewable except\nfor clear abuse, and only if it constitutes prejudicial error.” Lomba, 37 A.3d at 621 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).', 'III', 'Analysis', 'The defendant raises three arguments on appeal—viz., that the trial justice erred: (1) in\nsustaining the prosecutor’s objection to defense counsel’s question to Jacob as to whether he had\nsought “professional help for any reaction” that he may have had to the events at issue in this\ncase; (2) in not striking Mrs. MacNeil’s response to the prosecutor’s questions about contacting\nJacob or his family; and (3) in overruling the defense’s objection to Mrs. MacNeil’s testimony\nthat she and defendant lived on the side of an elementary school. We address each argument in\nturn.', 'A', 'Defense Counsel’s Cross-Examination of Jacob', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice erred in sustaining the prosecutor’s objection to\ndefense counsel’s question to Jacob as to whether he sought professional help after the events at\nissue in this case. The relevant portion of the trial transcript reads as follows:', '“[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] Now, did you seek professional help for', 'any reaction that you might have had?', '“[COUNSEL FOR THE STATE]: Objection, Judge.', '“THE COURT: Sustained.', '“[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: May we approach, Judge?', '“THE COURT: Absolutely.

The Court will not allow that to play out in front of', 'the jury.', '“(The sidebar was concluded.)” (Emphasis added.)', 'The defendant now asserts that the trial justice improperly sustained the state’s objection\nunder the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure and that the error was unduly prejudicial.\nHe argues that his attorney posed the question in order to challenge Jacob’s credibility and that\nthe trial justice’s ruling was incorrectly based on the trial justice’s view that counsel could have\nobtained that information by taking a deposition of Jacob. We note initially that defendant is\ncorrect in contending that the trial justice erred in stating that defense counsel could have taken a', '-7-\ndeposition of Jacob before trial.4', 'However, after careful review of the record, we have\ndetermined that this error was not prejudicial.', 'We have stated that “[i]nquiries that are potentially misleading or irrelevant, that offer\nlittle or no probative value, or that exceed the scope of the direct examination are objectionable,\nand may be restricted by the trial justice.” State v. Porter, 179 A.3d 1218, 1228-29 (R.I. 2018)\n(internal quotation marks omitted). In Porter, this Court affirmed a trial justice’s decision to\nlimit the scope of cross-examination during a trial for second-degree murder when “defendant\ncould not point to even a scintilla of evidence” that there was a possibility of an unknown second\nassailant and weapon. Porter, 179 A.3d at 1229; see State v. Alston, 47 A.3d 234, 249 (R.I.\n2012) (holding that “when the state objected to defendant’s question, defendant did not make any\noffer of proof that the examination he intended to embark upon could lead to relevant evidence”\nand that, therefore, the trial justice did not commit prejudicial error in limiting defendant’s cross-\nexamination of a witness); see also State v. Brown, 709 A.2d 465, 474 (R.I. 1998).', 'In the instant case, defense counsel acknowledged at sidebar that he had received from\nthe state before trial the name of one counselor from whom Jacob had sought treatment and\nstated that he “just wanted to make sure [he had] all the correct information * * *. [He] just\nwanted the name.” Defense counsel further stated that he “want[ed] to make sure there [was] no\nother person that he saw for counseling. That’s all.” There is no indication, either in the record\nor in defendant’s presentation before this Court, that the state improperly withheld from defense\ncounsel the names of any additional counselors from whom Jacob may have sought treatment, or\n4', 'A deposition would not have been appropriate because there had been no indication that\nJacob would be unavailable to testify at trial. See Super. R. Crim. P. 15. However, defendant\ncould have sought to compel further discovery before trial regarding additional counseling Jacob\nmay have sought if he believed that the state had withheld pertinent evidence. See Super. R.\nCrim. P. 16.', '-8-\nthat Jacob withheld the names of any such counselors from the state. Allowing defense counsel\nto question Jacob in this manner would have constituted an inquiry that was irrelevant and\noffered little probative value. See Porter, 179 A.3d at 1228-29. Therefore, the trial justice’s\nruling is not reversible; he did not allow further investigation to occur in the middle of a cross-\nexamination, a decision entirely within his discretion. See State v. Lynch, 770 A.2d 840, 847\n(R.I. 2001) (stating that “this Court can affirm the judgment of the Superior Court on grounds not\nactually relied upon by the trial court to justify its ruling”); cf. Chiaradio v. Falck, 794 A.2d 494,\n497 (R.I. 2002) (holding in a civil case that “[t]he trial justice should have rebuffed the\ndefendant’s midtrial attempt to resume discovery”). Accordingly, we perceive no reversible\nerror in the trial justice’s evidentiary ruling regarding defense counsel’s questioning of Jacob\nwith respect to professional counseling he may have received.', 'B', 'Mrs. MacNeil’s Testimony Regarding Not Contacting the Victim or His Parents', 'The defendant also argues on appeal that the trial justice erred in allowing the prosecutor\nto ask Mrs. MacNeil: “[A]fter this incident occurred * * * did you ever go down to talk to\n[Jacob]? * * * Did you go down to find out what had happened? * * * Did you talk to his\nparents?” The defendant contends that those questions were “totally irrelevant to the issue of the\ndefendant’s guilt,” citing Rule 401 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence; and he further argues\nthat the questions “gave rise to an inference of [d]efendant’s guilt.”', 'This Court need not address either of those arguments, because defense counsel did not\ntimely object to this line of questioning at trial. See State v. Pona, 66 A.3d 454, 468-69 (R.I.\n2013). In Pona, this Court held that “[a]ccording to our well settled raise or waive rule, if an', '-9-\nissue was not preserved by specific objection at trial, then it may not be considered on appeal.”\nPona, 66 A.3d at 468 (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'The prosecutor asked Mrs. MacNeil three questions about contacting the victim and his\nparents, and Mrs. MacNeil answered each one with no objection by the defense:', '“[COUNSEL FOR THE STATE:] * * * So after this incident', 'occurred on February 2nd * * * did you ever go down to talk to', '[Jacob]?', '“[MRS.

MACNEIL:] On the side.', '“[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection, relevance.”\nIt was not until after the prosecutor asked Mrs. MacNeil about living across from an elementary\nschool that defense counsel objected. Because he did not timely object to the questions as to\nwhether she had attempted to contact Jacob or his parents at trial, defendant may not raise an\nobjection to them now on appeal.5 See Pona, 66 A.3d at 468, 469; State v. Bido, 941 A.2d 822,\n5', 'It is true that there is a narrow exception to the “raise-or-waive” rule where the alleged\nerror is “more than harmless, and the exception * * * implicate[s] an issue of constitutional\ndimension derived from a novel rule of law that could not reasonably have been known to', '- 10 -\n828-29 (R.I. 2008); see also DeMarco v. Travelers Insurance Co., 26 A.3d 585, 628-29, 629\nn.55 (R.I. 2011).', 'C', 'Mrs. MacNeil’s Testimony Regarding the Nearby Elementary School', 'Lastly, defendant contends that the trial justice erred when he did not strike Mrs.\nMacNeil’s testimony that she and defendant lived near an elementary school; according to\ndefendant, that statement allowed for an improper inference of guilt. This issue is also waived;\nin In re Jazlyn P., 31 A.3d 1273 (R.I. 2011), we held that, “if the introduction of evidence is\nobjected to for a specific reason, other grounds for objection are waived and may not be raised\nfor the first time on appeal.” In re Jazlyn P., 31 A.3d at 1280-81 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). As noted above, at trial, the prosecutor asked Mr. MacNeil’s wife: “You live across\nfrom an elementary school; correct?” Mrs. MacNeil responded: “On the side.” Defense counsel\nobjected: “Objection, relevance.” The trial justice overruled the objection, stating: “It’s already\nin evidence. The answer will stand.” At trial, defendant raised a relevance objection to the\ntestimony, and the trial justice overruled it. He may not now raise an objection based on\nimproper inference.', 'In addition, the testimony that defendant and his wife lived near an elementary school\nhad already been admitted into evidence without objection before Mrs. MacNeil testified to that\nfact;6 therefore, the objection is unavailing. See State v. Brown, 9 A.3d 1240, 1245 (R.I. 2010)\n(holding that defense counsel’s later objection to testimony already in evidence was untimely\ncounsel at the time of trial.” State v. Breen, 767 A.2d 50, 57 (R.I. 2001). The instant case does\nnot fall within the parameters of that exception.\n6', 'During Jacob’s testimony on the first day of trial, when he was asked to describe the\nneighborhood in which he and defendant both lived, he stated that there was an elementary\nschool “about a house away from him.” See footnote 3, supra.', '- 11 -\nand therefore waived). At that point, defense counsel raised no objection. Therefore, the trial\njustice’s decision to overrule the objection during Mrs. MacNeil’s testimony three days later to\nthe same fact was proper because that fact was already in evidence and had not been previously\nobjected to.', 'Accordingly, we perceive no error on the part of the trial justice.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

The defendant complied with this order.', 'A hearing was held in Superior Court on June 6, 2013, on the appeal of the magistrate’s\ndecision denying defendant’s motion to reduce her restitution payments.

She then explained that the standard of review for this\nmatter was set forth in G.L. 1956 § 42-35-15, which was a “very deferential standard[] to the\ndecision of * * * the magistrate as to questions of fact.” The hearing justice further explained\nthat, under this limited standard of review, factual findings would be overturned if clearly\nerroneous, and issues of law would be reviewed de novo.', 'The defendant argued that the magistrate had erroneously concluded that she had\nsufficient assets, aside from her social security benefit, to pay $500 per month. The defendant\nalso reminded the court that her husband was not obligated to pay restitution and, therefore, that\nhis assets could not be counted toward defendant’s ability to make the required payments. The\nstate, for its part, argued that defendant had access to numerous assets that could be liquidated,\nand that she could easily reallocate some of the funds she was spending on unnecessary expenses\nin order to satisfy her restitution obligation.', 'The hearing justice began her bench decision by noting that defendant had borne the\nburden of proof in seeking to show that she was unable to make the $500 monthly payments, and\nthat she had “willfully failed to meet” this burden. Next, the hearing justice briefly summarized\nthe potential areas that could yield additional funds for the payment of restitution, including the\nfurs, the Highlander, insurance on the Highlander, cable television, life insurance, clothing,\nshoes, and charitable donations.', 'The hearing justice also noted that defendant had', '-6-\n“acknowledged being in possession of numerous items of jewelry,” and that “it was her burden\nto establish that that jewelry could not be sold and to establish the value and what amount of\nmoney could be yielded from that.”', 'Similarly, defendant had failed to account for the\nfurnishings inside her home. The hearing justice also noted that defendant had failed to provide\nany tax returns relating to years after 2007, which “further mudd[ied] the record” as to her\npotential assets. Accordingly, the hearing justice denied defendant’s appeal. She also vacated\nthe previously imposed stay and ordered defendant to pay the additional $1,000 pursuant to the\nmagistrate’s order. 13 Judgment reflecting the hearing justice’s decision was entered on October\n1, 2013, and defendant filed a timely appeal. 14', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'General Laws 1956 §§ 8-2-11.1(e) and 8-2-39(f) provide that final orders of the Superior\nCourt entered in a proceeding to review an order of a magistrate may be appealed to the Supreme\nCourt.

The state asserts that the magistrate and the hearing\njustice did not err in concluding that defendant had sufficient sources of income, aside from her\nsocial security benefit, to make $500 monthly restitution payments. The state also notes that\n“defendant’s continued expenditure of money to litigate the restitution obligations she incurred\nas a result of her [nolo contendere] plea would seemingly belie her claim that she worries\ncontinually about having money to feed herself and her husband.”', '-8-', 'We have previously held that a defendant who claims an inability to comply with a\nrestitution order bears the burden of proving that he or she has made sufficient efforts to acquire\nthe necessary funds.

When asked about these expenses and assets, she\nresponded elusively, at no time presenting the court with evidence that she had made a good-\nfaith effort to procure the additional $263 that was purportedly missing from her monthly budget.\nSimilarly, she now makes a vague claim that her husband is paying her monthly expenses, but\nshe has not supported this assertion with any evidence. Indeed, the financial statement upon\nwhich she relied below does not indicate how she is paying any of her enumerated expenses. 15\nAdditionally, she failed to provide the court with tax returns for any years after 2007, despite\nbeing instructed to do so on January 25, 2011; nor did she provide any documents to support the\nvarious expenses listed on her financial statement.

The defendant, Mark Ceppi, appeals from a judgment\nof conviction on one count of domestic felony assault, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2 and G.L.\n1956 § 12-29-5, and one count of domestic simple assault, pursuant to § 11-5-3 and § 12-29-5,\nwhich judgment was entered on August 5, 2010, following a jury-waived trial in the Newport\nCounty Superior Court. The defendant contends that the trial justice erred in denying his motion\nto dismiss a criminal information, which motion invoked Rule 9.1 of the Superior Court Rules of\nCriminal Procedure and G.L. 1956 § 12-12-1.7. The criminal information at issue contained two\ncounts, on both of which the defendant was eventually convicted; he posits that the criminal\ninformation package was not sufficient to establish probable cause for either of the two counts.\nHe further contends that the trial justice committed a number of evidentiary errors during the\ncourse of the trial. Those errors, according to the defendant, were as follows: (1) finding that\ncertain portions of the testimony of Newport Detective Christopher Hayes were not hearsay and\nallowing improper bolstering of the testimony of Heather King (the complaining witness) by the', '-1-\ntestimony of Det. Hayes; (2) improperly allowing questioning of the defendant with respect to an\nalleged past incident of violence involving his former wife; (3) impermissibly restricting the\ndefendant’s testimony with respect to Ms. King’s alleged intoxication; and (4) wrongly allowing\nStephanie Bacon, the complaining witness’s twin sister, to testify with respect to the complaining\nwitness’s injuries.', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the Superior Court’s judgment of\nconviction.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On October 6, 2009, defendant was charged by criminal information with domestic\nfelony assault, pursuant to § 11-5-2 and § 12-29-5 (Count One), and domestic simple assault,\npursuant to § 11-5-3 and § 12-29-5 (Count Two). Prior to trial, defendant filed a motion to\ndismiss the criminal information pursuant to Rule 9.1 and § 12-12-1.7, alleging that the criminal\ninformation package “failed to establish probable cause.” On May 19, 2010, a hearing was held\nin Superior Court, at the close of which the trial justice denied defendant’s motion to dismiss.1\nIn due course, a jury-waived trial was held over six days in July and August of 2010. We\nsummarize below the salient aspects of what transpired at trial.', 'A', 'The Testimony at Trial', '1.', 'The Testimony of the Complaining Witness', 'Heather King, the complaining witness, testified first at the trial. Ms. King testified that\nshe had dated defendant from “either the end of July, 2007 or very early August, 2007” until\n1', 'A more detailed discussion of the contents of the criminal information, the documents\nattached to it, and the hearing pertaining to the motion to dismiss is provided in Part II.A.1, infra.', '-2-\nMay 3, 2009. She further testified that she began living with defendant in January or February of\n2009. According to Ms. King’s testimony, “a couple of days before” March 17, 2009, she and\ndefendant had an argument; she did not recall what that particular argument was about, but she\nacknowledged that her arguments with defendant were “usually over jealousy or controlling\nissues.” It was her testimony that, during the course of the March 2009 argument, defendant\n“punched [her] twice in [her] rib cage.”2 She stated that she heard a “crack” when she was\npunched in the ribs, and she added that it was confirmed that she had fractured a rib when she\neventually had x-rays taken in “early May” of 2009. The March 2009 incident formed the basis\nof Count Two.', 'Ms. King next testified that, on May 2, 2009, she and defendant attended a charity event\nin Boston. It was her testimony that, during the drive home to their residence in Newport, they\n“pulled over” at a location “close to [Boston],” at which time they were arguing; she added that\ndefendant “hit [her] in the head” in the course of their argument. Ms. King stated that the next\nmorning (May 3, 2009), before defendant woke up, she deleted from his phone the name and\nphone number of a woman with whom defendant had been talking at the charity event which\nthey had attended the night before. It was her testimony that later that morning defendant asked\nif she had deleted “numbers from [his] phone” and that she replied in the affirmative. She\nfurther testified that, later that same day, after taking one of defendant’s sons out for breakfast,\nshe and defendant had a “conversation” about her deletion of the phone number. She stated that\n“at one point, [she] got upset, [and] walked away and into the bathroom” but that defendant\n“followed [her] into the bathroom,” “locked” the door, and “cornered” her. It was her testimony\nthat defendant “looked at [her] with these crazy eyes” and proceeded to “hit” her “in the\n2', 'Ms. King proceeded in her testimony to provide a very detailed account of the March\n2009 argument, which we need not narrate for the purposes of this appeal.', '-3-\nstomach, the arm, the leg, and then * * * [the] head;” she added that she was hit “five to seven”\ntimes and that afterwards she felt as though her head was “going to explode.” It was this second\nincident which formed the basis of Count One.', 'According to Ms. King’s testimony, after the May 3 assault, she felt lethargic and was\njust “lying in bed” “all day long;” she added, however, that the May 3 incident prompted her to\ndecide to leave defendant.3 With respect to her injuries, it was her testimony that the symptoms\nworsened and that, on May 9, 2009, she “woke up, and * * * couldn’t lift [her] head up,” at\nwhich time she went to Newport Hospital. She stated that personnel at Newport Hospital\nindicated that she had a “brain bleed;” she further stated that she was also told by personnel at\nNewport Hospital that she was “lucky to be alive” since most people with “the size of [her]\nhematoma * * * die within twenty-four hours of that injury.” Ms. King added that she was told\nthat she would be “rush[ed]” to Rhode Island Hospital. It was her testimony that, at Rhode\nIsland Hospital, she was given the option of going home, which she did, leaving Rhode Island\nHospital “late” on May 9, 2009—only to return at 6 a.m. the next morning because she “couldn’t\nstop throwing up.” At trial, she remembered spending “more than one day” at Rhode Island\nHospital before being released to stay with her sister, Stephanie Bacon, in Rutland,\nMassachusetts.', 'Ms. King testified that her symptoms continued to worsen4 while she was staying with\nher sister; she stated that she ultimately called her “doctor [in] Rhode Island” and that he said:\n3', 'It was Ms. King’s testimony that, with the help of a friend, she found a place to live and\nthat, on May 4, 2009, she moved out of the residence which she had been sharing with\ndefendant.

Medical and thereafter\nreturned to work about one month after she was discharged.5', 'We note that the prosecutor submitted into evidence Ms. King’s medical records\n(including her records from Newport Hospital, Rhode Island Hospital, and U. Mass. Medical);\nand defense counsel, rather than simply acquiescing to their admission by remaining silent,\nspecifically stated to the trial justice that he had no objection. We also note that, at trial, the\nparties stipulated that Ms. King’s subdural hematoma constituted a “serious bodily injury” under\n§ 11-5-2.', '2.', 'The Testimony of Stephanie Bacon', 'Stephanie Bacon, Ms. King’s identical twin sister, testified at trial that she visited Ms.\nKing in the hospital in Newport in May of 2009. In her testimony, Ms. Bacon confirmed that her\nsister’s symptoms intensified while she was staying with her in Rutland. Specifically, Ms.\nBacon testified that Ms. King was “vomiting uncontrollably” and that her head was filled with\npressure “which now we know was the blood on the brain.” Her testimony went on to confirm\nMs. King’s testimony with respect to being admitted to U. Mass.

Medical he spoke with one of Ms. King’s physicians, who told him\nthat Ms. King had a subdural hematoma and that the possibility of performing surgery on her\nwas being debated. During his testimony, Det. Hayes also indicated that Ms. King named\ndefendant as her assailant.', 'After Det.

The defendant testified that he and Ms. King\nhad gone to a “restaurant/bar” across the street from their residence, where Ms. King started\narguing with a woman who she believed was “flirting with” defendant. It was defendant’s\ntestimony that he left the restaurant and returned to the residence which he shared with Ms. King.\nHe added that she also came back to the residence about five to ten minutes later and was\n“yelling, [and] screaming”—only to leave again to return to the previously mentioned\nbar/restaurant. It was defendant’s further testimony that, another five to ten minutes later, Ms.\nKing once again appeared at their residence. The defendant stated that, at that time, he was in\nthe “spare bedroom” and that he locked the door of that room. According to defendant’s\ntestimony, Ms. King started “yelling, screaming, and ramming the door;” he stated that she\nrammed the door about ten times before he opened it.6 He added that the next day Ms. King\ncomplained that her ribs were hurting.

He testified that, on the drive back to Newport, he and Ms.\nKing stopped at a McDonald’s to get some food and that, during a “struggle over the keys,” Ms.\nKing bit his thumb. The defendant acknowledged that the next day Ms. King complained of a\nheadache. However, he denied ever hitting Ms. King in the bathroom. 7 He stated that he spoke\nto Ms. King on the phone on the night of May 3, 2009 and that he told her that they should not\nsee each other anymore; he added that Ms. King was “very upset” by what he said.', 'During cross-examination, the prosecutor asked defendant: “And according to your\ntestimony is that [sic] you never laid a hand on Ms. King, right?” The defendant responded to\nthat question in the negative. The prosecutor then asked defendant if he was “not violent,” and\nhe replied that he was not violent. The prosecutor then proceeded to question defendant with\nrespect to an “altercation” that he once had with his former wife. The defendant admitted to the\naltercation with his former wife. Defense counsel seasonably objected to the questions regarding\nMr. Ceppi’s “altercation” with his former wife and made a “general objection” to any\nquestioning related to any incidents of violence between defendant and his former wife, stating\nthat “there’s no [R.I.

In his memorandum in support of his motion to dismiss,\ndefendant argued that the “nature and extent of the injuries specified in the information package\n[did] not constitute ‘serious bodily injury,’” (which is required under § 11-5-2, the violation of\nwhich was alleged in Count One).

That conclusion seems even more appropriate in\nlight of the fact that a trial justice, ruling on a Rule 9.1 motion to dismiss a criminal information,\nis performing essentially the same function as a grand jury—namely, assessing whether or not\nthere is probable cause to believe that the defendant committed the crime being charged.

On February 17, 2014\nat 1:24 a.m., the Town of Bristol (the town) police were dispatched to a motor vehicle accident\nnear 85 Broad Common Road. The vehicle—a 2004 Volvo—had veered off the road and\nsevered a telephone pole, then continued until it hit a tree approximately fifteen feet away. A\nfront-seat passenger suffered injuries to his head and legs, while the suspected operator—\nidentified by the passenger as Minior—had a head laceration.

Officer Gallison\nrecalled that upon approaching the vehicle, he witnessed a male sitting in the driver’s seat.', '-2-', 'After both officers testified, defendant’s attorney moved to dismiss the violation. The\ndefendant asserted that, based on a lack of evidence as to both the posted speed limit and\ndefendant’s operation of the vehicle, the town failed to satisfy the requisite clear and convincing\nstandard. Significant to Minior’s argument before us is the magistrate’s admonition to one of the\nofficers that “there was no testimony as to observation of the motor vehicle at the time of the\naccident, as to who was driving it. You’re indicating and coming to the presumption as to who\nwas operating the vehicle.” In conclusion, the magistrate said “there was no observation of who\nwas operating the vehicle * * *, so the [c]ourt finds that the [t]own has not sustained the\nviolation for reasonable and prudent speed[s].”', 'On December 5, 2014, the state filed a criminal information charging defendant with two\ndriving-related counts: (1) driving under the influence, serious bodily injury resulting; and (2)\nreckless driving.

The motion to dismiss was\nheard by a Superior Court magistrate on September 14, 2015. The Superior Court magistrate\ngranted the motion based primarily on a decision he had rendered in a previous case.', 'Soon after, the state appealed the Superior Court magistrate’s decision per G.L. 1956 § 8-\n2-11.1(d) and a Superior Court justice heard the matter on December 15, 2015. The justice\nreversed the Superior Court magistrate’s decision, emphasizing the distinction between “what the\nTraffic Tribunal [magistrate] did and [what he] did not do when he rendered his decision.”\nContinuing, she noted that “a careful review of the transcript” revealed that the Traffic Tribunal\nmagistrate did not make a specific finding about whether defendant was operating the vehicle at\nthe time of the accident. Instead, the Traffic Tribunal magistrate “merely found that the [t]own', '-3-\nhad not sustained the violation,” and did not decide whether defendant was operating the vehicle.\n“[The Traffic Tribunal magistrate] merely commented on the absence of evidence and found\nonly that the [t]own had not sustained its burden.” The justice ultimately determined that\ncollateral estoppel did not apply, reversed the Superior Court magistrate’s decision, and\nreinstated the charges.

Because defendant failed to raise this argument\nbelow, we do not address its merits and instead consider it waived. See State v.

With that\ncontext in mind, we begin our analysis.', '“The doctrine of collateral estoppel provides that when an issue of ultimate fact has once\nbeen determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the\nsame parties in any future lawsuit.” Pacheco, 161 A.3d at 1172 (quoting Gautier, 871 A.2d at\n358). Collateral estoppel applies where there exists “(1) an identity of issues, (2) the previous\nproceeding must have resulted in a final judgment on the merits, and (3) the party against whom\ncollateral estoppel is asserted must be the same or in privity with a party in the previous\nproceeding.” Id.

Casco Indemnity Co., 755 A.2d at 782; see also\nFoster-Glocester Regional School Committee v. Board of Review, 854 A.2d 1008, 1017 (R.I.\n2004).', 'We have had occasion to apply this principle before. In Gautier, we held that collateral\nestoppel did not apply to a probation-violation hearing because “further application of the\ndoctrine of collateral estoppel to bar relitigation of a criminal charge, following a determination\nduring a [civil] probation-revocation hearing that is adverse to the state, inequitably overlooks\nand misconceives the inherent and important differences between those proceedings and criminal\ntrials.” Gautier, 871 A.2d at 358. One of the referenced differences in that case was the\napplicable due-process standard, which we articulated as “considerably less * * * than that to\nwhich they are constitutionally entitled in a full-blown criminal trial” “[d]ue to the less formal\nnature of such proceedings.” Id. at 359. We also noted the differing evidentiary rules, where the\nrules are applied “less stringently” in a probation-revocation hearing. Id.

Ultimately, we determined that “it is neither the purpose\nnor the intended function of probation-revocation hearings to ‘serve as a final arbiter of an\nindividual’s guilt or innocence of criminal charges’” and it would therefore be inequitable to\nestop the state from pursuing a criminal charge based on an unfavorable probation-revocation', '-7-\ndecision. Id. at 360 (quoting Commonwealth v. Cosgrove, 629 A.2d 1007, 1011 (Pa. Super. Ct.\n1993)).', 'We perceive several similarities between Gautier and this case. As we prophetically\ndelineated in Pacheco, 161 A.3d at 1176, there are numerous differences between a Traffic\nTribunal proceeding and a criminal trial.', 'For instance, those appearing before the Traffic\nTribunal are not guaranteed the right to counsel. Id. Neither are they afforded the same latitude\nin conducting discovery. Id. Though the distinctions are plentiful, perhaps the most persuasive\nis the overall formality of a Traffic Tribunal proceeding versus a criminal trial. Like probation-\nviolation hearings, which are “more informal * * * than a trial” because of the lower standard\nrequired to prove a violation, Traffic Tribunal proceedings are similarly informal where the\nburden of proof on the prosecution is one of “clear and convincing evidence.” Gautier, 871 A.2d\nat 359; Rule 17(a) of the Traffic Tribunal Rules of Procedure. The defendant argues that our\nholding in Gautier rested on reasoning that a probation-revocation hearing is less formal than a\ntrial on the merits, whereas a Traffic Tribunal proceeding is formal. We respond that in Gautier,\n871 A.2d at 359, we focused not on a superficial distinction between trials and probation-\nrevocation hearings, but instead remained “[m]indful of the critical differences in both the\npurposes of and procedures employed during probation-revocation hearings and criminal trials.”\nWith an eye to such “critical differences” between criminal trials and Traffic Tribunal\nproceedings, our reasoning today is in accordance with Gautier. Id.', 'Moreover, the following resonates:', '“‘[T]he government is not statutorily or constitutionally obligated', 'to put forth all its evidence at a probation[-]revocation hearing', '* * *.’ However, application of collateral estoppel to probation-', 'revocation hearings inevitably thwarts this principle of criminal', 'jurisprudence by forcing the state to expedite discovery and', 'present any and all of its evidence and witnesses well in advance of', '-8-', 'trial. This is especially problematic when, as in some complicated', 'cases, the charges raised at a revocation hearing are only a small', 'part of a larger, ongoing criminal investigation.” Gautier, 871', 'A.2d at 360 (quoting United States v. Miller, 797 F.2d 336, 342', '(6th Cir. 1986)) (emphasis added).\nWe believe that the same can be said of the Traffic Tribunal. The present case is an example of a\ntraffic violation that is “only a small part of a larger, ongoing criminal investigation.” Id. To\nrequire the state to “complete its entire investigation” before resolving the violation “can\neffectively hinder its ability to carefully strategize the prosecution of criminal suspects and,\nconsequently, provide for public safety.” Id. Estopping the state from pursuing criminal charges\nagainst defendant, or anyone accused similarly, based on the resolve of a non-criminal traffic\ncitation would compromise public safety and undeniably be an inequity to the community. See\nid.', 'In Pacheco, 161 A.3d at 1176-77, we also acknowledged that various jurisdictions have\ndecided the issue as we do today. For example, in State v. Walker, 768 P.2d 668 (Ariz. Ct.

The defendant, Tory Lussier, appeals from a judgment\nof conviction on one count of felony assault following a jury-waived trial in the Superior Court.\nA group consisting of the defendant, his friends, and his brother—most of whom were off-duty\nMarines—was involved in a late-night melee with some students from Brown University. After\nthe brawl had subsided and the groups were heading their separate ways, the defendant ripped off\nhis shirt, ran back toward the site of the donnybrook, and landed a punch to the head of Joseph\nSharkey. According to the defendant, that punch was in defense of himself and his companions;\naccording to the state, it was an uncalled-for sucker punch. The trial justice agreed with the\nstate’s theory and found the defendant guilty.', 'This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to\nappear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided.\nThe defendant contends that there was sufficient evidence of self-defense to require a finding of\nnot guilty. The defendant further argues that the trial justice overlooked material evidence in', '-1-\ncarrying out his fact-finding function.', 'After considering the parties’ written and oral\nsubmissions and after reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that\nthis case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth below,\nwe affirm the judgment of conviction.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The defendant and his friends Joseph Ryan, Joseph Parrish, and Andrew Parrish were all\nUnited States Marines who had served in the same unit, and they had been deployed to\nAfghanistan together. They considered themselves to be brothers, and each knew the importance\nof always having each other’s back. Unfortunately, during the early morning hours of May 12,\n2013, they became brothers in arms in a manner that they did not anticipate.', 'After the four Marines returned from active duty, they made plans to get together and\nenjoy a night socializing in Providence. The defendant, Ryan, Joseph, Andrew, and defendant’s\nyounger brother, Derek, first convened for dinner. 1 Eventually, they made their way to the East\nSide of the city, where the comrades spent the remainder of their night drinking at a bar located\nnear Brown University. The defendant estimated that he had consumed at least seven drinks at\nthe bar, and he described himself as having been intoxicated that night. The defendant was\nknown to his friends to sometimes become irritable and angry when he was drinking. Shortly\nbefore the 2:00 a.m. closing time, the group left the establishment in search of late-night food.\nTrouble ensued, however, while they were en route to their vehicles.\n1', 'Due to the commonalities of both first and last names in this case, we will refer to the Parrish\nbrothers and defendant’s brother by their first names and Joseph Ryan by his last name. We\nintend no disrespect to anyone involved.', '-2-', 'As the group walked on Thayer Street, in the vicinity of George Street, they passed by\ntwo individuals. The larger of the two, Dillon Ingham, a Brown University football player,\nsomehow insulted Ryan. Joseph intervened, and a fight erupted. Ingham punched Joseph and\nknocked him out. Either Ingham or his cohort rendered Ryan unconscious as well. Indeed, Ryan\nsuffered a concussion and broken orbital bone, nose, and tooth. 2 Andrew and Derek then jumped\ninto the fray to battle with Ingham.', 'Meanwhile, defendant had engaged in fisticuffs with the other individual who had been\nstanding with Ingham. The defendant, Ryan, and Derek all identified that second individual as\nSharkey, a Brown University basketball player who would ultimately become the complaining\nwitness at trial. 3 Soon enough, the melee petered out. Andrew pulled Derek away from Ingham,\nwho raised his hands and began to back away. At that point, the police arrived, and the crowd\nscattered.', 'The defendant was later seen on surveillance video pulling his shirt off and walking back\nin the direction of the initial confrontation as the first police cruiser arrived at the scene. By the\ntime the camera panned in that direction, an individual—later identified as Sharkey—could be\nseen lying motionless on the ground, his body half in the street and half on the sidewalk.\nSharkey had been badly injured and he had apparently collapsed and hit his head on the concrete.\n2', 'At trial, Ryan was unable to say definitively which of the two had hit him. However, it was\nIngham who was charged with felony assault of Ryan and misdemeanor simple assault of\nJoseph. Ingham’s felony-assault charge was later reduced to a simple assault in exchange for his\npleading nolo contendere to both misdemeanor counts. He received one year of probation.\n3', 'As a result of the injuries that he suffered, Sharkey could not remember what transpired that\nnight. He did, however, testify that he and Ingham were “acquaintances” who were in the same\nfraternity. Sharkey explained that, because “Brown doesn’t recognize Greek life,” “[i]t’s not\nreally a fraternity, just a house where everybody lives.” Theirs was a dorm that housed football\nand basketball players, but, according to Sharkey, he and Ingham were not all that close and did\nnot hang out socially. In fact, Sharkey did not know Ingham’s actual first name, but only his\nnickname, until after the unfortunate events that precipitated this trial.', '-3-\nTo save his life, it was necessary to remove a portion of his skull to stop his brain from\nswelling. 4 In fact, Sharkey’s injuries were so severe that Providence police initially treated the\ncase as a homicide investigation.', 'Numerous witnesses testified to what had transpired in the seconds between the time that\ndefendant was seen heading back toward the scene of the initial confrontation and the time that\nSharkey was grievously injured. Katherine Mahoney said that she had been out with Sharkey\nthat night; they were merely friends at the time, although the relationship did ripen into romance\nat a later time. Mahoney explained that she and Sharkey had just left an on-campus bar and that\nthey were walking on Thayer Street when they saw a commotion. According to Mahoney,\nSharkey then walked over to the “late night brawl” while she remained on the sidewalk. She\ntestified that she was watching him the whole time and that she did not see him throw any\npunches or touch anyone whatsoever. Sharkey was in the middle of the fighting for ten seconds\nat most, Mahoney said, before she called for him to get out of there and, whether her entreaty\nwas the reason or not, he did so. Mahoney said that, less than a minute later, she and Sharkey\nwere talking on the sidewalk approximately thirty feet away from where the fighting had taken\nplace. Mahoney testified that Sharkey had his back turned to the fight and that defendant ran\ntoward them from that direction. It was then that Mahoney saw defendant punch Sharkey in the\nside of his face from behind, and she watched as Sharkey “fell and smashed his head on the\nconcrete.” The defendant ran away, leaving Mahoney with the unresponsive and bleeding\nSharkey. The police arrived within seconds.', 'Wooyoung Moon, a student at Brown University, also testified to what he witnessed.\nMoon said that he had been out with some friends that night and that he was sober. He related\n4', 'Sharkey testified that, ever since his injury, he has been prone to seizures.', '-4-\nthat he was walking on Thayer Street when he heard a commotion. Moon testified that he looked\nup and saw a brawl going on, although it appeared to him to be “a gang of people ganging up on\nthis one guy and punching him.” Moon said that he watched the fight for ten to twenty seconds\nand that he was about fifteen to twenty yards away from it. He then looked down at his phone,\nstruggling to find the phone number for the Brown University police, and by the time he looked\nback up, the fight had settled down. He said that there was still some jawing going on, but no\npunches were being thrown. Moon then watched as defendant walked along Thayer Street, and\nMoon presumed he was going to his car. Moon also saw “this guy and this girl standing * * * on\nthe sidewalk north of this clump of people.” Moon testified that he thought defendant would\nsimply walk past the couple, but instead defendant suddenly punched the man. As the man fell\nto the ground, Moon heard defendant yelling expletives at the man while the woman screamed\nfor defendant to stop. The defendant then continued walking on Thayer Street, but when the\npolice arrived just seconds later, Moon testified that defendant ran right past him and ducked\ndown a side street.', 'When defendant testified, he painted quite a different picture. The defendant said that\nSharkey was with Ingham, that it was they who had initiated the scuffle, and that he saw Sharkey\nkicking Ryan. At that time, defendant testified, he jumped into the ruckus and he and Sharkey\nactually exchanged blows for about twenty seconds.', 'After Sharkey landed a punch to\ndefendant’s face, defendant said that he put Sharkey in a headlock until a woman came along and\npulled Sharkey out of the brawl by his belt. Meanwhile, Derek was still engaged with Ingham\nfarther down Thayer Street, so defendant ran to his brother’s aid. He said that that was when the\nsurveillance video captured Ingham backing away from the group of Marines with his hands\nraised, seemingly in a gesture of surrender. The defendant testified that he then saw Sharkey', '-5-\nwalking in his direction and “[f]ully looking” at him, and defendant “felt like it was him or me\nthat was going to be hit * * *.” And, defendant said, if it was not him who Sharkey was going to\nassault, it would have been one of his fellow Marines or his brother. The defendant said that he\npunched Sharkey but once. The defendant testified that it was simply a “reaction[,]” that he “felt\nlike it was fight or flight * * *.”', 'The trial justice did not see it that way. The trial justice found Moon to be the most\ncredible witness because he was the only person testifying who was completely disinterested and\nbecause he had not been drinking that night. The trial justice also held that the testimony of\nMoon and Mahoney and the events depicted in the surveillance video were corroborative of each\nother. The trial justice did not find any credible evidence that supported defendant’s story, and\nhe determined that the initial confrontation had concluded before defendant punched Sharkey.\nBased on those findings, the trial justice said that he was “constrained to conclude that this was\nnot a case of self-defense or defense of others, rather it was an act of retribution to even the score\nfor what happened earlier to [defendant’s] friends at the hands of the other Brown University\nstudent, Dillon Ingham.” Therefore, the trial justice found defendant guilty of felony assault. 5\n5', 'At the time the criminal information was filed in this case, G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2 defined felony\nassault as follows:', '“(a) Every person who shall make an assault or battery, or both,', 'with a dangerous weapon, or with acid or other dangerous', 'substance, or by fire, or an assault or battery which results in', 'serious bodily injury, shall be punished by imprisonment for not', 'more than twenty (20) years.', '“* * *', '“(c) ‘Serious bodily injury’ means physical injury that:', '“(1) Creates a substantial risk of death;', '“(2) Causes protracted loss or impairment of the function of any', 'bodily part, member or organ; or', '-6-\nThe trial justice sentenced defendant to seven years at the Adult Correctional Institutions, all\nsuspended with probation; 1,000 hours of community service; weekly counseling for two years\nfor treatment for his anger issues, PTSD-related symptoms, and alcohol abuse; and weekly\nrandom substance abuse screenings.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“In a jury-waived criminal proceeding, this Court gives deference to a trial justice’s\nfinding[s] of fact[]” and determinations of credibility. State v. Medeiros, 996 A.2d 115, 121 (R.I.\n2010) (quoting State v. Adewumi, 966 A.2d 1217, 1221-22 (R.I. 2009)). This is so because we', '“accord a great deal of respect to the factual determinations and', 'credibility assessments made by the judicial officer who has', 'actually observed the human drama that is part and parcel of every', 'trial and who has had an opportunity to appraise witness demeanor', 'and to take into account other realities that cannot be grasped from', 'a reading of a cold record.” Id. at 122 (quoting State v.

At the same\ntime, however, “our role is not simply to rubber-stamp the trial justice’s findings of fact; rather,\nour role is ‘to review the record carefully to see if it in fact contains sufficient evidence to\nsupport the trial justice’s conclusion.’” State v. Forand, 958 A.2d 134, 138 (R.I. 2008) (quoting\nState v.

McMahon, 116\nA.3d 204, 210 (R.I. 2015)).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'The defendant takes issue with the trial justice’s decision that the state successfully\nrebutted defendant’s self-defense claim beyond a reasonable doubt. 6 That argument is inherently\nrelated to his other argument: that the trial justice overlooked certain evidence in arriving at his\ndecision. The defendant contends that, because the trial justice did not recite or summarize\nAndrew’s testimony when delivering his bench decision, he must have overlooked it, and,\naccording to defendant, consideration of that testimony would have swung the weight of the\nevidence back in his direction. In our opinion, that argument misses the mark.', 'It is significant that, as he rendered his decision, the trial justice explained:', '“I have reviewed all of the witnesses who testified in this case, but', 'the most relevant and most significant testimony which I have just', 'placed on the record is from those witnesses that I’ve just recited', 'testimony from. There were a number of other witnesses who', 'certainly testified in this matter. I’ve considered that testimony,', 'but this testimony that I’ve just recited has the most bearing on the', 'legal issues before this Court. I just don’t want anyone to think I', 'overlooked the other witnesses.”\nIn defendant’s view, though, the trial justice did just that: “overlooked material evidence on a\ncontrolling issue.” Medeiros, 996 A.2d at 121 (quoting Adewumi, 966 A.2d at 1222). We do not\nagree. Simply because the trial justice did not go through each painstaking detail of every\nwitness’s testimony, it cannot be concluded that he did not consider it. To the contrary, he\n6', '“Once a defendant introduces evidence of self-defense, the burden is on the state to negate that\ndefense beyond a reasonable doubt.” State v. Urena, 899 A.2d 1281, 1288 (R.I. 2006).', '-8-\nprofessed that he did in fact consider it, and his bench decision evinces that he had clearly and\ncomprehensively reviewed the evidence adduced at trial.', 'Furthermore, our review of the record leaves no doubt whatsoever that sufficient\ncompetent evidence existed to support the trial justice’s decision. See Forand, 958 A.2d at 138.\nThe trial justice had ample evidence before him to support both the state’s theory of the case as\nwell as defendant’s. The trial justice discussed and analyzed both theories, and he made factual\nfindings and credibility assessments that led him to side with the state in concluding that\ndefendant had not assaulted Sharkey in an effort to defend himself, his friends, or his brother.\nMoreover, even if we were to disagree with that outcome, we are not in the business of replacing\nthe trial justice’s view of the evidence with our own. See Van Dongen, 132 A.3d at 1079.', 'It seems to us that the defendant’s twofold argument—that the evidence of self-defense\nnegated a guilty finding, and that the trial justice overlooked evidence in finding defendant\nguilty—is nothing more than a manifestation of the defendant’s disagreement with the findings\nof fact and determinations of credibility that the trial justice did place on the record. That,\ncertainly, “is a most difficult hurdle to overcome in a jury-waived trial.” Van Dongen, 132 A.3d\nat 1079. It was the defendant’s considered decision to waive his right to a trial by jury and put\nhis fate in the hands of a seasoned justice of the Superior Court, who, it turned out, did not see\nthings the way the defendant would have wished.

According to the description related by the', '-1-\ncomplainant, Jeffrey Lebrun (Jeffrey),1 to the responding officers of the Pawtucket Police\nDepartment,2 the invasion was perpetrated by two males, dressed in black and wearing ski\nmasks. Armed with a knife, the shorter of the two perpetrators grabbed Jeffrey’s neck from\nbehind while he was sitting on his couch and began choking him. As Jeffrey struggled with his\nattacker for possession of the knife, the second assailant, whom Jeffrey later described as\napproximately five-feet-eight inches to five-feet-ten inches in height, pushed Jeffrey’s head\ndown on the couch. During this struggle, Jeffrey called out to awaken his wife, Sheri, for help.\nSheri got out of bed and ran down the stairs in time to see Jeffrey struggling with one of the\nintruders.3 Sheri then called 911, and the assailants fled.4', 'Shortly after Sheri’s 911 call, then-Pawtucket Police Patrolman (now Sergeant) Eric\nBucka (Sgt. Bucka) received a radio description of the suspects, indicating that the perpetrators\nwere “two males dressed in all black, with masks, black sweatshirts, black pants, black shoes.”\nApproximately one block from the crime scene, Sgt. Bucka encountered Gibson, who was\nwearing black sneakers, black pants, and a white shirt, but no sweatshirt. In response to Sgt.\nBucka’s questioning, Gibson stated that he was coming from his girlfriend’s house in Attleboro,\nMassachusetts. After a few minutes, Sgt. Bucka and Gibson parted ways.\n1', 'To distinguish Jeffrey Lebrun from his wife, we refer to the Lebruns by their first names.\n2', 'By the time of defendant’s probation violation hearing, Jeffrey Lebrun had died.\n3', 'Sheri testified that, unlike Jeffrey, she saw only one intruder.\n4', 'A recording of Sheri’s 911 call was played for the trial justice, and both that recording and a\ntranscript of it were admitted as full exhibits at Gibson’s probation violation hearing. However,\nafter the hearing, the exhibits were permanently withdrawn for use at future proceedings.\nConsequently, the record before this Court contains neither the recording of the 911 call nor the\ntranscript of that recording.', '-2-', 'In the aftermath of the tumultuous events at the Lebrun residence, several items\nattributable to the perpetrators were uncovered at the scene and in the surrounding neighborhood.\nPolice obtained latex gloves outside of the home at 112 Dawson Street, and a backpack\ncontaining various break-in tools was found inside the dwelling. Additionally, police found the\nknife wielded by one of the assailants inside the home. Later that morning, Patrolman Carl\nBarovier (Ptlm. Barovier) was summoned to a home one and a half blocks away from the crime\nscene at 90 County Street, the same street on which Sgt. Bucka had stopped Gibson earlier that\nmorning. When Ptlm. Barovier arrived, the residents informed him that, when they awoke that\nmorning, a black sweatshirt was discovered on their lawn, inside their six-foot stockade fence.\nThe sweatshirt was tossed back over the fence by the homeowners and was situated between the\nroad and the fence at 90 County Street. Patrolman Barovier placed the sweatshirt into an\nevidence bag and returned to 112 Dawson Street to show it to the Lebruns. Both Jeffrey and\nSheri confirmed that the black sweatshirt looked like the sweatshirt that one of the intruders was\nwearing.', 'All the evidence recovered by the Pawtucket Police investigators was sent to the Rhode\nIsland Department of Health (DOH) for DNA testing.5 Tamara Wong (Wong), a forensic\nbiologist employed by the DOH and an expert in DNA testing, explained the results of the DNA\n5', 'The road to DNA testing of this evidence was a somewhat winding one. Shortly after the\nbreak-in in May 2013, the gloves found outside 112 Dawson Street were sent to the DOH. In\nJuly 2013, Jeffrey was murdered in his home, and, in August 2013, Pawtucket Police Detective\nCharles Devine (Det. Devine) was assigned to investigate both the murder and the home\ninvasion. In connection with the investigation, Det. Devine ordered the transfer of the remaining\nitems of evidence from the home invasion—the black sweatshirt, the knife, and the break-in tools\nfrom the backpack found at the crime scene—to the DOH. After Det. Devine learned that DNA\nextracted from the collar of the sweatshirt matched the DNA profile of a convicted offender\nnamed Juan A. Gibson from a DNA indexing system known as CODIS (Combined DNA Index\nSystem), he apprehended Gibson. A buccal swab was then taken from Gibson and transferred to\nthe DOH for comparison analysis.', '-3-\ntesting of this evidence. Wong testified that a saliva stain on the right shoulder of the black\nsweatshirt matched Jeffrey’s DNA profile. Additionally, DNA was extracted from the collar of\nthe sweatshirt, and this extracted DNA matched Gibson’s DNA profile.6 Wong also testified that\nshe examined other items found at the scene—the glove and a piece of cord or clothesline found\nin the backpack—and that the DNA profiles were consistent with Gibson’s DNA profile; she\nelaborated that twenty-one of the twenty-three loci in the profile found on both the glove and the\npiece of cord or clothesline matched Gibson’s DNA profile. During questioning from Det.\nDevine following Gibson’s apprehension in March 2014, Gibson told Det. Devine that, on the\nnight of the home invasion, his car broke down while he was coming back from North\nAttleborough,7 he was walking home, and he had to call AAA to take care of the car.', 'Gibson was serving suspended sentences for three separate drug convictions and was on\nprobation as a result. First, in 2005, Gibson entered a plea of nolo contendere to possession of a\ncontrolled substance with intent to deliver and was sentenced to ten years at the Adult\nCorrectional Institutions (ACI), two years to serve and the remaining eight years suspended, with\nprobation.8 Second, in 2010, Gibson entered a plea of nolo contendere to possession of cocaine\nand possession of marijuana, and he was sentenced to six years at the ACI, one year to serve and\n6', 'Wong testified that there is a mere one-in-fifty-six-trillion chance that the DNA from the\nsweatshirt collar does not belong to Gibson. On cross-examination, Wong testified that the DNA\nextracted from the sweatshirt collar was so-called “touch DNA,” which consists of “anything that\ncomes in contact with skin or epithelial cells that can be shedded.” Wong acknowledged that the\npresence of Gibson’s touch DNA on the sweatshirt collar did not necessarily mean that he ever\nwore the sweatshirt; if he simply touched the collar, his touch DNA could have transferred to the\ncollar.\n7', 'Although Det. Devine remembers Gibson saying that he was coming back from North\nAttleborough, he acknowledged that Gibson could have said Attleboro instead.\n8', 'Gibson had previously been adjudicated a probation violator on this sentence; at the time of the\nprobation violation hearing in this case, eighty-two months remained on the 2005 sentence.', '-4-\nfive years suspended, with probation. Finally, in 2012, Gibson entered a plea of nolo contendere\nto possession of an enumerated quantity of cocaine and was sentenced to nine years at the ACI,\neighteen months to serve and ninety months suspended, with probation. Accordingly, on March\n27, 2014, the state filed, pursuant to Rule 32(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal\nProcedure, notices of probation violation in each of these three cases. At the probation violation\nhearing, in addition to the evidence recounted above, Sheri testified that she knew Gibson\nthrough a friendship with his wife and that, although Gibson had been to the back porch of the\nLebrun home at 112 Dawson Street, he had never been inside the residence.', 'After considering the evidence, the trial justice was “more than reasonably satisfied” that\nGibson violated the terms and conditions of his probation. The trial justice found that two\naspects of the black sweatshirt that police had recovered—and that Sheri and Jeffrey identified as\nsimilar to the sweatshirts worn by the perpetrators—were indicative of defendant’s involvement\nin the break-in: (1) the discovery of the sweatshirt close to the crime scene, evidently discarded\nover a fence by one of the perpetrators; and (2) the fact that both Gibson’s and Jeffrey’s DNA\nwere found on the sweatshirt. The trial justice was also “trouble[d]” that Gibson “told [Sgt.]\nBucka one story and [Det.] Devine a different one.” He reasoned that, if Gibson’s car had\nbroken down and he was waiting for AAA to assist him, then it was “odd” that he had not\nrelayed these important facts to Sgt. Bucka. Although acknowledging Sheri’s testimony that she\nsaw only one intruder, the trial justice found that there were two intruders. He noted that Sheri’s\n“911 recording makes it quite clear that she is speaking of two assailants.” Additionally, the trial\njustice did not deem the discrepancy between Gibson’s height—somewhere between six-feet-one\nand six-feet-two—and Jeffrey’s estimation of the height of the taller intruder—approximately\nfive-feet-eight to five-feet-ten—to be significant. He noted the approximate nature of Jeffrey’s', '-5-\nestimation and reasoned that gauging an individual’s height while simultaneously fending off\narmed home invaders is a difficult task.', 'The trial justice (1) ordered that the eighty-two months that remained on the suspended\nsentence imposed in 2005 be served at the ACI; (2) removed the five years remaining on the\nsuspended sentence imposed in 2010 and ordered that Gibson serve that time at the ACI,\nconcurrent with the time to be served on the 2005 sentence; and (3) ordered that the ninety-\nmonth suspended sentence imposed in 2012 be continued, with the same conditions and terms.\nGibson timely appealed.', 'Standard of Review', 'A probation violation hearing has a singular focus: determining whether the conditions of\nprobation—namely, “[k]eeping the peace and remaining on good behavior—have been violated.”\nState v.

Unlike the burden of proof at a criminal trial, the state’s burden in the probation\nviolation context is far less exacting; the state need only “prove to the reasonable satisfaction of\nthe [trial] justice that the defendant has violated the terms and conditions of the previously\nimposed probation.”9 Id. (quoting Gromkiewicz, 43 A.3d at 48). We review a trial justice’s\nadjudication of probation violation deferentially, reversing only where the trial justice “acted\narbitrarily or capriciously in finding a violation.” Id. (quoting Gromkiewicz, 43 A.3d at 48).\nChallenges to a trial justice’s credibility determinations typically are unavailing in this Court\nbecause the assessment of witness credibility “in a probation violation hearing is a function of\nthe [trial] justice, not this Court.” Id. (quoting Gromkiewicz, 43 A.3d at 49).\n9', 'Consistent with the sole purpose of a probation violation hearing, the reasonable-satisfaction\nstandard is employed to determine only whether the terms and conditions of probation were\nviolated, not whether defendant is guilty of the offenses that form the basis of the violation\nallegation. See State v. Hazard, 68 A.3d 479, 499 (R.I. 2013).', '-6-', 'Analysis', 'On appeal, Gibson offers several reasons why, in his view, the trial justice acted\narbitrarily and capriciously in finding him to be a probation violator. None is persuasive. First,\nGibson argues that the trial justice erroneously credited Jeffrey’s statements that there were two\nperpetrators over Sheri’s testimony that she saw only one. We discern no error in this regard.\nJeffrey struggled with the two intruders from the outset of the home invasion, while Sheri\nwitnessed the break-in only after Jeffrey awakened her with his calls for help. By the time Sheri\narrived downstairs, one of the perpetrators may have fled, as did the assailant Sheri saw soon\nafter she came downstairs. Additionally, in his decision, the trial justice did address Sheri’s\ntestimony that she saw only one intruder, but he noted that she referred to two perpetrators in her\n911 call. Because the trial justice considered all of the evidence, accepted Jeffrey’s version for\nplausible reasons, and rationally rejected the inference that Gibson sought to draw from Sheri’s\ntestimony that she saw only one intruder, he did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in concluding\nthat there were two intruders. See Gromkiewicz, 43 A.3d at 49.', 'Gibson next claims that, because he is at least four inches taller than the taller of the two\nintruders that Jeffrey identified, he could not have been involved in the break-in. The trial justice\nconsidered this argument and rejected it because of the approximate nature of Jeffrey’s height\nestimation and the difficulty in accurately pinpointing a person’s height in the midst of a frantic\nstruggle. We are satisfied that discounting the significance of the height discrepancy for the\nreasons articulated by the trial justice does not lead to an arbitrary or capricious conclusion.', 'Gibson also faults the trial justice for placing too much reliance on the DNA evidence\nfound on the black sweatshirt and on Gibson’s statements to Sgt. Bucka and Det. Devine; he\ncontends that this evidence, although incriminating at first blush, does not establish that Gibson', '-7-\nwas one of the intruders. With respect to the DNA found on the sweatshirt, Gibson argues that\nthe touch DNA “might * * * have been transferred to the sweatshirt unremarkably, and\ninnocently, in any number of different exchanges” between Gibson and Jeffrey prior to the night\nof the home invasion.', 'Finally, with respect to his statements, Gibson contends that the\nstatements he gave to Sgt. Bucka and Det. Devine were not inconsistent: he was walking home\nfrom his girlfriend’s house in Attleboro, as he told Sgt. Bucka, because his car broke down on his\nway home, as he told Det. Devine. These contentions are unavailing. The weight of the\nevidence in a probation hearing rests with the trial justice.', 'Gibson was found approximately one block from the crime scene shortly after the police\nwere called, and he was wearing black pants and black sneakers and no jacket or outerwear.\nHowever, a black sweatshirt—matching the description of the clothing worn by the suspects—\nwas found within the same proximity of the crime scene, apparently thrown over a fence on the\nnight of the break-in. That sweatshirt, which matched the sweatshirts worn by the perpetrators,\ncontained Gibson’s DNA on the collar and Jeffrey’s DNA on the right shoulder. Although it is\npossible that there is an unremarkable and innocent explanation for how this evidence—\ncontaining both Gibson’s and the victim’s DNA—wound up behind a stockade fence near the\ncrime scene, the trial justice properly rejected that speculation. He was not required to turn a\nblind eye to the highly probative and incriminating nature of this evidence. His conclusion that\nthis evidence pointed towards Gibson’s involvement in the home invasion was neither arbitrary\nnor capricious. See State v. McLaughlin, 935 A.2d 938, 942 (R.I. 2007) (“The hearing justice\ncan draw reasonable inferences from the evidence presented to determine whether the defendant\nviolated the terms of his probation.” (quoting State v. Seamans, 935 A.2d 618, 621-22 (R.I.\n2007))).', '-8-', 'The same can be said for the discrepancy between Gibson’s statements to the\ninvestigating officers. He told Det. Devine that his car broke down and that he needed to call\nAAA. The trial justice found it “odd” that, if car failure was the true reason for Gibson’s\npresence in the vicinity of the crime scene in the early morning hours of May 19, 2013, Gibson\ndid not report his car troubles to Sgt. Bucka. Although one could reconcile Gibson’s statements\nto Sgt. Bucka and Det. Devine, the trial justice’s conclusion that Gibson told different stories to\nthe two officers is reasonable. See McLaughlin, 935 A.2d at 942.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons articulated above, we are of the opinion that the trial justice did not act\narbitrarily or capriciously in finding that the defendant violated the terms of his probation.\nAccordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-9-', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet\nTITLE OF CASE:', 'State v.

After a thorough review of the\nrecord and consideration of the parties’ arguments, we conclude that cause has not been shown\nand that the appeal may be decided without further briefing or argument.

On September 19, 2006, a Superior Court jury convicted\ndefendant on one count of first-degree child molestation sexual assault and acquitted defendant\non the second count. The trial justice sentenced defendant to sixty years’ imprisonment, with\nforty years to serve and the remainder suspended, with probation. This conviction was vacated\non appeal, and the case was remanded for a new trial. Oliveira I, 961 A.2d at 319. At a second\ntrial, before a different trial justice, defendant again was convicted on one count of first-degree\nchild molestation sexual assault. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, and this Court affirmed\nthe conviction. Oliveira II, 127 A.3d at 85.1', 'Subsequently, defendant filed a Rule 35 motion to reduce the sentence, on the ground that\nthe life sentence imposed after the second trial was unconstitutional. The defendant argued that\nit was improper for a second trial justice to depart from the original forty-year term to serve due\nto defendant’s disciplinary record at the Adult Correctional Institutions. The defendant also\nargued that the trial justice erred because, while he commented upon defendant’s disciplinary\nrecord, the trial justice failed to make clear “that [the record] was the reason why he imposed a\nlife sentence.” The state disagreed, and argued in opposition to the motion to reduce that there\nwas ample evidence in the record to support the trial justice’s sentencing decision, including\nconduct by defendant that occurred after the first conviction was vacated.', 'In denying defendant’s Rule 35 motion, the trial justice acknowledged that, although he\n“could have been more explicit in using * * * direct language” when departing from defendant’s\nfirst sentence and imposing a life sentence following his second conviction, this omission was\n1', 'This is not defendant’s first conviction. In State v.

He was sentenced to two eight-year sentences, to run\nconcurrently, with two years to serve and the balance suspended, with probation.', '-2-\nnot fatal to his sentencing decision.', 'The trial justice found that the fourteen disciplinary\ninfractions that defendant had committed between defendant’s first conviction and his second\ntrial were “very disturbing” because every infraction “fell into the moderate to high category of\ndisciplinary violations according to the Department of Corrections Code of Conduct.” The trial\njustice also explained that, during the sentencing hearing, he had “clearly characterized that\ncollection of infractions as demonstrating * * * that this defendant, in the [c]ourt’s view, was\nantisocial, disrespectful of authority, rules, and boundaries.” Finally, the trial justice recounted\nhis sentencing remarks about the impact this crime has had on the young complainant’s life. The\ndefendant’s grandson was six years of age at the time of the offense.', 'The defendant timely appealed.', 'Standard of Review', 'A motion to reduce a sentence under Rule 35 “is essentially a plea for leniency[.]” State\nv.

Chase, 9 A.3d 1248, 1253 (R.I. 2010)).\n“The motion is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial justice, who may grant it if he or she\ndecides on reflection or on the basis of changed circumstances that the sentence originally\nimposed was, for any reason, unduly severe.” State v. Mlyniec, 78 A.3d 769, 771 (R.I. 2013)\n(quoting State v. Mendoza, 958 A.2d 1159, 1161 (R.I. 2008)). We have a “strong policy against\ninterfering with a trial justice’s discretion in sentencing matters,” and thus “our review of a trial\njustice’s ruling on a Rule 35 motion is extremely limited.” Rivera, 64 A.3d at 745 (quoting State\nv. Snell, 11 A.3d 97, 101 (R.I. 2011)). Accordingly, we will interfere with that discretion only in\n“rare instances when the trial justice has imposed a sentence that is without justification and is\ngrossly disparate from other sentences generally imposed for similar offenses.” Id.

Specifically, defendant claims that, when the trial justice departed\nfrom the first sentence after retrial, imposing a sentence of life imprisonment, he violated\ndefendant’s right to due process because the court essentially punished defendant for\nsuccessfully appealing his first conviction. This argument is without merit.', 'It is well established that “a corollary of the power to retry a defendant is the power, upon\nthe defendant’s reconviction, to impose whatever sentence may be legally authorized, whether or\nnot it is greater than the sentence imposed after the first conviction.” North Carolina v. Pearce,\n395 U.S. 711, 720 (1969); see State v. Mattatall, 603 A.2d 1098, 1118 (R.I. 1992) (“Reversal of\nthe original conviction nullifies the previous sentence, thereby clearing the slate for the\nimposition of a completely new sentence.”). This is because, by vacating the first conviction, the\nsentence that was imposed is also vacated, thus allowing for the imposition of a completely new\nsentence following a new conviction. State v. Simpson, 520 A.2d 1281, 1285 (R.I. 1987) (citing\nPearce, 395 U.S. at 721). The trial justice on retrial may depart from the original sentence and\nimpose a harsher sentence based on “events subsequent to the first trial that may have thrown\nnew light upon the defendant’s life, health, habits, conduct, and mental and moral propensities.”\nId. (quoting Pearce, 395 U.S. at 723); see also Mattatall, 603 A.2d at 1118-19.', 'We hasten to add, however, that the United States Supreme Court has declared that\n“[d]ue process of law * * * requires that vindictiveness against a defendant for having\nsuccessfully attacked his first conviction must play no part in the sentence he receives after a\nnew trial.” Pearce, 395 U.S. at 725. The record in the case at bar discloses that defendant', '-4-\nconceded that there was no vindictiveness by the trial justice when he imposed the life sentence\nafter the second trial. Indeed, there is no evidence of vengeful or spiteful sentencing on the part\nof the second trial justice when he departed from the first sentence. Rather, the second trial\njustice affirmatively placed his reasons for imposing the longer sentence on the record.\nFurthermore, in the context of the second trial, which, again, was presided over by a different\ntrial justice than the first trial, any suggestion of vindictiveness based on the successful appeal of\nthe first conviction would be entirely speculative. See Texas v. McCullough, 475 U.S. 134, 139\n(1986) (explaining that the possibility of vindictiveness is speculative where the second sentence\nis imposed by a different trial justice who has “no motivation to engage in self-vindication”\n(quoting Chaffin v. Stynchcombe, 412 U.S. 17, 27 (1973))). We therefore are satisfied that the\nsentence imposed by the trial justice in this case was not motivated by vindictiveness.', 'A thorough examination of the record also reveals that the trial justice gave ample\nconsideration to events that occurred after the first trial that shed light upon defendant’s “life,\nhealth, habits, conduct, and mental and moral propensities.” Pearce, 395 U.S. at 723 (quoting\nWilliams v.

Lassiter, 836 A.2d 1096, 1107 (R.I. 2003) (internal quotations omitted)\n(quoting State v. Webber, 716 A.2d 738, 742 (R.I. 1998)). The witness need not “literally state\nan opinion concerning the credibility of another witness’s testimony” for the court to consider\nthe statement impermissible bolstering. Id. Rather, the statement is inadmissible if it has the\nsame “substantive import” as bolstering or vouching for another witness’s credibility. Id.; see\nalso Adefusika, 989 A.2d at 476.', 'The state argues that, in the first instance, defendant failed to properly preserve this\nobjection for appeal because defendant did not provide a specific basis for the objection at trial.\nFor his part, defendant, pointing to Rule 103(a)(1) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, avers\nthat a stated specific basis is required only “if the specific ground [for objection] was not\napparent from the context[.]” R.I. R. Evid. 103(a)(1).', 'Under this Court’s well-established “raise-or-waive” rule, a specific objection is required\nto preserve an issue for appellate review. State v. Perry, 182 A.3d 558, 573 n.8 (R.I. 2018).\nThat is, if an issue was not preserved at trial by “specific objection,” then this Court may not\nconsider the issue on appeal. State v. Pona, 66 A.3d 454, 468 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v.', '-6-\nMcManus, 990 A.2d 1229, 1237 (R.I. 2010)). This Court “require[s] a specific objection so that\nthe allegation of error can be brought to the attention of the trial justice, who will then have an\nopportunity to rule on it.” Id.', 'Carlone testified that it was his “judgment that [Jonathan] had just woken up from a deep\nsleep and been assaulted[.]” The defendant objected to this statement, but failed to provide any\nspecificity as to the nature of his objection. The defendant argues that the nature of his objection\nwas clear from the context because he objected at the precise moment that bolstering or vouching\noccurred.', 'After reviewing the record, however, we are of the opinion that the basis for defendant’s\nobjection was not clear from the context of the state’s questioning. Merely objecting at the\nprecise point of testimony at which the alleged impermissible bolstering or vouching occurred—\nwithout more—does not sufficiently alert a trial justice to a potentially prejudicial evidentiary\nissue. See Pona, 66 A.3d at 469; but cf. State v. Offley, 131 A.3d 663, 670 (R.I. 2016) (finding\ncounsel’s repeated attempts to explain his objection’s rationale, despite never actually\narticulating them, to be sufficiently focused in context of that case to preserve evidentiary\nobjections for review).', 'Here, defendant objected after Carlone had responded, “it was my judgment that he had\njust woken up from a deep sleep and been assaulted[,]” to the state’s unrelated question, “Did\nyou detect anything on him with regard to alcohol?” Significantly, following his objection,\ndefendant did not move to strike Carlone’s answer or pass the case. If a general objection at a\nprecise moment were sufficient to constitute a “specific objection,” a trial justice would be\nrequired to divine the reason for the objection, essentially reading the mind of the objecting\ncounsel. Also, if every well-timed “Objection” could be considered as a specific objection, the', '-7-\nspecificity requirement would be rendered meaningless. We therefore conclude that defendant’s\nmere “Objection,” without providing any detail as to its basis, did not suffice to preserve the\nissue of the admissibility of Carlone’s testimony for our substantive review.', 'Even if the issue had been properly preserved, however, we would conclude that the\nadmission of Carlone’s testimony did not constitute prejudicial error.', 'As noted above, to\nsuccessfully challenge a trial justice’s admission of evidence as impermissibly bolstering or\nvouching, a party must demonstrate not only that such bolstering or vouching actually occurred,\nbut also that it “constituted prejudicial error with respect to the defendant.” State v. Kausel, 68\nA.3d 524, 532 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Adefusika, 989 A.2d at 476).', 'Assuming without deciding that Carlone’s testimony constituted impermissible bolstering\nor vouching, we are convinced that the admission of this testimony did not amount to prejudicial\nerror in this case. The statement at issue was brief and without follow-up.', 'Unlike in State v.\nBrash, 512 A.2d 1375 (R.I. 1986), where the bolstering testimony of two witnesses, an FBI agent\nand a state police lieutenant, was pointedly “offered for the purpose of supporting [the witness’s]\ncredibility,” Brash, 512 A.2d at 1381, here, Carlone’s brief statement was a non-responsive\nanswer to the state’s inquiry as to whether Carlone smelled alcohol on Jonathan’s breath. The\nstate was not asking whether Carlone thought Jonathan had been assaulted.', 'Moreover, Jonathan was subject to intense cross-examination at trial, providing the jury\nwith its own opportunity to assess Jonathan’s credibility. See Rushlow, 32 A.3d at 900 (holding\nthat the admission of impermissible vouching or bolstering was not prejudicial error because of\n“the jurors’ sufficient opportunity to judge [the complaining witness’s] truthfulness” through\ncross-examination).', 'Also, the trial justice provided detailed jury instructions, including a\nreference to Carlone’s testimony, with specific instructions that the jury not afford a police', '-8-\nofficer’s testimony “any more credibility or less credibility merely because that person is a police\nofficer.”', 'Thus, the jury had “ample opportunity to form an independent opinion about\n[Jonathan’s] credibility[.]” State v. Higham, 865 A.2d 1040, 1046 (R.I. 2004).

Early in the morning of October 25, 2011, as she was\nleaving for work, the complaining witness, Dilcia Lora, was viciously attacked by a masked\nassailant in the front hall of her home and was severely cut on her face with a small blade.\nMs. Lora subsequently identified her attacker as the defendant, Jose A. Breton a.k.a. Pappi\nValdez, a man with whom she had previously had a two-year-long romantic relationship. In a\nthree-count information, the defendant was charged with one count of assault with a dangerous\nweapon and one count of simple assault on Ms. Lora. The third count was for a simple assault\nagainst Ms. Lora’s daughter, Jani Tolentino, which was alleged to have occurred on May 26,\n2010. When the case was reached for trial, the defendant was convicted of the two counts of\nassault against Ms. Lora, but he was acquitted of the third count against Ms. Tolentino. The\ndefendant filed a motion for a new trial, which the trial justice denied. 1 It is from that ruling that\nthe defendant has timely appealed, arguing that the trial justice misconstrued the evidence when\n1', 'On count 1 defendant was sentenced to twenty years, eleven to serve, nine years suspended,\nwith nine years of probation. On count 2, he was sentenced to one year to serve, suspended with\nprobation to run concurrently with count 1.', '-1-\nhe found Ms. Lora to be a more credible witness than the alibi witnesses produced by the\ndefendant. We have examined the record and have considered the written submissions and oral\narguments advanced by the parties. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the\njudgment of conviction.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On May 26, 2010, Ms. Lora and defendant had an argument, during the course of which\ndefendant struck and pushed Ms. Lora’s daughter, Jani Tolentino. The police were called, but\nwhen they arrived, Ms. Lora told them that she did not know defendant’s real name, only his\nalias, “Pappi Valdez,” and that they had been dating for only three months when in fact they had\nbeen dating for two years. At trial, Ms. Lora explained that she had not been truthful with the\npolice because she was afraid of what defendant would do if she reported him to law\nenforcement.', 'According to Ms. Lora, she and defendant had been in a two-year relationship that had\nbeen replete with assaults and threats. The romance, she said, came to an end in December 2010.\nHowever, Ms. Lora said that she never explained to defendant that the relationship was over and\nthat she never “officially” broke up with him, but instead she simply left the country. Ms. Lora\nsaid that she went to the Dominican Republic to stay with her mother, remaining there for\napproximately two months. Ms. Lora did not tell defendant she was leaving the country or\nwhere she would be going, nor did she inform her mother why she had come to stay. However,\nshortly after she got to the Dominican Republic, defendant showed up at her mother’s house,\nunexpected and uninvited. The defendant repeatedly asked Ms. Lora to resume their relationship\nand he promised to enter counseling. But Ms. Lora was unmoved, and, when she refused to get\nback together with him, he left.', '-2-', 'Ms. Lora moved to Florida and then back to Santo Domingo before finally returning to\nRhode Island in August 2011. In Rhode Island, she lived with her brother, her sister, her\ndaughter, and her niece and nephew. Eventually, Ms. Lora secured employment at Kenny\nManufacturing, where she worked with the mother of defendant’s children. Occasionally, she\nsaw defendant as he brought that woman to work but, she explained, she avoided interacting with\neither of them.', 'On October 25, 2011, as she was leaving her apartment to go to work, Ms. Lora was\naccosted by a hooded and masked assailant. Ms. Lora made an effort to defend herself with her\nhands “so he wouldn’t cut [her]” and, during the course of the struggle, she was able to pull part\nof the mask up. When she did, she recognized defendant’s nose and chin. Ms. Lora also\nrecognized the ski mask as belonging to defendant. Ms. Lora screamed for help and attempted to\ndefend herself as the attacker kept slashing at her with the knife. Ms. Lora’s brother, niece,\ndaughter, and sister, hearing her screams, rushed to her aid. When they arrived, the assailant\nceased attacking Ms. Lora, fled the apartment building and ran down the street. Lisandro, Ms.\nLora’s brother, chased the assailant out of the building but was unable to catch him. Ms. Lora\nimmediately told her family that “Pappi” had cut her.', 'At the hospital, Ms. Lora informed the doctors that Jose Breton had cut her face, that she\nhad been in a relationship with him for a long time, that he “always threatened [her]” and that\nshe had never before reported the abuse because she feared that he “would leave [her]\nparalyzed.” She also told the medical personnel that defendant had followed her to the\nDominican Republic and had confronted her at her mother’s house. Although Ms. Lora related\nthese events to the doctors, she did not immediately notify the police about who had attacked her\nbecause she was still afraid of defendant.', 'However, the following day Ms. Lora advised', '-3-\nDet. Emilio Matos of the Providence police department that defendant had assaulted her, that she\nknew it was him because of his height and build, and that she recognized the “little bit” of his\nface that had become uncovered when she tugged on the mask. She also explained that “the only\nperson threatening [her] was [defendant]. And he was always threatening [her] if [she] left him\nhe was going to kill [her], this that [sic], that he was going to take [her] eyes out, that he was\ngoing to leave [her] paralyzed.”', 'At trial, the attending emergency room physician, Dr. Leo Kowayashi, testified that\nMs. Lora presented with three lacerations above her right eye as well as a large deep laceration to\nthe left side of her face, and that these wounds would result in permanent scarring. Ana Cruz,\ndefendant’s mother, testified for her son. She said that she had brought defendant to New York\nCity on October 24, 2011, the day before the assault, dropping him off there as she traveled to\nVirginia for a funeral service for a recently deceased family member. She said that she rented a\nminivan at the T.F. Green Airport in Warwick, on October 24, 2011, traveled to New York City\nwith defendant, and arrived in Manhattan around 3:30 a.m. on October 25, 2011. Ms. Cruz\ntestified that she left defendant in Manhattan and picked up other family members who were\ngoing to the funeral, and that defendant went to stay with her brother’s former girlfriend, “Fam,”\nfor the day in Brooklyn. Ms. Cruz produced receipts for the rental car, gas, and tolls for the trip\nto Virginia. She testified that she returned the rental van on October 26, 2011.', 'Femije Tairi, or “Fam,” testified that defendant’s mother called her on October 24, and\nasked if defendant could stay with her because there were too many people going to the funeral\nand not everyone could afford to go. She said that she met Ms. Cruz and defendant in Manhattan\nearly in the morning on October 25, 2011, and Ms. Cruz picked up other family members;\nMs. Tairi said that she then drove with defendant back to her home in Brooklyn, where she lived', '-4-\nwith her daughter and two small sons. She testified that she and defendant arrived at her home\naround 4 a.m., at which point they started talking about the deceased family member and\n“goofing around like normal families” before making breakfast at about 6 a.m. The defendant’s\naunt, Marilyn Castillo, arrived around 6:15 a.m. “to grieve,” and Ms. Tairi explained that “[w]e\nhave our own way of grieving.” According to Ms. Tairi, defendant stayed in Brooklyn until after\n10 p.m., at which point she transported him back to Manhattan to meet his mother for the return\ntrip to Rhode Island. 2', 'The jury returned a guilty verdict on counts 1 and 2, but acquitted defendant on count 3.\nWhen defendant was heard on his motion for a new trial, he argued that the verdict was against\nthe weight of the evidence because it was based primarily on the credibility and reliability of\nMs. Lora in identifying defendant as her assailant. The defendant challenged Ms. Lora’s ability\nto identify her attacker, arguing that an accurate identification was impossible given that the\nattack began and ended in a matter of seconds in a poorly lit stairwell. Additionally, he pointed\nto the fact that it took her over a day to identify defendant as her assailant to the police after she\ninitially lied to them. And when she finally did, he argued, she did not describe defendant’s\nspecific facial features to them. Finally, defendant argued that the state was unable to cast doubt\non the unimpeached testimony of his alibi witnesses. 3', 'Standard of Review', 'Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that “[o]n motion of\nthe defendant the court may grant a new trial to the defendant if required in the interest of\n2', 'Ms. Castillo testified that Ms. Tairi had invited her to have breakfast on October 24 as a\n“family reunion[] [on] the occurrences of my cousin’s death.” She arrived there with her two\nchildren around 6 a.m., when she had breakfast with Ms. Tairi, her nieces, and defendant.\n3', 'The defendant argued for the first time, in his supplemental Rule 12A statement and at oral\narguments before this Court, that the trial justice’s decision demonstrated “a cultural bias or\nignorance.” After reviewing the record, we see no merit to this argument.', '-5-\njustice.” The trial justice’s role in reviewing a motion for a new trial is that of the proverbial\n“superjuror” who independently weighs the evidence and assesses the credibility of the\nwitnesses. Battle v. State, 125 A.3d 130, 132 (R.I. 2015). “Specifically, ‘the trial justice must\n(1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of\nthe witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would\nhave reached a result different from that reached by the jury.’” State v. Offley, 131 A.3d 663,\n674 (R.I. 2016) (quoting State v. Heredia, 10 A.3d 443, 446 (R.I. 2010)). “If, after conducting\nsuch a review, the trial justice reaches the same conclusion as the jury, the verdict should be\naffirmed and the motion for a new trial denied.” State v. Gregson, 113 A.3d 393, 398 (R.I. 2015)\n(quoting State v. Mathews, 88 A.3d 375, 388 (R.I. 2014)). In the end, we will not disturb the\ndecision of a trial justice on a motion for a new trial unless the decision is clearly wrong or “the\ntrial justice overlooked or misconceived material and relevant evidence * * *.” Battle, 125 A.3d\nat 132 (quoting Gomes v. Rosario, 79 A.3d 1262, 1265 (R.I. 2013)).', 'Analysis', 'At the outset of his decision, the trial justice acknowledged that the state’s “case rises and\nfalls on the shoulders of the [s]tate’s first witness Dilcia Lora.” He also said that he had\n“listened carefully” to defense counsel’s arguments and that he did not “overlook the various\npoints made” by him. These included the poor lighting, the fact the assailant was wearing a\nmask during an attack that occurred in a matter of seconds, Ms. Lora’s inability to identify the\nweapon used, and her refusal to identify defendant or reveal her prior relationship with him.\nNonetheless, the trial justice found her to be a credible witness. In so doing, the trial justice, in\nevaluating her testimony, said he sought to “understand the circumstances, the background, the', '-6-\nrelationship, between Ms. Lora and this defendant in weighing, sifting, and evaluating some of\nthe contradictions and omissions * * *.”', 'For that, he looked to Ms. Tolentino’s testimony, which he also found credible. Even\nthough defendant was acquitted of the assault charge related to her, the trial justice said that it\nwas helpful that she “did describe the nature of [the relationship between Ms. Lora and\ndefendant] and the dynamics of that relationship and the conduct exhibited by this defendant\ntowards her mother in the period of time leading up to the events related to these specific\ncharges.” Finding their testimony to be genuine, he summarized,', '“[t]here is no question in observing those two cases, mother and', 'daughter on this witness stand either it was an academy award', 'acting performance or it was a legitimate and sincere display of', 'fear but there is no question in this [c]ourt’s mind, I have not seen', 'witnesses testify in the manner that they testified aside from what', 'they said but the manner of delivery how they positioned', 'themselves on the witness stand, it didn’t strike me as contrived or', 'an act. It seemed like a sincere display of their feeling towards this', 'defendant.”', 'The trial justice did not stop there, however, and he went on to address the credibility of\nthe defendant’s alibi witnesses, all of whom placed him in New York at the time of the attack.\nDuring the defendant’s argument on his motion for a new trial, the trial justice specifically\nquestioned the alibi testimony regarding having the family gathering at 6 to 7 a.m. to\nmemorialize a decedent.', 'The trial justice asked defense counsel to address the timing,\ncommenting specifically:', '“[It] just so happened that is exactly the time that this assault', 'occurred. And, of course, they identified the defendant as sitting at', 'the table. I mean, I mean, I know there are different cultures and', 'different ways that people do things and [sic] but isn’t that an odd', 'time of day to gather little children and let’s all sit around and that', 'is the time you pick to memorialize this person who died.', '“* * *', '-7-', '“I just thought it peaked [sic] my interest at the time of the day that', 'took place.”\nIn response, defense counsel dismissed any suggestion that the time of day was odd, reasoning\nthat it was natural under the circumstances to hold a family gathering at that time of the day:', '“So if he arrives 3:30, 4:00 in the morning what is he', 'supposed to go to sleep at four a.m. or something. Of course they', 'are going to be up, and you cook breakfast, you know, young kids', 'have breakfast 6:30 seven in the morning. They get up early. So,', 'again, it was not just, not just a gathering for the memorial it was', 'also to see my client, too. Because the mother was coming into', 'town and they needed to pick my client up.

I think she arrived', 'little after six she said.”\nHowever, the trial justice rejected the testimony of the alibi witnesses when he weighed it against\nthe testimony of Ms. Lora, Ms. Tolentino, and the history of Ms. Lora’s relationship with the\ndefendant. The trial justice opined that', '“[w]hen you take that testimony and weigh it against what', 'Ms. Lora and her daughter had to say and the history of that', 'relationship up to that point, I can’t say I disagree with the jury’s', 'conclusion that the alibi would not be accepted based on the', 'recitation of those witnesses.”\nWe are of the opinion that the trial justice satisfied his obligations when he considered and\ndecided the defendant’s motion for a new trial, and that he was well within his discretion when\nhe found the state’s witnesses to be credible, despite any inconsistencies in their testimony.

On March 31, 2014, a Providence County Superior\nCourt jury found the defendant, Ricardo Florez (defendant or Florez), guilty of one count of\nsecond-degree child molestation sexual assault (sexual contact with a person fourteen years of\nage or under) in violation of G.L. 1956 §§ 11-37-8.3 and 11-37-8.4. On July 29, 2014, the trial\njustice sentenced the defendant to twenty years’ imprisonment, with eight years to serve and the\nremaining time suspended with probation.1 On appeal, the defendant asserts a variety of issues\nbefore this Court. First, he contends that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new\ntrial. Next, he asserts that the trial justice’s jury charge and verdict sheet were flawed in that\nthey permitted the jury to return a non-unanimous guilty verdict. Third, the defendant argues\nthat the trial justice erred by allowing the state to improperly refresh the complainant’s\nrecollection. Finally, he contends that the trial justice committed reversible error by declining to\nadmit parts of the witness statement of the complainant’s father into evidence. For the reasons\nset forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.\n1', 'In addition, defendant’s sentence included a requirement to attend sex offender treatment\nprogram and to register as a sex offender upon release, and a no-contact order was entered with\nregard to the complainant.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', ""The incident giving rise to defendant's conviction occurred on August 1, 2010 at a\nMcDonald’s restaurant in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.

He testified that, as he was ordering lunch,\nJoshua approached him and told him that he had to use the bathroom. He further testified that\nJoshua was still in the bathroom when he got back to the table with the food. According to\nGlenn’s testimony, Joshua left the bathroom, came up to him, and told him “that man touched\nme;” and, when Glenn asked what he meant, Joshua replied “sexually.” Glenn recounted that\nJoshua pointed to defendant when he walked out of the bathroom.

Accordingly, the fact that the parties and the trial justice mistakenly\nbelieved that the time to file such a motion had not lapsed is of no consequence.', 'The motion\nwas untimely and thus not properly before the trial justice.', 'Nevertheless, even if we were to consider defendant’s argument with regard to his motion\nfor a new trial, it is devoid of any merit. In essence, defendant’s argument is that the trial justice\nerred by crediting Joshua’s testimony in denying his motion for a new trial because (i) the trial\njustice specifically acknowledged certain shortcomings of Joshua’s testimony; and (ii) the\nsurveillance videotape from McDonald’s contradicted Joshua’s testimony with regard to whether\nJoshua or defendant exited the bathroom first.', '“We accord great deference when we review the decision of a trial justice on a motion for\nnew trial ‘because a trial justice, being present during all phases of the trial, is in an especially\ngood position to evaluate the facts and to judge the credibility of the witnesses.’” State v.\nWhitaker, 79 A.3d 795, 804 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v.

See Bido,\n941 A.2d at 828-29.', ""We also note that the exception to the raise-or-waive rule is not available to defendant.

Thus, even if\nthis objection were in regard to duplicity, such an objection is not properly preserved for our\nreview. See State v. Fry, 130 A.3d 812, 822 (R.I. 2016). Moreover, at oral argument, defense\ncounsel speculated that such objection was not asserted with regard to duplicity, but, instead,\nmay have been an exception to the trial justice’s denial of an instruction on a lesser included\noffense.\n8', 'Specifically, prior to Joshua’s anticipated testimony with respect to a second touching,\ndefendant objected pursuant to Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, and the\nparties went off the record to discuss a possible limiting instruction.

Accordingly, counsel could (and should) reasonably have known of the rule\nof law pronounced by this Court in Saluter at the time of trial, and, thus, the exception to the\n“raise-or-waive” rule is inapplicable.', 'The defendant presents two additional last-ditch arguments to attempt to save his claim.\nFirst, he suggests that the fact that “the trial judge seemed to represent himself as the expert in\nthe subject” should warrant an exception from the raise-or-waive rule.', ""We have never\nrecognized such an exception and decline to do so today. Second, defendant attempts to liken his\ncase to State v. Dennis, 893 A.2d 250, 263 (R.I. 2006), to argue that we should find the same\n“circumstances peculiar” in that case and relax the raise-or-waive rule in the current instance.\nThere, however, we declined to deem the defendant’s argument as waived “because of the trial\njustice's explicit statement that he would not give ‘any instructions * * * regarding Miranda\nrights to [the] jury.’” Id. at 264. Such circumstances simply do not exist in the case before us.\nAccordingly, we conclude that defendant’s multiple attempts to bypass this Court’s “raise-or-\nwaive” rule are unavailing, and, thus, we do not consider his Saluter argument on appeal.\n9"", 'Notably, defendant asks this Court to “revisit its present incarnation of the ‘raise-or-waive’\nrule[,]” and, instead, adopt a framework similar to the four-principle test used by the First Circuit\nwith regard to waiver. See United States v. Krynicki, 689 F.2d 289 (1st Cir. 1982). We decline\nto do so.', '- 10 -', 'C', 'Joshua’s Witness Statement', 'In his next assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial justice erred by improperly\nallowing the state to “refresh [Joshua’s] recollection” of the second touching by using his witness\nstatement. He contends that Joshua did not testify to a lack of memory, but, instead, testified that\nhe omitted the second touching from his testimony because he was scared; thus, according to\ndefendant, a proper foundation for refreshing Joshua’s recollection had not been formed.', ""However, in ruling on defendant’s objection to Joshua’s anticipated testimony, the trial\njustice stated: “If he says no then he could impeach him with his own statement assuming that *\n* * statement is inconsistent or if he says I’m not sure I don’t remember why can’t he refresh his\nrecollection with his own statement about something that he just can’t recall on the stand.”\nAlthough he does not cite to a specific Rule of Evidence by number, this ruling makes clear that,\nwhen Joshua answered that there had not been a second touching, the trial justice’s reasoning for\nallowing use of the witness statement was based on a prior inconsistent statement under Rule\n801(d)(1)(A) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. Pursuant to that rule, the prior statement\n(Joshua’s witness statement) is admissible if “[t]he declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and is\nsubject to cross-examination concerning the statement, and the statement is inconsistent with the\ndeclarant's testimony[.]” Id. To admit a prior statement into evidence under Rule 801(d)(1)(A),\n“there must be two statements and each must be sufficiently inconsistent to render the prior\nstatement admissible.” State v.

Notably, unlike the"", ""- 11 -\nfederal rule concerning the substantive admissibility of prior inconsistent statements, “the\ninconsistent statement need not have been made while under oath subject to penalty of perjury at\na trial, hearing, deposition or other proceeding.” Id. (quoting Advisory Committee's Notes to\nRule 801 at 1052)."", 'Here, Joshua’s testimony at trial that there was no second touching was contrary to the\naccount that he had given in his witness statement, “[t]hat [defendant] grabbed [Joshua’s] hand\nand made [him] touch [defendant’s] exposed penis.” Rule 607 of the Rhode Island Rules of\nEvidence provides, in pertinent part, that “[t]he credibility of a witness may be attacked by any\nparty, including the party calling the witness * * *.” Given the inconsistency between Joshua’s\ntestimony at trial and his witness statement, it was within the trial justice’s discretion to allow the\nstate to impeach him with his prior statement.

First, he suggests that the trial justice improperly\ndenied defendant’s use of the written statement during his cross-examination of Glenn. Second,\nhe asserts that, during Officer Slack’s testimony, the trial justice improperly excluded the\nstatement based on his unfounded conclusion that the statement was already before the jury “by\nimplication.” We consider each of these contentions in turn.', 'With regard to defendant’s assertion that the trial justice excluded defendant’s use of the\nwritten statement on cross-examination of Glenn, such a suggestion is belied by the record.\nWhen defendant attempted to use Glenn’s witness statement during his questioning, the state\nobjected and a discussion at sidebar ensued.', 'Contrary to defendant’s assertion on appeal,\nhowever, the trial justice did not preclude defendant’s use of the statement in cross-examination,\nargument to challenge the trial justice’s refusal to give such an instruction.

I can call the patrolman, Judge.”\nThus, the record makes pellucid that defense counsel was not precluded from questioning Glenn\nwith regard to his witness statement. Instead, defense counsel abandoned his strategy to question\nGlenn with respect to this statement, and, instead, opted to use it to question Officer Slack.\nAccordingly, defendant’s argument with respect to the use of Glenn’s witness statement during\nhis cross-examination must fail.', 'We turn next to defendant’s assertion that the trial justice improperly excluded the\nstatement during the examination of Officer Slack. On direct examination of the officer, defense\ncounsel asked: “I understand that you say that [Joshua] never said the man tried to touch me, but\nin the statement that I show you—[.]” At that point, he was interrupted by an objection by the\nstate, and the parties engaged in a discussion at sidebar.

At trial, Ms.\nNegron demonstrated how the intruder was choking her by putting her right hand around her\nneck in a choking fashion. 1 Ms. Negron testified that she struggled and scratched the intruder’s\narms and that, at some point during the struggle, she felt his hands at her waist. The intruder\nthreatened her, saying, “Don’t move or I’ll kill you.” During the struggle, the coat came off her\nface, allowing her to see.

This Court previously has held\nthat “an individual’s hands, when employed in such a manner as to be likely to produce\nsubstantial bodily harm, may properly be qualified as a dangerous weapon.” State v.

We are satisfied that the complainant’s testimony\nis sufficient to support the conviction on the charge of assault with a dangerous weapon.\nRegardless of the injuries actually suffered by the complainant, this Court agrees with the trial\njustice’s statement that “a choke, if carried to its natural conclusion, would probably cause\ndeath.” This Court has repeatedly held that “[t]he test is not whether serious bodily injury results\nfrom the assault, but whether the object was so used that serious bodily injury may have\nresulted.” State v.

In that statement, which was admitted\ninto evidence at the suppression hearing, Morin said that he had touched Sally‟s vagina on\nseveral occasions over the previous six months. He explained that he had stopped doing this\n“sometime [sic] ago” because “[t]here was no thrill” in it for him.', 'At the conclusion of the testimony, Morin argued that his statement to police should be\nsuppressed as the fruit of an illegal arrest. He urged the trial justice to reject New York v. Harris,\n495 U.S. 14, 21 (1990), in which the United States Supreme Court declined to apply the\nexclusionary rule to statements obtained after a warrantless arrest in a home. In response, the\nprosecutor argued that Harris should control the trial justice‟s decision. He also suggested that,\nunder the factors articulated in State v. Jennings, 461 A.2d 361, 368 (R.I. 1983), the exclusionary\nrule should not apply to Morin‟s statement to police.\n7', 'It appears that Officer Green was identified only by his surname in the record. He did not\ntestify at the suppression hearing; the prosecutor advised the court that “without refreshing his\nrecollection from documents,” Officer Green was unable to remember “anything” about Morin‟s\narrest.', '-4-', 'The trial justice stated that Harris “ought to control.” He found that Officer Green\n“[p]lainly” had “probable cause to arrest [Morin].” Crediting Brandstromskelding‟s testimony\nregarding the confrontation between Morin and his wife, the trial justice found that Officer\nGreen “would have truly been derelict in his responsibilities if he did not act as he acted [in\narresting Morin].” Having concluded that Morin was legally arrested, the trial justice heard\nargument regarding whether Morin had knowingly and voluntarily waived his Miranda rights.\nHe then concluded that the prosecution', '“ha[d] satisfied its burden [to prove] by clear and convincing', 'evidence that [Morin] comprehended all of his Miranda rights and', 'voluntarily, without coercion of any kind on the part of the police,', 'decided to speak with the [police], and that his decision was a', 'product of his free and intelligent choice.”\nAccordingly, he denied Morin‟s motion to suppress his statement to the police.', 'Morin then moved to redact certain portions of that statement. Specifically, he sought to\nredact the portion of the statement in which he had told police that he had sought counseling in\nthe past and that he “wish[ed] to seek further counseling” in connection with his sexual habits.\nAdditionally, he also asked the trial justice to redact two lines of the statement containing\nextremely crude language.8 The trial justice rejected Morin‟s argument that he would be unfairly\nprejudiced if the jury were allowed to consider the statement in its entirety. The case then\nproceeded to trial.', 'B', 'Trial', 'Jury selection began and concluded on November 2, 2009. That day, the state dismissed\ncount 3 under Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. Counts 1 and 2\n8', 'We discuss the pertinent portion of Morin‟s statement in part III-B, infra.', '-5-\n(first- and second-degree child molestation, respectively) were tried before a jury on November\n3-4, 2009. The state presented testimony from three witnesses: Sally, Brandstromskelding, and\nDet. Dicomitis.', 'Sally was the first witness to testify. In September 1992, she was eight years old and\nlived with her mother, her younger siblings, and her stepfather, Morin. She testified that she and\nher siblings would sometimes play “the naked game,” which she described as “just get[ting]\nnaked and run[ning] around like, you know, kids do.” She described an incident that occurred\nsometime in or around September 1992, when she was playing the naked game with her siblings\nin the living room. That day, when she was naked and sitting on Morin‟s lap, Morin touched her\nvagina and digitally penetrated her.', 'Sally described another incident that occurred around the same time period. After she\nhad a bad dream, Morin got into bed with her. At first, Sally testified that she “[didn‟t] really --\nknow if [Morin] touched [her] or not.” When asked where Morin‟s hands were during that\nincident, Sally said that she “[didn‟t] really remember too much, but maybe like around my\nwaist.” Later, however, she testified that he had rubbed her vagina over her undergarments.', 'In September 1992, Sally testified, she told her babysitter (whose name she could not\nrecall) about what had happened with Morin. She also remembered speaking with someone\nnamed Marta about the abuse. She testified that she did not tell her mother about the incidents of\nmolestation because she “didn‟t think that [her mother] would believe [her].”', 'On cross-examination, Sally stated that she did not remember anything about meeting\nwith Brandstromskelding, even after Morin‟s counsel attempted to refresh her recollection by\nhaving her review Brandstromskelding‟s notes of their conversation. Sally also admitted that,', '-6-\nduring a pretrial proceeding, she had not mentioned the incident in the bedroom. She did not\nrecall going to the police station and speaking with Det. Dicomitis on September 28, 1992.', 'Because the trial testimony of Brandstromskelding and Det. Dicomitis largely mirrored\ntheir testimony at the suppression hearing, we discuss the relevant portions of their trial\ntestimony in our analysis rather than summarize their testimony in this portion of the opinion.\nOn cross-examination, both Brandstromskelding and Det. Dicomitis testified that Sally had not\ntold them about the incident in which Morin touched her in her bedroom.', 'Over Morin‟s\nobjection, his statement to police was admitted as a full exhibit through Det. Dicomitis.', 'The state then rested. After the trial justice denied Morin‟s motion for a judgment of\nacquittal, pursuant to Rule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, Morin rested\nas well. On November 4, 2009, the jury returned a verdict, finding Morin guilty on count 1 and\nnot guilty on count 2.', 'Morin filed a motion for a new trial on November 17, 2009, pursuant to Rule 33 of the\nSuperior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.9 The trial justice heard arguments on that motion\non January 27, 2010. Morin argued that the jury‟s verdict—guilty on count 1 and not guilty on\ncount 2—was “confused * * * and perhaps * * * logically inconsistent.” In response, the\nprosecutor suggested that Morin‟s “acquittal on count 2 provides an additional measure of\ncomfort in the verdict itself.”', 'The trial justice stated that he was “well satisfied that [Sally‟s] claim of digital\npenetration was truthful.”', 'He also indicated that he was “completely satisfied, beyond a\nreasonable doubt, that [Morin] engaged in this activity specifically for the purpose of sexual\n9', 'On December 17, 2009, one month after filing his original motion for a new trial, Morin filed\nan amended motion for a new trial. Because Morin withdrew this amended motion on January\n27, 2010, when the trial justice heard arguments on his original motion for a new trial, we do not\naddress it.', '-7-\ngratification or arousal.” Furthermore, he agreed with the prosecutor that Morin‟s acquittal on\ncount 2 strengthened, rather than weakened, his confidence in the verdict. The trial justice\nconcluded that, “based upon [his] independent assessment of the evidence, * * * [Morin] was\nguilty beyond a reasonable doubt as to the charge of first-degree child molestation as alleged.”\nAccordingly, he denied Morin‟s motion for a new trial.', 'At a hearing on March 24, 2010, the trial justice sentenced Morin to forty years\nimprisonment, with fifteen years to serve and twenty-five years suspended, with probation.\nJudgment of conviction entered on June 14, 2010. Morin timely appealed to this Court.10', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'Morin raises three issues on appeal. First, he argues that the trial justice erred in denying\nhis motion to suppress evidence, which was directed at the statement he gave to Det. Dicomitis.\nAs he did below, he contends that this statement should be suppressed as the fruit of an unlawful\narrest.', 'Second, he maintains that the trial justice should have redacted a portion of that\nstatement, which he describes as “irrelevant and highly prejudicial.” Lastly, Morin argues that\nthe trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial. We address each of his contentions in\nturn.\n10', 'Appeals filed prior to the entry of final judgment are considered timely. See State v.\nDeRobbio, 62 A.3d 1113, 1118 n.7 (R.I. 2013) (citing Chapdelaine v. State, 32 A.3d 937, 941\nn.1 (R.I. 2011)).', '-8-', 'III', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Motion to Suppress', 'In Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 576 (1980), the United States Supreme Court held\nthat “the Fourth Amendment * * * prohibits the police from making a warrantless and\nnonconsensual entry into a suspect‟s home in order to make a routine felony arrest.” Relying on\nPayton, Morin argues that the trial justice should have suppressed his statement to police as the\nfruit of an illegal arrest. Although Payton, 445 U.S. at 590, explicitly authorized warrantless in-\nhome arrests made under “exigent circumstances,” Morin contends that the trial justice did not\n“explicitly” find that exigent circumstances justified his arrest.', 'Although the trial justice did not make an explicit finding of exigent circumstances, our\nreview of the record shows that this finding was implicit in his decision to deny Morin‟s motion\nto suppress. The trial justice characterized Brandstromskelding as “a detached state officer” and\ncredited her description of the confrontation that ensued at Morin‟s residence after his wife\nlearned that he had admitted to molesting Sally. He also credited her testimony that she called\npolice and requested them to come immediately after Morin‟s wife slammed a butcher knife into\nthe kitchen table. He found that “with the overall heightened concern that had arisen out of\nviolence, * * * [Officer Green] would have truly been derelict in his responsibilities if he did not\nact as he acted [in arresting Morin].”', 'Likewise, we conclude that exigent circumstances justified Morin‟s warrantless arrest in\nhis home. Officer Green had received information that a violent confrontation had taken place\nand that Morin‟s wife was (quite understandably) enraged after finding out that Morin had', '-9-\nmolested Sally. As the trial justice noted, Morin‟s admissions to Brandstromskelding, which she\nrelayed to police, “[p]lainly” furnished probable cause to arrest him. The trial justice further\nobserved that “if anybody was to be removed [from the house] at that point, it seems to me it\nwould have been [Morin], who had caused the escalation of the violence as a result of [his]\nstatements * * *.” In these circumstances, Officer Green must have “ha[d] a reasonable belief\nthat his assistance [was] required to avert a crisis.”11 See State v. Goulet, 21 A.3d 302, 313 (R.I.\n2011) (quoting Duquette v. Godbout, 471 A.2d 1359, 1362 (R.I. 1984)); see also State v. Portes,\n840 A.2d 1131, 1137 (R.I. 2004) (“This Court is mindful that police are in the emergency service\nbusiness and they usually have little or no time to leisurely consider their options or engage in\nprotracted evaluation.”).', 'Morin also urges this Court to reject New York v. Harris, 495 U.S. 14, 21 (1990), in\nwhich the United States Supreme Court declined to apply the exclusionary rule to statements\nobtained after a warrantless arrest in violation of Payton. In light of our conclusion that Morin\nwas validly arrested under Payton because exigent circumstances existed, we need not consider\nwhether the Rhode Island constitution requires us to apply a broader exclusionary rule. See In re\nBrown, 903 A.2d 147, 151 (R.I. 2006) (“Neither this Court nor the Superior Court should\ndecide constitutional issues unless it is absolutely necessary to do so.”); see also State v. Werner,\n615 A.2d 1010, 1014 (R.I. 1992) (“[S]tate courts should respect the manner in which [the Fourth\nAmendment] is interpreted by the Supreme Court.”).\n11', 'In most cases, the testimony of the arresting officer should provide the basis for the conclusion\nthat he or she reasonably believed that exigent circumstances existed. Under the facts of this\ncase, we conclude that, although Officer Green did not testify at the suppression hearing, “the\ncircumstances, viewed objectively, justify [his] action[s]” because Brandstromskelding‟s\ntestimony sufficiently demonstrated the existence of exigent circumstances. See Brigham City,\nUtah v. Stuart, 547 U.S. 398, 404 (2006) (quoting Scott v. United States, 436 U.S. 128, 138\n(1978)).', '- 10 -', 'Although Morin argues that the trial justice should have suppressed his statement to\npolice as the fruit of an unlawful arrest, he has not pressed on appeal any additional grounds for\nsuppression. Because we hold that Morin was validly arrested, and because we perceive no error\nwith the trial justice‟s conclusion that Morin knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waived his\nMiranda rights, we affirm his decision to deny Morin‟s suppression motion.', 'B', 'Redaction', 'Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence allows a trial justice to exclude relevant\nevidence “if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice * *\n*.” “[A] trial justice‟s discretion to exclude evidence under Rule 403 must be used sparingly.”\nState v. DeJesus, 947 A.2d 873, 883 (R.I. 2008). He or she must exclude evidence that is\n“marginally relevant and enormously prejudicial.” Id. This Court will affirm a trial justice‟s\nevidentiary ruling under Rule 403 “absent an abuse of discretion.” DeJesus, 947 A.2d at 883.', 'Morin moved to redact portions of his statement which contained references to\ncounseling; he also requested redaction of two lines which contained crude language. The\npertinent portion of his statement, including those two lines, is below:', '“Q: You freely admit that you have sexually touched your', 'daughter [Sally] and you feel that it is a problem that you', 'have.

I just wanted to stop it. I stopped it all on my own.”', 'After Morin argued that he would be unfairly prejudiced if the trial justice admitted his\nstatement to police without redacting the portion of his statement reproduced above, the trial\njustice stated:', '“I think it‟s part and parcel and relevant to what he', 'says. He * * * says the reason [he sought] counseling was,', '* * * for „paper pussy‟ magazines; and, the officer says,', 'what do you mean by that? He says, it‟s to cut out and', 'masturbate with them.

And, he says,', 'because it was something new.', '“I think these statements are quite relevant to the', 'rest of the statement; I‟m not going to redact them at all.', 'The motion to redact is denied.”', 'Having considered the contested portion in the context of Morin‟s entire statement, as\nwell as the remainder of the evidence against him—including Sally‟s damning testimony—we\nhold that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in admitting the statement in its entirety.\nRegarding the reference to “paper pussy,” any prejudice that may have inhered to Morin from\nthat crass and offensive phrase was undoubtedly overshadowed by the most prejudicial aspect of\nhis statement: his admission that he had molested his stepdaughter. While that phrase may well\nhave raised some eyebrows among the jury, Morin‟s explanation of why he molested Sally—\nbecause “[i]t was something new” after he stopped masturbating to pornographic magazines—\nwas highly relevant evidence. Furthermore, as the trial justice recognized, the references to\ncounseling were “part and parcel” of Morin‟s explanation of his behavior.', 'Morin claims that “[t]he distinct possibility existed that the jurors would be so disturbed\nby learning of [his] private sexual activities, legal though they might be, that they would be\nunfairly prejudiced against him and fail to analyze the evidence in an objective manner.”', '- 12 -\nHowever, his acquittal on count 2 proves that the jury did, in fact, analyze the evidence\nobjectively. The trial justice did not err in refusing to redact Morin‟s statement to police.', 'C', 'Motion for a New Trial', '“When deciding whether to grant or deny a motion for a new trial, the trial justice acts as\na thirteenth juror.” State v.

Diamante, 83 A.3d 546, 548 (R.I. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nOnly when a statute is ambiguous do we “apply the rules of statutory construction and examine the\nstatute in its entirety to determine the intent and purpose of the Legislature.” Id.

The statutory language does not require that a sentencing\njustice set a particular date when a defendant will be eligible for parole.

Mr. Paiva was sentenced under the statute to\nfifteen years, with ten years thereof being non-parolable. In so doing, the sentencing justice\ncorrectly complied with the statute at issue by ordering Mr. Paiva to “serve a minimum number of\nyears of the sentence before he * * * becomes eligible for parole.” Section 12-19-21(b).

This case came before the Supreme Court for\noral argument on November 27, 2018, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and\nshow cause why the issues raised should not summarily be decided. After hearing the arguments\nof counsel and examining the memoranda filed on behalf of the parties, we conclude that cause\n1', 'It appears from the record that D’Amico was released from prison in September 2011, although\nthe basis for his release, whether on parole or at the expiration of his sentence, remains unclear.', '-1-\nhas not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For\nthe reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgments of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Around 11:30 on the morning of November 23, 2011, Khurshid Siddiq and Edwin\nCowgen were enjoying a smoke break outside a 7-Eleven convenience store on Charles Street in\nProvidence. Siddiq, the franchisee and manager of the store, and Cowgen, a 7-Eleven “field\nconsultant,” noticed a man wearing sweatpants and a hooded sweatshirt enter the 7-Eleven and\ngrab a drink from the cooler. The man’s hood was pulled tightly about his face, leaving only the\narea between his eyebrows and upper lip visible. Siddiq later testified that, despite the man’s\ngarb, he could see that the man had a “light moustache” and “sunken eyes.” Siddiq testified that,\nfrom inside the store, the man pointed at them and gestured for them to come inside. They did so,\nbelieving that the man was a customer. To their chagrin, however, the hooded man was not in\nthe store to make a purchase, and he soon proclaimed his intentions with the blunt,\nstraightforward announcement: “This is a robbery.”', 'Cowgen immediately stepped aside and told the robber that he was not an employee of\nthe establishment. The man displayed what Siddiq and Cowgen both believed to be a handgun\nand demanded all the cash in the register, roughly $400, as well as some cigars and cigarettes.\nDuring the encounter, a customer approached the counter to make a purchase, but was rebuffed\nby the hooded character, who, according to Cowgen, told the customer, “turn the f around or I’ll\nrob you old man.” All told, the robbery lasted between two and four minutes, and it was\nrecorded in its entirety from several angles by the store’s surveillance cameras.', '-2-', 'Eventually, the cowled figure concluded the heist, and Siddiq watched him on a video\ncamera as he walked away from the store. As soon as the robber left the premises, Cowgen “hit\nthe panic button” to call the police. When the police arrived, Cowgen and Siddiq provided\nstatements to the responding officers, and Cowgen gave police a basic description of the culprit.', 'The Providence police officers circulated an email throughout the department containing\na photograph of the unknown robber, that had been harvested from surveillance video at the 7-\nEleven.', 'After two officers suggested that the hooded figure in the photograph might be\nD’Amico, police responded to his residence, which was, coincidentally, but a short distance from\nthe crime scene.', 'In January 2012, the state filed a Rule 32(f) violation report in the Superior Court,\nalleging that D’Amico had violated the terms and conditions of his probation in the two\nunderlying criminal cases by robbing the 7-Eleven convenience store two months earlier. 2 A\ntwo-day violation hearing was held in May 2012, at which both Siddiq and Cowgen testified for\nthe state. Also, D’Amico presented testimony by a Providence police detective who investigated\nthe robbery.', 'Siddiq testified that, sometime after the robbery occurred, Providence police showed him\na photographic array consisting of pictures of six different individuals.', 'A photograph of\nD’Amico was included in the array. Siddiq said that, after he examined the photographs one by\none, he circled the photograph of D’Amico, signed his name, and wrote “This is the guy who has\nrobbed us.” He also testified that he had seen the hooded man in the store on one or two prior\noccasions. Siddiq also identified D’Amico, from the witness stand, as the man who had held up\nthe store. When pressed to explain the level of confidence he had in his identification, he\n2', 'A separate criminal complaint filed against D’Amico relating to the November 23, 2011\nrobbery was later dismissed.', '-3-\ntestified that, although he was not one hundred percent sure, “one cannot be a hundred percent\nsure of anything”; but he also said that there was no doubt in his mind that D’Amico was the\nperson who had robbed the 7-Eleven.', 'When Cowgen took the stand, he testified that, when police asked him to pick the robber\nout of a photo array, he remembered identifying one of the individuals in the array who he\nbelieved closely resembled the 7-Eleven robber, but that his identification had not been positive\nor conclusive because “they did have a hoody on, it was scrunched up pretty tight.” When\npressed on cross-examination, Cowgen was unable to determine which photograph in the array\nhe had previously identified for police as possibly being the assailant. When asked whether\nCowgen recognized D’Amico as he appeared in the courtroom, Cowgen testified that he did not.\nAccording to Cowgen, 7-Eleven employees are instructed that “you’re not suppose[d] to look\ninto a robber’s eyes because that’s an indication that you’re being confrontational.”', 'The state also introduced several exhibits for the hearing justice’s consideration,\nincluding the six-photograph array presented to Siddiq, video surveillance that captured the\nrobbery as it happened, and two still photographs taken from video surveillance recordings—one\nof the hooded robber’s body and face in profile and another of his partially obscured facial\nfeatures as he faced the camera.', 'The hearing justice credited Siddiq’s identification and further opined that the photograph\nof the robber’s face was a “dead ringer” for D’Amico.', 'He concluded: “I have no question in\nmy mind that the [s]tate has proved its case that Mr. D’Amico has clearly violated his terms and\nconditions of his suspended/probationary sentence[.]” Accordingly, the hearing justice removed\nthe suspended portion of the sentences previously imposed for D’Amico’s 2007 conspiracy,', '-4-\nassault, and robbery convictions, and ordered that he serve ten years’ incarceration on the\npreviously imposed concurrent sentences.', 'D’Amico did not appeal from the resulting judgments of conviction and commitment.\nFive years later, however, D’Amico filed petitions for the issuance of writs of certiorari with this\nCourt, claiming that his attorney had failed to inform him that he had a right to appeal the\nviolation hearing. We granted certiorari on September 11, 2017, and ordered that the certiorari\npetitions be consolidated on October 27, 2017.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“‘Keeping the peace and remaining on good behavior are conditions of probation,’ and\nthe sole purpose of a probation violation hearing is for the [hearing] justice to determine whether\nthe conditions of probation have been violated.” State v. Gromkiewicz, 43 A.3d 45, 48 (R.I.\n2012) (quoting State v. Waite, 813 A.2d 982, 985 (R.I. 2003)). “In determining whether or not a\ndefendant has committed a probation violation, the hearing justice is charged with weighing the\nevidence and assessing the credibility of the witnesses.” State v. Tetreault, 973 A.2d 489, 492\n(R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. Christodal, 946 A.2d 811, 816 (R.I. 2008)); see State v. Jackson,\n966 A.2d 1225, 1229 (R.I. 2009). We afford great deference to the hearing justice’s adjudication\nof a probation violation, and our review of such an adjudication “is restricted to considering\n‘whether the hearing justice acted arbitrarily or capriciously in finding a violation.’”\nGromkiewicz, 43 A.3d at 48 (quoting State v. Seamans, 935 A.2d 618, 621 (R.I. 2007)).\n“Challenges to a trial justice’s credibility determinations typically are unavailing in this Court\nbecause the assessment of witness credibility ‘in a probation violation hearing is a function of the', '-5-\n[trial] justice, not this Court.’” State v. Gibson, 126 A.3d 427, 431 (R.I. 2015) (alteration in\noriginal) (quoting Gromkiewicz, 43 A.3d at 49); see Waite, 813 A.2d at 985.', 'At the time of the violation hearing in this case, the state had only to “prove to the\nreasonable satisfaction of the hearing justice that the defendant [had] violated the terms and\nconditions of the previously imposed probation.” State v. Hazard, 68 A.3d 479, 499 (R.I. 2013)\n(quoting Gromkiewicz, 43 A.3d at 48). Significantly, a 2016 amendment to Rule 32(f) of the\nSuperior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure increased the state’s burden of proof such that it\nmust now establish “by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the defendant breached a\ncondition of the defendant’s probation or deferred sentence or failed to keep the peace or remain\non good behavior.” Super. R. Crim. P. 32(f). However, even with that change, the state’s\nburden of proof in a probation violation hearing remains “far less exacting” than that required for\na conviction in a criminal trial. Gibson, 126 A.3d at 431.', 'III', 'Discussion', 'Before this Court, D’Amico argues that the hearing justice ascribed undeserved\nevidentiary weight to the photograph of the robber and to Siddiq’s testimony and, in doing so,\nacted arbitrarily and capriciously in finding that D’Amico had violated the conditions of his\nprobation. Alternatively, he argues that his case should be remanded to the Superior Court for a\nnew probation violation hearing in accordance with the June 21, 2016 amendment to Rule 32(f)\nof the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. Because the proper standard for determining\nwhether a violation has occurred is a threshold matter, we discuss D’Amico’s alternative\nargument first.', '-6-', 'A', 'Rule 32(f)', 'D’Amico’s probation violation hearing took place in May 2012. At that time, Rule 32(f)\nrequired only that the state “prove to the reasonable satisfaction of the hearing justice” that\nD’Amico had violated the terms and conditions of his probation. Hazard, 68 A.3d at 499. That\nrule was amended a full four years later to require a higher burden of proof. In re Amendments\nto Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure and Sentencing Benchmarks, at 1 (R.I., filed June\n16, 2016) (mem.). In accordance with that amendment, the state is now required to establish “by\na fair preponderance of the evidence” that a probationer has violated the terms and conditions of\nhis probation. Super. R. Crim. P. 32(f). D’Amico argues that his case should be remanded for a\nnew probation violation hearing under the new standard because, he avers, his “violation appeal\nwas still pending” at the time the amendment was enacted “because it had not been properly\nmade[,]” and, therefore, “[t]he judgment below was, and still is, not final.”', 'We do not agree. It is true that “[t]ypically, when a new rule of criminal procedure is\nannounced during the pendency of a defendant’s direct appeal, the defendant will benefit from a\nretroactive application of that rule.” State v. Pona, 926 A.2d 592, 605 (R.I. 2007).', 'The\njudgments in this case, however, were not pending direct review when Rule 32(f) was\namended—not “because it had not been properly made” as D’Amico claims, but rather because\nthe judgments had not been appealed at all. It is here that we diverge from D’Amico’s argument;\nin our opinion, the judgments were final.', 'Judgment in these cases was entered on May 22, 2012. From that date, D’Amico had\ntwenty days to file an appeal under Article I, Rule 4 of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate\nProcedure, but he did not do so. As a result of his failure to take a timely appeal, the judgments', '-7-\nbecame final. See Marcello v. Neves, 912 A.2d 420, 420 (R.I. 2006) (mem.); Bilotti v. LaSalle,\n506 A.2d 1362, 1365 (R.I. 1986). The judgments were final in 2016 when Rule 32(f) was\namended, and they remain final today. 3 This Court’s grant of certiorari to review the judgments\ndid not act in any way to transmute the judgments from final to “pending appeal,” because there\nwas no appeal. A writ of certiorari is a matter of judicial grace and cannot be used as an end-run\naround a final judgment for the purpose of exploiting favorable changes to the Rules of Criminal\nProcedure made years after that judgment was entered. 4', 'B', 'Sufficiency of the Evidence', 'D’Amico argues that the evidence presented at his probation violation hearing was\ninsufficient to support the hearing justice’s conclusion that D’Amico had breached the terms and\nconditions of his probation and, as such, the hearing justice acted arbitrarily and capriciously\nwhen he found that he had violated the terms of his probation. After closely examining the\nrecord in this case, we can discern no error by the hearing justice.', 'The evidence in this case was more than enough to “prove to the reasonable satisfaction\nof the hearing justice that the defendant [had] violated the terms and conditions of the previously\nimposed probation.” Hazard, 68 A.3d at 499 (quoting Gromkiewicz, 43 A.3d at 48).

Indeed, it was this claim that formed the\nbasis of his petitions for certiorari. Nevertheless, whether or not D’Amico’s failure to take a\ntimely appeal was a consequence of his attorney’s advice, or lack thereof, the judgments\n“became final upon expiration of the period allowed for appeals[.]” Marcello v.

His vantage point and the amount of time\nthat elapsed during the encounter provided ample opportunity for Siddiq to identify his assailant\nwhen he later viewed the photo array.', 'Moreover, the state presented photographs of the\nsuspect—both in profile and looking toward the camera—to the hearing justice, who had the\nbenefit of studying the photographs after having heard and observed Siddiq testify.', 'D’Amico makes much of the stressful nature of the robbery, that the robber was wearing\na hood that obscured a significant portion of his face, the fact that Cowgen was unable to identify\nD’Amico in the photo array or at the violation hearing, that 7-Eleven employees are trained to\navoid eye contact with those holding up stores, and that the photographs presented to the hearing\njustice were of less than pristine quality. Nevertheless, “[i]t is the duty of the hearing justice to\nweigh the relevant, material evidence and assess the credibility of the witnesses.” Jackson, 966\nA.2d at 1229. In this case, the hearing justice heard the testimony of Siddiq and Cowgen and\ncompared pictures of the robber to D’Amico’s visage as he appeared in the courtroom. It was\nthe hearing justice’s confident opinion that the individual depicted in the photographs before\nhim, despite their grainy quality, was a “dead ringer” for D’Amico, and he chose to credit\nSiddiq’s identification of D’Amico over Cowgen’s failure to make an identification.', 'It is not a function of this Court to “second-guess” the supportable credibility assessment\nof the hearing justice at a probation violation hearing.', 'Jackson, 966 A.2d at 1229.', 'The\ndeference we afford to the hearing justice is not simply theoretical, but “is premised upon our\nrealization that we lack ‘the same vantage point as the presiding judge, and we are unable to\nassess the witness[es]’ demeanor, tone of voice, and body language.’” State v.

Green further testified that she\nknew defendant had not paid off Tavarozzi’s second loan with Countrywide. Green attested that,\nwith respect to Tavarozzi’s insurance claim, Mortgage Guarantee & Title paid off his second\nCountrywide loan.', 'Green also attested that Mortgage Guarantee & Title received a title\ninsurance claim from Aguilar alleging that defendant never disbursed the sales proceeds after\nAguilar’s closing. Green testified, however, that Mortgage Guarantee & Title had never issued a\ntitle insurance policy to Aguilar and that the closing protection letter and title insurance\ncommitment defendant gave to Aguilar were forged.', 'Next, the jury heard testimony from defendant’s alleged co-conspirator, Gostomski.\nGostomski explained that she met defendant while she was working for another real estate\nattorney and that, after leaving that attorney’s office, she remained in contact with defendant.\nGostomski testified that, in or around January 2007, Gostomski and defendant began a romantic', '-6-\nrelationship. Gostomski further attested that, by that time, defendant had opened his own real\nestate law office and, in March or April of that year, she began working for him. Gostomski\ntestified that she was defendant’s only employee, and that her position included preparing all\npre-and-post-closing documents for the office’s real estate transactions. Gostomski attested that,\nat some point during the course of her employment, she began doing “some,” but not “all,” of the\nbookkeeping. According to Gostomski, although she was not listed as a signatory on either\ndefendant’s IOLTA or business-operating account, she, with defendant’s permission, issued and\nsigned checks from both of these accounts. Gostomski testified that she did not have the ability\nto access defendant’s accounts online, but that defendant monitored both accounts’ activities\nregularly. She recounted that she “would come in usually in the morning and that was usually up\non the computer[;] what the balances were, what transactions had transpired in both accounts\n* * *.” Gostomski also testified that defendant had what she believed to be the business-\noperating account’s only ATM card.', 'According to Gostomski, in February and March 2008, the office began to unravel,\nmeaning that “a lot of things got overlooked” and “were not being handled correctly.” At this\ntime, she explained that defendant’s business-operating account was frequently overdrawn, and,\non occasion, she had transferred unearned legal fees from defendant’s IOLTA account to his\nbusiness-operating account. Gostomski testified that, even as the number of real estate closings\ncontinued to decrease, defendant never changed his spending habits. Gostomski attested that,\nwhen the business-operating account balance was really low, defendant would ask her “[w]hat do\nwe have in the pipeline?”', 'Gostomski further testified about defendant’s working relationship with Mortgage\nGuarantee & Title. Gostomski testified that, during Mortgage Guarantee & Title’s repeated', '-7-\nattempts to audit defendant, defendant instructed her to withhold certain IOLTA account\nstatements. According to Gostomski, during this time, defendant considered becoming an agent\nwith another title insurance company, but did not pursue the matter any further after the company\nrequested to review defendant’s IOLTA account statements. Gostomski testified that defendant\n“kept saying that [they] needed to open a new IOLTA account and start fresh so that there was\n[sic] no discrepancies.” She further attested that defendant would intentionally avoid Mortgage\nGuarantee & Title’s representative saying, “[H]ere comes [a representative] from Mortgage\nGuarantee. I’m going to go out the back door * * *.” Gostomski also testified that she believed\nthat she saw the cancellation notice from Mortgage Guarantee & Title on defendant’s desk.', 'Gostomski also testified about the Aguilar closing. According to Gostomski, because\nMortgage Guarantee & Title terminated defendant as an agent, she prepared the closing\nprotection letter for Aguilar’s closing by copying and pasting the letter together from previously\nauthorized letters because defendant told her that “all closings had to close.” Gostomski also\ntestified that defendant gave Aguilar the forged closing protection letter.', 'According to\nGostomski, defendant withdrew his legal fee for the Aguilar closing thirteen days before the\nclosing date because defendant needed money. Moreover, Gostomski also testified regarding\nTavarozzi’s refinancing transaction. Gostomski stated that, on July 31, 2008, after Tavarozzi\ncontacted her, she initiated a wire transfer to pay off Tavarozzi’s first Countrywide loan—\napproximately five months after the closing in February 2008. She explained that funds from\nreal estate closings are typically, in the case of a sale, disbursed immediately after the closing\nand, in the case of a refinance, disbursed three days after the closing. Gostomski testified that,\nafter Mortgage Guarantee & Title contacted defendant about Tavarozzi, “[i]t did [not] seem like\n[defendant] took it as serious as [she] did” because he left the office that day as usual.', '-8-\nGostomski also acknowledged that she had a criminal record and that defendant learned about\nthis in December 2007. 6', 'Lori Tellier, a certified public accountant, certified fraud examiner, and civilian\ninvestigator in the state police’s financial crimes unit, was the final witness to testify. As part of\nthe state police’s investigation into the allegations against defendant, Tellier conducted a forensic\naudit of defendant’s IOLTA and business-operating accounts. Tellier testified that this audit\nrevealed that defendant, in fact, on several occasions did not disburse funds to the proper payees,\ndespite having received sufficient funds from each lender prior to each transaction. Tellier\nfurther testified that defendant made improper disbursements from his IOLTA account.\nAccording to Tellier, total outflows from defendant’s IOLTA account to defendant, between\nJanuary 2007 and September 2008, totaled approximately $496,000. Tellier attested that, out of\nthe $496,000 withdrawn from defendant’s IOLTA account, only $386,678.35 was legal fees\nearned by defendant. Tellier testified that her analysis revealed a pattern wherein transfers,\nincluding online transfers, were made from defendant’s IOLTA account to his business-operating\naccount to prevent the operating account from being overdrawn.', 'Tellier determined that approximately $168,000 entrusted to defendant was not remitted\nto the proper payees. Tellier testified that defendant spent this missing client money on personal\nexpenses. She explained that defendant made over $87,000 in ATM withdrawals from his\nbusiness-operating account. Tellier further explained that, from his business-operating account,\ndefendant used the missing client money to pay the following estimated personal expenses:\n6', 'On direct examination, Gostomski acknowledged that, in 1995, she pled nolo contendere to\nembezzlement and was sentenced to an eight-year suspended term of incarceration with\nprobation. Further, in 1998, she pled nolo contendere to the fraudulent use of credit cards and\nwas sentenced to a three-year term, with two years to serve in home confinement and the\nremainder to serve on probation.

Tellier also testified about a $5,000 internet transfer from defendant’s IOLTA to\nhis business-operating account that, according to the state, coincided with his vacation to\nPennsylvania.', 'Additionally, the parties stipulated to the following facts. On June 21, 2007, defendant\nwas the settlement agent in a real estate transaction involving Frank Hennessey and Normand\nLeClair. Hennessey and LeClair, as Trustees of the Hennessey/LeClair Trust, sold real estate\nlocated in Exeter for $35,000, and, on June 21, the sales proceeds were deposited into\ndefendant’s IOLTA account. Because Hennessey and LeClair were not Rhode Island residents at\nthe time of the sale, defendant was required to withhold a total of $2,100 to pay the nonresident\nreal-estate-sales tax due to the Rhode Island Division of Taxation. The defendant never made\nany payments to the Division of Taxation to satisfy Hennesey and LeClair’s tax obligation and,\nas a result, the state withheld the taxes due from Hennesey and LeClair’s income tax refunds that\ntax year. Further, on March 17, 2008, defendant was the settlement agent in a real estate\ntransaction involving Kevin Williams, who purchased real estate located in Providence.\nWachovia Mortgage Funding, Williams’ lender, wired funds into defendant’s IOLTA account on\nMarch 17 and 18 of 2008. Out of these funds, defendant withheld $1,115.58 to pay real estate\nproperty taxes due to the City of Providence, but he never made the payment to the city.', 'At the close of the state’s case-in-chief, defendant filed a motion for judgment of\nacquittal, which was heard and denied on January 15, 2014. The defendant did not present any\nwitnesses. After deliberation, the jury found defendant guilty of three counts of embezzlement', '- 10 -\n(counts 3, 4, and 5) and of conspiracy to commit embezzlement (count 6), but acquitted\ndefendant of two other counts of embezzlement (counts 1 and 2). Thereafter, defendant filed a\nmotion for a new trial, which was heard on February 10, 2014. The defendant argued that “the\nevidence presented by the [s]tate at trial was not sufficient * * * to prove * * * guilt beyond a\nreasonable doubt * * *.” In denying the motion, the trial justice agreed with the jury’s verdict,\nfinding that the evidence of defendant’s knowledge and intent was “overwhelming.” On April\n30, 2014, the trial justice sentenced defendant to a fifteen-year term of incarceration for counts 3,\n4, and 5, to run concurrently, with four and a half years to serve, the balance suspended, with\nprobation. On the conviction for conspiracy, the trial justice sentenced defendant to a five-year\nsuspended term of incarceration, with probation, to run consecutively. Subsequently, defendant\nfiled a timely notice of appeal. 7', 'II', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new\ntrial because there was insufficient evidence to support the jury’s verdict and in “fail[ing] in his\nrole as the thirteenth juror by misconceiving the evidence.” Additionally, he argues that the trial\njustice erred in admitting Green’s fax correspondence because it was irrelevant and unfairly\nprejudicial.

He asserts\nthat the evidence adduced at trial proves only that he was negligent in monitoring his IOLTA\naccount and in supervising Gostomski. Indeed, as defendant sees it, the trial justice was clearly\nwrong in crediting Gostomski—whom he described as a “jilted girlfriend and veteran\nembezzler”—when there was evidence to suggest that she was directly responsible for these\ncrimes.', 'It is well-settled that a defendant arguing a motion for a new trial may do so on two\nbases: (1) insufficiency of the evidence and (2) weight of the evidence. State v. Clark, 974 A.2d\n558, 570-71 (R.I. 2009). Although defendant challenges the “sufficiency” of the evidence on\nappeal, which would require an examination of the trial evidence in the light most favorable to\nthe prosecution, State v. Karngar, 29 A.3d 1232, 1235 (R.I. 2011), “[defendant’s] arguments and\npresentation of the law * * * to the trial justice * * * ask[ed] that his appeal be viewed through\nthe prism of the more traditional, weight-of-the-evidence standard.” State v. Fleck, 81 A.3d\n1129, 1133 (R.I. 2014). Specifically, at the hearing on his motion for a new trial, although\ndefendant articulated that the evidence was insufficient, he nevertheless asked the trial justice,\n“sitting as * * * a thirteenth juror,” to weigh the evidence. Accordingly, we deem his argument\nas it relates to sufficiency of the evidence to be waived, and we limit our review to his weight-of-\nthe-evidence argument. See id. 8\n8', 'In any event, even if we were to deem defendant’s sufficiency-of-the-evidence argument to be\npreserved (despite his asking the trial justice to weigh the evidence), “a defendant seeking to\nprevail on a motion for a new trial based on the sufficiency of the evidence bears a heavier\nburden than does a defendant seeking to prevail on a weight of the evidence argument * * *.”\nState v. Mendez, 116 A.3d 228, 246 (R.I. 2015). Because we affirm the trial justice’s finding\nthat defendant failed to meet the lesser burden, we need not go further.', '- 12 -', '1. Standard of Review', 'When deciding a motion for a new trial based on the weight-of-the-evidence standard,\n“the trial justice acts as a thirteenth juror and exercises independent judgment on the credibility\nof witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.” State v. Watkins, 92 A.3d 172, 191 (R.I. 2014)\n(quoting State v. Clay, 79 A.3d 832, 841 (R.I. 2013)). “In so deciding, ‘the trial justice must\nconsider the evidence in light of the jury charge, then independently assess the credibility of the\nwitnesses and the weight of the evidence, and also ultimately determine whether he or she would\nhave reached a result different from that reached by the jury.’” Id. (quoting Clay, 79 A.3d at 841-\n42). “If, after conducting this independent review, the trial justice agrees with the jury’s verdict\nor if the evidence is such that reasonable minds could differ as to the outcome, the motion for a\nnew trial should be denied.” Id.

The fourth step of the analysis requires the trial justice to\n“determine whether the verdict is against the fair preponderance of the evidence and fails to do\nsubstantial justice.

The defendant contends that the state\nfailed to prove that he intentionally converted his clients’ property.', 'After a careful review of the trial transcript and exhibits, it is our opinion that the trial\njustice did not overlook or misconceive material evidence, and that he articulated sufficient\ngrounds for denying defendant’s motion for a new trial. The trial justice found that the evidence\nof defendant’s knowledge and intent was “overwhelming.” He described the “significant paper\ntrail” introduced through Tellier’s extensive testimony.', 'Further, he considered Tellier’s\ntestimony that transfers from defendant’s IOLTA to his business-operating account coincided\nwith vacations and that the amount of income defendant received significantly exceeded the legal\nfees he earned. He determined that the witness testimony and documentary evidence were\nsufficient to support defendant’s convictions. The trial justice’s findings were all supported by\nthe record, and the evidence presented at trial met the necessary elements to convict defendant of', '- 14 -\nembezzlement.', 'With respect to counts 3, 4, and 5, defendant was the settlement agent for each transaction\nand, accordingly, he was entrusted with funds for the specific purpose of disbursing those funds\nafter each closing. As Tellier testified, defendant’s bank records showed that, prior to each\ntransaction, he received sufficient funds to make the required disbursements. Tellier further\ntestified that defendant’s bank records showed that, in each of these transactions, he never\ndisbursed the funds to the proper payee. In the case of Aguilar (count 5), defendant received\n$126,215.97 from Aguilar’s lender, which he was required to disburse to the seller after the\nclosing. The defendant never made this disbursement. In the case of Tavarozzi (count 3),\ndefendant received $147,862.27 from Tavarozzi’s lender—$36,224.78 of which should have\nbeen disbursed to Countrywide to pay off Tavarozzi’s second mortgage loan. The defendant,\nagain, never made this disbursement.', 'And, in the case of Williams (count 4), defendant\nstipulated that he never disbursed $1,115.58 to the City of Providence on behalf of Williams.', 'It is also our opinion that the trial justice did not overlook material evidence when\ndeciding that the evidence adduced at trial established the intent element of embezzlement. The\ntrial evidence not only established that defendant failed to disburse the monies to the proper\npayees; it also established that he actually spent much of the money on himself. As previously\nnoted, Tellier specified that defendant was using his business-operating account for personal\nexpenses, from car payments to furniture purchases, totaling roughly $75,000, while at the same\ntime failing to disburse the necessary payments to the proper payees.', 'Therefore, the trial\njustice’s determination that the evidence adduced at trial supported a finding that defendant\n“intended to appropriate and convert the [money] to his own use and permanently deprive\n[another] of the use,” was not clearly wrong. See McKone, 673 A.2d at 1073 (quoting Oliveira,', '- 15 -\n432 A.2d at 666).', 'It is this Court’s opinion that the record established each element of\nembezzlement as alleged in counts 3, 4, and 5. 9', 'Moreover, the evidence also showed that Mortgage Guarantee & Title terminated its\nagency agreement with defendant because he failed to complete its annual escrow review.\nFurther, Green testified about defendant’s evasive and misleading responses to her inquiries.\nThe defendant’s uncooperativeness in completing Mortgage Guarantee & Title’s escrow review,\nand his attempts to avoid Green, coupled with the evidence of how he handled the money\nentrusted to him, all support the basis for the inference that he acted with the requisite intent to\nembezzle. It is clear to us, therefore, that the trial justice conducted the appropriate analysis and\nwas not clearly wrong in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'B', 'The Admissibility of Green’s Correspondence', 'The defendant further maintains that the trial justice erred in admitting into evidence\nGreen’s fax correspondence expressing her opinion about his veracity and credibility because it\nwas both irrelevant and prejudicial. The trial justice found that Green’s correspondence was\nrelevant to the issue of intent and that its probative value “outweighed its prejudicial effect.” In\nour opinion, the admission of Green’s correspondence at trial was a sustainable exercise of the\ntrial justice’s considerable discretion in evidentiary rulings. 10\n9', 'The defendant makes no argument to this Court that the evidence was insufficient to meet the\nconspiracy charge; accordingly, we do not address count 6.\n10', 'The trial justice admitted Green’s correspondence under the business record exception to\nhearsay.

Thus, “absent a\nshowing of abuse of this discretion, this Court will not disturb a ruling concerning the\nadmissibility of evidence.” Id. (quoting Calenda, 787 A.2d at 1199). Further, Rule 403 of the\nRhode Island Rules of Evidence provides for the exclusion of relevant evidence “if its probative\nvalue is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or\nmisleading the jury.” This Court has stated that “determinations of relevance and prejudice are\nwithin the sound discretion of the trial justice, and such determinations will be upheld absent a\nshowing of an abuse of this discretion.” DiPetrillo v.

It also\nmade it more probable that defendant had notice of the misappropriations of funds or, at a\nminimum, of the severe allegations that Green was making regarding such misappropriations.\nAccordingly, we are of the opinion that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in finding\nthat the evidence was relevant.', 'Moreover, Rule 403 provides that “evidence may be excluded if its probative value is\nsubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice * * *.” “It is within the sound\ndiscretion of the trial justice whether to admit or exclude evidence under Rule 403.” State v.\nMlyniec, 15 A.3d 983, 997 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v.

At that time,', '-1-\nButler and defendant were living with defendant’s mother, Brenda Washington, who is Butler’s\ncousin, and defendant’s sister, G’tobia Washington, 1 in a three-story, townhouse-style apartment\nlocated at 214 Hillside Avenue in Newport, Rhode Island. 2 Brenda and defendant each occupied\nseparate bedrooms on the second floor of the apartment and shared the second-floor bathroom,\nwhile Butler and G’tobia each occupied separate bedrooms on the third floor and shared the\nthird-floor bathroom.', 'As Butler tells the story, on the afternoon of the altercation, he was between shifts at his\njobs at Burger King and Walmart. He was in a hurry and wanted to take a shower, but both\nbathrooms were occupied—the second-floor bathroom by defendant and the third-floor bathroom\nby G’tobia. Butler testified that he asked Brenda if she could “talk to one of the girls and let\n[him] use the restroom” so he could get ready for work. Brenda went upstairs to ask defendant\nhow much longer she would be occupying the bathroom, to which she responded: “Not too long,\nMom.” According to Butler, fearing that he would be late, he reluctantly opted to skip the\nshower and instead decided to just put on his uniform and go to his shift at Walmart.', 'Butler\nfurther testified that at this point, he told G’tobia that he felt as though he “was being nit-picked”\nand that the sisters had set him up to be late by purposely occupying both bathrooms at a time\nwhen they knew he needed to get ready for work.', 'According to Butler, an argument then ensued between him and defendant on the second-\nfloor “landing area” of the apartment. Butler testified that defendant put her hand in his face\ntwice and that, at one point, her hand “touched his nose.” Butler “removed” defendant’s hand\nfrom his face, and the two “got into it.” Butler testified that defendant pushed him, he pushed\nher back, and then defendant “left the scene and went in her room and came out with a box cutter\n1', 'To avoid confusion, we will refer to Brenda and G’tobia by their first names.\n2', 'Butler moved in with Washington in late 2011.', '-2-\n* * * and started just swinging it.” Butler went on to testify that defendant was “just like cutting\n* * * just was going everywhere” and demonstrated for the jury a “vigorous slashing motion.”\nButler testified that he felt a cut across his left bicep and inner forearm. He stated that the\nincident ended shortly thereafter because G’tobia had called the police.', 'Butler added that the police took a photograph of the cut on his forearm and that this was\nthe only photograph of his injuries taken at that time. Butler testified that afterwards, he left the\nhouse to go to Walmart to explain to his managers what had transpired. After leaving Walmart,\nButler testified that he came back to the apartment and then took a walk “to clear [his] mind.”\nHe then went back home, went upstairs to take a “bath;” and, “when [he] went into the bathroom,\n[he] noticed that there was a big gash up on [his] arm.” Thereafter, Butler took Brenda’s cell\nphone, walked up the street, and called the police, who arrived that evening and took a\nphotograph of the newly-discovered cut on his left bicep.', 'Aside from Butler, the state called only one other witness, Officer Stephen Carrig\n(Officer Carrig) of the Newport Police Department, who, along with another officer, initially\nresponded to the altercation. Officer Carrig testified that he spoke to “all the parties involved,”\nincluding both Butler and defendant, and photographed the scene, Butler, and defendant. Officer\nCarrig further stated that he was also one of the officers who responded to Butler’s call later that\nevening.', 'G’tobia, Brenda, and defendant all testified for the defense. G’tobia took the stand first.\nShe testified that, at the time of the incident, Butler had not been getting along with anyone in the\nhouse. She recounted that, on the day of the incident, Butler was upset because defendant went\nto his place of work and took the car that they shared because she needed to use it. She testified\nthat, after Butler came home from work that afternoon and after she thought he was done using', '-3-\nthe third-floor bathroom, she went into the bathroom to take a shower. She then recalled that\nButler came upstairs and started banging on the door, saying he needed to use the bathroom. She\nsaid she tried to calm him down by indicating she would be out of the bathroom soon, but that\nButler kept banging on the door saying, “[t]hese bitches, they keep playing * * * I’m going to\nshow them I’m not playing.” G’tobia recounted that she came out of the bathroom shortly\nthereafter and saw Butler and defendant “arguing back and forth”—defendant was standing in\nfront of the closet doors on the second floor, and Butler was standing on the second step going\nup to the third floor.', 'She testified that Butler turned the altercation into a physical one when he “jumped” on\ndefendant and was “just punching her.” G’tobia stated that defendant “started to fight back” and\nhit Butler and that Brenda tried to break up the altercation. After deducing that Brenda was not\ngoing to be able to break up the fight, G’tobia stated that she went into Brenda’s room to call the\npolice. G’tobia testified that she never saw defendant holding a box cutter, but that she heard a\nbox cutter was involved and relayed that over the phone to the police dispatcher. She stated that\nshe did not see any injuries on Butler and that the altercation ended shortly after she announced\nthe police were on their way.', 'Brenda was the next to testify, and she too stated that Butler was not getting along very\nwell in her home, especially with her daughters. Her version of events was similar to that of\nG’tobia’s and also indicated that it was Butler who turned the altercation physical. She testified\nthat she saw defendant with a box cutter and that defendant cut Butler on the arm when “he\n[went to] swing at her face again[.]” She further narrated that, after the police had come and\ngone, she gave Butler a ride to Walmart, picked him up about ten minutes later, and when they\nreturned home, he asked to borrow her cell phone and left the house. She stated that when Butler', '-4-\nreturned, he first went upstairs, and then came back downstairs and told her “I just found another\ncut on me[.]”', 'The defendant was the last to take the stand. She testified that, on the afternoon in\nquestion, Butler was banging on the door of the third-floor bathroom while G’tobia was\noccupying it. The defendant recalled that she tried yelling up the stairs to calm Butler down and\nthat, in response, Butler ran down the stairs “charging at [her]” and “got in [her] face and started\nyelling at [her].” The defendant next testified that “out of nowhere” Butler punched her in the\nface and she pushed him in an effort to get him off her. She further stated that, during the\naltercation, her back was to her bedroom door and, at some point, Butler “pushed [her] or\npunched [her]” and she “kind of * * * lost [her] balance.” The defendant said that, when she\nregained her balance, she saw the box cutter3 within arm’s reach on her bedroom dresser,\ngrabbed it, and swung it at Butler because she thought “he’d get out of [her] face and leave [her]\nalone.” The defendant testified that she saw two cuts on Butler’s forearm, but did not see them\nuntil after the police arrived and the altercation had ended.', 'After the defense rested, the trial justice—without objection from either party—instructed\nthe jury, including an explanation of the law as it pertained to self-defense and the duty to\nretreat. 4 On February 11, 2014, the jury found defendant guilty of the charge of assault with a\ndangerous weapon, a box cutter.', 'The defendant filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that the jury’s verdict was against\nthe weight of the evidence. Defense counsel argued that the motion was not a typical “pro forma\nmotion” for the purposes of appeal, but that “[t]he jury got [it] wrong.” The defense relied on the\n3', 'The defendant testified that she used the box cutter at her job at Walmart.\n4', 'During deliberation, the jury submitted a specific question regarding the law of self-defense\nand the duty to retreat. In response, the parties agreed that the trial justice would reread the self-\ndefense instruction that had been previously given.', '-5-\nquestion the jury asked during deliberation that related to the retreat doctrine to support its\ncontention that the jury “did not buy [Butler’s] testimony in toto”—specifically, the portion of\nhis testimony that suggested defendant was the initial aggressor. In ruling on the motion, the\ntrial justice noted that it was undisputed that defendant was “wielding” a box cutter and that\nButler was in fear for his safety at that time. He also noted that, while portions of Butler’s\ntestimony “stretch[ed] his credibility[,]” the jury was entitled to disregard those portions it\nconsidered non-believable and credit those portions it found to be believable. As such, the trial\njustice found that the portions of Butler’s testimony the jury found to be believable supported a\nconviction of felony assault, and he denied defendant’s motion.', 'On April 21, 2014, defendant was sentenced to five years imprisonment, suspended, with\nfive years of probation. 5 A judgment of conviction was entered on April 24, 2014; defendant\nfiled a timely notice of appeal.', 'II', 'Standards of Review', '“We will not disturb a trial justice’s evidentiary ruling without first determining that the\nruling constitutes a clear abuse of his or her discretion.” State v.

First, she claims that the trial justice abused his\ndiscretion by not allowing Officer Carrig to testify that she was “scared” of Butler, which she\nargues was “extremely relevant” to her defense. She also claims that the trial justice erred in\ndenying her motion for a new trial. We discuss each claim of error in turn.', 'A. Officer Carrig’s Testimony', 'On cross-examination, Officer Carrig was questioned about defendant’s demeanor on the\nday of the altercation. Officer Carrig testified that defendant was “cooperative” and that she\n“wasn’t agitated.” When Officer Carrig stated that he “d[id not] recall” any other observations\npertaining to defendant’s demeanor, defense counsel attempted to refresh his recollection by\nhaving him review a copy of the Domestic Violence & Sexual Assault/Child Molestation\n(DV/SA) form that was filled out by another officer in connection with the incident. When he\nwas asked if the DV/SA prompted any further recollection as to defendant’s demeanor on the\nday of the altercation, the state objected. The trial justice then heard the attorneys at sidebar. As', '-7-\ngrounds for the objection, the state argued that the DV/SA form included the phrase “scared of\nButler[,]” which the state posited did not refer to the officer’s observation of defendant’s\ndemeanor, but rather memorialized a statement defendant made to the reporting officer. The trial\njustice indicated that the statement was a conclusion either based on Officer Carrig’s\nobservations or based on a statement made by defendant, and that, if it were the latter, then the\nstatement was inadmissible hearsay under State v. Harnois, 638 A.2d 532 (R.I. 1994).\nNevertheless, the trial justice gave defense counsel the opportunity to lay a foundation for the\nadmissibility of Officer Carrig’s testimony that defendant was “scared of Butler.”', 'Defense counsel then tried to broach the topic of how Officer Carrig came to the\nconclusion that defendant was scared, and the state lodged another objection. The jury was\nremoved from the courtroom, and a voir dire of the witness commenced. During the voir dire,\nOfficer Carrig confirmed that he did not fill out the DV/SA form; rather, his colleague, Officer\nNick St. Lawrence (Officer St. Lawrence), completed the form, and he was not consulted.\nOfficer Carrig also testified that he did not recall seeing Officer St. Lawrence fill out the form.\nDefense counsel asked Officer Carrig if reviewing the form helped him to recall that defendant\n“was scared of Mr. Butler,” to which Officer Carrig responded in the affirmative. Officer Carrig\ntestified that he came to this conclusion based in part on defendant’s body language and the way\nshe was acting, but also that he could not recall if his conclusion was based on “physical signs\n[of fear] or if she verbally stated it.”', 'The state fleshed out its objection to Officer Carrig’s testifying that defendant was\n“scared of Butler” and argued that, absent an accompanying statement, one’s body language or\ndemeanor alone does not indicate fear of a particular individual or object. The trial justice\ndetermined that Officer Carrig’s recollection had not been refreshed by the DV/SA form because', '-8-\nhe could not remember whether the statement “scared of Butler” was derived from defendant’s\ndemeanor and/or an accompanying verbal statement, and he ultimately disallowed the testimony.', 'The jury returned, and defense counsel continued to ask Officer Carrig about defendant’s\ndemeanor based solely on his observations and not on any statements made by defendant.\nOfficer Carrig stated that defendant “was upset and seemed to be pretty nervous.” When defense\ncounsel pressed and asked if defendant “was nervous because Mr. Butler was still in the\nhouse[,]” the state objected, and the trial justice sustained the objection on the basis of lack of\npersonal knowledge. Officer Carrig’s testimony concluded shortly thereafter.', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice was “misguided” in thinking that Officer\nCarrig’s testimony that she was “scared of Butler” was inadmissible hearsay and implicated our\nholding in Harnois. In that case, we held that a defendant who did not testify and was not subject\nto cross-examination could not then “manipulate[]” the rules of evidence by introducing\nexculpatory statements he made through the testimony of police officers via the “catchall”\nexception to the hearsay rule, Rule 803(24) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. Harnois, 638\nA.2d at 535-36. Here, defendant argues that Officer Carrig’s testimony that she was “scared of\nButler” was not based on a statement she made, but rather was based solely on Officer Carrig’s\nobservations of her demeanor following the altercation. However, despite being given ample\nopportunity to do so, defense counsel failed to lay a foundation to demonstrate that Officer\nCarrig knew defendant was scared of Butler specifically and that his conclusion was based solely\non his observations.', 'To begin, we note that Officer Carrig was permitted to testify as to what he observed\nfollowing the altercation, which included any observations pertaining to defendant’s demeanor.\nSee State v. Bruskie, 536 A.2d 522, 522, 523 (R.I. 1988) (state troopers permitted to testify as to', '-9-\ntheir observation that a defendant suspected of driving under the influence appeared to be\n“belligerent” and “dis-arranged”). Indeed, he testified without objection that defendant was\n“cooperative” and “wasn’t agitated[;]” and, likewise, he was permitted to testify that she\nappeared “upset” and “nervous.” Officer Carrig’s testimony became problematic, though, when\nhe attempted to identify Butler as the source of defendant’s fear.', 'We have said that “a witness may not give an opinion as to the inner thoughts or feelings\nof another person * * *.” State v. Covington, 69 A.3d 855, 866 (R.I. 2013); see State v. Ellis,\n619 A.2d 418, 423 (R.I. 1993) (“[I]t can scarcely be contended that in the ordinary course of\nevents a lay witness is able to determine such inner feelings as might arise if a person was\nthreatened. This is a question that a lay witness (and probably most expert witnesses) would be\ntotally unqualified to answer.”). That afternoon, defendant could have exhibited an “upset” or\n“nervous” demeanor for any number of reasons, not the least of which being that the police were\nin her mother’s home as a result of a violent altercation she was involved in.', 'Despite being given leeway to do so, defense counsel declined to ask any questions to\nelicit specific observations made by Officer Carrig that would support his conclusion that the\nsource of defendant’s nervousness or fear was Butler. Additionally, Officer Carrig testified that\nhe could not recall whether his conclusion that defendant was “scared of Butler” was based on\nphysical signs of fear or based on a statement made by defendant. He also testified that he did\nnot author the DV/SA form, nor was he consulted during the process. 6', 'As such, it is\nquestionable that Officer Carrig knew that defendant was in fact scared of Butler in particular.\nSee Rule 602 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence (“A witness may not testify to a matter\n6', ""To be sure, the fact that Officer Carrig did not author the DV/SA form does not bar the defense\nfrom using it to refresh his recollection. See State v. Presler, 731 A.2d 699, 704 (R.I. 1999)\n(noting that “any writing or object may be used in an effort to refresh a witness's recollection * *\n*” quoting State v. Souza, 708 A.2d 899, 903 (R.I. 1998))."", '-10-\nunless evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding that the witness has personal\nknowledge of the matter.”).', 'Accordingly, we conclude that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in barring the\ntestimony.', 'B. Motion for a New Trial', 'The defendant next argues that the trial justice erred in denying her motion for a new trial\nbecause he overlooked and misconceived material evidence by failing to evaluate the credibility\nof the witnesses and failing to address her self-defense argument. She also takes issue with the\nfact that the trial justice “disposed of [her] motion for new trial in only six pages of transcript.”\nHowever, we have said that “[i]n setting forth the rationale for a decision [on a motion for a new\ntrial], ‘the trial justice need not refer to all the evidence supporting the decision,’ rather he ‘need\nonly cite evidence sufficient to allow this [C]ourt to discern whether the trial justice applied the\nappropriate standards.’” State v. Swiridowsky, 126 A.3d 436, 442 (R.I. 2015) (quoting State v.\nKizekai, 19 A.3d 583, 589 (R.I. 2011)). We “accord[] great weight to a trial justice’s ruling on\n[such a motion] if he or she has articulated sufficient reasoning in support of the ruling.” Id.\n(quoting Kizekai, 19 A.3d at 589).', 'We are satisfied that the trial justice articulated such reasoning in denying the defendant’s\nmotion for a new trial and that he applied the appropriate standard. He correctly assumed the\nrole of the “legendary thirteenth juror,” and exercised his independent judgment when weighing\nthe evidence and assessing the credibility of the witnesses. Karngar, 29 A.3d at 1235 (quoting\nClark, 974 A.2d at 569). The trial justice’s decision includes a fairly extensive review of the\ntestimony presented by both sides, and ultimately found that the jury “followed the evidence and', '-11-\nfollowed the law as given to it by [the court].” 7 While he noted that portions of Butler’s\ntestimony “stretch[ed] his credibility,” he concluded that the jury was nevertheless “entitled to\ndisregard that portion [of Butler’s testimony] which they found was non-believable, but accept\nthat portion that was believable.” The defendant has not convinced us that the trial justice\noverlooked or misconceived material evidence or that he otherwise clearly erred. Thus, we\ndecline to disturb his ruling. See Mendez, 116 A.3d at 247.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the Superior Court’s judgment of\nconviction. The record in this case may be returned to that tribunal.\n7', 'The defendant also argues that the jury instruction given with regard to her duty to retreat was\nincorrect. However, the record reveals that defense counsel failed to object to the instruction at\nthe time it was given and even agreed to the same instruction being reread in response to a\nquestion submitted by the jury. As such, we need not address this assignment of error. See State\nv.

He argues that the evidence presented at trial raised serious\ndoubt about the allegations and that the trial justice overlooked and misconceived material\nevidence. Specifically, defendant argues that John’s testimony was neither credible nor reliable\nand that the testimony of the other witnesses failed to corroborate John’s assertions, but instead\ncontradicted critical aspects of his testimony. For this reason, defendant contends that the verdict\nreturned by the jury was against the weight of the evidence and failed to serve the interests of\njustice.', 'By calling into question the trial justice’s assessment of the testimony and the weight of\nthe evidence, defendant effectively challenges the trial justice’s credibility determinations.\nHowever, “[t]his Court has stated that ‘[t]he mere fact that [a] defendant disagrees with the trial\njustice’s conclusions about credibility is not a sufficient basis to warrant the granting of\na motion for new trial.’” Paola, 59 A.3d at 104 (quoting State v. Rivera, 987 A.2d 887, 903 (R.I.\n2010)).

Luanglath, 749 A.2d 1, 5-6 (R.I. 2000)).

The trial justice comprehensively articulated his reasons for denying the\nmotion for a new trial. His conclusion—that the overwhelming and credible evidence of sexual\ncontact between defendant and John supported the jury’s finding of guilt beyond a reasonable\ndoubt—is clear and reflects thoughtful deliberation.', 'Furthermore, in assessing the credibility of the witnesses, the trial justice found John in\nparticular to be “a very nervous ten-year[-]old boy on the stand and some of his answers were\ncontradictory especially when the [c]ourt found he was nervous during cross-examination and\nbegan answering correct to just about every question. But with respect to his testimony as a\nwhole, the [c]ourt [found John] to be a very credible witness.” Thus, the trial justice concluded\nthat, based on John’s testimony, the jury could conclude that the requisite elements of the\ncharged offense were proven “beyond a reasonable doubt.” Accordingly, after reviewing the\nevidence adduced at trial, the trial justice concluded that he agreed with the verdict on all three\nelements of the charge, and he denied defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'Having carefully reviewed the record before us, we are satisfied that the trial justice did\nnot overlook or misconceive any material evidence. The trial justice conducted an appropriate\nanalysis of the evidence presented, evaluated the credibility of the witnesses, and assessed the\nweight of the evidence; and, having done so, he determined that sufficient credible evidence was\nsubmitted to support the verdict on both counts.

Mr. Diop stated that, on the day in question, after he had been\nsitting on the wall for “like, one to two minute[s],” defendant, who was standing beside his own\ntaxi, pointed toward Mr. Diop and said: “You. Hey. Why are you looking at me?” Mr. Diop\ntestified that the three men on the wall asked defendant to whom he was speaking and that\ndefendant pointed at Mr. Diop and said: “You. You know who I’m talking to. You. Why are you\nlooking at me? You know I don’t like you.” Mr. Diop testified that he responded to defendant:\n“Do you own my eyes? I can look wherever I want to look.” He testified that he then rose from\nthe cement wall and that he and defendant walked toward each other while he repeatedly asked\ndefendant: “Do you own my eyes?”', 'Mr. Diop further testified that, when the two men had closed the distance between them,\nhe pushed defendant with both hands, employing sufficient force that defendant “moved a little\nbit.” Mr. Diop stated that, at some point during that altercation, defendant stabbed him in the\nstomach with a knife. Mr. Diop further testified that, after defendant had stabbed him in the\nstomach, defendant also stabbed him in his left leg. According to Mr. Diop, defendant stabbed\nhim in the leg when he began kicking defendant’s hand in an attempt to get away from the knife\nthat he realized defendant was wielding.', 'Mr. Diop proceeded to testify that another taxi driver, a man he identified as William,\ninserted himself between defendant and Mr. Diop, pointed out to Mr. Diop that he was bleeding\n2', 'Mr. Diop testified that, a few days before September 1, 2012, he had intervened in an\nargument between defendant and another taxi driver after defendant acted in a way that did not\nconform to the protocol of the taxi line at the Amtrak station. Mr. Diop stated that, later that same\nday, he saw Mr. Guerrero in the bathroom of the Omni Hotel. According to Mr. Diop, they spoke\nabout the taxi line protocol.', '3\nfrom the stomach, and physically separated the two men. Mr. Diop testified that defendant then\nentered his taxi and drove away.

The Testimony of Francisco Guerrero', 'The defendant testified3 that, prior to September 1, he had seen Mr. Diop in “different\nplaces where you would pick up people” because they had both been employed as taxi drivers in\nProvidence for some time. The defendant further testified that, prior to the date of the altercation\nwith Mr. Diop, he had been told by fellow taxi drivers Jose Lizardo, William Toribio, and Kenny\nGuzman, that Mr. Diop was “problematic.”', 'The defendant also testified that, on September 1, 2012, Mr. Diop came up to him, “almost\nrunning,” and defendant asked him: “Why are you looking at me like that?” The defendant further\ntestified: “[Mr. Diop] pushed me right away. He started kicking me, and I was afraid for my life.”\nHe also testified that, while running at him, Mr. Diop said: “I’m going to kill you. I’m going to\nkill you.

I had it in my', 'backpack for when I was peeling an orange, and I forgot about it,', 'and I put it here in my backpack.”', '3. The Testimony of William Toribio and Jose Lizardo', 'William Toribio testified that, prior to September of 2012, he had told defendant to “watch\nout” for Mr. Diop “because Mr. Diop has had problems with other people * * *.” He also testified\nthat, on September 1, 2012, he was in his taxi in the Amtrak station line, texting someone while\nwaiting for a fare.

The defendant\nspecifically requested that the trial justice, in his role as the metaphorical thirteenth juror, consider\ndefendant’s arguments as to the use of excessive force and as to the duty to retreat.', 'After reviewing in detail his jury instructions as well as the conflicting witness testimony\nand the video evidence, the trial justice stated that he would have reached the same conclusion as\nthe jury did; accordingly, he denied the motion for a new trial.

After carrying out that analysis, if “the trial justice agrees\nwith the jury’s verdict or if the evidence is such that reasonable minds could differ as to the\noutcome, he or she should deny the motion for a new trial.” Prout, 996 A.2d at 645 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). However, if the trial justice disagrees with the jury’s verdict or does\nnot believe that reasonable minds could differ as to the outcome, he must conduct a fourth step of\nanalysis in order to determine “whether the verdict is against the fair preponderance of the evidence\nand fails to do substantial justice.” State v. Diaz, 159 A.3d 1053, 1061 (R.I. 2017) (internal\nquotation marks omitted).5', 'This Court accords the trial justice’s decision on a motion for a new trial great deference\ndue to the fact that “a trial justice, being present during all phases of the trial, is in an especially\ngood position to evaluate the facts and to judge the credibility of the witnesses.” Id. at 1062\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, “[a]bsent clear error and absent a determination\nby this Court that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material and relevant evidence\n[relating] to a critical issue in the case, we will defer to the trial justice’s ruling.” State v.

First, the trial justice considered the evidence in light of the jury charge;\nhe discussed the lengthy instruction that he had given to the jury regarding self-defense, including\nhis specific instruction to the jury that one may not use excessive force. He also noted that he had\n“indicated there is a duty to retreat * * *. And there is a test of the defendant’s state of mind, and\nit is in the consideration as to whether or not defendant’s actions were justified.” He concluded\n6', 'It is our considered judgment that defendant’s contention on appeal that the trial justice did\nnot properly consider the excessive force question has been waived. See State v. Day, 925 A.2d\n962, 974 n.19 (R.I. 2007); Wilkinson v. State Crime Laboratory Commission, 788 A.2d 1129, 1131\nn.1 (R.I. 2002) (“Simply stating an issue for appellate review, without a meaningful discussion\nthereof or legal briefing of the issues, does not assist the Court in focusing on the legal questions\nraised, and therefore constitutes a waiver of that issue.”). Although defendant alludes to that issue\nin his briefing before this Court, he makes no meaningful argument with respect to the excessive\nforce issue; instead, he limits himself to challenging the trial justice’s discussion of the duty to\nretreat. See State v. Mendez, 116 A.3d 228, 242 n.19 (R.I. 2015).', '8\nthis step of the analysis by noting that he had given an additional instruction as to the state’s burden\nto prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant did not act in self-defense.', 'Proceeding to the second step in the analytical process, the trial justice independently\nevaluated the evidence and weighed the credibility of the witnesses. He explained that the video\n“was a little grainy, and it was sometimes from a distance, but it depicted the entire confrontation\nat the Providence Train Station that occurred on the date this offense happened.” The trial justice\nexplained:', '“Mr. Guerrero stated * * * ‘I tried to get away, but he cornered me.’', 'That’s my note that I wrote in my trial notebook. The Court did not', 'see that on the video. I didn’t see any cornering.', '“Mr. Guerrero testified, I didn’t feel good. All he kept saying is,', 'I’m going to kill you, and I felt horrible.', '“Now, the Court has considered that, and that differs from Mr. Diop,', 'who was the victim, his version of the events.”\nThereafter, the trial justice expressed his disbelief in defendant’s testimony regarding the threats\nwhich he alleged Mr. Diop had made, which conclusion, the trial justice stated, was reinforced by\nthe fact that neither Mr. Toribio nor Mr. Lizardo had testified that they heard those statements or\nthreats.', 'The trial justice also stated that, although Mr. Diop was the initial aggressor, defendant had\na duty to retreat before acting in self-defense. In State v. Garrett, 91 A.3d 793 (R.I. 2014), this\nCourt noted our well-established doctrine that, before an individual who perceives himself\nthreatened by another may resort to using deadly force, he or she “must attempt to retreat if [he or\nshe is] consciously aware of an open, safe and available avenue of escape.” Garrett, 91 A.3d at\n801 (internal quotation marks omitted). In Garrett, this Court upheld the denial of a motion for a\nnew trial because there existed a duty to retreat even when the defendant’s avenue of escape would', '9\nhave required her to walk over debris and proceed up a set of stairs—even though that avenue of\nescape involved turning her back to the aggressor. Id. at 804-05.', 'In the course of his ruling on defendant’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice determined\nthat defendant did not satisfy that duty to retreat before responding with deadly force (his knife).\nIn our judgment, defendant’s challenge to the trial justice’s determination with respect to\ndefendant’s duty to retreat is unavailing. In reaching his conclusion, the trial justice considered\nthe avenues of retreat available to defendant and noted: “at a minimum, there was an opportunity\nto back up a few more steps, put some space between Diop and [defendant], and see if Diop\nadvanced further.” The trial justice additionally stated:', '“[I]ndependently, looking at this evidence, the Court feels that, one,', 'the amount of force and the immediate nature of that force was', 'excessive, that there was an opportunity to retreat, and, at the very', 'minimum, there was an opportunity that retreat would have included', 'backing up a few more steps and would allow any observer to see if', 'Mr. Diop was going to continue his aggressions towards Mr.', 'Guerrero.”', 'Additionally, because defendant was familiar with the Amtrak station, having worked as a\ntaxi driver there for some years, the jury was (and the trial justice was) entitled to draw the\ninference that he was aware of the available avenues of escape in that area. See State v. Hallenbeck,\n878 A.2d 992, 1012 (R.I. 2005) (noting that the jury was entitled to draw an inference as to the\ndefendant’s awareness of an avenue of escape).', 'On certiorari, defendant also emphasizes the short time span within which the scuffle\noccurred. Notably however, the trial justice expressly recognized “the speed with which this event\nwas unfolding,” and noted that it “is not something that the Court takes lightly.” It is clear to us\nthat the trial justice addressed all of the relevant evidentiary issues, and we perceive no reversible\nerror in his ruling with respect to conducting the second step in the analytical process.', '10', 'Upon concluding the above analyses, the trial justice reached the third step in the analytical\nprocess and stated that he would have reached the same result as the jury did. See Silva, 84 A.3d\nat 416. We note that the trial justice’s conclusion that he would have reached the same result as\nthe jury “is a significant consideration in this Court’s review of a denial of a motion for [a] new\ntrial * * *.” Id. at 418. Because the trial justice would have reached the same conclusion as the\njury, he properly concluded his analysis at that point and denied defendant’s motion for a new trial.\nSee Prout, 996 A.2d at 645; Imbruglia, 913 A.2d at 1028.', 'Accordingly, after a thorough review of the record in this case, it is our judgment that the\ndefendant has failed to demonstrate that the trial justice clearly erred or overlooked or\nmisconceived relevant or material evidence in denying the defendant’s motion for a new trial. See\nState v. Yon, 161 A.3d 1118, 1130 (R.I. 2017). We are satisfied that the trial justice more than\nadequately performed his role under each step of the analysis of the defendant’s motion for a new\ntrial. We therefore affirm the Superior Court’s denial of the defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

The defendant filed his timely notice of appeal on May 17, 2017.\nThis matter came before the Supreme Court on December 4, 2018, pursuant to an order directing\nthe parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised on appeal should not be summarily\ndecided. After reviewing their submitted memoranda, we are satisfied that cause has not been\nshown and further briefing or argument is therefore not required. For the reasons set forth\nherein, we affirm the judgment of conviction.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The events giving rise to this case occurred on November 13, 2014. There are two\ncompeting versions of what transpired on that day, both of which were presented at a four-day', '-1-\njury trial.1 Devin Smith (Smith) testified for the state that he left a restaurant that afternoon and\nwas driving his mother’s car eastbound on Putnam Pike in Smithfield, with three friends in the\nvehicle, when he approached a red light next to a vehicle, later identified as defendant’s, in the\nlane to his left. Smith testified that defendant asked him, through their open car windows, if\nSmith “wanted to see a frog leap.” Smith testified that he was unsure what defendant meant, but\nresponded by saying, “Whatever, Buddy[.]”', 'When the light turned green, both vehicles\ncontinued down the road, and, Smith testified, defendant began swerving into Smith’s lane three\nor four times, forcing Smith to swerve into the far right portion of the roadway, until they\neventually reached the traffic light at Esmond Street. Smith testified that, at that light, he came\nto a stop in the “left only” lane and defendant was in the right “straight only” lane, to Smith’s\nright. Additionally, Smith testified that, when the light turned green, he attempted to turn left\nonto Esmond Street, at which time defendant also turned left from his straight-only lane and\nstruck Smith’s car in the rear-passenger side, causing Smith to drive over a mulched area and\ninto a gas station parking lot.', 'Smith further testified that, as he drove to the exit of the gas station parking lot to pull\nback onto Putnam Pike, defendant again hit Smith’s car, this time in the rear. Smith described\nthat it was “not a bad hit” but “[j]ust, like, a tap.” Smith also testified that, after he left the gas\nstation, defendant followed him down Esmond Street and again hit the back of his car, this time\nat the intersection of Dean Avenue. Smith explained that, as he drove down Dean Avenue, he\nwas in the right lane and defendant continued on the side of his car “trying to cut in front of\n[him] to slow [him] down.” Smith testified that, at that point, defendant got out of his vehicle\nand “threw his hands up”; it looked to Smith as though defendant threw something at Smith’s\n1', 'For the purposes of this opinion, we will only discuss the witnesses’ testimony at trial that\npertains to the reckless driving charge.', '-2-\nvehicle. Then, Smith explained, he put his car in reverse, drove home, told his mother what had\nhappened, and called the police. Smith testified that his vehicle never struck defendant’s vehicle.\nFinally, Smith testified regarding the details of the damage to his vehicle, and photographs\ndepicting that damage were admitted into evidence.', 'The state called Aaron Mazzulla (Mazzulla) to testify next. Mazzulla was one of the\nthree passengers in Smith’s vehicle during the incident; he was sitting in the back seat behind\nSmith. Mazzulla’s account of the events corroborated Smith’s testimony. William Achille\n(Achille), the gas station clerk on duty that night, also testified for the state and described that, at\naround 5:00 p.m., he saw two vehicles speed through the parking lot, stop at the furthest exit, and\nthen get back onto the road. Achille also testified that he did not hear or see any collision take\nplace at the station; rather, he merely heard “[a] little bit of beeping.”', 'The defendant also testified at trial. According to defendant, he was driving home from\nwork when he stopped to pick up dinner for his children. When he left the restaurant, defendant\ntestified, he was traveling on Putnam Pike when he approached a red light near the above-\nmentioned gas station, and he observed that his mirror had become dislodged and he heard “the\nsound of change hitting the door, or rocks or sand[.]” The defendant testified that, after his car\nwas struck, he looked to his left and saw a car pulling into the gas station. Thereafter, defendant\ntestified that he used his left directional and pulled into the gas station behind the vehicle because\nhe “figured they knew they hit [his] vehicle, and that’s why they were parking.” The defendant\nstated that he pulled directly behind the vehicle, at which point the other vehicle reversed and\nstruck defendant’s vehicle, leaving a dent on the front driver’s side above the headlight.\nSubsequently, the other vehicle pulled westbound onto Putnam Pike and took an immediate right\nonto Esmond Street. The defendant testified that he followed the vehicle as far as he could', '-3-\nbefore losing it. He then returned to the gas station with the hope that someone had seen\nsomething or that a police officer would be there. The defendant denied any other interaction\nwith Smith or his passengers.', 'Both Smith and defendant reported their versions of the events to the Smithfield police\ndepartment. After taking statements and investigating, the Smithfield police arrested defendant\non November 20, 2014, and he was ultimately charged by information on May 28, 2015, with\nassault with a dangerous weapon, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2 (count one); reckless\ndriving, in violation of § 31-27-4 (count two); leaving the scene of an accident, in violation of\nG.L. 1956 § 31-26-2 (count three); falsely reporting a crime, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-32-2\n(count four); and disorderly conduct, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-45-1(a) (count five). Prior to\ntrial, the state dismissed count three pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of\nCriminal Procedure.', 'Subsequently, on April 20, 2017, defendant was convicted by a jury of count two,\nreckless driving, and acquitted of the remaining counts. The defendant filed a motion for a new\ntrial, arguing that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to convict him of reckless\ndriving and further contending that the jury did not note the specific location where defendant’s\nalleged reckless driving took place. On May 15, 2017, the trial justice denied defendant’s\nmotion for a new trial and sentenced defendant to one year at the Adult Correctional Institutions,\nthe entirety of which was suspended, with probation. The trial justice further ordered defendant\nto complete anger-management counseling. The defendant timely appealed.', '-4-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“When ruling on a motion for a new trial, the trial justice acts as a thirteenth juror,\nexercising ‘independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the\nevidence.’” State v.

The motion was heard before a\nsecond hearing justice, sitting in Providence County, who, in response, read from the Rule 48(a)\ndismissal filed by the state in that underlying case, which stated: “[T]he [s]tate is dismissing\nthese charges in the interest of sparing the victim any further trauma from repeated court\nappearances. This dismissal shall in no way be construed to imply that the [s]tate indicates a\nlack of probable cause or any doubt of the culpability of the defendant.” The state objected to\ndefendant’s motion, arguing at that initial hearing that the underlying District Court charges\nagainst defendant were dismissed because the state was “satisfied with the sentence as well as\nsparing the victim of [sic] any further hearing.” The state further argued that defendant had not', '-5-\ndemonstrated any of the five reasons enumerated in § 12-19-18(b) that would mandate that his\nimprisonment be terminated.', 'The court eventually held an evidentiary hearing.', 'The first witness to testify was\nassistant attorney general Roger Demers, who was the prosecutor at defendant’s probation-\nviolation hearing.

He did,\nhowever, “remember seeing that [there was no probable cause to charge him with a crime] in one\nof her early reports.”', 'After identifying the Rule 48(a) dismissal filed in the District Court case, Demers\ntestified that the state had dismissed the charges against defendant to ensure that the complaining\nwitness would not be put through any more trauma, including, according to Demers, the “trauma\nof being sexually assaulted by the defendant and the trauma of having to testify about that sexual\nassault and undergo a fairly lengthy cross-examination, much of it having to do with irrelevant\nquestions.” He testified further that the “main input was from the victim herself” in the state’s\ndecision to dismiss the underlying charges against defendant; according to Demers, the\ncomplaining witness “did not want to continue to have to suffer through this.” He testified that\nthere was no doubt in his mind that there was probable cause in the underlying case and that\ndefendant was culpable for the acts alleged.', 'The defendant then called Det. Wuest as a witness, to which the state objected, arguing\nthat only the state had the discretion to dismiss the charges, and, therefore, the testimony of Det.', '-6-\nWuest was not relevant. The hearing justice sustained the state’s objection, but he allowed\ndefendant to examine Det.

He found that only the state had\nthe authority to decide whether to proceed with or dismiss the charges, based upon the input of\nthe complaining witness; ultimately, the hearing justice noted, it is the attorney general who has\nthe final say. He found that Det. Wuest’s testimony was not relevant to the determination of\nprobable cause but that, even if it was, “what she initially said about probable cause was later\nretracted, at least implicitly[.]”', 'The hearing justice concluded by stating that “given the strictures of [§] 12-19-l8(b)(5),\nthe [c]ourt finds that Mr. Demers’ testimony is very, very credible,” and that there was “nothing\nthe [c]ourt heard by way of cross, redirect or recross, or anything — in the event the [c]ourt was\nin error and should have considered Detective Wuest’s testimony, there is nothing that undercut\nMr. Demers’ very credible testimony.” He therefore denied defendant’s motion.', 'An order was entered denying defendant’s motion to terminate imprisonment.

Wuest was an offer of proof and not admitted into evidence, it\nis important to note that while Det. Wuest testified that initially there was not enough probable\ncause to charge, once she conducted an investigation, the police “determined there was enough\nprobable cause to charge, and the AG agreed with us, so we charged.”\n5', 'This Court has consistently considered a notice of appeal filed prior to the entry of the\njudgment or order appealed from to be timely.

Importantly, the hearing justice\nnoted that defendant himself, in his statements to police, corroborated portions of the\ncomplaining witness’s story that supported a finding that he had breached the peace, in particular\nthat he had pushed her back inside and prevented her from leaving the apartment.

The hearing justice held an\nevidentiary hearing, at which defendant had the opportunity to examine and cross-examine both\nDemers and Det. Wuest. The defendant’s core argument in support of his motion to terminate\nimprisonment was that § 12-19-18 applied to the facts of this case. Section 12-19-18 states, in\npertinent part:', '“(b) Whenever any person, after an evidentiary hearing, has been', 'sentenced to imprisonment for violation of a suspended sentence or', 'probationary period by reason of the alleged commission of a', 'felony or misdemeanor said sentence of imprisonment shall, on a', 'motion made to the court on behalf of the person so sentenced, be', 'quashed, and imprisonment shall be terminated when any of the', 'following occur on the charge which was specifically alleged to', 'have constituted the violation:', '“* * *', '“(5) The charge fails to proceed in District or Superior Court', 'under circumstances where the state is indicating a lack of', 'probable cause, or circumstances where the state or its agents', 'believe there is doubt about the culpability of the accused.”', 'The defendant asserts before this Court that, by dismissing the underlying District Court\ncomplaint, the “state [was] indicating a lack of probable cause” and an “agent believe[d] there\n[was] doubt about the culpability of the [defendant,]” and that, therefore, his imprisonment\nshould be terminated under § 12-19-18(b)(5). In support of this argument, defendant points to a', '- 11 -\nstatement by Det. Wuest suggesting that, at one point early in the case, there was insufficient\nprobable cause to arrest defendant. He argues that, in light of Det. Wuest’s testimony in this\nregard, the hearing justice erred in his application of § 12-19-18. This argument is without merit\nfor two reasons.', 'First, while Det. Wuest did testify in the offer of proof that, prior to a full investigation of\nthe case, there was a lack of probable cause to arrest defendant, she clearly also testified that,\nafter further investigation, including interviewing witnesses and gathering evidence, there was\nsufficient probable cause and therefore defendant was subsequently arrested.', 'Section\n12-19-18(b)(5) requires that “[t]he charge fails to proceed in the District * * * Court under\ncircumstances where the state is indicating a lack of probable cause[.]” The fact that probable\ncause may have been lacking preliminarily does not mean that § 12-19-18(b)(5) is applicable,\nespecially when future investigations establish the existence of probable cause. See, e.g.,\nO’Connell v. Walmsley, 156 A.3d 422, 428 (R.I. 2017) (holding that “although we must give\nwords their plain and ordinary meanings, in so doing we must not construe a statute in a way that\nwould result in absurdities or would defeat the underlying purpose of the enactment” (brackets\nand deletion omitted) (quoting Commercial Union Insurance Co. v. Pelchat, 727 A.2d 676, 681\n(R.I. 1999))).', 'Second, as noted supra, the Rule 48(a) dismissal by the state in the District Court\nspecifically indicated that the reason for the dismissal of the three charges against defendant was\nto “spar[e] the victim any further trauma[,]” and that it was not because of “lack of probable\ncause” or any “doubt about the culpability about the accused[,]” as required by § 12-19-18(b)(5).\nAt the hearing on defendant’s motion to terminate imprisonment, Demers was found to have\ncredibly affirmed those statements as contained in the Rule 48(a) dismissal.', '- 12 -', 'As such, there is ample evidence to support the hearing justice’s conclusion that\n§ 12-19-18(b)(5) is inapplicable to the instant case.

The details of that incident are not necessary for\nthe resolution of this appeal.', '-1-', 'Following his arrest, defendant reached out to the Public Defender’s office for legal\nrepresentation, but was deemed ineligible for services.

The defendant further made clear that he did not\nwant to proceed to trial pro se.

The trial justice offered defendant the opportunity to give an opening\nstatement, but defendant instead responded: “I take the Fifth. * * * I don’t want to go forward', '-5-\nbecause I don’t have an attorney.

According to Officer Donley, he and Officer Ramos\nresponded to a call for backup to a store parking lot, and as the two arrived, he observed Officer\nLajoie and defendant yelling at each other in a “heated verbal argument.” Officer Donley testified\nthat he then “observed [defendant] push Officer Lajoie to the ground.” When the officers caught\nup to defendant and Officer Lajoie, they attempted to take defendant into custody, but he resisted.\nOfficer Donley testified that he used pepper spray and an “open hand slap to the side of his face *\n* * [a]s a distraction technique” to “successfully handcuff [defendant] without further incident.”', 'Officer Donley testified that he observed Officer Lajoie’s foot to be “dangling\nabnormally[,]” and called a rescue.

He gave a similar account to Officer\nDonley’s testimony.', 'The defendant also attempted to cross-examine Officer Ramos, but was again unsuccessful.\nThe defendant told the trial justice, in the presence of the jury, that he felt unqualified to represent\nhimself, and that the trial justice “forced [him] to go forward.” After the state rested, the trial\njustice gave defendant the opportunity to testify in narrative form, but defendant declined. The\ndefendant also refused to give a closing statement, saying, “at this point, I don’t know what is\ngoing on.” After the prosecutor gave a closing statement, the trial justice charged the jury with\ninstructions and excused them for the day.', 'The following morning, Attorney Thomas DeSimone (DeSimone) entered his appearance\nfor defendant on the record, stating that defendant had retained him around nine o’clock the\nprevious night. DeSimone asked that the “case go back to the beginning so that [defendant] can\nactually have a lawyer represent him.” The trial justice denied that request.', 'The jury found defendant guilty as to all pending charges: assault of a police officer (count\n1), resisting arrest (count 3), and disorderly conduct (count 4).6\n6', 'The state dismissed the charge for simple assault (count 2) prior to jury deliberations.', '-8-', 'C', 'Posttrial', 'On May 28, 2015, defendant, who remained represented by counsel, filed a motion for a\nnew trial. The defendant averred that he had been denied his constitutional rights at trial because\nhe did not have representation. After hearing argument, the trial justice rendered a decision from\nthe bench denying defendant’s motion. The trial justice concluded that, prior to beginning trial,\nshe had “found that the Defendant willfully and intentionally entered into a strategy to manipulate\nthe system and delay trial indefinitely. And in doing so, he knew he ran the risk of a trial without\na lawyer. His strategy was knowing and voluntary and intelligent * * *.”7 Additionally, the trial\njustice noted that, “[t]he fact that Defendant hired Mr. DeSimone so expeditiously on the night of\nMay 18th demonstrates further, speaks volumes, as to the extent to which Defendant misled the\n[c]ourt about his inability to engage counsel.” The trial justice further determined that the jury\nfollowed the instructions she had given, and that, if she had been sitting without a jury, she would\nhave come to the same conclusion based on the evidence presented at trial.', 'The defendant was sentenced on count 1 to three years’ imprisonment, with fifteen months\nto serve and the remainder suspended, with probation. As to count 3, defendant was sentenced to\none year suspended, with probation, to run consecutively to the sentence for count 1. As to count\n7', 'At the hearing on defendant’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice agreed that she had not\nspecifically used the words “knowing, intelligent, and voluntary” waiver of counsel on record prior\nto trial. However, the trial justice emphasized that she denied defendant’s request for a\ncontinuance prior to trial after she had determined that defendant’s failure to engage counsel\n“constituted an intelligent, intentional strategy on the part of the Defendant and an effort to\nmanipulate the system by * * * stalling * * * trial[.]” Moreover, defendant concedes that “[w]hile\n[the trial justice] did not make this specific finding before the trial began, her ruling made clear\nthat she considered [defendant’s] actions to be tantamount to a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent\nwaiver of the right to counsel.”', '-9-\n4, defendant was sentenced to six months suspended, with probation, to run concurrently to the\ncount 3 sentence.

A defendant must voluntarily,\nknowingly, and intelligently waive his or her right to counsel for the waiver to be valid. Id.', '“When confronted with a defendant’s purported waiver of counsel, this Court employs a\ntwo-prong analysis to determine the validity of that waiver.” Cruz, 109 A.3d at 390. Thus, “we\nmust first determine whether the waiver was ‘voluntary,’ and then we must determine whether the\nwaiver was ‘knowing and intelligent.’” Id. (quoting Laurence, 848 A.2d at 253). In assessing\nwhether there has been a valid waiver of counsel, “we examine the totality of the circumstances.”\nLaurence, 848 A.2d at 253.

Bluitt, 850\nA.2d 83, 87 (R.I. 2004).', 'A', 'Voluntary', 'First, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in finding a voluntary waiver of counsel\nwithout first independently inquiring into defendant’s indigency status. Specifically, defendant\nargues that a trial justice is required to “determine whether a defendant is constitutionally entitled\nto court-appointed counsel, regardless of his or her statutory eligibility for Public Defender\nrepresentation.” Conversely, the state responds that the Public Defender’s office, alone, is vested\nwith the authority to make indigency determinations under the eligibility statute, G.L. 1956 § 12-\n15-9. Furthermore, the state argues that, even if the trial justice was required to inquire about\ndefendant’s eligibility for representation, defendant has not demonstrated that he could not afford\nan attorney, and in fact, had continuously represented that he was financially able to hire his own\nrepresentation during pretrial proceedings.', 'In support of his position, defendant cites to cases from other jurisdictions which have held\nthat a defendant is entitled to a separate judicial determination of indigency when the public\ndefender has determined that the defendant is not eligible for services. For example, in People v.\nSteinbeck, 186 P.3d 54 (Colo. App. 2007), a defendant, whose private counsel withdrew after part\nof the proceedings, was found to be ineligible for services by the state public defender’s office.\nSteinbeck, 186 P.3d at 57, 58. The Colorado Court of Appeals concluded that the defendant had\nbeen denied his statutory right to judicial review of the indigency determination, and further, his\nconstitutional right to court-appointed counsel. Id. at 59, 60. In so deciding, the court in Steinbeck\nnoted that the mandate for judicial review of indigency determinations was “grounded in a long', '- 12 -\nhistory of inherent judicial power to appoint counsel for a defendant without the means to afford\ncounsel in order to ensure a fair trial for the defendant.” Id. at 57. In State v. Dean, 471 N.W.2d\n310 (Wis. Ct. App. 1991), the Wisconsin Court of Appeals stated that Wisconsin’s eligibility\nstatute permitted judicial review of an indigency determination, but further commented that\n“[t]here are situations, as here, where a defendant does not meet certain indigency criteria, but\nnevertheless is unable to afford counsel.” Dean, 471 N.W.2d at 313, 314. The court in Dean\nfurther concluded that a trial justice “is required to go beyond the public defender’s determination\nthat a defendant does not meet the legislative criteria and determine whether the ‘necessities of the\ncase’ and the demands of ‘public justice and sound policy’ require appointing counsel.” Id. at 314.', 'The defendant also relies on Ingram v. Justice Court for Lake Valley Judicial District of El\nDorado County, 447 P.2d 650 (Cal. 1968), to support his position that the constitution requires\nthis independent inquiry. In Ingram, the Supreme Court of California was tasked with determining\nthe opposite situation to the case at bar—whether a court may review a public defender’s\ndetermination that a defendant was indigent and eligible for services. Ingram, 447 P.2d at 651.\nThe court ultimately held that judicial review of this determination was inappropriate. Id. at 655.\nNevertheless, in dicta, the court discussed a scenario similar to the case at bar, and commented\nthat a defendant would be “entitled to judicial review of a determination of nonindigence not\nbecause of any language in [California’s eligibility statute] but because of the fundamental\nconstitutional guarantee of counsel to all persons accused of crime.” Id. at 654.', 'However, all three of the cases defendant cites for support are distinguishable from the case\nbefore us. Ingram, as we have stated, involved the opposite set of facts to the case before us. See\nIngram, 447 P.2d at 651. Furthermore, in Steinbeck, the Colorado Court of Appeals held that “a\ndefendant bears the initial burden of raising his claim of indigency to the court[,]” and that the', '- 13 -\ndefendant in that case had “provided the trial court on more than one occasion with facts indicating\nthat he could not afford to retain counsel.” Steinbeck, 186 P.3d at 56, 59. Similarly, in Dean, the\nWisconsin Court of Appeals stated that “[a] defendant who seeks appointed counsel must present\nevidence to the trial court of his or her assets, income, liabilities and attempts to retain counsel.”\nDean, 471 N.W.2d at 315. In that case, the defendant had claimed indigency on multiple\noccasions, the state had stipulated to the defendant’s indigent status at a postconviction-relief\nhearing, and one of the judges presiding over the defendant’s proceedings had “specifically stated\nthat [the defendant] could not afford an attorney.” Id. at 312, 315. Conversely, here, defendant\ncontinuously maintained before the Superior Court hearing justices that he had funds to hire an\nattorney. Even after defendant claimed that he was indigent but was deemed ineligible by the\nPublic Defender, defendant again represented to the hearing justices that he would be able to raise\nfunds to hire an attorney.', 'Additionally, the defendants in Steinbeck and Dean were entitled to a statutory right of\nreview of a public defender’s indigency determination under the laws of Colorado and Wisconsin,\nrespectively. Steinbeck, 186 P.3d at 56; Dean, 471 N.W.2d at 313. In Rhode Island, the statute\ndefining eligibility requirements for indigent representation does not expressly mandate or permit\na trial justice to review the Public Defender’s determination of ineligibility. See G.L. 1956 § 12-\n15-9.9\n9', 'General Laws 1956 § 12-15-9 reads, in pertinent part:', '“If the public defender, after examination and investigation of the', 'financial statement, is satisfied that the person submitting it is an', 'indigent defendant, the public defender or one of his or her assistants', 'shall defend the person; provided, that if the public defender is', 'satisfied that the person is not an indigent defendant, he or she shall', 'notify the court which referred the person to the public defender’s', '- 14 -', 'Moreover, this Court has held that a defendant may demonstrate a voluntary waiver of the\nconstitutional right to counsel by his or her actions. See Laurence, 848 A.2d at 254. For example,\nin Laurence, we determined that a defendant who repeatedly rejected the services of court-\nappointed counsel had voluntarily waived his right to an attorney, even though that defendant\n“asserted many times at trial that it was not his desire to represent himself and that he felt coerced\ninto doing so[.]” Id. at 254, 255; see also State v. Thornton, 800 A.2d 1016, 1026 (R.I. 2002)\n(“[The defendant’s] repeated refusal to accept the services of competent court-appointed defense\ncounsel demonstrates clearly the voluntary waiver of his right to counsel, and that he was not in\nany way unconstitutionally ‘forced’ to proceed pro se.”).', 'Here, we are of the opinion that, despite defendant’s claims that he was forced to proceed\nto trial without counsel, defendant’s continuous failure to obtain representation demonstrates a\nvoluntary waiver of counsel. As set forth above, defendant repeatedly represented to two justices\nof the Superior Court that he was able to afford counsel, but that he was not comfortable with the\nretainer payment system after his experience with his prior attorneys. Moreover, defendant was\ngenerously granted more than ten continuances over the course of fourteen months, yet he still\nfailed to procure representation, notwithstanding his many assurances to the court that he would\nhire an attorney. As this Court concluded in Laurence, to allow defendant to continue this pattern\n“would be to prevent any trial whatever until the accused person himself should be pleased to', 'office of the determination that the person is not an indigent', 'defendant.”\nFurthermore, § 12-15-8 defines an “indigent defendant” as', '“a person who after payment of necessary expenses for food, shelter', 'and medical care, does not have sufficient income or assets to enable', 'him or her to retain counsel nor is there any one to whom he or she', 'is entitled to look for support who has that income or assets.”', '- 15 -\npermit it.” Laurence, 848 A.2d at 255 (quoting Illinois v. Allen, 397 U.S. 337, 349 (1970)). Thus,\nas we have held, it is clear that “[t]he defendant’s actions, rather than his words, demonstrate that\nhe waived his right to counsel.” Id. at 254.', 'Accordingly, we are of the opinion that the trial justice did not err in determining that\ndefendant voluntarily waived his right to counsel prior to trial.', 'B', 'Knowing and Intelligent', 'The defendant also argues that he did not knowingly or intelligently waive his right to\ncounsel. The defendant contends that the trial justice did not consider defendant’s lack of\nunderstanding that, upon assenting to the motion to withdraw, he would be required to proceed to\ntrial pro se if he did not secure other representation. The defendant asserts that the trial justice\nlooked only to defendant’s actions following the withdrawal and that, therefore, the trial justice’s\nfinding “was based on an incomplete assessment of the circumstances[.]” The state counters that,\nupon withdrawal of defendant’s retained attorney and over the course of the many subsequent\npretrial hearings, “defendant was warned that his two options were to hire a replacement attorney\nor to represent himself.” Consequently, the state contends, defendant’s waiver of counsel, “by\nvirtue of his refusal to hire counsel for over a year despite repeated opportunities and warnings,\nwas voluntary, knowing and intelligent.”', 'This Court has held that “[a] valid waiver is effective only if a ‘defendant knows what he\nor she is doing and his or her choice is made with eyes open.’” Cruz, 109 A.3d at 390 (brackets\nomitted) (quoting Chabot, 682 A.2d at 1380). “A criminal defendant, therefore, should be ‘made\naware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation.’” Id. (quoting Chabot, 682 A.2d at\n1380). However, this Court has also stated that, while “a detailed colloquy between a trial justice', '- 16 -\nand a defendant on the record assists the trial justice in ascertaining the knowing and intelligent\nnature of a defendant’s waiver[,] * * * ‘such an inquiry is not constitutionally required.’” Id.\n(quoting State v. Spencer, 783 A.2d 413, 416 (R.I. 2001)).', 'The defendant contends that the first hearing justice’s colloquy with defendant prior to\ngranting the motion to withdraw was “clearly insufficient” to enable the hearing justice to be\ncertain that defendant “fully understood the potential consequences of his actions.” A review of\nthe record shows that, at the hearing during which the motion to withdraw was granted, the first\nhearing justice informed defendant of the seriousness of his situation prior to granting the motion.\nThe hearing justice stated: “Mr. Souto, this is a critical situation as you are facing a felony charge,\nfacing a trial, facing an offer. * * * What you really need right now is an attorney.” The hearing\njustice further informed defendant that he had a right to represent himself during the legal process.\nIt is also true that the hearing justice did not expressly tell defendant that he would be required to\nproceed pro se if he did not secure representation prior to trial.', 'However, even if we assume that, at the time of Connors’ withdrawal, defendant did not\nunderstand that he might be required to proceed to trial pro se if he did not hire an attorney, this\nfact does not demonstrate a constitutionally inadequate waiver of counsel. The relevant inquiry\nhere is whether the trial justice erred in finding that defendant knowingly and intelligently waived\nhis right to counsel prior to trial. As we have stated, in the fourteen months following Connors’\nwithdrawal from defendant’s representation on March 13, 2014, and prior to the May 18, 2015\ntrial, defendant appeared before two justices of the Superior Court at least a dozen times. At each\nhearing, the hearing justices emphasized the critical need for defendant to retain an attorney as\nsoon as possible. The hearing justices also made it clear to defendant that the case needed to move\nto trial, and on several occasions, set trial dates. Importantly, defendant was expressly warned at', '- 17 -\nseveral of those hearings that he would represent himself at trial if he did not obtain an attorney,\nand his responses suggested that he understood this possibility.10\n10', 'For example, on May 1, 2014, more than a year before trial, defendant was warned at a pretrial\nconference that he would be representing himself at trial. The following colloquy took place at\nthat hearing:', '“THE COURT:', 'I’d love to hear the side of your story.', 'For you to say it here is to put you at', 'risk because they’re going to use what', 'you say against you at trial, and you', 'have a right not to incriminate', 'yourself. If we get you to an attorney,', 'you’re protected.', 'I’m trying to protect you. So if you', 'get an attorney, fine. Otherwise, by', 'then, I will read the -- I will read the', 'police report.

Do something about it. Get an', 'attorney.”\nThe defendant also would have been aware of this possibility after a brief discussion between\ncounsel for the state and the hearing justice on September 15, 2014, which proceeded as follows:', '“[THE STATE]:', 'This case was already set down for', 'trial on or after October 1st; I ask that', 'it remain.

On the first morning of trial, the trial justice carefully reviewed the\ntravel of the case, noted a defendant’s critical right to be able to choose his or her counsel, and\nWhen the matter was set for trial before the second hearing justice, defendant made a\nrepresentation that he could not afford a lawyer at that time. The hearing justice expressly\ninformed defendant of the consequences of failure to obtain representation:', '“THE COURT:', 'Mr. Souto, you’ve had more than', 'enough time. If you are indigent as', 'you claim you are, you don’t have any', 'money, then you might be eligible for', 'the Public Defender’s office services,', 'but you have to apply. * * *', '“* * *', '“THE COURT:', 'Do you think you can just keep', 'getting this case continued and', 'continued because you say you don’t', 'have a lawyer when it’s called ready', 'for trial back in September?', '“THE DEFENDANT:', 'No.', '“* * *', '“THE COURT:', 'Either you’re going to the Public', 'Defender’s office or you’re going to', 'represent yourself.', '“* * *', '“THE COURT:', '* * * You are to go see [the public', 'defender],', 'make', 'your', 'own', 'appointment, meet with them, give', 'them the information necessary.

One week from', 'today.”', '- 19 -\ndecided to proceed with defendant representing himself after considering the totality of the\ncircumstances of the case. We see no reason to conclude that this decision was in error or a\nviolation of defendant’s constitutional rights.', 'The defendant contends that the trial justice failed to address the remainder of the Chabot\nfactors, and that these factors would cut in favor of the conclusion that defendant did not knowingly\nand intelligently waive his right to counsel. The defendant argues that his background and\nexperience rendered him incompetent to present his own defense, that he was not afforded standby\ncounsel, and that he did not have any prior “useful experience with the criminal justice system.”', 'First, this Court has been clear that a trial justice is not required to consider all of the Chabot\nfactors absent an issue with defendant’s mental competency. See Laurence, 848 A.2d at 254. There\nis no suggestion here that mental competency was at issue. Furthermore, we have held that “a trial\njustice ‘need not make any assessment of the extent of the defendant’s technical legal knowledge\nin determining the defendant’s knowing exercise of the right to defend himself.’” Cruz, 109 A.3d\nat 390 (quoting State v. Briggs, 787 A.2d 479, 485 (R.I. 2001)). It is true that defendant did not\nhave standby counsel at the proceedings, and, for the sake of this discussion, we also assume that\ndefendant is relatively unfamiliar with the judicial system. However, given the hearing justices’\nclear warnings to defendant at the numerous pretrial hearings about the dangers of proceeding pro\nse, in addition to the trial justice’s finding that defendant manipulated the proceedings by\nintentionally delaying his quest to engage an attorney, we cannot say that the trial justice erred in\nfinding that defendant knowingly and intentionally waived his right to counsel.', 'Thus, after careful consideration of the totality of the circumstances, it is our opinion that\nthe defendant voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived his right to counsel.', '- 20 -', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of conviction.

Anthony Perkins’s application for postconviction relief\nbased on ineffective assistance of counsel was denied in the Superior Court, and he appealed to\nthis Court, contending that the trial justice’s decision was in error. This case came before the\nSupreme Court on October 2, 2013, pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why\nthe issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. We have considered the record\nand the written and oral submissions of the parties, conclude that cause has not been shown, and\nproceed to decide the appeal without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in\nthis opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On October 15, 1999, applicant, Anthony Perkins, entered a plea of nolo contendere to a\ncharge of first-degree robbery and was sentenced to twenty years with nine years to serve and\neleven years suspended, with probation. While he was on parole from that sentence, applicant\nwas charged with second-degree child molestation. Of relevance to this appeal, the acts on', '-1-\nwhich the child-molestation charges were based occurred before applicant was convicted of\nrobbery.', 'On July 25, 2003, applicant pleaded nolo contendere to two counts of second-degree\nchild molestation. Under the terms of a plea agreement, he received a ten-year suspended\nsentence with ten years probation, both of which would run concurrently with his ongoing\nsentence on the robbery conviction. Perkins was also required to register as a sex offender and to\nundergo sex-offender treatment counseling as determined by the probation department.', 'On September 14, 2006, Perkins filed an application for postconviction relief. In that\napplication, he alleged that the attorney who had represented him in the child-molestation case\nhad provided him with ineffective assistance. The applicant alleged that his former attorney\nadvised him that if he had not pleaded to the child-molestation charges, the state would have\nsought to revoke his probation stemming from the robbery conviction. He further alleged that\nhis counsel told him that the state would then seek the revocation of his suspended sentence and\nthat he would be incarcerated for eleven years, starting immediately. Perkins said that this\nadvice was erroneous because he could not have been found to have violated the terms of his\nprobation based on conduct that occurred before he was on probation. The erroneous advice,\napplicant claimed, denied him the effective assistance of counsel.', 'The same Superior Court justice who accepted applicant’s nolo contendere plea to the\nchild-molestation charges held a hearing on applicant’s postconviction-relief application. In his\ndecision denying the application, the trial justice said that applicant had presented no evidence\nthat his former attorney gave him erroneous advice except for applicant’s own “self-serving\nstatements and allegations” and that, even if he had been provided with erroneous advice,\napplicant nonetheless had failed to demonstrate that the result of the earlier proceedings would', '-2-\nhave been different. As a result, the trial justice denied the application, and Perkins timely\nappealed to this Court.', 'On appeal, applicant argues that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel\nbecause of his former attorney’s guidance that, if he did not plead guilty to the child-molestation\ncharges, then the state would have sought to revoke his probation. He also argues that the trial\njustice abused his discretion when he denied the application in the face of applicant’s\nuncontroverted testimony during the postconviction-relief hearing.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'Postconviction relief is available pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-1(a)(1), which provides\na remedy to a person who has been convicted of a crime and who demonstrates “[t]hat the\nconviction or the sentence was in violation of the constitution of the United States or the\nconstitution or laws of this state[.]” See also Hazard v. State, 64 A.3d 749, 756 (R.I. 2013). An\napplicant for postconviction relief must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the relief\nshould be granted. Id.', 'On appeal, “this Court affords great deference to the hearing justice’s findings of fact and\nwill not disturb his or her ruling ‘absent clear error or a showing that the [hearing] justice\noverlooked or misconceived material evidence.’” Hazard, 64 A.3d at 756 (quoting Higham v.\nState, 45 A.3d 1180, 1183 (R.I. 2012)).', '“When a postconviction relief decision involves\n‘questions of fact or mixed questions of law and fact pertaining to an alleged violation of an\napplicant’s constitutional rights[,]’ we review those issues de novo.” Neufville v.

Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). Hazard, 64\nA.3d at 756. Under that exacting standard, applicants must demonstrate both that “counsel’s\nperformance was deficient in that it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness” and that\n“such deficient performance was so prejudicial to the defense and the errors were so serious as to\namount to a deprivation of the applicant’s right to a fair trial.” Id. (quoting Tassone v. State, 42\nA.3d 1277, 1284-85 (R.I. 2012)).', 'The first prong of the Strickland analysis requires an applicant to show “that counsel’s\nperformance was deficient[, which] requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that\ncounsel was not functioning as the ‘counsel’ guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth\nAmendment.” Neufville, 13 A.3d at 610 (quoting Powers v. State, 734 A.2d 508, 522 (R.I.\n1999)). To overcome this obstacle, there must be a showing that “‘counsel’s advice was not\nwithin the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases * * * .’” Id. (quoting\nRodrigues v. State, 985 A.2d 311, 315 (R.I. 2009)). There is, however, “a strong presumption\nthat counsel’s conduct falls within the permissible range of assistance.” Id. (citing Hazard v.\nState, 968 A.2d 886, 892 (R.I. 2009)).', 'The Strickland test’s second prong is satisfied by a showing of prejudice resulting from\ncounsel’s deficient performance. Hazard, 64 A.3d at 757. In this context, prejudice is defined as\n“‘a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the\nproceeding would have been different[,]’” id., which, in a plea context, means that the applicant', '-4-\n“‘would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial’ and, importantly, that\nthe outcome of the trial would have been different.” Neufville, 13 A.3d at 611 (quoting State v.\nFigueroa, 639 A.2d 495, 500 (R.I. 1994)). Notably, we have said that “when counsel has secured\na shorter sentence than what the defendant could have received had he gone to trial, the\n[applicant] has an almost insurmountable burden to establish prejudice.” Id. at 614 (citing\nRodrigues, 985 A.3d at 317).', 'In Figueroa, 639 A.2d at 500, we considered the misrepresentations by counsel to a\ndefendant who had pleaded nolo contendere. There, there was no question that the defendant\nhad been given erroneous advice by his attorney: he was told that his nolo contendere plea was\nnot a conviction under Rhode Island law and that the Spanish-language plea form was identical\nto the English-language form. Id. We held that “[a]lthough th[e] misrepresentations may have\nfallen below acceptable standards of attorney performance, [the applicant] did not satisfactorily\nprove that the outcome would have been different if he had proceeded to trial.” Id. Because the\napplicant admitted that he committed the gun offense for which he was charged, we said that a\ntrial likely would have resulted in a conviction and sentence of imprisonment. Id. at 500-01.', 'In the case presently before us, the trial justice determined that applicant had failed to\ndemonstrate that he had received the advice that he claims was constitutionally deficient. In his\ndecision, the trial justice recounted that applicant had failed to directly answer questions about\nwhether he had been advised to lie during the plea colloquy and that he also had testified\ninconsistently about how much he and his attorney had discussed the potential plea. The trial\njustice also observed that applicant was attempting to persuade the trial justice that he had lied\nduring the plea colloquy but that he was testifying truthfully at the postconviction-relief hearing.\nBecause the trial justice determined that applicant had failed to submit “a scintilla of evidence”', '-5-\nbeyond his own “self-serving statements and allegations,” and because those statements and\nallegations had failed to persuade him, the trial justice denied the application. 1', 'Although applicant argues to this Court that the advice that probation could be revoked\nbased on conduct that predated the probation would amount to a legal impossibility, and\ntherefore was clearly deficient, he is unable to articulate why we should reject the trial justice’s\nfinding that applicant did not receive that advice from his attorney. See Pelletier v. Laureanno,\n46 A.3d 28, 39 (R.I. 2012) (viewing with deference a trial justice’s decision to reject\nuncontroverted testimony of a party to the litigation and interested witness because he found that\nit was “not credible,” “self-serving,” and “biased”). Indeed, the trial justice concluded that the\nadvice would have been erroneous if it had been given, but he also found that applicant had\nfailed to satisfy his burden that the advice was in fact given. 2 We cannot say that the trial justice\nwas clearly wrong or that he overlooked or misconceived material evidence when he found that\napplicant failed to satisfy his burden. See Hazard, 64 A.3d at 756.', 'We are also of the opinion that, even if he had somehow been able to satisfy the first\nprong of the Strickland analysis, applicant has failed to show that prejudice resulted from any\nerroneous advice that he may have received. See Neufville, 13 A.3d at 610-11, 614. Other than\nhis own conclusion that he would have been acquitted, Perkins failed to provide any reason why\nthe outcome of a trial would have been more favorable to him than was his disposition. See id.\n1', 'The attorney who represented applicant in the child-molestation information and subsequent\nplea to that charge was not called to testify during the postconviction-relief proceedings.\n2', 'Although the determination is not necessary to decide this case, we agree with the trial justice\nthat such advice would have been erroneous. In State v. Bergevine, 883 A.2d 1158, 1158-59\n(R.I. 2005) (mem.), we considered “[t]he notion of a defendant being on probation with respect\nto a criminal offense before being convicted of the crime itself * * * .” We held that it “defies\ncommon sense,” “is not legally viable,” and “quite apart from being illogical, is rife with\npractical problems,” such as the fact that a person could be violated before he or she was\nsentenced to the probation. Id. at 1158, 1159.', '-6-\nIndeed, there is nothing on which this Court could base a conclusion that a different outcome\nwould have resulted from a trial. See Figueroa, 639 A.2d at 500-01 (noting the absence of\nanything that might show an applicant’s innocence and concluding that a trial “most probabl[y]”\nwould have led to a conviction).', 'In Neufville, 13 A.3d at 614, we said that the burden of showing prejudice is “almost\ninsurmountable” when the sentence received after a plea is shorter than the sentence that an\napplicant could have received had he proceeded to trial. The applicant here was charged with\nsecond-degree child molestation under G.L. 1956 § 11-37-8.3. Pursuant to § 11-37-8.4, the\napplicant could have been sentenced to between six and thirty years for each count if he was\nconvicted after trial, and those sentences could have been imposed consecutively and even\nconsecutive to the robbery sentence he was already serving. See State v. Fuentes, 433 A.2d 184,\n192 (R.I. 1981). By striking a favorable agreement with the state and pleading nolo contendere,\nhe received only a ten-year sentence, all of which was suspended and ran concurrently with his\nrobbery sentence.', 'The applicant has failed to demonstrate that he suffered any prejudice\nwhatsoever from the advice that he contends he received, and his application thus falls short on\nthe Strickland test’s second prong as well.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

Long, 61 A.3d 439, 447 (R.I. 2013) (“The law is well settled\nthat one who aids and abets in the commission of the crime and is also present at the scene may\nbe charged and convicted as a principal.” (quoting State v. Davis, 877 A.2d 642, 648 (R.I.\n2005))).', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'This appeal arises from an incident that occurred on July 24, 2010. On that date, Justin\nMcFadden (complainant or McFadden), as he had in the past, went to the Crossroads’2 clinic for\nmedical services. The events that followed his arrival, however, interrupted his purpose and\ninstigated the criminal prosecution that is at issue in this case.', 'McFadden testified that, when he arrived at Crossroads, he carried in his pockets his bank\ncards, bus pass, approximately $500 in cash, a necklace, and a bag of medication.', 'He\nimmediately went downstairs to the clinic, but learned that he could not be seen for at least\nanother hour. He left and waited his turn in an outdoor locker area, sitting on the concrete floor\nwith his back against a wall. He reported seeing two people, later identified as Juan Lugo (Lugo)\nand Jackson Rivera (Rivera),3 about five to eight feet away, huddled together and conversing in\nSpanish. McFadden observed them for a short while before they turned to speak with a third\nman, later identified as Padilla, waiting outside the gate.4 One of the men walked over to Padilla,\nwho remained outside the gate, and both looked over at McFadden. At that point, they were\napproximately seventeen feet away from McFadden. From five to eight feet away, the third man\ncontinued to look “right at” him.', 'At this point, all three men came together and “came at [McFadden].” Approximately\nfour feet before reaching him, Padilla “broke off” from the group. Rivera and Lugo continued\n2', 'Crossroads is an organization in Providence that offers shelter and other services to homeless\nindividuals.\n3', 'Lugo and Rivera pled nolo contendere to their charges resulting from this incident and are not\ninvolved in this appeal.\n4', 'We recognize that the term “gate” is subject to multiple interpretations and, as such, it caused\nsome confusion during trial. The trial justice addressed the confusion, saying “[o]ne thing we\ncan call it is a door. We can call it a gate because it is attached to a fence. Usually when\nsomething opens attached to a fence you often call it a gate, but we can call it a door as well.”', '-2-\ntowards McFadden, and Lugo “pulled out a Rambo style knife and charged at [him].” After\nLugo pulled out the knife, McFadden recalled him saying “I’m going to stab you” or “[g]ive\nwhat you have, your money.” Rivera reiterated that sentiment, telling McFadden “[g]ive him the\nmoney.”', 'Within a few seconds of these statements, Lugo stabbed McFadden in his arm. Padilla\nthen “rushed at [McFadden].” McFadden remembered “[p]unching, kicking, whatever [he]\ncould do” to protect himself. He testified that he tried to grab Lugo’s arm. He remembered he\n“had a good grip on [Lugo],” but Padilla “hit [him] and [he] got turned around.” Lugo then\nstabbed him multiple times in the back. McFadden testified that he felt “[o]ne gigantic [incision]\nand one not so gigantic [incision].” Rivera then “was trying to go in [McFadden’s] pockets.”\nThough in and out of consciousness at that point, McFadden felt his belongings being removed\nfrom his pockets. McFadden testified at trial that Padilla was the one who “hit [him] like a\nlinebacker” before going through his pockets while he was on the ground. In his statement to the\ngrand jury six months after the incident, McFadden had testified that Padilla “came up from\nbehind [him] pretty quickly” after he was stabbed in the arm.', 'He also noted that, while he\nwrestled Padilla, he “got a good look at his face.”', 'At trial, McFadden testified that, following the stabbing, he chased after the three men.\nAs he ran, he recalled seeing and hearing a woman, later identified as Frances Paban, who was\n“very upset” “screaming” at Lugo, “not in so many words saying you are an idiot, what are you\ndoing.” McFadden recalled that a person grabbed him from behind, attempting to stop his\nbleeding. Fire and rescue soon arrived and transported him to the hospital. He awoke a day or\nso later to learn that his kidney had been lacerated. In addition, he had superficial wounds on his\narm and back, and an interior mesh had been inserted into his abdomen. He was initially', '-3-\nreleased from the hospital after one week, but later hospitalized a second time after developing\nan infection. He also spent six months using a walker upon his release.', 'The day after the attack, McFadden gave the police a recorded statement wherein he\nreviewed three photo arrays to identify his attackers. The police instructed McFadden to circle\nanyone who participated in the attack, and to write the nature of that person’s involvement under\nhis picture. McFadden identified Rivera as the man who said “give me the money” while\napproaching him alongside Lugo. In a second photo array, McFadden selected Lugo as the man\nwho stabbed him.', 'Finally, in a third photo array, McFadden recognized Padilla, who he\nacknowledged “was there.” The police returned three days later to take another statement, at\nwhich time McFadden confirmed the previous photo identifications.', 'A. Paban’s Testimony', 'In addition to McFadden, Frances Paban also testified as a state’s witness at trial.5 Paban\n– fifteen years old on the date of the attack – frequently stayed with her boyfriend, Lugo, at\nCrossroads, and on July 24, 2010 spent the morning outside Crossroads’ locker area doing drugs\nwith him. Despite her altered state, Paban recalled seeing Lugo, Rivera, and Padilla in the locker\narea that day.', 'While in the locker area, Paban heard Lugo and Rivera tell each other in Spanish,6 in the\npresence of McFadden, that they wanted to rob him. When she heard this, Paban had lost sight\nof Padilla, though she had previously seen him sitting silently atop a crate shaving his legs about\nthirty feet away from Lugo and Rivera. Paban “went to go see what was going on,” and testified\nthat, when she reached Lugo, she did not see anyone besides Rivera in his immediate vicinity.\n5', 'The state called two other witnesses to testify as well: Officer Jose Deschamps and Det. Emilio\nMatos, Jr. The defense called one witness, Lugo, who testified that Padilla was not involved in\nthe robbery and, instead, that he acted alone.\n6', 'Paban testified to her belief that Lugo and Rivera knew the victim did not understand Spanish.', '-4-\nAfter Lugo told her to sit back down, she returned to her previous spot, from which she could no\nlonger see Lugo and Rivera, and she “sat on a crate, * * * put [her] headphones * * * on” and\n“zoned out.” Approximately five to ten minutes later, Paban saw Lugo come “outside of the\nlocker, behind from where the locker was[,] with blood on his hands and on his clothes.”\nTemporarily deafened by her headphones, Paban said she had not heard any commotion, nor had\nshe seen Padilla move from the crate.', 'Amid the chaos, Paban and Lugo agreed to meet at Amos House.7 She rode a bicycle to\nthe agreed place. Paban, unaware of Rivera’s location, met Lugo at Amos House; and, as Lugo\nsat down at a picnic table, she saw the handle of a knife and blood dripping down his pants leg.\nShortly thereafter, Rivera arrived, followed by Padilla. The police interrupted their rendezvous\nmoments later, “thr[owing] [Lugo] to the floor, lift[ing] up his shirt and f[inding] his knife.”8\nMeanwhile, Rivera was about six picnic tables away.', 'After the police arrested Lugo, Paban went to the police station with Det. Emilio Matos\nand gave a full recounting of the morning’s events. Later that evening, however, Paban returned\nto the station seeking to change her statement. While her second statement references Padilla’s\ninvolvement, her first statement makes no mention of him. In her second statement to Det.\nMatos, Paban, in describing the events, said “[Padilla] got involved in it and [he] said I will\nwatch but I want half and they said all right.” She elaborated that “[Padilla] was at the end of it,\n7', 'Amos House is an organization that offers food, shelter, and social services to those in need in\nthe Providence area.\n8', 'During trial, Officer Jose Deschamps testified about his experience escorting Lugo to the police\nstation. Deschamps recalled Lugo telling him: “I know who took the money. It was two of my\nfam. They are probably going back to Crossroads. Oh, shit, there they are.” Deschamps then\nsaw “two male subjects,” later identified as Rivera and Padilla, walking down the street. Lugo,\nwith his hands cuffed behind his back, motioned his head in Rivera and Padilla’s direction.\nDeschamps broadcast a description of Rivera and Padilla over his radio, and officers arrived and\narrested them.', '-5-\nat the end of the gate watching it * * * he was very aware of [what was going on] * * * he * * *\n[w]anted a cut.” At trial, Paban again switched her story, testifying that Padilla had nothing to\ndo with the incident and instead helped the victim tend to his wounds. In addition, she testified\nthat, following her first statement to police but before her second, she used drugs.', 'Toward the end of her trial testimony, Paban asked the trial justice if she could “come up\nand talk to [him] * * * away from everybody else.” He denied her request, but directed the\nprosecutor to bring her issue to his attention if necessary. Later in her testimony, Padilla’s\nattorney asked Paban to read her witness statement aloud, to which she responded “[I] can’t read.\nI can follow along if you read but I can’t read it.” Upon further inquiry, she clarified that she had\na limited reading ability such that she can read names and can “follow along if [someone] read[s]\nit out loud.”', 'Throughout her trial testimony, each time counsel for either side referred Paban to her\nwitness statements, they either read her the statement or played her a recording of it. Moreover,\nprior to testifying, Paban was both permitted to listen to a recording of her statement and\nprovided with a transcript of it. When asked if she recognized the transcript of her statement, she\nindicated that she did; she said she followed along with the transcript while listening to the\nrecording at the station.', ""Padilla moved to dismiss his charge pursuant to Rule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of\nCriminal Procedure after the state rested, but the trial justice reserved his decision until the\ndefense presented its case. At the conclusion of all evidence, the trial justice denied the motion\nto dismiss. In so doing, the trial justice quoted State v. McKone, 673 A.2d 1068 (R.I. 1996),\nwhich allows that “if the trial justice in a criminal case setting concludes that the trial evidence is\nsufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, he or she denies the defendant's motion to"", '-6-\ndismiss and, if both sides have rested, enters decision and judgment of conviction thereon.” Id.\nat 1073. He ultimately determined that the evidence proved Padilla guilty of first-degree robbery\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. On April 14, 2014, he sentenced Padilla to fifteen years at the Adult\nCorrectional Institutions, with four years to serve and eleven years suspended with probation.\nPadilla filed a notice of appeal on April 15, 2014.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“[T]his Court affords great deference to a trial justice’s credibility determinations when\nsitting without a jury.” State v. Edwards, 147 A.3d 982, 987 (R.I. 2016). “When reviewing\ndeterminations of credibility and findings of fact by a trial justice sitting without a jury, this\nCourt will not disturb the trial justice’s findings unless they are clearly wrong or the trial justice\nmisconceived or overlooked material evidence on a controlling issue.” State v. Erminelli, 991\nA.2d 1064, 1069 (R.I. 2010) (quoting State v. Adewumi, 966 A.2d 1217, 1222 (R.I. 2009)).\n“When the record indicates that competent evidence supports the trial justice’s findings, we shall\nnot substitute our view of the evidence for his [or hers] even though a contrary conclusion could\nhave been reached.” Edwards, 147 A.3d at 987 (quoting State v. Van Dongen, 132 A.3d 1070,\n1076 (R.I. 2016)).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, Padilla argues that the trial justice committed two errors warranting reversal\nof his conviction: (1) that the trial justice misconstrued McFadden’s testimony as to who\nconfronted him; and (2) that the trial justice erred in relying on Paban’s witness statements where', '-7-\nher inability to read rendered her unable to acknowledge them. We will discuss each issue in\nturn.', 'A. McFadden’s Testimony', 'Padilla first challenges the trial justice’s characterization of the attack, arguing that he\ninaccurately recounted McFadden’s testimony and, specifically, that he erred in saying that “all\nthree men approached [McFadden]” and “all three confronted [McFadden].” Padilla argues that,\nrather than “all three” approaching the complainant, McFadden actually testified that only Lugo\nand Rivera approached and confronted him. We disagree and instead hold that the trial justice,\nin summarizing McFadden’s testimony, accurately recounted it.', 'In describing the complainant’s testimony, the trial justice highlighted that “Mr.\nMcFadden then testified that all three men approached him. He could tell from their demeanor\nas they approached that ‘something bad was going to happen close.’” Padilla primarily takes\nissue with the trial justice’s statement that he “confronted” McFadden along with Lugo and\nRivera. However, we do not find the trial justice’s indication that Padilla participated in the\ninitial confrontation inconsistent with the record. During his testimony, McFadden narrated that\nthe “man that was standing [ten] feet away was joined by the other two and they came at me.”\nWhen asked specifically by the trial justice whether “all three c[a]me towards you,” he answered\nin the affirmative.', 'We believe, contrary to Padilla’s argument, that “confront” accurately\ndescribes McFadden’s narration of Padilla’s actions – that Padilla “c[a]me towards” McFadden\nwith Lugo and Rivera before retreating.', 'Furthermore, it is clear that Padilla takes the trial justice’s summary out of context.\nWhile he is correct that McFadden testified that Padilla “broke off and was near the [gate] area”\nafter approaching the complainant, the trial justice also spoke of Padilla’s departure from the', '-8-\ngroup. The trial justice, after saying that “all three men approached [McFadden],” continued that\n“[s]hortly after all three confronted him one of the men who he later identified as Mr. Padilla\nbroke off from the confrontation * * *.” Later, the trial justice reiterated that “[McFadden]\nrecalled all three men approaching and he sensed something bad was about to happen. As the\nconfrontation between Mr. McFadden and these men began, he recalled Mr. Padilla breaking off\nfrom the group and taking a position near the gate area or the entrance to that locker area.” This\nCourt has said that a trial justice should not “pick one isolated statement in a witness’s testimony\nout of context from the whole of it.” State v. Brown, 709 A.2d 465, 481 (R.I. 1998). It follows,\nthen, that counsel should refrain from doing the same. See Deatte v. Duxbury, 66 R.I. 1, 9, 17\nA.2d 24, 27 (1940) (“The suggestion of the trial justice to which the complainant objects must be\nread with what precedes and follows; it should not be isolated from its context * * *.”).', 'The trial justice did not “misconceive[ ] or overlook[ ] material evidence” sufficient to\nwarrant reversal. Erminelli, 991 A.2d at 1069. Rather, Padilla has sequestered one sentence of\nthe trial justice’s bench decision without relating it back to the whole. Thus, we accept the trial\njustice’s summary as accurate.', 'B. Paban’s Prior Statements', 'Next, Padilla challenges Paban’s recognition of her prior witness statements during her\ntestimony. He argues that Paban’s concession late in her testimony that she could not read\nrendered her unable to effectively acknowledge her prior statements, which the trial justice relied\non in finding him guilty. Padilla’s argument, however, is unpersuasive.', 'In light of the trial justice’s revelation that Paban’s testimony was “the most enlightening\nand damaging * * * which clearly implicates and explains in detail Mr. Padilla’s participation in\nthis robbery,” it is not surprising that Padilla seeks to undermine it. “However, as we have stated', ""-9-\nmany times, this Court's ‘raise-or-waive’ rule precludes our consideration of an issue that has not\nbeen raised and articulated at trial. * * * It is well settled that a litigant cannot raise an objection\nor advance a new theory on appeal if it was not raised before the trial court.” State v. Bido, 941\nA.2d 822, 828-29 (R.I. 2008). Padilla did not take issue with the prosecutor’s use of Paban’s\nprior statements at trial, and his failure to challenge it then precludes him from now raising the\nargument on appeal. As such, having failed to preserve it, Padilla has waived his objection."", 'Nevertheless, even if we were to overlook the “raise-or-waive” rule, we still would not be\ninclined to hold that the trial justice erred in relying on Paban’s testimony regarding her prior\nstatements. In his bench decision, the trial justice recalled that, during her testimony, “[Paban]\nwas confronted with the inculpatory statements she attributed to Mr. Padilla that were contained\nin her second taped statement * * *. Those statements from her recorded statement were placed\nin front of her in the courtroom and she in her statement acknowledged all of these statements\nwere made in her presence according to that recorded statement.” Padilla argues that Paban’s\ninability to read means she was unable to recognize her prior statements. However, his argument\nrelies on the misconception that the prosecutor asked Paban to read her statements before she\nacknowledged them as her own.', 'Instead, before asking Paban if she recalled a specific\nstatement, the prosecutor either read it to her aloud or played her a recording of it, in which she\nrecognized her voice.9 Moreover, during her testimony, Paban had a copy of the transcript in\nfront of her, and she told Padilla’s counsel that she could “follow along if [someone] read[s] it\nout loud,” which is precisely what the prosecutor did.\n9', 'In fact, after Paban’s disclosure, Padilla’s counsel offered to utilize the same method as the\nprosecutor by reading Paban her statement – the same procedure with which Padilla now takes\nissue.', '- 10 -', 'A review of Paban’s testimony reveals that she was capable of recognizing her prior\nstatements, and could do so through the means the prosecutor used.', 'So, “[r]ather than\nmisconceive or overlook evidence, the trial justice duly considered” Paban’s testimony and\nstatements. Edwards, 147 A.3d at 987. Padilla’s contention that “the trial record indicates that\nshe had no ability to recognize [her July 24, 2010 statement’s] accuracy or inaccuracy” reflects a\ndistorted view of the record and one that we reject.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the aforementioned reasons, the Superior Court’s judgment is affirmed.

Three people\nwere primarily involved in the events leading to defendant’s arrest: Bobbie-Jo Dumont, Harold\nAndrews, 3 and defendant. Dumont and Andrews became acquainted in 2000 at a Providence\nstrip club, where Dumont was employed as a stripper and Andrews was a customer.

Dumont testified that, on the day\nafter this altercation, she and defendant asked Andrews to drive them to a remote field in the\nTown of Exeter, where the three had previously stashed a gun locker, and Andrews agreed.\nDumont further testified that, while she and Andrews were attempting to wipe fingerprints off\nthe gun locker, she saw defendant shoot and kill Andrews.', 'The defendant and Dumont were arrested for Andrews’s murder on June 6, 2003. Drew,\n919 A.2d at 402. On July 31, 2003, Dumont entered into a cooperation agreement with the state,\nin which she agreed to plead to one charge of possession of heroin and two counts of breaking\nand entering committed within the state of Rhode Island. The agreement provided for Dumont to\nreceive sentences of three years suspended/three years probation for the heroin possession charge\nand five years suspended/five years probation for the breaking-and-entering charges. The state\nalso agreed to withdraw a pending bail-violation notice that had been filed pursuant to Rule\n46(g) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure in an unrelated matter. The agreement\nwas executed in exchange for Dumont’s past and future cooperation and testimony in connection\nwith the prosecution of all criminal cases brought as a result of Andrews’s murder.', 'It is undisputed that the state provided defendant with the following documents prior to\ntrial: Dumont’s cooperation agreement, Dumont’s witness statements, and a narrative written by\n4', 'The exact number of breaking and enterings is not clear. On direct examination at trial,\nDumont testified that she, defendant, and Andrews broke into houses “just about every day”\nbetween November 2002 and June 2003. On cross-examination, defense counsel asked Dumont\nif she had committed “around 18 breaking and enterings,” and she answered affirmatively.\nAccording to a narrative written by Det. Gregory T. Ryan of the Swansea Police Department,\nDumont said “she had committed approximately 80 house breaks and larcenies.” Dumont’s\nwitness statement from August 7, 2003, lists seventeen specific addresses that she identified as\npart of the break-ins in which she participated.', '-3-\nDet.

On cross-examination, Det.

Ryan’s narrative states that “[a]s requested by Det.

The defendant asserts that the state’s failure to disclose this important information\ndeprived him of the benefit of knowing the full extent of Dumont’s cooperation agreement. The\ndefendant also argues that, under the dictates of Brady, the prosecution had a duty to disclose the\ninformation contained in Det. Ryan’s narrative regarding Det. Kershaw’s request to not charge\nDumont with the Massachusetts offenses.', 'The defendant first argues that this alleged\nnondisclosure was deliberate, as evidenced by the fact that Det. Kershaw was the lead detective\non defendant’s case and sat at counsel table throughout defendant’s trial.', 'Alternatively,\ndefendant argues that, even if the nondisclosure was not deliberate, a new trial is required\nbecause the undisclosed evidence was material.', 'Specifically, defendant explains that the\nevidence was material because the state’s case was highly dependent on Dumont’s testimony,\nand knowing the full extent of her agreement with the state was essential to attacking her\ncredibility.', 'The state responds by arguing that defendant’s motion was properly denied because the\nevidence at issue fails the two-part test established by this Court for deciding new-trial motions\nbased on newly discovered evidence. See Price, 66 A.3d at 417, discussed infra. First, the state\nargues that the evidence was not newly discovered because Dumont’s cooperation agreement\nreferred to “numerous” break-ins, and both Det. Kershaw’s narrative and Dumont’s witness\nstatement mentioned that Dumont was involved in break-ins in Massachusetts. Further, the state\nargues that defense counsel demonstrated knowledge of the alleged new evidence by referring to', '-7-\nthe Massachusetts break-ins, as well as the fact that Dumont had not been charged, during the\ncross-examinations of Dumont and Det. Kershaw at defendant’s trial. Next, the state argues that\nthe alleged new evidence was merely cumulative and impeaching rather than material, because\nthe state disclosed the terms of Dumont’s written cooperation agreement and the extent of\nDumont’s criminal activity was fully explored before the jury. Finally, the state argues that the\nalleged new evidence was not the kind that would likely change the verdict at a new trial because\nevidence demeaning Dumont’s credibility, such as her significant drug use and criminal activity,\nwas already presented at trial. As to the alleged Brady violation, the state asserts that Det.\nRyan’s narrative did not disclose any facts not previously known to defendant, as evidenced by\ndefendant’s trial strategy and the information contained in Det. Kershaw’s narrative.', 'A', 'The Defendant’s Motion for a New Trial Based on Newly Discovered Evidence', 'Trial courts use a two-pronged test when considering a motion for a new trial based on\nnewly discovered evidence brought pursuant to Rule 33. See Price, 66 A.3d at 417.', '“The first prong encompasses a four-part inquiry, requiring that the', 'evidence is (1) newly discovered since trial, (2) not discoverable', 'prior to trial with the exercise of due diligence, (3) not merely', 'cumulative or impeaching but rather material to the issue upon', 'which it is admissible, (4) of the type which would probably', 'change the verdict at trial.” Id. (quoting State v. Woods, 936 A.2d', '195, 197 (R.I. 2007)).\n“The second prong, which is to be addressed only if the requirements set forth in the first prong\nhave been satisfied, requires that the trial justice ‘determine if the evidence presented is credible\nenough to warrant a new trial.’” Id. (quoting Woods, 936 A.2d at 197).', 'Here, the trial justice first clarified that the evidence at issue was not Det. Ryan’s\nnarrative itself; rather it was “only the possibility that the report contain[ed] evidence of an', '-8-\nundisclosed agreement that may [have] amount[ed] to evidence of a non-disclosure in violation\nof due process.” The court did not find evidence to suggest that defendant was anything but\ndiligent in his pretrial efforts to discover information. Next, the court found that defendant was\naware, prior to his trial, that Dumont had been involved in break-ins in Massachusetts and that\nshe was not charged in return for her cooperation. Specifically, the trial justice pointed to Det.\nKershaw’s narrative, which stated that, as part of her cooperation agreement, Dumont “agreed to\nidentify ‘numerous residences’ in which she was involved in break-ins” and that she did in fact\nidentify residences “throughout Rhode Island and Massachusetts.” The trial justice also found\nthat in Dumont’s witness statement dated June 6, 2003, she identified seventeen such addresses,\nsome of which were located in Massachusetts. 10 Further, the court found that defense counsel\nquestioned Dumont about these break-ins during cross-examination at trial, in relation to her\ncooperation agreement. The court also found that defense counsel questioned Det. Kershaw\nabout the cooperation agreement as referenced in his narrative, including Det. Kershaw’s\nunderstanding that the agreement covered break-ins in both Massachusetts and Rhode Island.', 'Next, the trial justice found that, even if more information could have been provided\nregarding Dumont’s cooperation agreement as it related to the Massachusetts crimes, the\nevidence would have been merely cumulative and impeaching rather than material and would\nprobably not have changed the verdict at trial. The court found that, “given the amount of\nimpeachment evidence presented to the jury at trial regarding Ms. Dumont’s criminal past, it\nwould have been difficult to show that more information regarding her past would shake any\nconfidence in the verdict.”', 'Thus, the trial court found that the alleged newly discovered\nevidence failed the first prong of the test to be applied for Rule 33 motions based on newly\n10', 'The trial justice’s decision referred to Dumont’s statement dated June 6, 2003, but the August\n7, 2003, statement was actually the one that contained the addresses of the various residences.', '-9-\ndiscovered evidence. 11 There is no indication that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived\nrelevant and material evidence while conducting this analysis; we therefore affirm the court’s\ndecision in this regard.', 'B', 'The Defendant’s Due-Process Claim', 'In order to comply with the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution, the\nstate must “provide a criminal defendant with certain information.” State v.

Here, the parties disagree on the threshold issue of whether the state failed to disclose\ninformation regarding an agreement not to charge Dumont with the Massachusetts break-ins.\nThe defendant claims that “[n]o information regarding an agreement not to charge Ms. Dumont\nwith the Massachusetts B & E’s was ever provided to [defendant] at any point before or during\nhis trial.” Contrary to defendant’s assertion, however, the state provided defendant with several\ndocuments implying that Dumont had participated in, but had not been charged with, the\nMassachusetts break-ins. First, defendant received Det. Kershaw’s narrative, which stated:', '“As part of a cooperational [sic] agreement with Attorney Generals', '[sic] Department, Bobbie Joe Dumont agreed to identify numerous', 'residences in which she, Harold Drew and Harold Andrews had', 'broken into throughout the year of 2003.

Third, defendant\nreceived the written cooperation agreement between Dumont and the state of Rhode Island, in\nwhich Dumont agreed to plead to one charge of possession of heroin and two counts of breaking\nand entering in exchange for her “past cooperation and continued full cooperation and truthful\ntestimony * * * in connection with the prosecution of all criminals [sic] cases brought as a result\nof a murder of Harold Andrews * * * and numerous breaking crimes committed by Harold Drew\n* * *.”', 'Additionally, defendant’s trial strategy suggests that he believed Dumont was not charged\nwith the Massachusetts crimes in exchange for her cooperation with the state of Rhode Island.\nThe following line of questioning occurred during defense counsel’s cross-examination of\nDumont, regarding the break-ins that she identified for the Rhode Island State Police:', '“Q', 'And you told investigators at the [Adult Correctional', 'Institutions], including the Rhode Island State Police who', 'were with you, that you did about 18 -- around 18 breaking', 'and enterings, right?', '“A', 'I don’t remember if I said that.', '“Q', 'You pointed out a lot to them?', '“A', 'Pointed out a lot to them.', '“Q', 'Did you count them?', '“A', 'I didn’t count them, no.', '“Q', '18 sound good to you?', '“A', 'What do you mean sounds good?', '“Q', 'Sound too high or too low?', '“A', 'As many as I pointed out, maybe.', '“Q', 'If I told you, going through your transcript in 2003, that', 'there are 18 different locations that you brought the Rhode', 'Island State Police to, would that be accurate?', '“A', 'Okay.', '“Q', 'Okay.

Ryan’s newly\ndiscovered narrative: “As requested by Det. Arthur Kershaw, as part of her cooperation, Bobbie\nJo Dumont will not be charged due to her assistance as a witness.” This statement does not\nreflect any sort of formal agreement; rather, it illustrates a mere conversation between two\ndetectives. 12 During the defendant’s motion hearing, Det. Kershaw testified that he recalled\ntelling Det. Ryan to “hold off” on charging Dumont with the Massachusetts breaking and\nenterings.', 'He then stated that he recalled telling Det. Ryan about the agreement between\nDumont and the state of Rhode Island and that he may have asked Det.

The previous renter, Withers, had been a tenant for only two months when\nshe left a note indicating that she had moved and would pick her mattress up at a later date.', 'At trial, DiPaola testified that, as she was cleaning, Barros yelled to her that Withers and\na man—later identified in the police report as Antonio Bryant—were approaching the property.\nThe property had exterior stairs in the front of the building, and it also had interior stairs leading\nup to the apartment door. DiPaola instructed Barros to stop Withers from coming into the\napartment. In response to “yelling and shouting,” DiPaola recalled that she opened the apartment\ndoor to see Withers and Bryant walking up the stairs. DiPaola testified that Withers was walking\nbackwards up the outside stairwell, using a walker, and Bryant was assisting by pushing the\nwalker.', 'DiPaola walked down the interior stairs and began yelling at Withers, “[y]ou can’t come\nin.” At this point, DiPaola observed Withers “barrelling [sic] up the stairs,” before Withers\n“grabbed [her] on [her] arm” and “threw [her] down the stairs.” DiPaola tumbled down about\nfour or five stairs and landed at the very bottom of the stairwell. In response, DiPaola called out\nto Barros, “Help me. She threw me downstairs.” DiPaola testified that Barros was located on\nthe exterior stairs at this time.', 'At trial, Barros recalled walking out of the building to the exterior stairs as Withers and\nBryant were walking up those stairs. He called the police to report Withers’ arrival on the\nproperty without DiPaola’s consent, and at the same time he noticed DiPaola “on the floor,\nyelling, Call [sic] the police. She just pushed me down the stairs.” On cross-examination,\ndefense counsel asked Barros whether he had seen Withers walking up the inside stairs, to which\nBarros responded, “She went passed [sic] me with the other guy * * * and she started going up', '-2-\nthe stairs.” Barros then clarified that he did not actually see Withers going up the stairs because\nhe was looking at his phone, but he stated that he knew she had been walking up the stairs.', 'Officer Brian Auclair responded to DiPaola’s apartment building for a reported assault,\nand he spoke with DiPaola who “appeared upset. I believe she was crying.” Officer Auclair\ntestified that DiPaola told him she was pushed down the stairs by the second-floor tenant.\nOfficer Auclair took a written statement from DiPaola, who was “shaking” while she wrote. In\nhis police report, Officer Auclair memorialized the events as follows:', '“DiPaola and Barros stated that Tonya Withers * * * and Antonio', 'Bryant * * * came rushing up the stairs and began to force the door', 'open. When DiPaola ran down the stairs telling her to stop,', 'Withers pushed her causing DiPaola to fall down the stairs.

And she grab[ed] me and push[ed] me\ndown outside stairs.” On redirect, the prosecutor asked DiPaola what she considered “outside”\nstairs, and DiPaola responded that she meant the stairs outside the apartment, meaning the\ninterior stairs.', 'On cross-examination, defense counsel confronted DiPaola with her prior testimony from\na housing court hearing a few weeks after the purported assault. In those proceedings, DiPaola\ndescribed the incident: “I came to the front door, and [Withers] started screaming at me, and I\nwas in front of the door, and she was trying to move me out of the door, and she literally picked\nme up and threw me down the stairs.” When defense counsel asked DiPaola at trial to what\nstairs she had been referring, DiPaola clarified that she considered the apartment door the front\ndoor, indicating that the stairs she was thrown down were the interior stairs.', '-3-', 'After the close of the trial, the jury found defendant guilty of simple assault. The\ndefendant moved for a new trial, which was denied. The defendant was sentenced to one year of\nprobation, including mental health counseling. The trial justice also ordered no contact between\ndefendant and the victim. The defendant timely appealed to this Court. In her appeal, defendant\nraises two issues—(1) the trial justice erred in denying a motion for a new trial; and (2) the trial\njustice erred in not letting defendant proceed pro se, pursuant to the Sixth Amendment to the\nUnited States Constitution and article 1, section 10 of the Rhode Island Constitution.1', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'A', 'Motion for a New Trial', 'When this Court reviews a motion for a new trial, we give “great weight” to a trial\njustice’s ruling when she “articulate[s] sufficient reasoning in support of the ruling.” State v.\nKizekai, 19 A.3d 583, 589 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v.

The apartment building had two sets of\nstairs—one interior and one exterior. DiPaola’s description of Withers’ assault “troubled” the\ntrial justice as DiPaola placed the assault on the interior stairwell, while she had referred to the\nlocation in the witness statement as occurring on the “outside stairs.”', 'The trial justice also commented on the trial version of DiPaola’s account of the incident,\nexplaining that she found “the version [DiPaola] offered at trial” was “really difficult to\nunderstand logistically how it occurred.” She suggested that the confusing aspect of DiPaola’s\ntestimony was how DiPaola could have been “thrown down the stairs” without “hit[ting] the\nbody of the [d]efendant * * * [or] the walker,” but rather, “she just went down the stairs.”\nReferring to the housing court transcript, the trial justice also remarked that Barros testified in\nthose proceedings that he found DiPaola on the floor inside the house “pretty upset.” While\nquestioning the portion of DiPaola’s testimony describing how she fell, the trial justice did\nbelieve her when she testified that the police came quickly, which the trial justice found to be\nconsistent with the testimony of Officer Auclair. The trial justice again referred to a transcript\nfrom housing court proceedings, where Barros testified that the incident occurred inside while he\nwas outside.', '-6-', 'Based on her disbelief of the sequence of events as relayed at trial, the trial justice\nconcluded that she would have found that the state had failed to prove its case beyond a\nreasonable doubt. However, given the standard for a motion for a new trial, the trial justice\nproceeded to decide whether reasonable minds could have differed. The trial justice ultimately\nfound that there was sufficient evidence, even after discrediting DiPaola’s testimony that\ndefendant committed an assault.3 In making her determination, the trial justice relied on the\ntestimony of Officer Auclair and Barros, both of whom she found credible. Officer Auclair\nrecalled arriving on the scene soon after the incident and found DiPaola “shaking and crying”\nwhile she relayed that she had been pushed down the stairs and her arm was sore. Barros stated\nthat he saw DiPaola on the floor, telling him to call the police because Withers had pushed her\ndown the stairs.', 'After a close review of the record, we cannot conclude that the trial justice clearly erred\nor “overlook[ed] * * * material inconsistencies.” State v. Ferreira, 21 A.3d 355, 366 (R.I. 2011).\nEven discounting DiPaola’s testimony at trial, two other witnesses testified that they encountered\nDiPaola after the incident, visibly upset, and she told them Withers had pushed her—declarations\na reasonable jury could have found to have been credible based on the circumstantial evidence\npresented at trial. Here, the trial justice found that the circumstantial evidence surrounding\nDiPaola’s fall down the stairs was sufficient to overcome the confusing portion of her testimony\nregarding the incident.

Whitaker, 79 A.3d 795, 804 (R.I. 2013) (upholding denial of\n3', 'A “simple assault [is] an ‘unlawful attempt or offer, with force or violence, to do a corporal\nhurt to another, whether from malice or wantonness.’” State v.

Kennedy, 586 A.2d 1089, 1091 (R.I. 1991) (quoting Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 807\n(1975)). However, a defendant may proceed pro se if he or she wishes only so long as the\nwaiver of his or her right to counsel is valid. Cruz, 109 A.3d at 390. A defendant’s waiver must\nbe made “voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently.”', 'Id.', 'First, the Court must determine\nwhether the waiver was voluntary, and then the Court should proceed to decide whether it was\n“knowing and intelligent.” Id. (quoting State v. Laurence, 848 A.2d 238, 253 (R.I. 2004)).\nWhere a defendant is competent, we have articulated six factors that the trial justice may use as a', '-8-\nguide in reviewing a defendant’s request under a totality of the circumstances approach. 4 Id. at\n391. The factors are as follows:', '“(1) the background, the experience, and the conduct of the', 'defendant at the hearing, including his age, his education, and his', 'physical and mental health; (2) the extent to which the defendant', 'has had prior contact with lawyers before the hearing; (3) the', 'defendant’s knowledge of the nature of the proceeding and the', 'sentence that may potentially be [ ]imposed; (4) the question of', 'whether standby counsel has been appointed and the extent to', 'which he or she has aided the defendant before or at the hearing;', '(5) the question of whether the waiver of counsel was the result of', 'mistreatment or coercion; and (6) the question of whether the', 'defendant is trying to manipulate the events of the hearing.” State', 'v. Chabot, 682 A.2d 1377, 1380 (R.I. 1996).', 'The defense contends that the trial justice failed to determine whether Withers was\nknowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waiving her right to counsel. We disagree. The trial\njustice explicitly referenced Cruz, 109 A.3d at 390, and cited the “voluntarily, knowingly, and\nintelligently” test. She expressed the test as follows: “When confronted with a purported waiver\nof counsel, the [c]ourt applies a two-prong analysis to determine the validity of the waiver. The\n[c]ourt first determines whether it was voluntary, and then whether it was knowing and\nintelligent. It must be all three. I have to examine the totality of the circumstances.” Then, “[a]\nvalid waiver of counsel is effective only if a defendant knows what he or she is doing, and his or\nher choice is made with eyes open. A criminal defendant certainly should be made aware of the\ndangers and disadvantages of self-representation.”\n4', 'If there is a question of a defendant’s mental competency, a trial justice must consider the six\nfactors in deciding whether a defendant’s waiver of his or her right to counsel is knowing,\nvoluntary, and intelligent. See Cruz, 109 A.3d at 391. However, the trial justice need not\nexplicitly apply these six factors when the mental competency of a defendant is not at issue. Id.\nat 392. Here, neither party addresses Withers’ competency in their briefs, and the trial justice did\nnot indicate any concern on the record regarding Withers’ competency when she denied the\ndefendant’s request to proceed pro se; and so we assume defendant was competent and review\nthe trial justice’s decision accordingly.', '-9-', 'In this case, the trial had already commenced when defendant expressed dissatisfaction\nwith her lawyers. In fact, DiPaola had already testified, and her cross-examination had been\ncompleted by defense counsel. As the defense noted, the trial justice did refer to the timing of\ndefendant’s request in relation to the trial proceedings, noting also that defendant had been\nabsent for one-and-one-half days of the trial after the jury was sworn. Although defendant\nvoiced a number of excuses for her absence, the trial justice determined that her failure to show\nup to court was voluntary.', 'Additionally, defendant stated her desire to avoid the trial entirely:', '“And I still say my lawyers, they don’t—they don’t, um—they', 'don’t impress me. And I’m fine. Again, you wanted to do it. I’m', 'going prepared to drop them, drop this whole court crap, because,', 'okay, it’s on the phone where I was. It’s going to go to Supreme', 'Court on you, like I said before. I want to go back to my cell.', '“* * *', '“I don’t want to be here anymore. I spoke.', '“* * *', '“Leave me alone. I don’t care. I don’t care. Whatever. I don’t', 'care. I’m going to Supreme. I don’t care. I don’t care. You’re', 'fired. Leave me alone. Can I go back to my cell now?”', 'The trial justice also asked defendant to specify her issues with her counsel.', 'The\ndefendant expressed concern with defense counsel’s jury selection because there were no\nAfrican-American jurors. The trial justice attempted to explain to defendant that there had been\nno African Americans stricken from the jury because there were simply no African Americans\nselected—something beyond defense counsel’s control.', 'The trial justice concluded that she did not believe defendant had “made the requisite\nintelligent and knowing decision to discharge counsel at this stage to meet the standard,” and she\ngave the defense attorneys an opportunity to address the matter. Defense counsel represented', '- 10 -\nthat they were prepared to continue defending Withers notwithstanding her request for them to\nwithdraw. Subsequently, the trial justice denied Withers’ request to discharge her attorneys.', 'We agree with the trial justice. The defendant’s contentions regarding her counsel\nelucidated her lack of understanding of the jury selection process, which is evidence that\ndefendant was not knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waiving her right to counsel. Put\ndifferently, defendant raised a complaint about her counsel that, had she represented herself, she\ncould not have done better.', 'But see State v. Spencer, 783 A.2d 413, 417-18 (R.I. 2001)\n(upholding a grant of a defendant’s request to proceed pro se where the defendant explained that\nthere were issues he wished to address with the witnesses that were important to his defense).', 'Furthermore, defendant had not been present for the testimony of key witnesses,\nincluding that of DiPaola. As such, her choice to represent herself pro se after a significant\nabsence could certainly not be said to be knowing or intelligent where such nonattendance put\nher at a substantial disadvantage in completing the trial. See Cruz, 109 A.3d at 390 (“A valid\nwaiver is effective only if a ‘defendant knows what he [or she] is doing and his [or her] choice is\nmade with eyes open.’” (quoting Faretta, 422 U.S. at 835)). It is inconceivable to us that\ndefendant would knowingly put herself at such a disadvantage. Moreover, although the timing\nof defendant’s midtrial request was not dispositive to the trial justice’s analysis, as the defense\nsuggests, it certainly indicates that defendant’s waiver was not knowing or intelligent. See\nSpencer, 783 A.2d at 417 (acknowledging that the totality of the circumstances analysis used in\ndetermining whether a waiver is knowing, voluntary, and intelligent must be conducted “in light\nof the particular stage of the proceedings at the time the waiver is proposed”). Likewise,\ndefendant’s stated wish to abandon the trial altogether and “go back to [her] cell” demonstrates a', '- 11 -\nlack of understanding that firing her attorneys would still result in defendant’s required\nappearance in court for the remainder of the trial.', 'Although we have expressed a preference for trial justices to have more than a brief\ndiscussion with a defendant before deciding whether a waiver of right to counsel is effective, the\ndefendant’s failure to attend the initial portion of the trial indicates that the defendant was not\nmaking a knowing and intelligent waiver of her constitutional rights. See Cruz, 109 A.3d at 393\n(“[A]lthough an explicit Chabot discussion would have been preferable, the absence of such a\ncolloquy does not infect [a] defendant’s waiver of counsel with any constitutional defect.”). In\nview of that, we find that the trial justice engaged in an appropriate inquiry with the defendant in\norder to establish whether her requested waiver of her right to counsel was voluntary, knowing,\nand intelligent.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

36,"State v. Jose Gonzalez. ORDER The defendant, Jose Gonzalez, appeals from a Superior Court order denying his motion to
reduce sentence. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument pursuant to an
order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be
summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and after
reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be
decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this order, we affirm
the order of the Superior Court. On July 1, 2010, after a jury trial, defendant was convicted of one count of first-degree
child molestation and two counts of second-degree child molestation. 1 The defendant was
sentenced to forty years, with twenty-two years to serve on the first count and five years to serve
on the remaining counts; the sentences were to run concurrently. The defendant appealed the
judgment of conviction; and, in December 2012, this Court affirmed the judgment. State v.
1 The facts of this case were detailed in our opinion affirming defendant’s conviction. State v.
Gonzalez, 56 A.3d 96 (R.I. 2012). It is not necessary for us to repeat them here. - 1-
Gonzalez, 56 A.3d 96, 104 (R.I. 2012). The defendant then filed a motion to reduce sentence
pursuant to Rule 35 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. 2 On January 16, 2013, at a hearing before the same justice who had presided over his
criminal trial, defendant argued that his sentence should be reduced because he had shown
“exemplary behavior” while incarcerated at the Adult Correctional Institutions and because the
sentence imposed was “not justif[ied]” and “far too heavy in this situation.” The trial justice
reviewed the factors she considered when she imposed the sentence and determined that the
original sentence was appropriate. Finding no change in circumstances that would entitle
defendant to leniency, she denied the motion. The defendant filed a timely appeal. “This Court adheres to a ‘strong policy against interfering with a trial justice’s discretion
in sentencing matters.’” State v. Barkmeyer, 32 A.3d 950, 952 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v.
Chase, 9 A.3d 1248, 1254 (R.I. 2010)). “As a result, ‘[o]ur review of a trial justice’s decision on
a Rule 35 motion is extremely limited.’” Id. (quoting Chase, 9 A.3d at 1254). “We will disturb a
trial justice’s ruling on a motion to reduce ‘only when the sentence is without justification.’” Id.
(quoting Chase, 9 A.3d at 1254). “Further, ‘[w]e have emphasized that the inherent power to
review sentences should be utilized only in the exceptional case * * * when the sentence is
without justification and grossly disparate from sentences generally imposed for similar
offenses.” Id. at 953 (quoting State v. Dyer, 14 A.3d 227, 227 (R.I. 2011) (mem.)). “It is the
defendant’s burden to show that the sentence imposed violates this standard.” Id. (quoting Chase,
9 A.3d at 1254).
2 Rule 35(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that a court “may
reduce any sentence when a motion is filed within one hundred and twenty (120) days after the
sentence is imposed, or * * * after receipt by the court of a mandate of the Supreme
Court * * * .” - 2- On appeal, defendant argues that “there is nothing to be gained” by keeping him
incarcerated for twenty-two years because, in light of his age, this “is essentially a life sentence
for him.” 3 Further, while defendant acknowledges that he has a criminal record, he notes that his
last conviction was in 1999 and none of his prior convictions involved child molestation. He
also contends that his sentence exceeds both the applicable sentencing benchmark and the state’s
pretrial offer. Finally, he argues that, because he has always been gainfully employed and has no
substance-abuse or mental-health issues and has exhibited exemplary behavior while imprisoned,
the sentence is excessive and unwarranted. The trial justice reviewed the factors she considered when she originally imposed the
sentence, specifically: “the severity of the offense, the defendant’s personal, educational, and
employment background, his criminal record, his potential for rehabilitation, social deterrence,
and the appropriateness of the punishment.” The trial justice noted that she did not impose the
maximum sentence allowed, and, considering “the seriousness of the offense, [and] the
defendant’s criminal record,” the sentence was appropriate. The trial justice also concluded that
defendant had presented no evidence that would indicate any change in circumstances. We see no reason to question the trial justice’s well-reasoned decision. We have
previously held that a defendant’s age is not a determinative factor in a motion to reduce
sentence. See State v. Lynch, 58 A.3d 146, 149 (R.I. 2013). This defendant’s criminal history
may not have involved child molestation, but it was nonetheless serious, dating from the early
1970s through the late 1980s and including a twelve-year sentence for attempted murder
imposed in 1989. It was certainly reasonable for the trial justice to find that the defendant’s
record “does not indicate * * * a great deal of potential for rehabilitation.” Further, the fact that
the defendant has maintained good behavior while incarcerated is to be expected. As we stated
3 The defendant’s date of birth is December 22, 1949. - 3-
in State v. Guzman, 794 A.2d 474, 476 (R.I. 2002), “demeanor and conduct in prison since the
crime are of no moment to [such an] appeal.” Neither are we concerned that the sentence
exceeded the applicable benchmark because sentencing benchmarks serve only as “a guide to
proportionality” and are not mandatory. State v. Snell, 11A.3d 97, 102 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State
v. Coleman, 984 A.2d 650, 655 (R.I. 2009)). In imposing sentence, the court “is bound only by
the statutory parameters established by the Legislature.” Barkmeyer, 32 A.3d at 953
(quoting State v. Thornton, 800 A.2d 1016, 1044 (R.I. 2002)). The trial justice gave due
consideration to all the factors and chose not to impose the maximum sentence permitted under
the statute. 4 We have no cause to disturb her denial of the defendant’s motion. For the reasons stated in this order, we affirm the order of the Superior Court denying the
defendant’s motion to reduce sentence. The record in this case may be remanded to the Superior
Court. Entered as an Order of this Court on this 24th day of February, 2014. By Order, _____________/s/___________________ Clerk
4 General Laws 1956 § 11-37-8.2 provides: “Every person who shall commit first degree child

Guzman, 794 A.2d 474, 476 (R.I. 2002), “demeanor and conduct in prison since the\ncrime are of no moment to [such an] appeal.” Neither are we concerned that the sentence\nexceeded the applicable benchmark because sentencing benchmarks serve only as “a guide to\nproportionality” and are not mandatory. State v. Snell, 11A.3d 97, 102 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State\nv. Coleman, 984 A.2d 650, 655 (R.I. 2009)).

The trial justice gave due\nconsideration to all the factors and chose not to impose the maximum sentence permitted under\nthe statute. 4 We have no cause to disturb her denial of the defendant’s motion.', 'For the reasons stated in this order, we affirm the order of the Superior Court denying the\ndefendant’s motion to reduce sentence.

37,"Raymond Lynch : v. : State of Rhode Island. : ORDER The applicant, Raymond Lynch, appeals pro se from the Superior Court’s dismissal of his
second application for postconviction relief. In 1998, the applicant was convicted on three
counts of first-degree sexual assault and two counts of second-degree sexual assault in violation
of G.L. 1956 §§ 11-37-2 and 11-37-4. He was sentenced to a total of sixty years imprisonment,
with thirty years to serve on each first-degree count and ten years to serve on each second-degree
count, all to run concurrently. This Court affirmed those convictions in 2004. See State v.
Lynch, 854 A.2d 1022 (R.I. 2004). Subsequently, in 2011, we affirmed the Superior Court’s
denial of the applicant’s first application for postconviction relief. See Lynch v. State, 13 A.3d
603 (R.I. 2011). On November 15, 2011, applicant filed a second application for postconviction relief,
which is the subject of the instant appeal. In that application, he contended that: (1) the Superior
Court justice who presided over his trial erred in admitting certain evidence in violation of Rule
803(4) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence; (2) his trial counsel was ineffective; (3) his right
to an impartial jury was violated; (4) his sentence was disproportionately high in comparison to -1-
the sentences meted out in similar cases; 1 (5) his right to a fair trial was violated because the
friendly nature of the complaining witness’s interactions with him at trial outside the presence of
the jury was not brought to the jury’s attention; (6) there was prosecutorial misconduct; and (7)
his right to a fair trial was violated by the jury’s consideration of perjured testimony. The
applicant’s court-appointed attorney moved to withdraw from the case and filed a memorandum,
pursuant to Shatney v. State, 755 A.2d 130 (R.I. 2000), in support of that motion. On May 11,
2012, the Superior Court granted the attorney’s motion to withdraw and permitted applicant to
proceed pro se. In due course, on August 30, 2012, the hearing justice rendered a bench decision granting
the state’s motion to dismiss applicant’s second application for postconviction relief. She found
that all of the issues raised by applicant were “barred in their entirety” pursuant to G.L. 1956
§ 10-9.1-8, which mandates that “[a]ll grounds for relief available to an applicant * * * must be
raised in his or her [direct appeal or] original * * * application [for postconviction relief] * * *
unless the court finds that in the interest of justice the applicant should be permitted to assert
such a ground for relief;” and she also found, with respect to “the interest of justice” proviso in
the statute, that there was no “further issue that has not been fully vetted at this point in time.” The applicant filed a timely appeal to this Court. He contends that the hearing justice
erred in summarily dismissing his second application for postconviction relief. The statutory remedy of postconviction relief set forth in § 10–9.1–1 is “available to any
person who has been convicted of a crime and who thereafter alleges either that the conviction
violated the applicant's constitutional rights or that the existence of newly discovered material
1 The applicant should have challenged the length of his sentence in a motion made
pursuant to Rule 35(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. That issue is not
properly before this Court in the existing procedural context. -2-
facts requires vacation of the conviction in the interests of justice.” Perez v. State, 57 A.3d 677,
679 (R.I. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). The applicant’s ability to further pursue postconviction relief is limited to the extent that
his application, like those of other applicants, is subject to the doctrine of res judicata. “Section
10–9.1–8, which codifies * * * the doctrine of res judicata within the postconviction-relief
context, bars relitigation of the same issues between the same parties after a final judgment has
entered in a prior proceeding.” State v. Thornton, 68 A.3d 533, 541 (R.I. 2013) (internal
quotation marks omitted); see also Anderson v. State, 45 A.3d 594, 602 (R.I. 2012). This Court
has repeatedly stated that the doctrine of res judicata “provides a procedural bar not only to
issues that have been raised and decided in a previous postconviction-relief proceeding, but also
to the relitigation of any issue that could have been litigated in a prior proceeding, even if the
particular issue was not raised.” Ferrell v. Wall, 971 A.2d 615, 620 (R.I. 2009) (emphasis in
original) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Price v. Wall, 31 A.3d 995, 999 (R.I. 2011). In our judgment, the Superior Court correctly found that applicant’s second application
for postconviction relief was barred by § 10-9.1-8. See Perez, 57 A.3d at 682; Mattatall v. State,
947 A.2d 896, 905 (R.I. 2008). After carefully reviewing the record, this Court is more than
convinced that all of applicant’s claims in his second application are matters that have been
raised or that could have been raised on direct appeal or in his first application for postconviction
relief. The applicant does not present any persuasive explanation as to why the contentions
raised in his second application could not have been previously presented. See Brown v. State,
32 A.3d 901, 910 (R.I. 2011). We have recognized a “very limited and narrow exception” to the res judicata bar in the
postconviction relief context, pursuant to which “issues which were finally adjudicated or not -3-
[previously] raised may nonetheless be the basis for a subsequent application for postconviction
relief if the court finds it to be in the interest of justice.” Mattatall, 947 A.2d at 905
(applying § 10-9.1-8) (internal quotation marks omitted). With respect to the case before us,
however, we are of the same mind as was the hearing justice in perceiving no reason to invoke
that “very limited and narrow exception” so as to permit the applicant to further pursue the
claims contained in the second application for postconviction relief. Id. Accordingly, the
applicant’s claims in his second application for postconviction relief are barred by res judicata,
and we have no hesitation in holding that the hearing justice did not err in denying the
applicant’s second application. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. Entered as an Order of this Court this 28th day of February, 2014 . By Order, _____________/s/_______________ Clerk -4- RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet

The defendant, Paul Fleck, appeals to this Court from a\njudgment of conviction of one count of simple domestic assault against Kim Dolbec in violation\nof G.L. 1956 § 11-5-3 and G.L. 1956 § 12-29-5. Under the provisions of § 12-29-5(c)(1), the\ndefendant was deemed to be a felon because he had been convicted at least twice previously of\ndomestic-violence offenses. As a result, the trial justice sentenced Fleck to ten years at the Adult\nCorrectional Institutions (ACI), with three and one-half years to serve, and six and one-half years\nsuspended, with probation. Before this Court, the defendant advances two arguments. First, he\nargues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal pursuant to Rule\n29 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. Second, he presses that the trial justice\nerred in denying his motion for a new trial under Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of\nCriminal Procedure. Specifically, and relevant to both arguments, the defendant maintains that\nthe evidence presented at trial did not establish that Fleck and Dolbec were in a domestic', '-1-\nrelationship, as is required under § 12-29-2. After a careful review of the defendant’s arguments,\nand for the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'This case arises from an incident that occurred during the course of an argument between\ndefendant, Paul Fleck, and the complaining witness, Kim Dolbec, on September 13, 2009.\nAlthough the two were long acquainted, having first met in school nearly thirty years earlier,\nthey had begun to date only some months before, after they were reintroduced by Dolbec’s\nneighbor, Heidi Leonard. At that time, both were living in East Providence. 1 Dolbec testified\nthat soon after the pair began a relationship, she asked Fleck to move in with her, and that he did\nso, even though he continued to maintain his own apartment.', 'Dolbec testified that after she made dinner for defendant on September 13, defendant\ngrabbed her by the arm and struck her in the face with a closed fist. Although by all indications\nthis was the first incident of physical violence between the two, the substance of the argument\nwas familiar to this couple because it arose when defendant accused Dolbec of cheating on him.\nAs she did whenever defendant made such accusations, Dolbec denied them because, as she\ntestified, she told him, “[w]hen I’m with somebody, I’m not a slut. Excuse my language.”\nDolbec did not report the assault at that time; she testified that she did not do so because she was\nafraid that Fleck would kill her if she did. However, two nights later, on September 15,\ndefendant made similar accusations, and this time the accusations were coupled with poking\n1', 'The precise length of time that defendant and Dolbec dated is unclear because Dolbec testified\nthat she had suffered a brain injury that caused her to forget certain details of her life and of her\nrelationship with defendant. There were indications that Dolbec suffered that injury as a result of\nher being a victim of a separate domestic-violence incident that did not involve defendant.\nDolbec testified that she and defendant had been dating for a few months, but she previously had\ntold a responding police officer that the two had dated for a period of five months.', '-2-\nDolbec in the chest. After this second incident, Dolbec left the apartment and went to Leonard’s\nresidence because she could not “take [defendant] hitting [her] anymore.” After listening to\nDolbec’s story, Leonard notified the police, who arrived after “just a few minutes.”', 'East Providence Police Officers Ryan Vose and Genevieve Rock responded to a call for a\n“delayed domestic assault,” and they took a statement from Dolbec. Officer Vose testified that\nhe had observed that Dolbec was visibly shaken and that she had “a black eye that appeared to be\ncoming down” as well as some bruising on her right arm. At the police station, the officers\nphotographed Dolbec’s injuries; the photos eventually were entered into evidence. Dolbec\nrelated to Officer Vose that defendant had been her boyfriend for five months and that she had\nbeen living with him. Officer Vose noted on the Domestic Violence Sexual Assault Reporting\n(DVSA) form that Fleck was Dolbec’s “intimate partner.” Officer Rock also spoke with Dolbec\nat the Leonard residence, noting the bruises and that she appeared to be very nervous out of fear\nof Mr. Fleck. Officer Rock indicated that Dolbec’s bruises were consistent with her story of the\nphysical abuse that she claimed had occurred two days earlier.', 'The East Providence Police apprehended Fleck on the evening of September 15 without\nincident, after spotting him on a park bench near Riverside Square in East Providence. Fleck\nwas charged with one count of simple domestic assault on November 6, 2009. The defendant\nwas tried before a jury on March 7-9, 2011.', 'At the conclusion of the prosecution’s case, defendant moved for judgment of acquittal\npursuant to Rule 29. The defendant argued that the state had introduced insufficient evidence\nthat Fleck and Dolbec had been in a domestic relationship, as that term is defined in § 12-29-2.\nAfter reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state and drawing all reasonable\ninferences in favor of the state as she was required to do, the trial justice concluded that there had', '-3-\nbeen a domestic relationship, and she denied the motion. The defendant then proceeded to\npresent his defense. On March 9, 2011, the jury found defendant guilty of one count of simple\ndomestic assault.', 'The defendant then filed a motion for new trial pursuant to Rule 33, which the trial\njustice heard and decided on March 25, 2011. The defendant argued that there was insufficient\nevidence to support a finding of guilt because, under § 12-29-2(b), Fleck and Dolbec did not\nmeet the definition of a domestic relationship. Sitting as the thirteenth juror, the trial justice\nconducted the three analyses as outlined in State v. Banach, 648 A.2d 1363, 1366-67 (R.I. 1994).\nThe trial justice considered all of the evidence presented by the state and defendant. She found\nDolbec credible, remarking that, when Dolbec did not remember something, she did not “pretend\nshe knew it” and noted that her testimony had been corroborated by the responding officers and\nher neighbor, Heidi Leonard. The trial justice reviewed the evidence, noting that it supported a\nfinding that Fleck and Dolbec were in a domestic relationship. She further found that Fleck had\nlived with Dolbec, and she noted that Dolbec had referred to defendant as her boyfriend. The\ntrial justice, after assessing the evidence of the relationship between the two, found that they\nindeed had been in a substantive dating relationship, noting that the length of that relationship\nhad not been clearly established.', 'Finally, the trial justice described the frequency of the\nrelationship noting that the parties had lived together and that defendant visited with Dolbec\nevery evening after his workday ended. The trial justice said that she agreed with the jury’s\nverdict and, as a result, denied the motion. On June 10, 2011, the trial justice sentenced\ndefendant to ten years at the ACI, three and one-half years to serve and the remainder to be\nsuspended, with probation.', '-4-', 'Before this Court, defendant argues that the trial justice erred when she denied both the\nRule 29 and Rule 33 motions. Both arguments are premised on the same grounds: that the state\nfailed to prove that Fleck and Dolbec were in a domestic relationship as that term is defined in\n§ 12-29-2 of the Domestic Violence Prevention Act.', 'Standard of Review', ""It is well settled that a defendant has a higher hurdle to overcome when arguing a Rule 29\nmotion for judgment of acquittal than when he seeks to prevail on a Rule 33 motion for new trial\nbecause when he renews an acquittal motion, the trial justice “must view the evidence in the light\nmost favorable to the state, * * * giving full credibility to the state's witnesses, and draw[ing]\ntherefrom all reasonable inferences consistent with guilt.” State v. Cardin, 987 A.2d 248, 250\n(R.I. 2010) (quoting State v. Caba, 887 A.2d 370, 372 (R.I. 2005)). In the case of a motion for\nnew trial, however, the trial justice does not favor the state’s evidence, but “use[s] independent\njudgment to weigh the evidence and assess the credibility of the witnesses.” State v. Pineda, 13\nA.3d 623, 640 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Dame, 560 A.2d 330, 334 (R.I. 1989)). When faced,\nas here, with both Rule 29 and Rule 33 motions, “this Court first conducts a review of the new-\ntrial motion.” See State v. Gaffney, 63 A.3d 888, 893 (R.I. 2013) (citing State v. Cardona, 969\nA.2d 667, 672 (R.I. 2009)). “[U]nless a defendant can show that the presented evidence failed to\nsupport his or her conviction upon the motion-for-a-new-trial standard, a defendant necessarily\nwill be unable to establish he or she was entitled to a judgment of acquittal.” Pineda, 13 A.3d at\n640 (citing State v. Hesford, 900 A.2d 1194, 1200 (R.I. 2006))."", 'At this juncture, it is important for us to note that a motion for new trial may be argued on\ntwo bases. A defendant may claim that the weight of the evidence was not adequate to convict\nhim, or, in the alternative, he may argue that the evidence was legally insufficient to support a', '-5-\nconviction. State v. Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 569 (R.I. 2009). Here, even though defendant casts his\nappeal as a challenge to the “sufficiency” of the evidence, his arguments and presentation of the\nlaw, both to the trial justice and to this Court, ask that his appeal be viewed through the prism of\nthe more traditional, weight-of-the-evidence standard.', 'We previously have articulated the\ndiffering standards of review for sufficiency of the evidence versus weight of the evidence when\na defendant appeals a trial justice’s denial of a motion for new trial. See State v. Karngar, 29\nA.3d 1232, 1235-36 (R.I. 2011); see also Clark, 974 A.2d at 569.', 'As set forth above, when a defendant argues that the evidence was legally insufficient to\nserve as the basis for conviction, the trial justice does not weigh the evidence or the credibility of\nthe witnesses, examining it instead in the light most favorable to the prosecution. See Karngar,\n29 A.3d at 1235. To deny the motion, the trial justice need only decide that any rational trier of\nfact “could have found that the prosecution established the elements of the crime beyond a\nreasonable doubt.” Id.', 'On the other hand, a motion for a new trial based on the weight of the evidence requires\nthat “the trial justice act[] as a thirteenth juror, exercising ‘independent judgment on the\ncredibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.’” State v. Heredia, 10 A.3d 443, 446\n(R.I. 2010) (quoting State v. Imbruglia, 913 A.2d 1022, 1028 (R.I. 2007)). “Specifically, ‘the\ntrial justice must (1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess\nthe credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he\nor she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.’” Id. (quoting State v.\nTexieira, 944 A.2d 132, 140 (R.I. 2008)). We will not disturb the decision of a trial justice\nprovided she “has complied with this procedure and articulated adequate reasons for denying the\nmotion * * * unless the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence or otherwise', '-6-\nwas clearly wrong.” State v. Phannavong, 21 A.3d 321, 325 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v.\nPeoples, 996 A.2d 660, 664 (R.I. 2010)).', 'Because defendant urged that the trial justice, both in the hearing on the motion for a new\ntrial and in his brief before this Court, act as the “thirteenth juror,” we will therefore consider\ndefendant’s appeal as a challenge to the weight of the evidence, and not as to its legal\nsufficiency. See Karngar, 29 A.3d at 1235.', 'Discussion', 'Motion for New Trial', 'The defendant contends that the trial justice erred when she denied the motion for new\ntrial because the evidence that the state presented did not establish beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat defendant and Dolbec were in a domestic relationship as defined within the “[f]amily or\nhousehold member” definition in § 12-29-2. That section informs § 12-29-5 which states in\nparagraph (c)(1):', '“Every person convicted of an offense punishable as a', 'misdemeanor involving domestic violence as defined in § 12-29-2', 'shall:', '“* * *', '“(ii) For a third and subsequent violation be deemed guilty', 'of a felony and be imprisoned for a term of not less than one year', 'and not more than ten (10) years.”\nThe trial justice’s finding that the parties were in fact in a domestic relationship bore particular\nimportance because of defendant’s rather impressive record of earlier domestic violence\nconvictions. The defendant’s criminal record reveals a disturbing pattern of domestic abuse.\nFrom 1992 until 1996, defendant had four different domestic-misdemeanor convictions. And\nfrom 1997 until 2001, he was convicted of three felony domestic-assault charges. Because of his', '-7-\nprior domestic-violence convictions, if the parties’ relationship was deemed to be domestic in\nnature, defendant would be subject to the enhanced sentencing sanctions of the statute.', 'Relevant to our discussion here, § 12-29-2(b) defines a “Family or household member” as\n“persons who are or have been in a substantive dating or engagement relationship within the past\none year which shall be determined by the court’s consideration of the following factors:', '“(1) the length of time of the relationship;', '“(2) the type of the relationship;', '“(3) the frequence [sic] of the interaction between the parties.” 2', 'When the trial justice considered the motion, she analyzed each of the factors outlined in\nthe statute. The evidence supported that the type of relationship was intimate in that Dolbec\nreferred to Fleck as her boyfriend and that they lived together. Dolbec also testified that the\nrelationship was exclusive and that defendant often accused her of being unfaithful. The trial\njustice noted that there was some inconsistency with the testimony regarding the length of the\nrelationship. Dolbec testified that she was unable to remember how long she and Fleck had lived\ntogether, but that they had been together “for a few months,” and initially Dolbec told the\nresponding officer that they had dated for five months, prompting Officer Vose to refer to Fleck\nas an “intimate partner” on the DVSA form. With regard to the frequency of contact, the trial\njustice considered that the couple lived together, that Dolbec cooked dinner for defendant every\n2', 'Significantly, the definition of family or household member under G.L. 1956 § 12-29-2 also\nincludes “adult persons who are presently residing together or who have resided together in the\npast three (3) years.” The testimony at trial indicated that, although Fleck maintained his own\napartment, there was testimony that he was living with Dolbec at the time of the incident in\nquestion. Therefore, the parties may well have qualified as household members under the statute\nwithout need for the analysis of the domestic-relationship aspect of the definition. However, the\ntrial justice confined her analysis to the nature of the relationship between defendant and Dolbec.\nThus, we will review the appeal based on the analysis and reasoning of the trial justice.', '-8-\nnight, and that the two always had dinner together. After reviewing the statutory factors, the trial\njustice found that defendant and Dolbec were in a domestic relationship. 3', 'Because the characterization of defendant and Dolbec as being in a domestic relationship\nwas proper, we must next determine if the trial justice appropriately denied the motion for new\ntrial. We hold that that denial was appropriate. After an exacting review of the record, it is clear\nto us that the trial justice conducted a thorough and complete analysis of defendant’s motion for\nnew trial. Although defendant attempts on appeal to challenge the credibility of the complaining\nwitness due to her cognitive deficiencies, the trial justice came to a different conclusion.', '“This Court is loath to overturn the credibility findings of a trial justice because ‘it is the\ntrial justice who has the opportunity to observe the witnesses as they testify and therefore is in a\nbetter position to weigh the evidence and to pass upon the credibility of the witnesses than is this\n[C]ourt.’” State v. Richardson, 47 A.3d 305, 318 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Penhallow v. Penhallow,\n725 A.2d 896, 897 (R.I. 1998) (mem.)). In our opinion, the trial justice followed the proper\nprocedure when considering the motion for new trial and did not overlook or misconceive\nmaterial evidence. See Phannavong, 21 A.3d at 325. The trial justice’s denial of the motion for\nnew trial was not clearly wrong, and we see no basis for disturbing her decision.', 'Motion for Judgment of Acquittal', 'The defendant moved for judgment of acquittal at the close of the prosecution’s case, but\ndid not renew that motion after presenting his defense. This Court has held that we will consider\nan appeal for a denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal only if the matter has been properly\npreserved. State v. Price, 68 A.3d 440, 444 (R.I. 2013) (citing State v. Tower, 984 A.2d 40, 45\n3', 'On appeal, defendant asks this Court to reconsider our holding in State v. Enos, 21 A.3d 326\n(R.I. 2011), a recent opinion that prompted two dissents. We decline to do so. In our opinion,\nthis case bears little resemblance to Enos.', '-9-\n(R.I. 2009)). “We consistently have held that the failure to renew a motion for judgment of\nacquittal at the close of evidence forecloses the defendant’s right to appeal the denial.” Tower,\n984 A.2d at 45. Therefore, the defendant’s Rule 29 motion has been waived. However, even if\nthe motion had been preserved, it would have provided no relief to the defendant because we\nhave affirmed the Superior Court with respect to the Rule 33 motion for new trial. In any event,\nwe would not consider his Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal because any such review is\nunnecessary. See Pineda, 13 A.3d at 640; see also Cardona, 969 A.2d at 672 (noting that when\nthis Court simultaneously faces a defendant’s challenge to the trial court’s rulings on motions for\nnew trial and judgment of acquittal, we first conduct “the more exacting analysis required for\nreview of a ruling on a motion for a new trial”).', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of conviction in this\ncase.

39,"State : v. : Francisco Pacheco. : ORDER This appeal stems from a jury trial in Providence County Superior Court. Francisco
Pacheco, the defendant, appeals from the denial of his motion to dismiss one of the charges
against him—namely, a charge of refusal to submit to a chemical test. Mr. Pacheco’s appeal
from the denial of that motion came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the
parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily
decided. After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties’ arguments
(both written and oral), we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this appeal may
be decided at this time. On December 28, 2011, during an interaction with officers from the Warren Police
Department, Mr. Pacheco refused a preliminary breathalyzer test at the scene and then later
refused to submit to a chemical test at the police station. On May 10, 2012, Mr. Pacheco was
charged by criminal information with a number of counts, including refusal to submit to a
chemical test after having been previously convicted of a chemical test refusal, in violation of -1-
G.L. 1956 § 31-27-2.1(b)(2). 1 He was arraigned on June 20, 2012, and entered a plea of not
guilty on the charge of refusal to submit to a chemical test. Subsequently, on July 15, 2013, Mr.
Pacheco appeared before the Rhode Island Traffic Tribunal on a summons for refusing to submit
to a preliminary breath test, in violation of § 31-27-2.3. That violation was dismissed after a
brief hearing because the magistrate in the Traffic Tribunal concluded that the police officer who
testified had not provided the required “evidentiary foundation” to sustain the violation. Mr.
Pacheco thereafter moved in Superior Court to dismiss the charge of refusal to submit to a
chemical test which was still pending in that court. He contended then, and he contends again
before this Court, that the state was collaterally estopped from proceeding against him on the
charge of refusal to submit to a chemical test in violation of § 31-27-2.1(b)(2) because, in his
view, that issue had been previously adjudicated and decided in the Traffic Tribunal. On March 5, 2014, the trial justice denied Mr. Pacheco’s motion to dismiss on the
grounds that the principle of collateral estoppel was not applicable in the circumstances of this
case. The trial justice then proceeded to state the following: “Also, pursuant to the procedural
requirements of [Rule] 12(b)(2) [of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure], the Court
is also going to deny the motion on those grounds as to timeliness.” Mr. Pacheco was ultimately
convicted by a Superior Court jury on the charge of refusing to submit to a chemical test in
violation of § 31-27-2.1(b)(2); he was sentenced to five months incarceration, a two-year loss of
his driver’s license, an eight hundred dollar fine, and one hundred hours of community service. Rule 12(b)(2) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure reads, in pertinent part,
as follows:
1 Mr. Pacheco stipulated to the fact that he had previously been convicted of refusal to
submit to a chemical test on June 3, 2008. -2- “The defense of double jeopardy and all other defenses and objections based on defects in the institution of the prosecution or in the indictment, information, or complaint other than that it fails to show jurisdiction in the court or to charge an offense may be raised only by motion before trial. The motion shall include all such defenses and objections then available to the defendant. Failure to present any such defense or objection as herein provided constitutes a waiver thereof, but the court for cause shown may grant relief from the waiver.”
Additionally, Rule 12(b)(3) states the following: “The motion shall be made no later than thirty (30) days after the plea is entered * * * but in any event the Court may permit the motion to be made within a reasonable time after the plea is entered * * *.” Rule 12(b)(2) sets forth the general rule requiring that a motion to dismiss on collateral
estoppel grounds (which would constitute a “defect[] in the institution of the prosecution”) be
filed before trial; it appears that, in the instant case, Mr. Pacheco did in fact file his motion to
dismiss before the impaneling of the jury began—thus, “before trial.” However, it is important
to note that Rule 12(b)(3) proceeds to set forth a more specific requirement—viz. that a motion
referenced in Rule 12(b)(2) must be filed within thirty days of the entry of the defendant’s
plea. 2 See State v. Hightower, 661 A.2d 948, 963 (R.I. 1995) (stating that the temporal
requirements set forth in Rule 12(b)(3) apply to the types of motions referenced in Rule
12(b)(2)). Mr. Pacheco pled not guilty on June 20, 2012, whereas the motion to dismiss was not
filed until March of 2014—a time span of almost two years.
2 The trial justice accurately referenced Rule 12(b)(2) of the Superior Court Rules of
Criminal Procedure in his decision on Mr. Pacheco’s motion to dismiss. He did not mention the
more specific terms of Rule 12(b)(3). We do not believe that the trial justice committed an error
in referring to only Rule 12(b)(2) because Rule 12(b)(2) necessarily should be read in light of the
specific requirement set forth in Rule 12(b)(3). See State v. Hightower, 661 A.2d 948, 963 (R.I.
1995). -3- While we remain cognizant of our Rule 12(b) jurisprudence (see Hightower, 661 A.2d at
963), in view of representations made by Mr. Pacheco’s present attorney at oral argument as to
the possible health-related reason for the delay in the filing of his motion to dismiss and the fact
that the timeliness vel non of the motion was not extensively addressed at the hearing in March
of 2014, we have decided to remand the case to the Superior Court for the purpose of conducting
an evidentiary hearing concerning the Rule 12(b) issue in this case. 3 For the reasons stated herein, we remand the case to the Superior Court for further
proceedings as explained supra. The record may be returned to that tribunal. Entered as an Order of this Court, this 10th day of November, 2015. By Order, /s/ Clerk
3 Consequently, we need not address at this time the collateral estoppel issues which Mr.
Pacheco has raised on appeal. See Grady v. Narragansett Electric Co., 962 A.2d 34, 41-42 n.4

Francisco\nPacheco, the defendant, appeals from the denial of his motion to dismiss one of the charges\nagainst him—namely, a charge of refusal to submit to a chemical test. Mr. Pacheco’s appeal\nfrom the denial of that motion came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the\nparties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily\ndecided. After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties’ arguments\n(both written and oral), we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this appeal may\nbe decided at this time.', 'On December 28, 2011, during an interaction with officers from the Warren Police\nDepartment, Mr. Pacheco refused a preliminary breathalyzer test at the scene and then later\nrefused to submit to a chemical test at the police station. On May 10, 2012, Mr. Pacheco was\ncharged by criminal information with a number of counts, including refusal to submit to a\nchemical test after having been previously convicted of a chemical test refusal, in violation of', '-1-\nG.L. 1956 § 31-27-2.1(b)(2). 1 He was arraigned on June 20, 2012, and entered a plea of not\nguilty on the charge of refusal to submit to a chemical test. Subsequently, on July 15, 2013, Mr.\nPacheco appeared before the Rhode Island Traffic Tribunal on a summons for refusing to submit\nto a preliminary breath test, in violation of § 31-27-2.3. That violation was dismissed after a\nbrief hearing because the magistrate in the Traffic Tribunal concluded that the police officer who\ntestified had not provided the required “evidentiary foundation” to sustain the violation. Mr.\nPacheco thereafter moved in Superior Court to dismiss the charge of refusal to submit to a\nchemical test which was still pending in that court. He contended then, and he contends again\nbefore this Court, that the state was collaterally estopped from proceeding against him on the\ncharge of refusal to submit to a chemical test in violation of § 31-27-2.1(b)(2) because, in his\nview, that issue had been previously adjudicated and decided in the Traffic Tribunal.', 'On March 5, 2014, the trial justice denied Mr. Pacheco’s motion to dismiss on the\ngrounds that the principle of collateral estoppel was not applicable in the circumstances of this\ncase. The trial justice then proceeded to state the following: “Also, pursuant to the procedural\nrequirements of [Rule] 12(b)(2) [of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure], the Court\nis also going to deny the motion on those grounds as to timeliness.” Mr. Pacheco was ultimately\nconvicted by a Superior Court jury on the charge of refusing to submit to a chemical test in\nviolation of § 31-27-2.1(b)(2); he was sentenced to five months incarceration, a two-year loss of\nhis driver’s license, an eight hundred dollar fine, and one hundred hours of community service.', 'Rule 12(b)(2) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure reads, in pertinent part,\nas follows:\n1', 'Mr. Pacheco stipulated to the fact that he had previously been convicted of refusal to\nsubmit to a chemical test on June 3, 2008.', '-2-', '“The defense of double jeopardy and all other defenses and', 'objections based on defects in the institution of the prosecution or', 'in the indictment, information, or complaint other than that it fails', 'to show jurisdiction in the court or to charge an offense may be', 'raised only by motion before trial. The motion shall include all', 'such defenses and objections then available to the defendant.', 'Failure to present any such defense or objection as herein provided', 'constitutes a waiver thereof, but the court for cause shown may', 'grant relief from the waiver.”\nAdditionally, Rule 12(b)(3) states the following:', '“The motion shall be made no later than thirty (30) days after the', 'plea is entered * * * but in any event the Court may permit the', 'motion to be made within a reasonable time after the plea is', 'entered * * *.”', 'Rule 12(b)(2) sets forth the general rule requiring that a motion to dismiss on collateral\nestoppel grounds (which would constitute a “defect[] in the institution of the prosecution”) be\nfiled before trial; it appears that, in the instant case, Mr. Pacheco did in fact file his motion to\ndismiss before the impaneling of the jury began—thus, “before trial.” However, it is important\nto note that Rule 12(b)(3) proceeds to set forth a more specific requirement—viz. that a motion\nreferenced in Rule 12(b)(2) must be filed within thirty days of the entry of the defendant’s\nplea. 2', 'See State v. Hightower, 661 A.2d 948, 963 (R.I. 1995) (stating that the temporal\nrequirements set forth in Rule 12(b)(3) apply to the types of motions referenced in Rule\n12(b)(2)). Mr. Pacheco pled not guilty on June 20, 2012, whereas the motion to dismiss was not\nfiled until March of 2014—a time span of almost two years.\n2', 'The trial justice accurately referenced Rule 12(b)(2) of the Superior Court Rules of\nCriminal Procedure in his decision on Mr. Pacheco’s motion to dismiss. He did not mention the\nmore specific terms of Rule 12(b)(3). We do not believe that the trial justice committed an error\nin referring to only Rule 12(b)(2) because Rule 12(b)(2) necessarily should be read in light of the\nspecific requirement set forth in Rule 12(b)(3). See State v. Hightower, 661 A.2d 948, 963 (R.I.\n1995).', '-3-', 'While we remain cognizant of our Rule 12(b) jurisprudence (see Hightower, 661 A.2d at\n963), in view of representations made by Mr. Pacheco’s present attorney at oral argument as to\nthe possible health-related reason for the delay in the filing of his motion to dismiss and the fact\nthat the timeliness vel non of the motion was not extensively addressed at the hearing in March\nof 2014, we have decided to remand the case to the Superior Court for the purpose of conducting\nan evidentiary hearing concerning the Rule 12(b) issue in this case. 3', 'For the reasons stated herein, we remand the case to the Superior Court for further\nproceedings as explained supra.

40,"State : v. : Michael Rocchio. : ORDER The defendant, Michael Rocchio, appeals from a Superior Court order denying his
motion to withdraw his plea of nolo contendere to one count of breaking and entering. On June 2, 2010, the defendant was charged with two counts of unlawful breaking and
entering in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-8-2 and two counts of conspiracy to break and enter in
violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-1-6. On May 14, 2012, the defendant entered a plea of nolo
contendere to one of the breaking and entering counts in exchange for dismissal of the three
remaining counts. In addition, the Superior Court agreed to impose a ten-year sentence, the
defendant having to serve the first six months 1 and the remaining nine years, six months
suspended, during which the defendant would be placed on probation. That same day, the
defendant, through counsel, asked the Superior Court to stay execution of sentence until May 23,
2012. In the interim, the defendant filed a motion to withdraw his plea, to which the state
objected. The defendant argued that he did not have sufficient time to discuss the consequences
of his plea with his family, that he did not fully understand the consequences of an immediate
plea of nolo contendere, and that if he had had an opportunity to consult with his family, he
would not have entered the plea. The state countered, arguing that the defendant’s motion to
1 The term to serve has been stayed pending the disposition of this appeal. -1-
withdraw was untimely because sentence had already been imposed. The state suggested that the
proper avenue would be for the defendant to file an application for postconviction relief, but
added that, even on the merits, the defendant’s motion to withdraw should be denied. On May 23, 2012, the Superior Court convened a hearing on the motion.
Notwithstanding the timeliness argument raised by the state, the hearing justice chose to err on
the side of giving the defendant the opportunity to proceed with his motion to withdraw. The
hearing justice heard arguments from counsel and testimony from the defendant’s father. Taking
all of this into consideration, he denied the motion. As a threshold inquiry, “we must first determine if this matter is properly before us.”
State v. Castriotta, 80 A.3d 854, 855-56 (R.I. 2013). Rule 32(d) of the Superior Court Rules of
Criminal Procedure provides that “[a] motion to withdraw a plea of guilty or of nolo contendere
may be made only before sentence is imposed or deferred or probation is imposed or imposition
of sentence is suspended.” As we have explained, “[o]nce a defendant has entered a plea of
guilty or of nolo contendere and sentence has been imposed, any issue relating to the validity of
the plea must be raised by way of postconviction relief.” Castriotta, 80 A.3d at 856 (quoting
State v. Vashey, 912 A.2d 416, 418 (R.I. 2006)). Therefore, because the Superior Court had
already accepted the defendant’s plea and sentenced him, but had only stayed the execution of
sentence until a later date, the defendant’s appeal is not properly before this Court. However, under a similar set of facts, in Castriotta, despite stating that it was “our firm
opinion * * * that [the] defendant's appeal [was] not properly before [the] Court,” we nonetheless
discussed the merits of the defendant’s plaint. Castriotta, 80 A.3d at 856. We do the same here,
briefly. -2- Our decision in State v. Carroll, 110 R.I. 532, 294 A.2d 187 (1972), focuses withdrawal
of pleas on two questions: “[D]id the accused fully understand the consequences of his earlier
plea and, if he did, is he now offering to adduce evidence at trial which, if believed, would tend
to cast doubt on his guilt?” Id. at 536, 294 A.2d at 189. During the hearing on the motion to withdraw, the hearing justice engaged in a colloquy
with the defendant’s father regarding the father’s assertion that he knew his son did not commit
the crime pled to. The hearing justice found that the father’s testimony on behalf of his son,
though laudable, was essentially devoid of any factual basis. Indeed, such bare assertions do not
provide “any factual evidence which would cast doubt on [the defendant’s] guilt.” State v.
Sfameni, 113 R.I. 150, 154, 318 A.2d 460, 462 (1974) (holding that the defendant’s mere
“statement that he was not guilty” was insufficient “to satisfy the requirement of establishing
doubt as to guilt”). Accordingly, after his careful consideration of the arguments raised by defense counsel
and testimony from the defendant’s witness, the hearing justice determined that the defendant
should not be permitted to withdraw his plea. In support of his determination, the hearing justice
noted that, notwithstanding the testimony of the defendant’s father that his son had limited
formal education, was unable to hold steady employment, and may have had concentration
difficulties, there was “no evidence” introduced that “convince[d] [the] Court that [the
defendant] did not knowingly, intelligently and freely understand that he was giving up his
right[s] * * * by pleading nolo contendere.” Further, the hearing justice noted that the
“defendant ha[d] presented absolutely no information or evidence to [the] Court that * * *, if
believed, would tend to cast doubt on his guilt.” We cannot — especially in the absence of a -3-
transcript of the underlying plea colloquy — say that the hearing justice abused his discretion in
that determination. See Falcone v. State, 871 A.2d 361, 363 (R.I. 2005) (mem.). For the foregoing reasons we affirm the order of the Superior Court. The record in this
case may be returned to that tribunal. Entered as an Order of this Court, this 17th of October, 2014. By Order, _____________/s/___________________ Clerk -4- RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet

After the close of both the state’s and defense’s cases-in-chief, but\nbefore the trial justice rendered his decision, defense counsel apprised the trial justice of the\namendment to the statute. Defense counsel then sought to have the larceny count amended and\nthe solicitation charge dismissed or, in the alternative, amended. The state demurred, arguing\nthat any change in the law should be applied only prospectively and that defendant, who had\nalready been charged by the time the law was amended, should not benefit from the legislative\nchange.', 'The trial justice agreed with the state and proceeded with the counts as charged. Both\nparties gave their closing arguments, and the trial justice rendered his decision from the bench on\nJuly 2, 2012. The trial justice found that the evidence was clear that the amount of money in\nquestion was $714.

The\ndefendant was sentenced to five years imprisonment, with six months to serve, the remaining\nfour and one-half years suspended with probation on count 1, and the same sentence to run\nconcurrently on count 2. 2 A final judgment of conviction was later entered, and thereafter\ndefendant timely appealed.\n2', 'The sentences were stayed pending appeal.', '-2-', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the legislative intent behind the amendment to § 11-41-\n5, increasing the threshold for felony larceny from $500 to $1,500 was to reclassify offenses\nunder $1,500 from felonies to misdemeanors. Further, he argues that the amendment was\nameliorative in nature and should inure to the benefit of defendants, including those whose cases\nwere still pending on appeal when the statute was amended.

The state appeals from an order of the Superior Court\ngranting the defendant’s motions to suppress and/or exclude evidence obtained by Pawtucket\npolice detectives following the defendant’s arrest in the city of Providence. The defendant\nSteven B. Morris (Morris or defendant) was indicted for two separate incidents of first-degree\nrobbery committed in Pawtucket in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-39-1(a). On appeal, the state\nargues that the hearing justice erred in deciding that evidence stemming from an extra-\njurisdictional arrest was subject to the exclusionary rule of the Fourth Amendment to the United\nStates Constitution. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the order of the Superior\nCourt.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The facts in this matter are largely undisputed. The first of the two robberies with which\ndefendant was charged occurred on September 6, 2010 when Alcides Dias, an assistant manager', '-1-\nat PCX Clothing Store in Pawtucket, was robbed at knifepoint. 1 Detective David Silva of the\nPawtucket Police Department testified that Dias described the robber as being a “black male in\nhis forties, or late thirties, * * * heavyset, stocky,” and wearing a red hat, white shirt, black and\nblue shorts, and black gloves with the tips cut off. A few days later, on September 9, 2010, the\nSave-a-Lot grocery store in Pawtucket was also robbed at knifepoint. Nicole Cookson, the\nvictim in that robbery, described the robber as being “a black male, forties, stocky build,\nHawaiian shirt, yellow hat, running shorts[.]” Two other witnesses said that the robber fled the\nstore in a black Mercedes Benz with a temporary license plate in the rear window of the car. The\nwitnesses also said that the license plate contained the numbers 1367 or 1376. Detectives Silva\nand Donti Rosciti of the Pawtucket Police Department reviewed the surveillance footage from\nboth robberies and, based on the videos, formed a belief that the person who had robbed the PCX\nhad also committed the Save-a-Lot robbery. They then sent an email to all other police officers\nin the department with the description of the getaway vehicle.', 'The following day, Officer Mark Ramos identified a car matching that description parked\noutside of 327 Sayles Avenue in Pawtucket.', 'Officer Ramos notified the detectives and\ndiscovered, on speaking to one of the residents, that the car belonged to “a black male * * * who\nlived on the third floor.” Detective Silva used the vehicle identification number of the car and\nwas informed by the dealer at Class Act Auto Sales that the car had been sold to Morris. Officer\nRamos and the detectives then went to the third floor of the building and received the consent of\nthe resident to search the apartment. The resident of the apartment confirmed that Morris\nsometimes stayed overnight as a guest and directed the police to a storage room in the apartment\n1', 'The facts in this section are taken from the testimony of the detectives and other witnesses who\ntestified at the hearing.', '-2-\nwhere defendant kept some of his belongings. The police seized clothing and an Allstate\ninsurance policy in defendant’s name for the Mercedes.', 'Detective Silva obtained defendant’s phone number and called him, explaining that his\nvehicle had been seen leaving the scene of a robbery. The defendant identified the vehicle by\nasking, “My Mercedes?” Detective Silva told defendant that the detectives needed to speak with\nhim. Although defendant offered to take a bus to the Pawtucket police station, he was eventually\nconvinced by Det. Silva that he be picked up at Crossroads 2 in Providence.', 'On arriving at Crossroads, the detectives saw defendant and recognized him as the person\nwhom they had observed in the surveillance footage from both robberies.', 'After a brief\nconversation with defendant in which he agreed to accompany the detectives to the police\nstation, Det. Rosciti performed a pat-down search of him. Detective Rosciti testified that the pat-\ndown looking for weapons was standard procedure before any civilian is permitted to enter a\npolice vehicle. On performing the pat-down, Det. Rosciti felt something like paper or plastic in\none of defendant’s pockets and removed it. The piece of paper that Det. Rosciti took from\ndefendant’s pocket was later identified as being a U-Haul rental truck receipt. Detective Rosciti\ntestified that he took it out because he believed it might be contraband, such as a small packet of\nheroin or marijuana.', 'Morris was taken to the Pawtucket police station in the detectives’ car. Morris was not\nhandcuffed while in the car. After arriving at the Pawtucket police station, defendant reviewed\nand initialed a Miranda rights waiver form. The detectives asked defendant where he had been\nthe previous day, September 9, 2010, and defendant answered that he had been helping his sister\nmove from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. and had rented a U-Haul truck for that purpose. It was at that point\n2', 'Crossroads is a facility, located on Broad Street in Providence, that offers shelter and other life\nservices for the homeless.', '-3-\nthat the detectives looked at the U-Haul receipt that had been seized from defendant’s person\nduring the pat-down search. Detective Rosciti also spoke to Vivian Morris, defendant’s sister,\nwho told him that defendant had called suddenly on September 9, between 1 and 1:30 p.m., and\ntold her that he was going to move her that day. Following the conversation with Vivian Morris,\nthe detectives then went to the U-Haul franchise in Pawtucket and reviewed the surveillance\nfootage there. This footage showed defendant wearing what appeared to be the same clothing\nthat the suspect in the Save-a-Lot robbery had been wearing.', 'The defendant was charged with two counts of first-degree robbery for the two armed\nrobberies. The defendant filed a number of pretrial motions, including a motion to sever the\ncharges pursuant to Rule 14 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, as well as\nseveral motions to suppress (1) certain clothing and paperwork found in the apartment on Sayles\nAvenue in Pawtucket, (2) the U-Haul receipt seized from defendant’s person, (3) photographs\ntaken from the surveillance video from the U-Haul franchise in Pawtucket, (4) the statements\ndefendant made to the Pawtucket police, and (5) the testimony of defendant’s sister, Vivian\nMorris.', 'The pretrial motions were heard in the Providence County Superior Court on February\n23, 24, and 27, 2012. The hearing justice granted defendant’s motion to sever the charges, and\nthe state elected to proceed first on the charge involving the Save-a-Lot robbery. 3 After hearing\ntestimony and argument, the hearing justice granted defendant’s motion to suppress the U-Haul\nreceipt, concluding that defendant was under arrest from the moment of the pat-down procedure\nand that “the arrest was illegal because it was outside [the] jurisdiction [of the detectives].” The\nhearing justice also granted defendant’s motions to suppress defendant’s statement to the\n3', 'The motion to sever is not an issue before this Court.', '-4-\nPawtucket police, the testimony of defendant’s sister, and the U-Haul surveillance video\nphotographs as “fruits of the poisonous tree” stemming from defendant’s unauthorized arrest. 4\nThe hearing justice denied defendant’s motion to suppress the clothing and paperwork seized\nfrom the apartment on Sayles Avenue. 5', 'The state timely filed a notice to appeal the hearing justice’s granting of defendant’s\nvarious motions to suppress evidence, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 9-24-32. 6', 'A final order\nmemorializing the hearing justice’s decisions on defendant’s motions to dismiss was entered on\nMay 14, 2012. 7', 'Additional facts will be supplied as necessary to address the issues on appeal.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'In reviewing the grant or denial of a motion to suppress, this Court accords deference to\nthe trial justice’s factual findings and accepts those findings unless they are clearly erroneous.\nSee State v.

The\nstate bases its argument on the United States Supreme Court opinion in Virginia v. Moore, 553\nU.S. 164, 178 (2008), in which the Supreme Court held that the Fourth Amendment “does not\nrequire the exclusion of evidence obtained from a constitutionally permissible arrest.” The state\ncontends that the police officers’ actions were reasonable and that consequently, the exclusionary\nrule is too extreme a remedy under the facts of this case. In contrast, defendant argues that\napplication of the exclusionary rule is the appropriate remedy for a violation of state law and that\nthe circumstances of the instant case did not otherwise justify the detectives’ failure to respect\nthe jurisdictional boundaries of their authority.', 'A', 'The Authority of the Pawtucket Police Officers', 'This Court has repeatedly held to the principle that “[i]n the absence of a statutory or\njudicially recognized exception, the authority of a local police department is limited to its own\njurisdiction.” State v. Ceraso, 812 A.2d 829, 833 (R.I. 2002) (citing Page v. Staples, 13 R.I. 306\n8', 'The state concedes for the purposes of this appeal that defendant was placed under arrest from\nthe moment of the pat-down search. Accordingly, the question of whether defendant was\nactually under arrest before he was taken to the Pawtucket police station is not before this Court.\n9', 'The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution states, in pertinent part, that “[t]he\nright of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable\nsearches and seizures, shall not be violated * * *.”', '-6-\n(1881)). 10 The General Assembly has established two exceptions to this rule. The first, known\nas the “hot pursuit” exception, permits police officers who are in “close pursuit” of a person to\ncross into another jurisdiction in order to arrest that person.', 'See G.L. 1956 § 12-7-19. 11\n“Second, in emergency situations, it may be necessary and appropriate for the police from one\njurisdiction to exercise authority in another jurisdiction.” Ceraso, 812 A.2d at 833; see also G.L.\n1956 § 45-42-1 (granting officers responding to a request for “emergency police assistance from\nanother police department * * * the same authority, powers, duties, privileges, and immunities as\na duly appointed police officer of the city or town making the request”).

Hagan, 819 A.2d 1256, 1259 (R.I. 2003).', 'The hearing justice concluded that defendant’s arrest was based on probable cause and\ntherefore justified even though the police officers did not have a warrant for defendant’s arrest at\nthe time. 12', 'The hearing justice went on to consider both exceptions to the jurisdictional\n10', 'We recognize that Page v.

Detectives Rosciti and Silva were not in hot pursuit of defendant nor\nwere they in Providence at the Providence Police Department’s request.', 'The defendant contends that the detectives had probable cause to arrest him before they\narrived at Crossroads and that the detectives had, consequently, traveled to Providence with the\nspecific intention of doing so. We disagree with defendant’s contention. We have held that\n“[p]robable cause to arrest exists when the facts and circumstances within the police officer’s\nknowledge and of which he has reasonably trustworthy information are sufficient to warrant a\nreasonable person’s belief that a crime has been committed and that the person to be arrested has\ncommitted the crime.” Musterd, 56 A.3d at 936 (quoting State v. Kryla, 742 A.2d 1178, 1182\n(R.I. 1999)). We are of the opinion that probable cause for defendant’s arrest did not arise until\nthe detectives arrived at Crossroads and visually identified him as the person they had seen in the\nsurveillance videos of the robberies. Until the detectives matched defendant with the perpetrator\nof the robberies in the videos, they knew only that defendant was the owner of a car that\nappeared to match the one used at the Save-a-Lot robbery. Accordingly, we cannot agree with\ndefendant’s contention that the detectives crossed the boundary into Providence with the intent to\narrest him. We give credence to Det. Silva’s testimony at the hearing that, at the time, they\nintended only to transport defendant to the Pawtucket police station to question him about the\ninvolvement of defendant’s Mercedes in the robberies.', '-8-', 'The defendant further argues that the Pawtucket detectives should have called the\nProvidence police before they entered Providence. We disagree with defendant’s argument and\nfind our recent opinion in Hagan to be informative. In Hagan, Portsmouth police, having\nlawfully arrested the defendant in their jurisdiction, drove him to Middletown in order to conduct\na Breathalyzer test after discovering that the machine in Portsmouth was malfunctioning. See\nHagan, 819 A.2d at 1257. There, we distinguished between the “arrest and seizure of a suspect\noutside a municipality’s borders * * * and the extraterritorial transport of a prisoner who is in\nlawful custody, for the performance of legitimate law enforcement duties * * *.” Id. at 1261.\nWe “acknowledge[d] the practical realities of police investigations into unlawful conduct” in\nholding that “[a] police officer may take a prisoner already in lawful custody to another\nmunicipality to carry out legitimate law enforcement duties.” Id. Similarly, in the case at bar,\nwe are satisfied that the Pawtucket police could properly travel outside of their jurisdiction\nwithout the accompaniment of Providence police in the course of investigating the robberies.\nWe find no fault with the Pawtucket detectives’ behavior until they arrived at Crossroads.', 'We acknowledge that once the Pawtucket detectives arrived at Crossroads and made their\nvisual identification of defendant as the perpetrator of the robberies, their actions did not follow\nthe mandates for proper law enforcement activities outside of their jurisdiction. The state argues\nthat, upon identifying defendant, the detectives were then justified in immediately arresting him\nto prevent defendant from “abscond[ing], perhaps to commit a third violent crime before\nrecapture[.]” We do not agree with the state’s argument. Indeed, we find it implausible based on\nthe facts of the case at bar. The defendant’s meeting the detectives at Crossroads and his\ncooperation with the detectives when they arrived do not indicate to this Court that defendant\nwas a threat to flee from the police. We note that, if defendant had been inclined to flee, he', '-9-\nwould hardly have been waiting at Crossroads to be questioned by the detectives at all. While\nthe detectives may well not have expected defendant to appear, we deem it unreasonable to\nbelieve that he presented a risk of flight, once they saw that defendant had, in fact, met them at\nCrossroads. 13 Accordingly, we are satisfied that, from the moment the detectives arrived at\nCrossroads and determined they had probable cause to make an arrest, our jurisprudence required\nthat they contact the Providence police department to ask for its assistance in arresting defendant.\nIt was undisputed that Crossroads is located close to the Providence police station. Under the\ncircumstances, we do not believe that requiring the Pawtucket detectives to contact the\nProvidence police in order to make the arrest would have placed an unreasonable burden on\nthem.', 'We emphasize that there is nothing in the record to indicate that contacting the\nProvidence police and then waiting for their assistance would have required unlawfully detaining\ndefendant for any length of time but rather could have been done in a matter of minutes. “[W]e\nare cognizant of the strong public interest underlying jurisdictional restraints over law\nenforcement personnel and are mindful that the Legislature has granted limited authority to an\nofficer to arrest a suspect outside his or her jurisdiction * * *.” Hagan, 819 A.2d at 1261. Under\nthe circumstances presented here, we decline to expand the authority which the Legislature has\ngranted to a police officer to arrest a suspect outside of his or her jurisdiction. Consequently, we\nhold that the Pawtucket detectives’ actions in arresting defendant outside their jurisdiction\nwithout even attempting to get the assistance and approval of the Providence police were\nunauthorized and in excess of their authority.\n13', 'We find a belief that defendant posed a risk of flight to be especially unreasonable under the\ncircumstances as defendant was, to the best of the detectives’ knowledge, without the use of a\ncar. We note that defendant had previously offered to take the bus to the Pawtucket police\nstation.', '- 10 -', 'B', 'The Appropriate Remedy for Defendant’s Unauthorized Arrest', 'Our analysis, however, must continue on to determine whether the Fourth Amendment to\nthe United States Constitution mandates the exclusion of evidence obtained from defendant’s\nextra-jurisdictional arrest. The state argues that application of “the exclusionary rule is too harsh\na remedy for any violation of a state jurisdictional statute” where, as here, the police officers\n“act[ed] in good-faith furtherance of their duty to protect the public[.]”', 'It is axiomatic that “[t]he exclusionary rule bars from introduction at trial evidence\nobtained either during or as a direct result of searches and seizures in violation of an individual’s\nFourth Amendment rights.” State v. Jennings, 461 A.2d 361, 368 (R.I. 1983). This prohibition\nagainst the use of evidence obtained after an illegal search applies with equal force against the\nuse of evidence obtained from an unlawful arrest. See Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471,\n485 (1963).', 'The exclusionary rule operates as “a judicially created remedy designed to\nsafeguard Fourth Amendment rights generally through its deterrent effect, rather than a personal\nconstitutional right of the party aggrieved.” United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 348 (1974).\n“[W]hether the exclusionary rule’s remedy is appropriate in a particular context * * * [is] an\nissue separate from the question whether the Fourth Amendment rights of the party seeking to\ninvoke the rule were violated by police conduct.” Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 223 (1983).\nThe United States Supreme Court has warned that “unbending application of the exclusionary\nsanction to enforce ideals of governmental rectitude would impede unacceptably the truth-\nfinding functions of judge and jury.” United States v. Payner, 447 U.S. 727, 734 (1980). It is\nwith these general principles in mind that we will consider whether the evidence obtained as a\nresult of defendant’s unauthorized arrest must be suppressed.', '- 11 -', 'The United States Supreme Court has recently addressed the question of whether the\nFourth Amendment requires that evidence obtained from a search made incident to an arrest that\nwas unlawful under state law be excluded. See Moore, 553 U.S. at 177-78. Moore involved an\narrest for the misdemeanor of driving on a suspended license, which under Virginia law was not\nan arrestable offense. Id. at 167. The Supreme Court concluded that “the arrest rules that the\nofficers violated were those of state law alone” and “it is not the province of the Fourth\nAmendment to enforce state law.” 14 Id. at 178. Accordingly, the Supreme Court held that the\nFourth Amendment did not require the exclusion of the evidence because of a violation of a state\nlaw where the arrest was otherwise “constitutionally permissible” under the federal constitution.\nId.', 'More recently, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has addressed the\nissue of whether evidence obtained after an arrest made outside of a federal law enforcement\nofficer’s jurisdiction is inadmissible for that reason. See United States v. Ryan, 731 F.3d 66, 67\n(1st Cir. 2013). In Ryan, a United States Park Ranger saw the defendant driving over the center\nline of the road and after following the defendant, pulled him over for the traffic violation, at\nwhich time the Ranger determined that the defendant was intoxicated. 15 Id. The traffic stop and\nthe defendant’s subsequent arrest occurred outside of the National Park System and, therefore,\noutside of the federal statutory jurisdiction of the Ranger. Id. at 67-68. The First Circuit cited\nMoore in noting that, generally, federal constitutional claims have not been based on violations\n14', 'The United States Supreme Court specifically noted that “Virginia law does not, as a general\nmatter, require suppression of evidence obtained in violation of state law.” Virginia v. Moore,\n553 U.S. 164, 167 (2008). The Supreme Court’s analysis, therefore, was limited to the question\nof whether suppression was required under the federal constitution. Id. at 168.\n15', 'The federal statute limiting the jurisdiction of the Ranger included an exception for when a\nperson flees to avoid arrest. See United States v. Ryan, 731 F.3d 66, 68 n.2 (1st Cir. 2013). In\nRyan, however, there was no claim that the defendant was fleeing and so this exception was\ndeemed to be inapplicable. Id.', '- 12 -\nof state or federal statutes concerning arrest. See id. at 69. The court concluded that “an officer\n* * * arrest[ing] an obviously intoxicated driver just outside that officer’s territorial jurisdiction,\nafter a lawful traffic stop, is ‘not remotely’ akin to the invasions of privacy that might call for the\nexclusion of evidence [under the Fourth Amendment].” Id. at 70.', 'Here, there is no question that defendant’s arrest, although extra-jurisdictional, involves\nonly a violation of state law and not of defendant’s constitutional rights. As a general matter,\n“the lawfulness of a state arrest by state police is governed by state law so long as that law is not\ninconsistent with federal constitutional standards.” State v. Berker, 120 R.I. 849, 855, 391 A.2d\n107, 111 (1978). This Court has further concluded that a warrantless arrest made under our state\nstatutes is “constitutionally sound * * * to the extent that it meets the requirement of probable\ncause[.]” Id. at 856, 391 A.2d at 111; cf. Ryan, 731 F.3d at 70 (noting that Moore “implies that\nan extraterritorial arrest is not a per se violation of the Fourth Amendment”). Our primary\nconcern here is, therefore, with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule for\nan arrest, based on probable cause, that was made outside the territorial jurisdiction of the\narresting officer. We hold, in conjunction with the United States Supreme Court and the First\nCircuit, that the Fourth Amendment does not mandate exclusion of evidence obtained after\ndefendant’s arrest outside of the Pawtucket detectives’ jurisdiction.', 'Although the arrest here was in excess of the officers’ jurisdiction, the Fourth\nAmendment does not impose some hypothetical ideal of a law enforcement officer’s conduct, but\nrather is concerned with whether the officer’s conduct was “reasonable” under the\ncircumstances. See State v. Taveras, 39 A.3d 638, 648 (R.I. 2012) (“The lynchpin of any Fourth\nAmendment analysis is reasonableness.”); see also State v. Johnson, 102 R.I. 344, 351, 352, 353,\n230 A.2d 831, 835, 836 (1967) (stating that “standards of reasonableness under the Fourth', '- 13 -\nAmendment are not susceptible of Procrustean application” and that a court “should measure the\ntotality of circumstances against the constitutional standard of reasonableness” and be mindful of\nthe fact that “a law enforcement officer * * * must act on a quick appraisal of the facts before\nhim without the benefit of the hindsight which is usually possessed by those reviewing his\nactions”). This Court has stated that the exercise of our supervisory power to interpret and apply\nthe exclusionary rule “should be exercised with great restraint after balancing carefully the\nsocietal interests involved.” State v. Jackson, 570 A.2d 1115, 1117 (R.I. 1990). We are of the\nopinion that the detectives’ actions in the case at bar do not constitute egregious conduct in\nexcess of their jurisdiction. Accordingly, we conclude that the exclusionary rule of the Fourth\nAmendment does not apply here to suppress the evidence gathered as a result of defendant’s\nunauthorized arrest. 16', 'The defendant urges us to adopt the reasoning of the Supreme Judicial Court of\nMassachusetts in Commonwealth v. Hernandez, 924 N.E.2d 709 (Mass. 2010). In Hernandez,\nthe Supreme Judicial Court upheld the suppression of evidence obtained after Boston University\ncampus police had arrested the defendant without the statutory authority to do so. See id. at 710-\n11. The Supreme Judicial Court addressed the holding in Moore, but concluded that past\nprecedents of that court had established that suppression was appropriate because “exclusion is a\ndeterrent to the abuse of official power based on the application of State legal principles.” Id. at\n16', 'The defendant asserts that this Court has previously applied the exclusionary rule as a remedy\nfor the violation of state law, citing, in particular, State v. Robinson, 658 A.2d 518 (R.I. 1995) as\na case where this Court used the exclusionary rule to suppress a confession obtained after a\nviolation of the District Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. We are convinced, however, that\nthis case is not applicable to the case at bar. Robinson involved an arrest and detention made\nwithout probable cause, where the actions of the police were egregious. Robinson, 658 A.2d at\n520-21. Indeed, this Court explicitly noted that what was at issue in Robinson was “[t]he\nviolation of * * * constitutional protections,” not only a violation of a state procedural rule. Id.\nat 522.', '- 14 -\n712. We deem Hernandez to be inapposite to the instant case. To begin with, the Supreme\nJudicial Court based its conclusion on its own past precedents and Massachusetts statutory law,\nwhich differ both from the Fourth Amendment jurisprudence of the United States Supreme Court\nand from our own jurisprudence. See id. at 712-13; cf. State v. Barros, 24 A.3d 1158, 1167 (R.I.\n2011) (declining to follow the reasoning of the Supreme Judicial Court with regard to jury\ninstructions about custodial interrogations). In addition, we note that the conduct of the campus\npolice in Hernandez was significantly more egregious than the conduct of the Pawtucket\ndetectives here. In Hernandez, the campus police apparently decided to run a check of the\ndefendant’s automobile when the defendant was engaged in nothing more suspicious than\npumping gasoline and then proceeded to arrest the defendant for an outstanding warrant for an\noffense that had no connection to the university. See Hernandez, 924 N.E.2d at 711. The\ncampus police behavior in Hernandez is not analogous to the conduct of the Pawtucket detectives\nhere. Accordingly, we decline to adopt the reasoning of Hernandez to order the suppression of\nthe evidence the Pawtucket detectives obtained in the instant case.', 'We recognize that Rhode Island also has a statutory exclusionary rule embodied in G.L.\n1956 § 9-19-25. 17', 'This Court has, however, concluded that § 9-19-25 largely tracks the\nexclusionary rule of the Fourth Amendment. See State v. Mattatall, 603 A.2d 1098, 1113 (R.I.\n1992) (“[T]his [C]ourt has, with very few exceptions, followed the opinions of the United States\nSupreme Court whether premised on the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution or\non our own statutory exclusionary rule. The Rhode Island exclusionary rule is a statute that has\n17', 'General Laws 1956 § 9-19-25 states:', '“In the trial of any action in any court of this state, no', 'evidence shall be admissible where the evidence shall have been', 'procured by, through, or in consequence of any illegal search and', 'seizure as prohibited in § 6 of article 1 of the constitution of the', 'state of Rhode Island.”', '- 15 -\nnever acquired or developed an independent body of jurisprudence.”). Moreover, because we are\nsatisfied that, under Moore, 553 U.S. at 169, and Ryan, 731 F.3d at 69-70, defendant’s arrest did\nnot violate the Fourth Amendment, we conclude that it similarly did not violate defendant’s\nrights under article 1, section 6 of the Rhode Island Constitution. See State v. Foster, 842 A.2d\n1047, 1050 n.3 (R.I. 2004) (noting that the Fourth Amendment “is substantively the same as\narticle 1, section 6 of the Rhode Island Constitution”); see also Brousseau v. Town of Westerly,\n11 F.Supp. 2d 177, 183 (D. R.I. 1998) (recognizing that article 1, section 6 of the Rhode Island\nconstitution is generally co-extensive with the federal Fourth Amendment). Accordingly, we are\nof the opinion that our statutory exclusionary rule also does not mandate the suppression of the\nevidence obtained in this case.', 'In so doing, we emphasize that our holding is limited to the specific facts of the case at\nbar. We reserve for another day a decision as to whether more egregious violations of state law\nwould trigger application of our statutory exclusionary rule. Cf. Mattatall, 603 A.2d at 1112-13\n(declining to expand our statutory exclusionary rule in that case beyond what was required under\nthe Fourth Amendment).', 'As this Court has stated before, “[w]e believe that an exclusionary rule is strong medicine\nindeed since it deprives the trier of fact in many instances of highly relevant and reliable\nevidence.” Jackson, 570 A.2d at 1117. We are of the opinion that the detectives’ conduct here\nwas not egregious enough to justify exclusion of probative evidence, and we decline to expand\nour exclusionary rule jurisprudence to require the suppression of evidence in the circumstances\nof the case at bar. Accordingly, we hold that the hearing justice erred in granting the defendant’s\nmotions to suppress the U-Haul receipt, his statement to the Pawtucket police, the testimony of\nthe defendant’s sister, and the U-Haul surveillance video photographs.', '- 16 -', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the order of the Superior Court granting the\ndefendant’s motions to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of his arrest.

The defendant, Pedro Marte, appeals from a\nSuperior Court judgment of conviction for possession with intent to deliver cocaine. After a jury\ntrial, the defendant was sentenced to a term of ten years at the Adult Correctional Institutions,\nwith two years to serve, and eight years suspended. On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial\njustice erred: (1) by not excluding evidence that the defendant was carrying cash at the time of\nhis arrest; and (2) in denying the defendant any remedy for the state’s late disclosure of that\nevidence. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to\nappear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided.\nAfter considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we\nconclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further\nbriefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the\nSuperior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On September 13, 2010, at approximately 8 p.m., two Providence police detectives\nobserved a vehicle idling in the parking lot of a Wendy’s restaurant at the corner of Public and', '-1-\nEddy Streets in the City of Providence. Detective Kristopher Poplaski and his partner, Det.\nPatrick Potter, testified that there were two occupants in the vehicle, one of whom—passenger\nSeth McGough—was using a cell phone. Detective Poplaski testified that he observed a Nissan\ndrive into the lot a short time later. The driver, whom Det. Poplaski identified as defendant, was\nalso talking on a cell phone. According to Det. Poplaski, defendant pulled into the parking space\nnext to McGough and then pulled back out of the space and drove out of the parking lot, towards\nPublic Street. Detective Poplaski testified that McGough’s vehicle followed defendant’s out of\nthe lot and down Public Street. Detectives Poplaski and Potter followed the two vehicles as they\nturned onto Temple Street. Detective Poplaski testified that defendant’s vehicle pulled over and\nparked on the side of the road, and McGough’s vehicle pulled up and parked immediately behind\nit.', 'According to Det. Poplaski, McGough exited his car and entered the front passenger side\nof defendant’s vehicle. At that point, Det. Poplaski recounted, Det. Potter drove by defendant’s\nvehicle “very slowly.” As their car drew alongside defendant’s vehicle, Det. Poplaski observed\nMcGough hand something to defendant and defendant hand something to McGough in what he\ncharacterized as “a transaction that occurred very quickly.” The detectives exited their vehicle;\nand although Det. Potter arrested defendant immediately, McGough fled on foot. Detective\nPoplaski pursued McGough and witnessed as he placed something in his mouth.', 'As he\napproached McGough, Det. Poplaski recalled that he directed McGough to “spit it out.”\nAccording to Det. Poplaski, McGough spit two clear plastic bags of suspected cocaine onto the', '-2-\nground. The substance in the bags was weighed and tested and determined to be 3.1 grams of\ncocaine. 1', 'Mr. McGough testified that, on the night of September 13, he was “[l]ooking to purchase\ndrugs.” He recalled that, as he sat in the Wendy’s parking lot, he made the call to arrange to\nmeet someone there to buy $100 worth of cocaine. Mr. McGough testified that, after getting into\ndefendant’s vehicle, he purchased an “eight ball of cocaine” from defendant for approximately\n$100. 2', 'The defendant was charged with unlawful delivery of a controlled substance (cocaine) in\nviolation of G.L. 1956 § 21-28-4.01(a)(4)(i). On the morning that his trial was to begin, the state\nnotified defendant that it intended to question one of the detectives about the contents of\ndefendant’s wallet at the time of arrest.', 'The state averred that it had only received the\ninformation “[fifteen] minutes ago,” and that it consisted of the inventory of items in defendant’s\npossession upon arrest—a wallet and $185 cash.', 'The money was neither seized nor\nphotographed, because department policy was to not seize any amount below $300.', 'The\ndefendant made a motion in limine to exclude this evidence, arguing that it was a violation of\nRule 16 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure and that it constituted an unfair\nsurprise. 3 The trial justice ruled that the state’s late disclosure was not a violation of Rule 16.\n1', 'Mr. McGough later pled nolo contendere to one count of possession of cocaine and two counts\nof simple assault, for which he received eighteen months of probation and 100 hours of\ncommunity service. One count of resisting arrest was dismissed pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the\nSuperior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n2', 'According to Det. Poplaski, an eight ball of cocaine is 3.5 grams and can be worth anywhere\nbetween $100 and $150.\n3', 'This Court has stated that Rule 16 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure requires\nthe state to turn over “prior recorded statements, a summary of their expected trial testimony, and\nany records of the[] prior convictions” of any witnesses the state intends to call at trial.

There was testimony that defendant had cash on him at the time of the arrest and\nthat it was not seized because it was less than $300, but no amount was named.

The trial justice accepted the state’s\nrepresentation that the late disclosure was not intentional, and he next considered whether\ndefendant was prejudiced by the information. In response to the trial justice’s questioning,\ndefense counsel stated that “possibly it would have changed the structure of the entire case,\nwhether or not it would have gone to trial * * * .” The defendant’s counsel asserted that it was\nher understanding that there “was no money here” because it was not included in the seizure\n4', 'During his testimony, Det. Potter offered this explanation of a “traps bag”: “It’s property --\nwhen you’re arrested, any property that you have on you can’t go into the cell with you, so it’s\nplaced in a bag, sealed and labeled * * * just to identify what you have * * *.”', '-5-\nreport.

Since', 'there was no specific indication that there was no money found,', 'and the defendant, through counsel, had notice of what the', 'codefendant alleged that he, in fact, paid money, I can’t find as a', 'matter of law it’s a Rule 16 violation.”\nDespite finding no violation, the trial justice then allowed a short recess, during which the parties\nspoke and came to an agreement that the state would not ask how much money was in\ndefendant’s possession and that testimony regarding the cash would be limited to the fact that\nthere was money and it was less than $300.', 'We have stated that “the trial justice is in the best position to evaluate whether any\nprejudice has resulted from noncompliance with discovery motions.” Grant, 946 A.2d at 828\n(quoting State v. Evans, 668 A.2d 1256, 1259 (R.I. 1996)). Here, after the trial justice granted a\nbrief recess, the parties reached an agreement. Detective Potter then testified that defendant had\ncash, but that it was not seized, and that it was less than $300. Further, Det. Potter testified that\n“we never seize less than $300.” The jury, therefore, could not know whether defendant’s wallet\ncontained one dollar or some other amount up to $299.', 'Given our deferential standard of review, we find no clear error on the part of the trial\njustice. The fact that the defendant had some amount of cash on his person at the time of arrest\nis not unfairly prejudicial; and, indeed, jurors may likely suppose that most people have some\namount of cash in their wallets at any given time.

The defendant posits that the\nconflict exists because § 12-1-12(a) provides for the sealing of all court records by the clerk of\nthe court within sixty days after exoneration, provided the person has not previously been\nconvicted of a felony and, therefore, the sealing of her court record pertaining to Count One,\n6', 'Sections 12-1-12(a) and 12-1-12.1(a) were amended by the General Assembly effective\nJuly 15, 2013 by P.L. 2013, ch. 301, § 1.

However, § 12-1-12.1(a) provides\nfor the sealing of all court records only when a person is exonerated of “all counts in a criminal\ncase.” According to defendant’s reading of the statutes, § 12-1-12(a) requires the sealing of\ncourt records that § 12-1-12.1(a) does not allow to be sealed. The defendant avers that, because\nof the alleged conflict, this Court should not rely merely on the plain language of the statute.', 'The state counters, contending that the plain language of § 12-1-12.1(a) clearly requires\nexoneration of all counts in a criminal case in order for the individual to be eligible to have his or\nher record sealed. Moreover, the state argues, § 12-1-12(a) deals with the destruction of physical\nidentification records whereas § 12-1-12.1(a) deals with court records. The state also points out\nthat the only time that court records are mentioned in § 12-1-12(a), a specific reference to the\nsealing requirements of § 12-1-12.1(a) is made. Consequently, the state contends: (1) that there\nis no conflict between the two statutory provisions; and (2) that this Court should affirm the trial\njustice’s decision because it is based on the plain language of § 12-1-12.1(a).', 'Pursuant to our canons of statutory construction, we first address whether or not the\nstatute in question has a plain meaning and is, as such, unambiguous. See DeMarco, 26 A.3d at\n617; State v. DiCicco, 707 A.2d 251, 253 (R.I. 1998). If we find the statute to be unambiguous,\nwe simply apply the plain meaning and our interpretive task is done. See, e.g., State v. Graff, 17\nA.3d 1005, 1010 (R.I. 2011) (“[W]e have indicated that a clear and unambiguous statute will be\nliterally construed.”) (internal quotation marks omitted); State v.

Conflict of Interest\nCommission, 121 R.I. 232, 237, 397 A.2d 884, 887 (1979) (“It is a primary canon of statutory\nconstruction that statutory intent is to be found in the words of a statute, if they are free from\nambiguity and express a reasonable meaning.”).', 'We begin by scrutinizing § 12-1-12.1(a), an enactment that relates to judicial records.\nThat statute expressly requires a dismissal of all counts in a criminal case for an individual to be\neligible to have his or her record of a dismissed charge sealed: “Any person who is acquitted or\notherwise exonerated of all counts in a criminal case * * * may file a motion for the sealing of\nhis or her court records in the case * * * .” (Emphasis added.) We detect no ambiguity in the\nGeneral Assembly’s use of the words “all counts.” The General Assembly certainly “has not\nsounded an uncertain trumpet” since the plain language of § 12-1-12.1(a) clearly requires that an\nindividual be exonerated of all counts in a criminal case in order to have the record in that case\nsealed. State v. Calise, 478 A.2d 198, 201 (R.I. 1984) (“In the case at bar the Legislature has not\nsounded an uncertain trumpet.”). Any other interpretation would require this Court to ignore the\nstatute’s pellucid “all counts” language and, in essence, rewrite the statute—thereby flying in the\nface of the fundamental principle that a court should not rewrite a statute enacted by the General', '-7-\nAssembly. See Calise, 478 A.2d at 201 (stating that the Court has “neither the authority nor the\ncompetence to rewrite” a statutory definition); see also Dodd v. United States, 545 U.S. 353, 359\n(2005) (stating that a court is simply “not free to rewrite [a] statute that Congress has enacted”).\nMoreover, we have repeatedly held that a Court may not “broaden statutory provisions by\njudicial interpretation unless such interpretation is necessary and appropriate in carrying out the\nclear intent or defining the terms of the statute.” State v. Santos, 870 A.2d 1029, 1032 (R.I.\n2005) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Rivera v. Employees’ Retirement System of\nRhode Island, 70 A.3d 905, 910 (R.I. 2013) (“[W]e have noted that [w]here there is no\nambiguity, we are not privileged to legislate, by inclusion, words which are not found in the\nstatute.”) (internal quotation marks omitted); Iselin v.

See State v.\nManocchio, 743 A.2d 555, 558 (R.I. 2000) (stating that the Superior Court does not possess an\n“inherent power to disregard the specific criteria and limitations on the expungement and sealing\nof * * * records that are set forth in the statute”); see generally Green v. Biddle, 21 U.S. (8\nWheat.) 1, 89-90 (1823) (“[W]here the words of a law * * * have a plain and obvious meaning,\nall construction, in hostility with such meaning, is excluded.”); see also Graff, 17 A.3d at 1010-\n12 (finding error in a trial justice’s overly expansive interpretation of a statute). When we apply\nthe plain language of § 12-1-12.1(a), we reach precisely the same conclusion as did the hearing\njustice: pursuant to that statute, defendant was not entitled to have her record pertaining to Count', '-8-\nOne sealed because she opted to plead nolo contendere to Count Two, and, consequently, she\nwas not exonerated of “all counts[.]”', 'The defendant contends that, in spite of the plain language of § 12-1-12.1(a), we must go\nbeyond the plain meaning in our analysis because the just cited statute, in defendant’s view, is in\nconflict with § 12-1-12(a). Upon review of both statutes, however, we are unable to perceive the\npresence of any conflict. The pertinent language of § 12-1-12(a), which defendant submits is in\nconflict with § 12-1-12.1(a), reads as follows: “[W]ithin sixty (60) days after there has been an\nacquittal, dismissal, no true bill, no information, or the person has been otherwise exonerated\nfrom the offense with which he or she is charged, the clerk of court where the exoneration has\ntaken place shall, consistent with § 12-1-12.1, place under seal all records of the person in the\ncase including all records of the division of criminal identification established by § 12-1-4\n* * * .” (Emphasis added.) Even if we assume arguendo that defendant’s contention is correct\nand that § 12-1-12(a) is mandatory, there is no conflict created in view of the clear reference in §\n12-1-12(a) to § 12-1-12.1. It is a basic canon of statutory construction that “the Legislature is\npresumed to have intended each word or provision of a statute to express a significant meaning,\nand the court will give effect to every word, clause, or sentence, whenever possible.” State v.\nBryant, 670 A.2d 777, 779 (R.I. 1996); see also State v. Reis, 430 A.2d 749, 752 (R.I. 1981).\nThe General Assembly specifically and unambiguously required that the sealing of records under\n§ 12-1-12(a) be consistent with § 12-1-12.1. Accordingly, we conclude that there is no conflict\nbetween § 12-1-12(a) and § 12-1-12.1(a) because § 12-1-12(a) requires the sealing of court\nrecords only when doing so would be permissible under § 12-1-12.1(a). As a result, we hold that\nthe hearing justice did not err by hewing to the plain language of § 12-1-12.1(a) when passing\nupon defendant’s motion to seal.', '-9-', 'B', 'The Defendant’s Further Arguments', 'The defendant has set forth some further arguments to support her contention that the\nhearing justice’s order was in error.', 'We address these arguments briefly.', 'The defendant\ncontends that § 12-1-7 is also in conflict with § 12-1-12.1(a) because § 12-1-7 requires that the\nAttorney General maintain only a record of information of “all persons who shall be or shall\nhave been convicted of [a] felony, or imprisoned for violating any of the military, naval, or\ncriminal laws of the United States or of any state, and of all well-known and habitual criminals\nfrom wherever procurable.” According to defendant, the duty of the Attorney General pursuant\nto § 12-1-7 does not include the maintenance of records of those individuals who have been\nconvicted of a misdemeanor or had charges against them dismissed. The defendant posits that\n§ 12-1-7 is in conflict with § 12-1-12.1(a) because § 12-1-12.1(a) prohibits the sealing of records\nthat § 12-1-7 does not require the Attorney General to maintain. However, we perceive no\nconflict between the fact that the Attorney General is required by statute to maintain only records\nof felony convictions and the fact that the courts are prohibited from sealing a dismissed felony\ncharge when there was a plea of nolo contendere to an accompanying misdemeanor charge, as\noccurred in the instant case. Each of the two statutory provisions clearly applies to an entirely\ndifferent governmental body, and consequently the statutes are not even arguably in conflict.\nSee Olamuyiwa, 45 A.3d at 534 (stating that, when a statute is clear and unambiguous the Court\ngives the words in the statute their plain and ordinary meaning).', 'Moreover, defendant’s\ncontention that these two statutes are in conflict, even if it were meritorious, does not change the\nconclusion that this Court has made—viz., that the plain language of § 12-1-12.1(a) requires', '- 10 -\nexoneration on all counts in a criminal case before an individual is eligible to have his or her\nrecord sealed.', 'Finally, defendant further argues that the General Assembly “did not intend for those\nindividuals with a companion misdemeanor charge to be prohibited from destruction of all other\n‘felony’ charges that they were exonerated of * * * .” The defendant, citing the difficulties that\nan individual encounters when there is a record of his or her arrest, contends that there is no\nlegitimate law enforcement purpose in maintaining the record of charges on which she has been\nexonerated. Once again, while we do not minimize the challenges that a record of arrest can\npose, defendant’s contentions are unavailing due to the plain language of § 12-1-12.1(a)—and a\nstatute’s plain language is “the best indicator of legislative intent.” Graff, 17 A.3d at 1010; see\nalso Santos, 870 A.2d at 1032. We are not the branch of Rhode Island government responsible\nfor policy-making; accordingly, any remedy to such hardship as may result from the application\nof the plain language of § 12-1-12.1(a) would fall within the competence of the General\nAssembly.

It’s through the prosecutor’s redirect.”\nDefense counsel asked the trial justice to pass the case (i.e., declare a mistrial), arguing that the\nprosecutor “went after” Yvonne “as a total adverse witness against the rules of redirect;” he\nadded that “[t]o have her breakdown [sic] to the point where the jury can feel nothing but\nsympathy, I think it’s prejudicial to my client.” The trial justice characterized the prosecutor’s\nquestioning as a “very grave error,” “totally inappropriate,” and “totally improper.” He further\nchastised the prosecutor at sidebar as follows:', '“Why in the world did you take it upon yourself to tell her', 'what her own daughter has never told her after all of these years', 'when the witness’s answers have been consistent on both direct', 'and cross examination that the daughter never told her?', '-7-', '“***', '“This case rises and falls on the witness’s statement,', '[Jessica’s] statement, not what her mother didn’t know that, you,', 'with great vehemen[ce] told her that she didn’t know, and I think it', 'was very inappropriate that you took it upon yourself to tell her', 'what she didn’t know when it wasn’t necessary. It wasn’t', 'necessary to prove your case and put this woman through the', 'distress that she is now going through.”\nDespite his criticism at sidebar of the challenged questions by the prosecutor, the trial justice\nnonetheless decided not to pass the case; and he denied defense counsel’s motion to that effect.\nInstead, the trial justice provided a curative instruction to the jury as follows:', '“Ladies and gentlemen, that line of questioning engaged in', 'by the prosecutor I consider to be inappropriate to this witness.', 'First of all, the witness answered consistently in both direct, cross', 'and redirect that she was never told by her daughter what the actual', 'alleged acts of misconduct were.', '“I think it’s unfortunate that the prosecution chose to reveal', 'these facts to this woman at this time.

So her reaction has got nothing to do with this other', 'than her own unfortunate discovery of the nature of these', 'allegations. It doesn’t prove the allegations. Understand what I’m', 'saying? And I think that line of questioning was inappropriate. I’m', 'not going to do anything other than caution you not to allow this to', 'enter into your deliberations with regard to overt sympathy.

It was her testimony that, on one of those\noccasions (which she stated that she told her mother about), defendant was “looking out the\nwindow, the bedroom window.” It was further her testimony that, on the other occasion, she\n“woke up” and saw defendant “getting out up from [Jessica’s] bed;” she added that she\npretended to be asleep and that defendant walked over, “sat on the end of [her] bed and then he\nleft the room.” Adriana testified that she did not tell her mother about the second incident.', '-9-', 'B', 'The Jury Instructions, the Deliberations and the Verdict', 'After Adriana’s testimony, the prosecution rested, and defendant (after unsuccessfully\nmoving for a judgment of acquittal) likewise rested without calling any witnesses.

Sympathy, compassion, hatred, bias, any of the', 'human emotions that we all have and that we all experience have', 'no place in your deliberations.”\nAfter a day of deliberating the jury sent a note to the trial justice stating that it had reached a\nconsensus on “12 of the 14 counts but [was] struggling to come up to a consensus on the other\ntwo.”', 'After receiving that note from the jury, the trial justice repeated his instructions\nconcerning the issues to which the jury had pointed. That same day, the jury returned a verdict\nof guilty on two counts of second-degree sexual assault, both of which arose from the first\nincident about which Jessica testified. Specifically, defendant was found guilty on Count One\nand Count Two which alleged “Hand to Vagina” and “Hand to Breast” respectively. The jury\nreturned a not guilty verdict on the remaining twelve counts. In due course, the trial justice\nsentenced defendant on each of the two counts to twenty-five years imprisonment, with eight\nyears to serve and seventeen years suspended, with probation.', 'C', 'Motion for a New Trial', 'The defendant moved for a new trial, which motion was heard on December 2, 2011.\nThe defendant argued that the jury’s verdict was “inconsistent” with the evidence presented at\ntrial.

Accordingly, defendant argued that, if the jury found Jessica to be a credible witness,\nit should have found him guilty on “all counts” and if it did not find her to be a credible witness\nit should have “acquitted him” on all counts. The defendant also pointed out that the first\nincident had the least evidentiary support since Jessica testified that she had “her eyes closed”\nand knew defendant only by his “rough hands.” The defendant characterized Jessica’s testimony\nas “robotic;” he added that her description of what had occurred was “done basically without any\ntype of emotion[,] * * * almost in a script * * * .”', 'The trial justice denied defendant’s motion.', 'He found Jessica’s testimony to be\n“unemotional” but nevertheless “credible.” With respect to Yvonne, the trial justice stated that\nhe found her to be “extremely credible particularly after she was made aware” of the specific\nallegations against defendant. The trial justice expressed his “surprise” that the jury convicted\non only two of fourteen counts, and he found the verdict to be inconsistent. However, he\ndeclined to “disturb the finding of guilty on the first two counts.” The trial justice stated that the\njury “understood the charge, and took their time.” He further stated that there could have been\n“some compromise” among the jurors or that the jury may not have believed that a “child of\ntender years” could have experienced the type of penetration Jessica described without “cry[ing]\nout.” The trial justice stated that a “reasonable inference[]” could be drawn from Jessica’s\ntestimony that the perpetrator of the first incident of sexual assault (Counts One & Two) was\ndefendant because he was the only adult male in the household.', '- 11 -', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'On appeal, defendant contends: (1) that the trial justice erred in failing to grant his motion\nto pass the case subsequent to the prosecutor’s questioning on redirect examination of Yvonne\nwith respect to the details of the assaults that defendant allegedly committed against Jessica\n(which questioning the trial justice characterized as “totally improper”); and (2) that, in denying\ndefendant’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice overlooked and misconceived material\nevidence and inappropriately relied on Yvonne’s emotional response to the prosecutor’s\nquestioning on redirect examination, which he had instructed the jury not to consider.', 'III', 'Analysis', 'A', 'The Motion to Pass the Case', '1.

Accordingly, it is defendant’s contention that\nthe trial justice recognized that the questioning was improper and prejudicial and therefore, that,\nhe abused his discretion in not granting defendant’s motion to pass the case.', 'In response, the state, “for its part, stands by the argument that the defendant opened the\ndoor to the prosecutor’s line of inquiry when, on cross-examination, counsel pressed [Yvonne]\nabout her daughter’s failure to inform her mother of [defendant’s] conduct in explicit sordid\ndetail * * * .” The state adds that it “respectfully disagrees with the trial justice’s determination\nthat this line of questioning by the prosecutor was improper.” According to the state, the\ndefendant cannot “justifiably complain that the prosecutor questioned [Yvonne] on re-direct\nexamination concerning the very same information his counsel pressed that witness about on\ncross-examination.” (Emphasis in original.) The state avers that defendant “made an issue out\nof [Jessica’s] reluctance to disclose to [Yvonne] the specific details of [defendant’s] conduct”\nand, consequently, “when [defendant] claimed that [Jessica’s] silence on the matter of the sexual\nabuse was evidence of fabrication, it became the State’s job to provide the jury with an\nexplanation for her hesitancy to confide such sordid information to her mother.” The state\nfurther contends that any prejudice which may have resulted from the questioning at issue was\ncured by the trial justice’s curative instruction to the jury.', '- 14 -', 'A trial justice, in considering a motion to pass a case, “must determine whether the\nevidence would cause the jurors to be so inflamed as to make them unable to decide the case on\nthe basis of the evidence presented.” State v. Oliveira, 882 A.2d 1097, 1127 (R.I. 2005). “If the\nprejudice is inexpiable, the motion to pass should be granted.

Since the\ntrial justice decided to “utilize a cautionary instruction” in the instant case, “the question before\nus is whether [the trial justice’s] instruction can be fairly said to have removed from [the jurors’\nminds], when weighing the evidence properly before them, the taint represented” by Yvonne’s\nemotional response to the prosecutor’s questions on redirect examination, which questions\nprovided her, for the first time, with the specific details of the assaults to which her daughter was\nsubjected.

In spite of defendant’s contention that any\nprejudice in the instant case was “demonstrably uncurable,” we can perceive nothing in the\nrecord that indicates that any taint which might have existed was not cured by the trial justice’s\ncurative instruction; we likewise can perceive nothing in the record that indicates that the jury\nchose to disregard the trial justice’s curative instruction.

He even reminded the jury that the case rose and fell “on the testimony\nof the young complaining witness.” The trial justice also gave the instruction in a timely\nmanner, immediately after the questioning at issue. See Hoyle, 122 R.I. at 48, 404 A.2d at 71.\nMoreover, we note that, despite Yvonne’s emotional response to the questioning on redirect\nexamination, the jury nonetheless found defendant not guilty on twelve out of the fourteen\ncounts against him.

First, he considered the evidence in light of the jury\ncharge; the trial justice addressed with specificity the multiple incidents of sexual assault alleged\nby Jessica, and he noted that Adriana’s testimony “corroborated” Jessica’s testimony. He further\nconsidered Yvonne’s testimony with respect to the fact that she installed a lock on Jessica and\nAdriana’s bedroom, and he stated that “the inference was she was somewhat suspicious of\ndefendant as the girls got older * * * .” In ruling on defendant’s motion for a new trial, the trial\njustice considered the testimony of every witness who testified at trial. He also commented on\nthe evidence in light of the jury charge on sexual assault.

After explicitly recognizing that he had to conduct his own independent\nreview of the evidence, the trial justice discussed Jessica’s testimony. He began by noting that\nshe was “very unemotional” and “fairly monotone;” but he added that he did not find that', '- 20 -\n“totally unusual in cases like [the one before him].” He noted that, when Jessica testified\nregarding the assault for which defendant was convicted, she stated that she had her eyes closed\nbut that she had felt “rough hands;” the trial justice added that a “reasonable inference” could be\ndrawn from that testimony that defendant “perpetrated these crimes against her,” because “[h]e\nwas the only adult in the building, living there” and Jessica “knew he was living there” and “had\nrough hands.” The trial justice concluded that Jessica was a “credible witness” and stated:', '“I thought that her testimony, while delivered in a monotone, flat', 'manner, was as a result of her embarrassment of having to live', 'through the motion, [sic] live through the emotion of telling the', 'story again that had happened so long ago, that she could look at it', 'perhaps from a distance now as a young woman and just relate', 'what she remembered from the facts.”\nThe trial justice proceeded to find Adriana to be “credible” and Yvonne to be “extremely\ncredible.” We note that the mere fact that defendant might disagree with the trial justice’s\ndetermination that each of the witnesses at trial was credible does not require the trial justice to\ngrant defendant’s motion for a new trial. See id. at 418 (“This Court has repeatedly stated that\n[t]he mere fact that [a] defendant disagrees with the trial justice’s conclusions about credibility is\nnot a sufficient basis to warrant the granting of a motion for new trial.”) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted); see also Gonzalez, 56 A.3d at 103.', 'With relation to the third step in his analysis, the trial justice remarked that he was\n“surprised” by the verdict.

Consequently,\nwe are satisfied that the trial justice properly took into account the fact that the verdicts in this\ncase could be characterized as inconsistent.', 'Finally, defendant takes issue with the trial justice’s reference to Yvonne’s emotional\nresponse to the questions regarding the specifics of Jessica’s sexual assault.', 'In denying\ndefendant’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice stated: “I thought the mother was extremely\ncredible particularly after she was made aware of what the nature of the allegations was which\napparently heretofore [she] had not been aware of.”', 'While it is true that the trial justice\ninstructed the jury not to let sympathy affect their assessment of Yvonne’s testimony, he did not\ninstruct the jury to utterly disregard her reaction. He expressly stated:', '“I’m not going to do anything other than caution you not to allow', '[the line of questioning on redirect examination] to enter into your', '- 22 -', 'deliberations with regard to overt sympathy. You may take this', 'witness’s testimony and weigh it and sift as you would anyone', 'else * * * .”\nIn our view, in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial, it would have been preferable for the\ntrial justice to pass over in silence Yvonne’s emotional breakdown on the witness stand; but\nthere is nothing in the trial justice’s comments that would suggest that he was doing what he\ninstructed the jury not to do—namely, letting sympathy affect his determination of Yvonne’s\ncredibility. Therefore, we consider defendant’s contention that it was error for the trial justice to\nmention Yvonne’s emotional response in denying his motion for a new trial to be unavailing.', 'Accordingly, in our judgment, the trial justice did not misconceive or overlook material\ntestimony and did not otherwise commit clear error in denying the defendant’s motion for a new\ntrial.5\n5', 'The defendant also raises a challenge to the trial justice’s denial of his motion for a\njudgment of acquittal, which he made at the close of the prosecution’s case and at the close of all\nthe evidence.

On the night of May 6, 2009, three men savagely\nattacked and robbed Cesar Lopez (Lopez or complainant), who had unwittingly arrived at an\nabandoned house to deliver pizza. The attackers made off with about $20. Several days later, a\nchance encounter with one of the robbers led to his arrest, and that perpetrator implicated the\ndefendant, Markus Matthews (defendant), in this brutal crime. The defendant was tried and\nconvicted by a jury of a single count of first-degree robbery. He now appeals that conviction,\nassigning an array of errors to the trial court. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the\nconviction.', 'Facts and Travel', 'Cesar Lopez was employed by Domino’s Pizza (Domino’s) as a pizza delivery-person.\nOn May 6, 2009, he drove to 54 Lynch Street in Providence to make a delivery. Upon arriving at\nthat address, Lopez called the phone number associated with the order, and the voice on the other\nend told him to “go through the back door.” Although something about the situation appeared\namiss, particularly because the house was dark, Lopez attempted to fulfill the delivery.', '-1-', 'As Lopez exited his vehicle, he was struck from behind with “a piece of tubing.”1 As a\nsecond attacker grabbed him, he heard someone say “bring him into the house.” While Lopez\nwas being moved toward the house, there was one man in front, wearing a blue and white\nbandana over his nose, and another assailant behind him, with his arm around Lopez’s neck.\nWhen Lopez tried to turn around, the choke-hold tightened, almost to the point of strangulation.\nLopez briefly was able to free himself, but was then struck on the leg with the pipe and dragged\nup the driveway toward the house.', 'As the attackers moved Lopez toward the house, the beating continued. According to\nLopez, there were three assailants: one with the pipe and two men pummeling with their fists.\nLopez testified that he was struck with the pipe on the head and left eye. Approximately $20\nwas taken from his pocket. As the attackers wrestled him toward the back door of the house, he\nwas able to grab onto the handrail; the attackers repeatedly hit him in an effort to make him let\ngo of the railing. At that point, Lopez fought back. The assailants grabbed his uniform shirt; he\nslipped out of it and escaped to his car. The assailants were left holding the shirt. After Lopez\nreached the street, the attackers retreated and, despite his injuries—one eye was completely\nclosed—he was able to drive back to Domino’s. When he arrived, he sounded the horn, exited\nthe car, and collapsed. Lopez’s co-workers helped him up and called 911. Lopez continues to\nhave problems with his eyesight and suffers from headaches.', 'On May 10, 2009, Lopez visited Domino’s in order to return some items belonging to the\nstore, including his uniform and pizza bag. While driving there with his wife, Lopez saw one of\nhis attackers who was loitering on the street. According to Lopez, when the attacker saw him, he\n“started doing some suspicious things,” such as backing up so that Lopez could not see him.\n1', 'It appears from the testimony that the “tubing” was a metal pipe.', '-2-\nAfter his wife called the police, they decided to circle the block; when the alleged attacker saw\nthe car again, he went into a driveway and came out onto another street. Lopez directed his wife\nto drive to another street, where he expected the attacker to appear. Upon seeing Lopez again,\nthe assailant started running with Lopez in pursuit.', 'After a foot chase, Lopez caught the\nattacker—Michael Long—and held him until the police arrived.', 'The police arrested Long for the May 6, 2009 robbery and proceeded to interview him.\nLong initially denied any involvement in the crime, but eventually confessed, and in so doing, he\nimplicated defendant.2 Based on statements made by Long, defendant was apprehended. Long\nlater pled nolo contendere to charges of robbery and conspiracy to rob.', 'At trial in this case, the complainant testified about the attack, noting that he could not\nrecall the exact time that he left to deliver the pizza, but that it was after 10 p.m.3 He also\ntestified about the circumstances that led to Long’s arrest. The state also called Long to testify;\nhowever, he professed to have no memory of the events, notwithstanding his confession and\nsubsequent plea. Jeannine Labossiere, Michael Long’s former fiancée and the mother of his\nchild, also testified at trial, and her memory was intact. She testified that, at about 10:30 p.m. on\nMay 6, 2009, Long borrowed her cell phone and left her apartment. Labossiere testified that he\nwas gone until about 1 a.m. when he returned to her house, accompanied by defendant. She\ntestified that after some prodding, Long disclosed the beating and robbery of a Domino’s\ndelivery-person, as defendant stood silent. The defendant neither contested nor denied Long’s\nrecital of the events of the evening. Labossiere also testified that her cell phone number matched\n2', 'Long implicated defendant in both versions that he gave to police, including when he denied\nhis own involvement. Long also implicated a third man referred to as “Knowledge” in his\nrecorded statement.\n3', 'The owner of the Domino’s Pizza testified that his establishment’s tracking system indicated\nthat the call came in at 11:17 p.m.', '-3-\nthe one used to call Domino’s on May 6, 2009. Because the testimony of both Long and\nLabossiere are central to the issues in this case, we elaborate upon their testimony in the\ndiscussion below.', 'The defendant testified in his own defense and denied any involvement in this crime. He\nclaimed that he was not at 54 Lynch Street on the night of May 6, 2009, having left Labossiere’s\nhouse at about 9:30 p.m., arriving home a little after 10 p.m. The defendant’s mother also\ntestified, corroborating her son’s alibi. The jury was unconvinced.', 'The trial justice instructed the jury that they were to consider three charges against\ndefendant. The trial justice told the jury that defendant was charged with first-degree robbery,\nbut that it was alleged to have been committed under two different theories: “The first theory is\nthat [defendant did] rob Cesar Lopez by use of a dangerous weapon. The second, or alternative,\ntheory is he did rob Cesar Lopez and Cesar Lopez was, in fact, injured.” Later, the trial justice\ntold the jury,', '“There’s only one robbery being charged but two factual elements', 'that are different from each count. One is the dangerous weapon;', 'one is the injury. You make separate decisions for each one. But', 'they clearly are one count, one charge of the robbery. He’s not', 'being charged with two separate counts of robbery.”\nAdditionally, defendant was charged with conspiracy to rob.', 'The jury returned verdicts of not guilty on first-degree robbery by means of a dangerous\nweapon and the conspiracy count. The defendant, however, was found guilty of first-degree\nrobbery resulting in injury. The defendant’s motion for a new trial was denied by the trial\njustice, who subsequently sentenced defendant to twenty years at the Adult Correctional\nInstitutions, with nine years to serve and the remaining eleven years suspended with probation.', '-4-', 'Analysis', 'I', 'Double Jeopardy', 'Count 1 of the indictment charged that defendant “on or about 6th day of May, 2009, in\nthe City of Providence, in the County of Providence, did rob Ceasar Lopez by use of a dangerous\nweapon * * * .” Similarly, count 2 of the indictment charged that defendant “on or about 6th day\nof May, 2009, in the City of Providence, in the County of Providence, did rob Ceasar Lopez\ncausing him to be injured * * * .” The defendant argues that his conviction for first-degree\nrobbery must be vacated because “[c]harging one robbery as two crimes and permitting the jury\nto deliberate twice on one robbery violated double jeopardy principles.”', 'Rule 12(b)(2) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that “[t]he\ndefense of double jeopardy * * * may be raised only by motion before trial.” (Emphasis added.)\n“[A] defendant’s failure to raise such a motion before trial precludes that defendant from\nthereafter raising a double jeopardy challenge.” State v. Day, 925 A.2d 962, 977 (R.I. 2007)\n(citing State v. Feliciano, 901 A.2d 631, 647 (R.I. 2006)). In this case, defendant did not comply\nwith the provisions of Rule 12(b)(2) and, therefore, has waived this argument.', 'Nonetheless, we deem it appropriate to address two important issues. First, were this\nissue properly before the Court, we would affirm defendant’s conviction because we are satisfied\nthat defendant’s double jeopardy contentions are without merit. The principal evil against which\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause protects—multiple criminal punishments for the same offense—is\nnot implicated in this case because defendant stands convicted of (and punished for) a single\noffense. See Hudson v. United States, 522 U.S. 93, 99 (1997) (“The [Double Jeopardy] Clause\nprotects only against the imposition of multiple criminal punishments for the same offense', '-5-\n* * * .”) (emphasis omitted); see also 1A Charles Alan Wright & Andrew D. Leipold, Federal\nPractice and Procedure: Criminal § 142 at 11-12 (4th ed. 2008) (“It remains permissible to\ncharge a single offense in several counts (although not to convict and punish on more than one\nfor a single crime) * * *.”). Additionally, this Court has noted that “it would be impermissible to\ncharge a defendant with murder in the second degree and, subsequent to disposition of the\ncharge, then charge him or her with first-degree murder,” but that “[t]rial of lesser-included\noffenses contemporaneously with the trial for the greater offense does not violate principles of\ndouble jeopardy.” State v. Grabowski, 644 A.2d 1282, 1286 (R.I. 1994). Although the two\nseparate factual predicates for first-degree robbery here do not constitute a primary and a lesser-\nincluded offense, the same principle nonetheless applies because they are alternative theories of\nguilt. Furthermore, the trial justice’s instruction to the jury mollified the risk that the indictment\nwould result in unconstitutional multiple punishment. The trial justice instructed the jury that the\nindictment alleged two different theories of robbery, and, later in the instruction, she stated that\nthe two robbery charges “clearly are one count, one charge of robbery. He’s not being charged\nwith two separate counts of robbery.”', 'The defendant argues that in accordance with our decision in State v. Bolarinho, 850\nA.2d 907 (R.I. 2004), this Court must vacate defendant’s conviction. We agree that the issues\npresented in Bolarinho are similar, but we disagree that our holding compels the remedy sought\nby defendant. In Bolarinho, 850 A.2d at 908-09, the defendant was convicted of two offenses—\nfelony assault resulting in serious bodily injury and felony assault by means of a dangerous\nweapon, a shod foot. It was clear, however, that both crimes arose from the same assault. Id. at\n911. This error was remedied by our decision that vacated the conviction on count 1—assault\nresulting in serious bodily injury. Id. We did not vacate both convictions and order a new trial.', '-6-\nSee id. Here, defendant contends that the Bolarinho remedy cannot be invoked because the jury\nfound him not guilty on count 1; and that, therefore, the Court must vacate the conviction and\norder a new trial because defendant “cannot be both innocent and guilty of the same crime.” We\nreject this argument. In this case, defendant was found guilty, beyond a reasonable doubt, of the\noffense of first-degree robbery that resulted in injury. The jury was not satisfied that the state\nhad proven robbery by means of a dangerous weapon. Simply because the jury rejected this\ntheory of robbery, that fact does not impact the Double Jeopardy Clause. Because there was a\nsingle conviction in this case, there is no double jeopardy violation for us to remedy. See id.\nAdditionally, we are not confronted with inconsistent verdicts. Because the prosecution had two\ntheories of robbery, the jury could have concluded that both theories were proven beyond a\nreasonable doubt, or that defendant robbed Lopez causing bodily injury, but the state did not\nprove that defendant used a dangerous weapon in the process. Nevertheless, a conviction of a\nsingle count of first-degree robbery would result.', 'Second, we provide guidance to the trial court and its practitioners in order to avoid\nconfusion when a single offense is charged under multiple theories. Initially, we note that a bill\nof particulars is designed to cure any potential problems with the indictment in the early stage of\na prosecution; however, defendant did not file for a bill of particulars in this case. Contrast\nPierce v. Wall, 941 A.2d 189, 194 (R.I. 2008) (“The record discloses that a bill of particulars was\nfiled in this case that made clear that a single act was charged in each of the seven counts.”).\nFurthermore, although a permissible practice, charging defendant with two separate counts of\nfirst-degree robbery is not the ideal manner in which to draft an indictment. The preferable\nmanner is to charge a single offense as one count, setting forth multiple theories that may be\nalleged. See Sanabria v. United States, 437 U.S. 54, 66 n.20 (1978) (“A single offense should', '-7-\nnormally be charged in one count rather than several, even if different means of committing the\noffense are alleged.”).', 'General Laws 1956 § 12-12-1.4 provides in pertinent part, “An\nindictment, information, or complaint shall be a plain, concise, and definite written statement of\nthe offense charged.” Nothing in this section precludes the assertion of multiple theories in a\nsingle count. Additionally, Rule 7(c) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure permits\nsuch a procedure: “It may be alleged in a single count that the means by which the defendant\ncommitted the offense are unknown or that he [or she] committed it by one or more specified\nmeans.” (Emphasis added.) Although it may be constitutionally permissible to charge a single\noffense in several counts, we reiterate that “the rules are intended to discourage that practice.”\nWright and Leipold, § 142 at 12 (discussing identical federal rule). As the Eighth Circuit\nrecently stated:', '“[W]here a ‘statute specifies two or more ways in which one', 'offense may be committed, all may be alleged in the conjunctive in', 'one count of the indictment, and proof of any one of the methods', 'will sustain a conviction.’ * * * This method of procedure would', 'adequately inform the defendant of each allegation that he must', 'defend against while solving any potential multiplicity problems.”', 'United States v. Roy, 408 F.3d 484, 492 n.4 (8th Cir. 2005)', '(quoting Gerberding v. United States, 471 F.2d 55, 59 (8th Cir.', '1973) (emphasis added)).\nUltimately, when confronted with a single offense in an indictment from which a jury could\nconclude that the offense was committed under one or more theories, it is the trial justice’s\nresponsibility—through instructions to the jury and a carefully drafted verdict form—to ensure\nthat a defendant stands convicted, if at all, of a single offense.', 'An indictment or criminal information that charges one offense having been committed\nby multiple means is a fair solution for both the state and the defendant. It lessens, or eliminates,\nany potential double jeopardy concerns, because it ensures that the accused is charged with a\nsingle offense, and thus, can only be convicted and sentenced on a single count. It also addresses', '-8-\nduplicity issues because the jury would have to state which theory or theories were proven\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.4 Requiring a jury to deliberate on each factual predicate alleged in\nthe charging document is also fair to the state because it permits the jury to find that the state\nproved multiple theories, but only one offense—a practice that permits a complete examination\nof the sufficiency of the evidence in the event that there is a motion for a new trial.', 'II', 'Admission of Michael Long’s Recorded Statement', 'The defendant wages a multi-pronged attack against the use at trial of Michael Long’s\nstatement to police following his arrest. As noted, when he testified during the state’s case-in-\nchief, Long suffered from the ubiquitous failure of memory of a confessing codefendant. Long\nadmitted that he participated in the robbery of a pizza delivery-person on May 6, 2009, and that\nhe was serving a sentence at the Adult Correctional Institutions for that crime. However, he\nclaimed to remember almost nothing else about that night or his arrest on May 10, 2009. The\nprosecutor attempted to refresh Long’s recollection by showing him the statement that he gave to\npolice after he was arrested; this proved futile because Long repeatedly denied that his\nrecollection was refreshed. Long not only professed a failure of memory about the statement, he\nrefused to acknowledge his own voice on the tape recording. When confronted with defendant’s\nphotograph—the one he identified when he was arrested—Long recognized defendant as the\nperson in the photograph; however, he denied that it was his signature below the picture, despite\nacknowledging that the name looked like “Michael Long” and the date was “5/10/09.” When the\n4', '“The term ‘duplicity’ refers to the joining of two or more offenses, however numerous, in a\nsingle count of an indictment.” State v. Saluter, 715 A.2d 1250, 1253 (R.I. 1998). The problem\nwith duplicity is that “a guilty verdict on a duplicitous indictment does not indicate whether the\njury found defendant guilty without having reached [a] unanimous verdict on the commission of\na particular offense.” Id. (quoting United States v. Murray, 618 F.2d 892, 896 (2d Cir. 1980)).', '-9-\nprosecutor asked Long whether he remembered the interrogation at the Providence police station,\nLong responded, “I don’t know what happened five minutes ago.”', 'In the face of Long’s recalcitrance and refusal to acknowledge that his recollection was\nrefreshed in any way, the prosecutor began asking specific leading questions about Long’s\nstatement to police. At this point, defense counsel raised an objection to “the further continuance\nof [the prosecutor’s] line of questioning” and argued at sidebar that Long’s statements did not\nqualify as prior inconsistent statements. The trial justice, however, analogized this case to two\nprior opinions of this Court5 and stated, “I think that I am going to make a finding that at the\nappropriate time it’s a prior inconsistent statement.”6 The prosecutor continued asking specific\nleading questions after Long continued to claim that his recollection had not been refreshed.\nThese questions included statements by Long that he punched the complainant and that\ndefendant hit him with a lead pipe. Later, during the testimony of a Providence police detective,\nthe recording of the interview was admitted as a full exhibit and played for the jury.7', 'The defendant raises issues under the Rules of Evidence, the Confrontation Clause, and\nthe Due Process Clause. His primary argument is that Long’s statements were inadmissible\nhearsay and violative of the Confrontation Clause. Although defendant contends that “[t]he\narguments against admissibility are the same under [Rule 801(d)(1)(A) of the Rhode Island\nRules of Evidence] and the Confrontation Clause,” such is not the case. See Crawford v.\n5', 'We discuss these cases below; they are State v. McManus, 990 A.2d 1229 (R.I. 2010) and State\nv.

We conclude that\nthe trial justice did not abuse her discretion in doing so.', 'We have addressed nearly identical situations in two previous opinions. In State v.\nJaiman, 850 A.2d 984, 986 (R.I. 2004), a key witness “suffered a convenient failure of memory,\ndeclaring over and over again, especially at critical points about details of [a] drive-by shooting,\nthat he had difficulty remembering the events of [the evening of the shooting].” At trial, the state\nintroduced portions of the witness’s police statement, and, on appeal, the defendant argued that\nthe statement should not have been admitted under Rule 801(d)(1)(A).

Here, Long similarly professed a lack of memory regarding almost all of the facts\nsalient to the robbery and his subsequent arrest, including his own signature and the sound of his\nvoice. Thus, it was permissible for the prosecutor to question him about the details of his\nstatement to police in an attempt to refresh his recollection and for the trial justice to admit the\nrecording. It was for the jury to determine whether Long’s refusal to admit his recollection was\nrefreshed was in fact a denial of the prior statement and therefore, a prior inconsistent statement\nof a testifying witness.

The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides: “In all criminal\nprosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right * * * to be confronted with the witnesses against\nhim * * *.” Although not articulated with perfect clarity, defendant’s Confrontation Clause\nargument seems to suggest that, despite his physical presence on the witness stand, Long was\nunavailable for cross-examination because of his professed lack of memory.', 'The seminal case in modern Confrontation Clause jurisprudence is Crawford v.\nWashington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004).', 'In Crawford, the Supreme Court recognized that the\nConfrontation Clause provides a procedural, rather than substantive, guarantee that evidence be\ntested by cross-examination:', '“[T]he [Confrontation] Clause’s ultimate goal is to ensure', 'reliability of evidence, but it is a procedural rather than a', 'substantive guarantee.

The Supreme Court held that the\ndefendant’s inability to cross-examine the witness regarding the confession denied the defendant\nhis right of cross-examination under the Confrontation Clause. Id. at 419. Here, Long did not\nrefuse to testify based on any Fifth Amendment privilege; rather, he testified that he had no\nmemory about the statement but was, in fact, available for cross-examination. Although his\nresponses were not particularly helpful, they were substantive in that he stated that he did not\nremember making the statement and did not recognize the sound of his own voice or his\nsignature; Long did not deny making the statement to police. Further, on cross-examination,\ndefense counsel asked a number of questions about the circumstances surrounding Long’s\nstatement, and Long answered those questions.8', 'Thus, we cannot say that Long was not\navailable for cross-examination as is a witness who claims a privilege against self-incrimination\nand refuses to answer any questions at all.', 'The defendant also cites Lee v. Illinois, 476 U.S. 530 (1986), to support his\nConfrontation Clause argument. Because the reasoning of Lee is fundamentally at odds with the\nreasoning of Crawford, its continued viability is dubious. Compare Crawford, 541 U.S. at 63\n(rejecting an “indicia of reliability” framework as “so unpredictable that it fails to provide\nmeaningful protection from even core confrontation violations”) with Lee, 476 U.S. at 539\n8', 'For example, when shown the rights form that he signed, Long acknowledged that he signed\nthe form at 6:12 p.m.; when shown the transcript of the recorded statement, Long acknowledged\nthat it did not start until 6:52 p.m. Defense counsel then asked a number of questions about what\nhappened in the time between the signing of the rights form and the start of the recording. Long\nresponded that he did not remember having a conversation with the police officers before they\nturned the recorder on, but that they “said something about the robbery.”', '- 14 -\n(holding that the witness’s statement was “presumptively unreliable and that it did not bear\nsufficient independent ‘indicia of reliability’ to overcome that presumption”); see also State v.\nMoten, 64 A.3d 1232, 1240 (R.I. 2013) (noting that Crawford definitively abrogated the “indicia\nof reliability” framework as announced in Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56 (1980)). Regardless of\nthe legal reasoning, the facts of Lee are inapplicable here because the confessing codefendant\nwitness in Lee never took the stand. See Lee, 476 U.S. at 536.', 'Accordingly, we are satisfied that the use of Long’s prior police statements as prior\ninconsistent statements did not violate the Confrontation Clause. See Crawford, 541 U.S. at 60\nn.9; see also Jaiman, 850 A.2d at 989 (“[T]he Confrontation Clause ‘guarantees only an\nopportunity for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever\nway, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.’”).', 'C', 'Remaining Arguments', 'The defendant also contends that the leading questions that the prosecutor was permitted\nto ask Long were prejudicial. When reviewing leading questions posed to another witness\nsuffering from jailhouse amnesia, this Court declared,', '“Although leading questions generally are prohibited on direct', 'examination, they may be allowed for a limited purpose such as to', 'guide the testimony of a hostile or a purportedly forgetful witness.', '“Here, it is clear that [the witness’s] appearance at trial was', 'anything but cooperative; he experienced a failure of memory that', 'could be characterized as hostile and lacking in credibility. A', 'party is entitled to treat a forgetful witness as adverse; and, in an', 'effort to elicit truthful testimony from the witness, the examiner', 'may resort to leading questions. It is within the discretion of the', 'trial justice to decide whether to allow the examiner to lead; that', 'discretion, however, is not without limit.” McManus, 990 A.2d at', '1236.', '- 15 -\nAlthough in McManus, the trial justice came “dangerously close to a prejudicial abuse of\ndiscretion,” we deemed any error to have been harmless “in light of our decision upholding the\nintroduction of [the witness’s] statement to the police.” Id. In this case, we are of the opinion\nthat error, if any, arising from the use of leading questions by the state was harmless based on\nour conclusion that Long’s police statement was admissible as a prior inconsistent statement.\nThis holding simply recognizes the difficulty inherent in attempting to refresh the recollection of\nan unwilling witness without resort to leading questions. This is a decision left to the discretion\nof the trial justice.', 'The defendant also argued that his due process rights were violated because Long’s\nstatement was obtained without counsel and was the product of coercion.', 'This argument,\nhowever, was not raised to the trial justice below. Therefore, it was waived. See State v. Bido,\n941 A.2d 822, 828-29 (R.I. 2008) (“It is well settled that a litigant cannot raise an objection or\nadvance a new theory on appeal if it was not raised before the trial court.”).', 'III', 'Admission of Jeannine Labossiere’s Testimony as an Adoptive Admission', 'The defendant argues that Long’s statements to Labossiere should not have been admitted\nas adoptive admissions by defendant. At trial, Labossiere testified that Long and defendant came\nto her house at 1 a.m. on May 7, 2009. She noticed that defendant was limping and that Long\nhad a bandana wrapped around his hand; thus, she sensed that something was amiss. After she\nrepeatedly asked them what happened, Long admitted that “they robbed a Domino delivery guy.”\nAccording to Labossiere, defendant “looked a little mad that Long said something” to her, but he\nremained silent. Long then provided additional details about the crime, including that he gave\nLabossiere’s cell phone to defendant so that defendant could call Domino’s and place an order', '- 16 -\nfor delivery to an abandoned house. Long disclosed that, when Lopez approached the house,\ndefendant grabbed him and put him in a choke-hold. At that point, it was defendant who\ndemonstrated the choke-hold to Labossiere. She also testified that Long described Lopez as\nbadly beaten and that he got away a couple of times such that defendant had to put him back in\nthe choke-hold. Shocked at these revelations, Labossiere said to them, “What the hell did you\nguys do?” She testified that defendant responded, “We just told you what we did.” (Emphasis\nadded.) When she inquired about the fruits of the robbery, defendant told Labossiere that he\nbought her a pack of cigarettes and produced about $15 in cash.', 'A trial justice’s evidentiary rulings are reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard.\nMcManus, 990 A.2d at 1234. Rule 801(d)(2)(B) provides that “[a] statement is not hearsay if\n* * *[t]he statement is offered against a party and is * * * a statement of which the party has\nmanifested his or her adoption or belief in its truth[.]”', 'It is well settled that “silence is\nsometimes sufficient to signify adoption.”', 'Day, 925 A.2d at 983.', 'Where an accusatory\nstatement was made within hearing distance of an accused and the accused did not respond to the\naccusation, this Court has pointed to five factors to consider in deciding whether a purported\nadoptive admission results:', '“(1) whether the statement was incriminating or accusatory; (2)', 'whether it was one to which an innocent person in the defendant’s', 'situation would respond; (3) whether the statement was made', 'within the presence and hearing range of the defendant; (4)', 'whether it was understood by the defendant; and (5) whether the', 'statement was one to which the defendant had an opportunity to', 'respond.” Id.', 'We are satisfied that this case represents a use of classic adoptive admissions. Long\nimplicated defendant in a robbery; thus, the statement was clearly incriminating. Furthermore,\nan innocent person would certainly respond to such a direct suggestion of robbery. Labossiere\nalso testified that Long and defendant were standing side-by-side—clearly within hearing range.', '- 17 -\nThe fact that defendant looked annoyed by Long’s initial disclosure of the robbery and later\ndemonstrated the choke-hold he applied to subdue Lopez establish that he not only understood\nthe statements, but that he also had an opportunity to respond; additionally, evidence that\ndefendant demonstrated the choke-hold is an admission by conduct. If defendant’s silence\nduring Long’s initial disclosure was not enough to establish an adoptive admission, defendant\nlater affirmed his participation in the robbery by telling Labossiere, “[w]e just told you what we\ndid.” Accordingly, the trial justice did not err by admitting Long’s statements to Labossiere in\nthe presence of defendant as adoptive admissions.', 'IV', 'Denial of Defendant’s Motion for a New Trial', 'The defendant contends that the trial justice erred by denying his motion for a new trial.\n“When ruling on a motion for a new trial, the trial justice acts as a thirteenth juror, exercising\n‘independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.’” State\nv.

Imbruglia, 913 A.2d 1022, 1028 (R.I.\n2007)). “Specifically, ‘the trial justice must (1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge,\n(2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then\n(3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the\njury.’” Id.

She\nmade credibility determinations as to the key witnesses; specifically, she found that Lopez and\nLabossiere were credible and that the defendant, his mother, and Long were not credible\nwitnesses. Ultimately, the trial justice agreed with the jury’s verdict and denied the motion for a\nnew trial. Primarily, the defendant seizes upon the trial justice’s apparent misstatement that it\nwas the defendant who told Labossiere that he and Long had robbed a Domino’s delivery-\nperson. While the defendant is correct—the record discloses that it was Long who made the\ndisclosure—this error is immaterial to the decision denying the defendant’s motion for a new\ntrial. Although the defendant did not directly declare, “we robbed a Domino’s delivery guy,” his\nsilence and demonstrative conduct permit the factfinder to draw an inference that the defendant\nadopted that statement. Furthermore, as noted by the trial justice, the defendant demonstrated his\nchoke-hold for Labossiere and also responded to her question by saying, “We just told you what\nwe did.” Therefore, the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive material evidence relating\nto a critical issue in this case.

The defendant, Jody Johnson, was found guilty by\na jury of first-degree robbery, conspiracy to commit first-degree robbery, and assault with a\ndangerous weapon in a dwelling house with intent to commit robbery. We granted his petition\nfor writ of certiorari requesting direct review of his convictions.1 He argues that the trial justice\nerred by denying his motion for new trial because, according to the defendant, the jury’s verdict\nwas against the weight of the evidence. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an\norder directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should\nnot be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and\nreviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be\ndecided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm\nthe judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On April 10, 2015, defendant was charged by indictment with one count of conspiracy to\ncommit first-degree robbery, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-1-6; one count of first-degree\n1', 'The defendant did not file a timely notice of appeal.', '-1-\nrobbery, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-39-1(a); and one count of assault with a firearm in a\ndwelling house with intent to commit robbery, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-4.2', 'The\ndefendant was tried before a jury over four consecutive days in January 2017 in the Providence\nCounty Superior Court. The state presented testimony from two individuals: the complaining\nwitness, Mary Celletti, and a Providence police detective, Matthew Cute, who responded to\nCelletti’s home and was subsequently involved in the investigation.', 'Mary Celletti testified that, on the evening of January 28, 2014, she was home alone and\ngetting ready to watch “the presidential address” when she realized, either through a knock at the\ndoor or a ring of the doorbell, that someone was outside and wanted to come in. Before opening\nthe door, Celletti asked who was outside and heard “I’m locked out of the house” from an\nunfamiliar voice who also told her his mother was not at home. Celletti “opened the door a\ncrack” and saw a boy around the age of ten or eleven standing there. She asked him if he wanted\nto use her phone and opened the door to allow him to enter. After he walked into her house, she\ntried to close the door but the door pushed back open and a “tall, muscular man” with black skin,\na dark blue jacket, a hood, a scarf, and glasses appeared in the doorway and asked her what she\nwas doing with his son. As she answered that she thought the boy was locked out of his house\nand she was allowing him to use her phone, the man pulled out a gun with a “dirty silver barrel”\nand brown handle and pointed it at her face. Celletti observed that the man’s glasses were dark\ngray with Scotch tape on one side holding the arm to the front frame of the lenses. The man\n2', 'The defendant was also charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor, in violation of\nG.L. 1956 § 11-9-4, but the state dismissed this charge pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the Superior\nCourt Rules of Criminal Procedure after trial when it realized—during the sentencing phase of\nthe case—that, pursuant to § 11-9-9, the Family Court has exclusive jurisdiction over charges\nbrought under § 11-9-4.', '-2-\ninstructed Celletti to go sit down, and she sat down on her bed, located in an open alcove\nadjacent to the kitchen.', 'Celletti testified that the man asked her who else lived in her home; when she replied that\nher son lived there but was at his girlfriend’s house that evening, the man asked where the son’s\nbedroom was located and said that he was there to collect money the son owed him. The man\nthen took off his scarf and his jacket, hung the jacket on the back of a kitchen chair, and pulled\ndown the hood of his sweatshirt, uncovering his head. He made a phone call and Celletti heard a\nthird person enter her house from the same door through which the boy and the man had come.\nThe man handed the gun to the boy and instructed him to sit in a chair across from Celletti. The\nboy held the gun on her while the man disappeared from view and spoke with the third person\nwho had entered her home. Celletti testified that she never saw the third person’s face, but that\nshe concluded this person was female from the timbre of the voice. Celletti described the third\nperson as tall and thin, wearing a red hoodie, with the hood up for the entire duration of the\nincident.', 'Celletti testified that she engaged the boy in conversation and told him about herself “to\nhumanize [her]self with [him]” and to try to find out who he was. She learned his name and the\nname of his school. When the boy wanted a drink, Celletti gave him a can of Diet Coke. She\nasked him if he had ever held a gun before and if he thought they were going to kill her.', 'Celletti testified that she saw her son’s mattress and boxspring being lifted up as well as\nthings in her bedroom torn up; she also heard her computer being moved, her pocketbook being\ndumped out, her television being turned off, unplugged, and carried out, as well as the movement\nof other televisions in her home. Celletti also stated that the people who entered her home left\nwith bags from her basement, her cell phone, her home phone, bottles of red wine, coin', '-3-\ncollections, CDs and DVDs, her son’s wedding band, and cash, among other things. Before the\ngroup of intruders left, the man took the gun from the boy, used a bra from Celletti’s dirty\nclothes hamper to wipe the gun off, and, on his way out the door, said: “If you call the cops, I’m\ncoming back.”', 'A few moments later, Celletti saw the man’s jacket on the back of her kitchen chair,\ncalled out to him, and gave the jacket to him. After realizing that both her cell phone and her\nhome phone had been taken, she found an old cell phone with just enough battery charge to make\na call to her daughter and screamed that she had just been “robbed at gunpoint.” Her daughter\nsoon arrived at the house, which shortly thereafter was “swamped with police from Johnston and\nProvidence.”', 'Both Celletti and Det. Cute testified that, a few days after the incident, the detective\nbrought a yearbook from the boy’s school over to Celletti’s house and Celletti was able to\nidentify the boy who had been in her house the night of the incident. Both witnesses also\ntestified that, two weeks after the incident, Det. Cute brought over a photo array which included\ndefendant’s photo, but Celletti was unable to identify any of the men in the photographs as the\nman who had entered her home on January 28.', 'Some months after being shown the photo array, Celletti called the Attorney General’s\noffice to inquire about the legal proceedings involving the boy. After a brief conversation—the\nsubstance of which is not on the record—she used her daughter’s laptop computer to search\nFacebook for the name “Jodi Johnson.” Celletti thought this might have been the name of the\nthird person in her house on January 28 whom she had not seen but had assumed was a woman\nbased on the voice. After scrolling through the various Jodi Johnsons who came up in the\nFacebook search results, she looked at photos for different spellings of “Jodi.” She testified that,', '-4-\n“all of a sudden [she] saw a picture that was very familiar to [her], but it wasn’t a female, it was\na male.” Celletti testified that, based on the eyes and the large head, “he looked like the man\nwho came into [her] house with a gun.” Celletti clicked on the photo, which brought her to that\nman’s Facebook profile page. Celletti scrolled through several photos of this “Jody Johnson,”\nincluding one in which he was wearing glasses with tape on the corner. When Celletti saw that\npicture, she was “a hundred percent” certain this photo was of the man who had entered her\nhouse on January 28. Celletti called Det. Cute, who testified that he went to her house, watched\nher repeat the search sequence she had performed on Facebook, and, using his own cell phone\ncamera, took photos of the images on her computer screen. Celletti identified defendant as the\nman who entered her home and pointed a gun at her face.', 'At the close of the state’s evidence, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on the\nassault charge, arguing that insufficient evidence had been produced that a firearm was used\nduring the incident. The trial justice denied the motion. The defendant renewed his motion prior\nto the delivery of the jury instructions and closing arguments; the trial justice reserved his\ndecision. The jury returned guilty verdicts on all counts. In March 2017, the trial justice denied\ndefendant’s renewed motion for judgment of acquittal and motion for new trial, in which\ndefendant argued that the jury’s verdict was contrary to the weight of the evidence and Celletti’s\ntestimony.', 'The trial justice imposed a sentence of twenty-five years’ imprisonment with twelve\nyears to serve and the balance suspended, with probation, on defendant’s first-degree robbery\nconviction and on defendant’s assault-with-a-firearm conviction.', 'With respect to defendant’s\nconspiracy conviction, the trial justice initially sentenced him to twenty years’ imprisonment\nwith ten years to serve and ten years suspended, with probation, but corrected the sentence sua', '-5-\nsponte a month later because this sentence exceeded the statutory maximum. Accordingly, he\nmodified the sentence to ten years’ imprisonment with ten years to serve. Each sentence runs\nconcurrently with the sentences for the other convictions. Final judgment entered on May 30,\n2017. The defendant filed a notice of appeal before the trial justice entered a final judgment of\nconviction, but did not file another notice of appeal after the trial justice corrected the sentence\nimposed for the conspiracy conviction. We granted defendant’s petition for writ of certiorari\nasking this Court for direct review of his convictions.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'The defendant appeals only from the trial justice’s denial of his motion for new trial. As\nwe have oft repeated, “[w]hen a trial justice is presented with a motion for a new trial based on\nthe weight of the evidence, he or she acts as a thirteenth juror and exercises independent\njudgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.” State v. Gomez, 116\nA.3d 216, 223 (R.I. 2015) (quoting State v. Storey, 102 A.3d 641, 646 (R.I. 2014)). “[T]he trial\njustice must consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, then independently assess the\ncredibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and also ultimately determine\nwhether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” Id.\n(quoting Storey, 102 A.3d at 646). “If, after conducting this independent review, the trial justice\nagrees with the jury’s verdict or if the evidence is such that reasonable minds could differ as to\nthe outcome, the motion for a new trial should be denied.” Id. (quoting Storey, 102 A.3d at 646).\n“Only when the trial justice does not agree with the jury’s verdict, [must he or she] embark on a\nfourth analytical step.” Id. (quoting Storey, 102 A.3d at 646).', '-6-', '“This Court’s review of a denial of a motion for a new trial is deferential because the trial\njustice is in an especially good position to evaluate the facts and to judge the credibility of the\nwitnesses * * *.” Gomez, 116 A.3d at 223 (quoting Storey, 102 A.3d at 647). “If the trial justice\nhas articulated adequate grounds for denying the motion, his or her decision is entitled to great\nweight and will not be overturned by this Court unless he or she has overlooked or misconceived\nmaterial evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.” Id. (quoting Storey, 102 A.3d at 647).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice was clearly wrong when he denied\ndefendant’s motion for a new trial because, according to defendant, the verdict was against the\nweight of the evidence. Specifically, he asserts that Celletti’s testimony identifying him as the\nperpetrator should have been given little weight and that the weight of the evidence does not\nindicate that an operable firearm was used during the incident. We begin our discussion by\nacknowledging that the trial justice applied the correct standard for assessing the motion for new\ntrial and articulated sufficient grounds for denying the motion; his decision is therefore entitled\nto great weight and deference pursuant to our well established standard of review. See Gomez,\n116 A.3d at 223.', 'With respect to Celletti’s in-court identification of defendant as the perpetrator, defendant\nargues that little weight should have been given to this testimony because she had not been able\nto identify him from a photo array a couple of weeks after the incident despite her testimony that\nshe had spent several minutes looking at his face while he was in her house. The defendant also\nargues that none of the Facebook photos of him wearing glasses shows tape at the corner, which\ndirectly contradicts the emphasis he claims Celletti placed on her ability to identify him on', '-7-\nFacebook as the perpetrator based on the Scotch tape at the corner of his glasses. In addition,\ndefendant argues that Celletti more likely identified defendant as the perpetrator because a\nrepresentative from the Attorney General’s office told her the name of a suspect, she went\nlooking for a photo of the person with that name, and then adjusted her recollection of his\nphysical description once she found the photos.', 'In the trial justice’s decision denying defendant’s motion for new trial, he concluded that\nCelletti’s testimony was consistent and that the few discrepancies—drawn out during cross-\nexamination—between her initial statements to the police, her grand jury testimony, and her trial\ntestimony “did not diminish the weight or significance of [her] testimony.” Our review of the\ntestimony reveals that, as Celletti scrolled through the Facebook profiles listed from her search\nfor “Jodi Johnson,” she came across a photo of a face that was “very familiar” to her “[b]ecause\nhe looked like the man who came into [her] house with a gun.” She opened his profile and\nlooked through other photos; when she saw the photo of him wearing glasses with “the shadow\nof the tape on the side of the glasses,” she “knew a hundred percent that was him.” While it had\napparently been suggested to Celletti that an individual by the name of “Jodi Johnson” was\nthought to be involved in the incident, the name merely provided a starting point for Celletti’s\nFacebook search. Indeed, she testified that, when she started her search, she was looking for a\nfemale.', 'As the state points out, the Facebook search for “Jodi Johnson” yielded many profiles and\nphotos that Celletti scrolled through before seeing one with a familiar face; the search did not\nresult in a single photo that Celletti concluded was a photo of her perpetrator. Moreover, at trial,\nCelletti emphasized that her in-court identification of defendant was based on “his height, how\nbig he is, his eyes.” Deferring to the trial justice’s front-and-center position to evaluate the facts', '-8-\nand to judge credibility, considering his clear articulation of his conclusion that Celletti’s\ntestimony was consistent and credible, and absent any indication that he overlooked or\nmisconceived the evidence, we agree with the trial justice’s assessment of the weight to which\nCelletti’s testimony was entitled and perceive no error on his part. See Gomez, 116 A.3d at 223.', 'The defendant also specifically challenges his convictions for first-degree robbery and\nassault with a dangerous weapon in a dwelling house with intent to rob on the basis that the\nguilty verdicts for these counts are against the weight of the evidence that the gun wielded during\nthe incident was operable. He argues that Celletti’s only testimony about the gun was to describe\nits color and to state that it was pointed at her, and he further argues there was no testimony that\nshe knew the gun was operable or that the intruders indicated the gun was operable. The\ndefendant contends that Celletti’s testimony about her fear at the sight of the gun does not show\nits operability.', 'The indictment in this case identified the dangerous weapon as a firearm. To prove\nassault with a dangerous weapon when the dangerous weapon in play is a firearm, it is well\nsettled that the state must prove the defendant possessed an operable gun. State v. Tillery, 922\nA.2d 102, 107 (R.I. 2007). The state need not either produce the gun at trial or prove that the\ngun was loaded during the commission of the crime; the operability of the gun “may be inferred\nfrom the actions and statements of the defendant.” Id. at 108. We have had prior opportunities to\nconsider whether the circumstances presented in a variety of cases could lead to a reasonable\ninference that an operable firearm was used in the commission of an assault. We have held that\nthere was sufficient evidence that an operable gun was used when witnesses consistently\ndescribed the gun they saw the defendant carrying and testified that the defendant had made a\nthreat to shoot and that they had heard the gun click. Id. We have also held that the jury could', '-9-\nproperly infer a firearm was used when the witnesses testified that they were afraid, when the\ndefendant pointed a gun at—and within inches of—one witness’s chest, and when the defendant\nthreatened to shoot a hole in a nearby mattress. State v. Andrade, 657 A.2d 538, 543 (R.I. 1995)\nabrogated on other grounds by State v. Jackson, 752 A.2d 5, 9-10 (R.I. 2000). On the other\nhand, we have also vacated a conviction after holding that there was insufficient evidence to\nprove that the defendant possessed an operable weapon when the complaining witness was\nequivocal about whether the defendant had possessed a gun at all during the incident in question.\nState v. Caba, 887 A.2d 370, 376-77 (R.I. 2005).', 'The case at bar presents testimony that is more akin to the circumstances in Tillery and\nAndrade than those in Caba. In her testimony at trial, Celletti described the gun as having a dirty\nsilver barrel and brown handle and stated that defendant had pointed the gun at her face when he\nentered her home. She was clearly afraid the gun would be used to kill her because she asked the\nboy—who held the gun on her while the others searched her house—whether he thought the\nothers were going to kill her. She also testified that the gun was pointed at her face by the young\nboy while defendant and the third person removed a variety of electronics and personal items\nfrom her home. As the intruders were leaving, Celletti testified that defendant issued a threat: “If\nyou call the cops, I’m coming back.”', 'In his decision denying defendant’s motion for new trial, the trial justice specifically\nconcluded that a gun was used during the incident. He considered the caselaw discussed supra\nand gave great weight to Celletti’s testimony that she was in fear, as demonstrated by her\nquestion to the young boy about whether he thought the others were going to kill her,\ndefendant’s threat to return if she called the police, and the gun pointed at her for the duration of\nthe incident. Unlike the defendant in Caba, Celletti was unequivocal about the presence of the', '- 10 -\ngun. The unrebutted testimony as to the actions and statements of defendant and his accomplices\nlead to a reasonable inference that the gun was operable, and defendant has not shown that the\ntrial justice overlooked or misconceived any evidence by so concluding.', 'Overall, the trial justice concluded that Celletti was a credible witness, and he specifically\nstated that he agreed with the jury’s guilty verdicts on all three counts.', 'After thoroughly\nreviewing the record, it is apparent that the trial justice explained and supported his reasons for\ndenying the defendant’s motion for new trial.

Alves seeks to have his conviction and sentence vacated, and asks this Court to grant him a\nnew trial on the grounds that the trial justice erred in admitting into evidence identification\ntestimony and a photograph identification. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the\njudgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On February 7, 2014, Farhan Mustafa was closing his cell-phone-repair shop for the\nevening when two men entered from the back door and held “guns right in [his] face” and robbed\nhim. Mustafa recognized one of the assailants as “Big D.” Although he did not know the second\nassailant, Mustafa testified that the man was “very familiar,” and that he had observed him for\nten to fifteen seconds from less than two feet away. Mustafa called the Providence police to\nreport the incident and also called his friend, Ryan Gallant, who, Mustafa testified, knew Big D.', '-1-\nAt the Providence police station, Mustafa met with Detective Ronald Riley and described the\nassailants. He described the second assailant as between five feet eight inches and five feet ten\ninches tall, with a medium complexion. Detective Riley then showed Mustafa a series of ten to\nfifteen photographs, from which Mustafa identified the first assailant, Big D. The following day,\nDet. Riley presented Mustafa with another photo array to identify the second assailant, but\nMustafa did not find the second assailant among the photographs presented.', 'Later that day, in a further attempt to identify the second assailant, Mustafa and Gallant\nvisited a website that featured pictures of patrons at various Rhode Island nightclubs. After\nlooking at between twenty and twenty-five photographs, Mustafa identified a photograph\ndepicting the second assailant. Mustafa recognized the assailant “right away.” Gallant informed\nMustafa of the name of the man Mustafa had identified in the photograph. Mustafa printed the\nwebsite photograph and brought it to Det. Riley. Detective Riley asked Mustafa to draw a circle\naround the individual he identified. Mustafa then wrote “Brandon New Bedford” in the upper\nleft corner of the image, and signed and dated the photograph.', 'On April 16, 2014, Mustafa received a text message from Gallant reporting the then-\ncurrent location of the second assailant. Mustafa informed the police, who responded and\narrested Alves. Two days later, Det. Riley showed Mustafa a single photograph of Alves from a\nshared-law-enforcement database. Detective Riley testified that he showed Mustafa a single\nphotograph because “[Mustafa] [had] already identified the suspect in the previous photo he\ngave” to Det. Riley, and that this single photograph was meant to confirm “the name and date of\nbirth” of the suspect. According to Det. Riley, “As soon as [he] put the * * * photo [of Alves]\ndown in front of [Mustafa],” Mustafa “immediately identified” the individual depicted as the\nsecond assailant, with one hundred percent confidence.', '-2-', 'Alves was charged with first-degree robbery and conspiracy. He filed a motion to\nsuppress the single photograph shown to Mustafa by Det. Riley. At a hearing on the motion,\nAlves argued that the identification procedure was “unnecessarily suggestive,” and that there was\na “substantial likelihood of misidentification” such that he was denied due process of law. The\ntrial justice denied Alves’s motion and determined that the photographic depiction was not “an\nunnecessarily suggestive procedure.” A jury trial commenced shortly thereafter, which resulted\nin Alves’s conviction for first-degree robbery and conspiracy. He timely appealed to this Court.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“It is well established that decisions concerning the admissibility of evidence are ‘within\nthe sound discretion of the trial justice, and this Court will not interfere with the trial justice’s\ndecision unless a clear abuse of that discretion is apparent.’” State v.

The defendant argues that this testimony was impermissible\nhearsay.1', '“Hearsay is defined in Rule 801(c) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence as ‘a\nstatement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in\nevidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.’” State v. Gomez, 116 A.3d 216, 226 (R.I.\n2015) (quoting R.I. R. Evid. 801(c)). “Rule 802 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence sets forth\nthe general prohibition against the admissibility of hearsay statements other than those well-\nrecognized exceptions carved out by law.” Id. “[A] determination of whether an out-of-court\nstatement meets an exception to the hearsay rule is within the trial justice’s discretion.” Id.\n(quoting State v. Watkins, 92 A.3d 172, 187 (R.I. 2014)). “Under this standard, this Court will\nuphold the trial justice’s ruling unless a clear ‘abuse of discretion that prejudices the complaining\nparty is shown.’” Id. (quoting Watkins, 92 A.3d at 187).', 'At trial, the state questioned Mustafa, “[D]id you write anything on the photo when you\nsaw Detective Riley?” and Mustafa began to answer, “[Gallant told] me that is his name so I\nwr[o]te it[,]” at which point defense counsel objected. The trial justice overruled the objection\nand stated, “I will permit the answer to stand to explain why he wrote on the photograph. It is\nnot for the truth of the matter asserted, only to explain why he would make a marking on that\nphotograph and no other reason.”', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice should have stricken Mustafa’s answer,\nwhich explained that Gallant informed him of the name of the individual depicted in the\nphotograph they found online, as impermissible hearsay. We are of the opinion, however, as was\n1', 'The defendant also argues that his “name could have been obscured or redacted” from the\nphotograph exhibit; but defendant neither objected to the written caption nor requested a\nredaction before the trial justice. Therefore, this issue is waived. See State v. Feliciano, 901\nA.2d 631, 646 (R.I. 2006).', '-4-\nthe trial justice, that the testimony at issue was not offered “for the truth of the matter\nasserted”—i.e., that a man named Brandon was the individual in the photograph—but was\noffered, instead, to explain why Mustafa wrote on the photograph. Mustafa had already, on his\nown, identified the individual depicted in the photograph as the second assailant. As noted by\nthe trial justice in his oral ruling on defendant’s motion to suppress the identification, Mustafa\n“immediately without any difficulty, without any hesitation when he saw Mr. Alves’ face in that\ngroup photograph he said that is the second guy who robbed him.”', 'Moreover, the jurors had access to the photographic evidence and could determine for\nthemselves whether defendant was the individual depicted in the photograph. Finally, we note\nthat Gallant testified at trial and was thereby subject to cross-examination regarding his\nstatement to Mustafa about the name of the individual in the photograph. See State v. Jaiman,\n850 A.2d 984, 990 (R.I. 2004) (“Even evidence that traditionally would be categorized as\nhearsay * * * d[oes] not alter the fact that the Confrontation Clause’s requirements are satisfied\nwhen a hearsay declarant is present at trial, is placed under oath and is subject to unrestricted\ncross-examination, thus affording the jury an opportunity to observe the witness’s demeanor.”).\nTherefore, the trial justice did not abuse his discretion, and the statement at issue was not\nhearsay.', 'B', 'The defendant’s second assignment of error is that the trial justice abused his discretion\nby failing to suppress the single photograph of defendant shown to Mustafa by Det. Riley. The\ndefendant argues that the display of the single photograph by Det. Riley violated his right to due\nprocess and was “unnecessarily suggestive and misleading.”', '-5-', '“In reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress an identification that was allegedly\ntainted by an unduly suggestive procedure, we carry out a two-step analysis.” State v. Franco,\n750 A.2d 415, 420 (R.I. 2000). “First, we must determine whether ‘the totality of circumstances\ndiscloses procedures that were so unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable\nmistaken identification that it constituted a denial of due process of law.’” Id. (quoting State v.\nAndrade, 657 A.2d 538, 541 (R.I. 1995)). “Only if we determine that the procedures were\nunduly suggestive do we proceed to the second step of our analysis and assess the reliability of\nthe identification.” Id. Absent “a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification[,]”\nthe out-of-court identification should be admitted. Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 384\n(1968).', 'In the case under review, we need go no further than the first prong of the analysis,\nindeed if we need go that far. The presentation to Mustafa of the single photograph of defendant\nwas not so much an identification procedure as it was a confirmation of the identification that\nMustafa had already made. The evidence revealed that Mustafa was accosted by two individuals\nbrandishing guns as he was closing his cell-phone-repair shop. He had a clear view of their faces\nfor ten to fifteen seconds, from two feet away. Mustafa immediately recognized one of the\nassailants and said that the other had a very familiar face.', 'With the help of Gallant, but without any police assistance, Mustafa was soon able to\npositively identify defendant as the second assailant. Approximately two months later, after\ndefendant was arrested, Mustafa instantly identified the second suspect from the individual\nphotograph depicting defendant. Under these circumstances, we are satisfied that the use of a\nsingle photograph was neither unnecessarily suggestive, nor did it implicate defendant’s right to\ndue process. See Perry v. New Hampshire, 565 U.S. 228, 238-39 (2012) (“[D]ue process', '-6-\nconcerns arise only when law enforcement officers use an identification procedure that is both\nsuggestive and unnecessary.”).', 'The facts here are analogous to those in State v. Luciano, 739 A.2d 222 (R.I. 1999), in\nwhich this Court ruled that “use of an individual picture of [a] defendant was not unnecessarily\nsuggestive” where witnesses had identified the defendant as the shooter before they were shown\nthe individual photograph of the defendant, because the police had not suggested that the man in\nthe photograph was the shooter, but “simply showed the picture to confirm [the witnesses’\nprevious] identification.” Luciano, 739 A.2d at 226. Here, Mustafa identified defendant through\nhis own research, without the help of the police. Detective Riley’s display of the individual\nphotograph to Mustafa was strictly a means to confirm the identification Mustafa had already\nmade and relayed to police. Consequently, the photograph display was not unduly suggestive,\nand the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in admitting the photograph into evidence.', 'The defendant also argues that the trial justice erred in admitting the photograph because\nhe did not consider whether Mustafa’s identification was reliable. Again, this Court has made\nclear that “[o]nly if we determine that the procedures were unduly suggestive do we proceed to\nthe second step of our analysis and assess the reliability of the identification.” Franco, 750 A.2d\nat 420.', 'Because this Court has determined that the photograph display was not unduly\nsuggestive, we need not proceed to any further analysis regarding reliability.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

On the evening in question, defendant\ntestified that the dispute was nothing more than an exchange of childish words and that he was\nnot angry.

The testimony of defendant and that of Officer Salvatore diverge from the time of\ntheir initial encounter. Officer Salvatore stated that, as the front door of defendant’s residence\nwas open and the storm door was shut, and seeing a male and a female in the kitchen area, he\nknocked on the storm door. When they did not acknowledge him, he opened the storm door,', '-2-\nstepped on the threshold, and yelled, “Hello.”', 'The man asked who the officer was; after\nidentifying himself as a Cranston police officer, Officer Salvatore asked the man if he was Tom.\nAt this time, another man later identified as Thomas Mercurio “came running from the right side\nof the home” and began yelling, asking the officer if he had a warrant. Officer Salvatore\ndescribed Mercurio as “irate” or “pretty upset.”', 'The officer testified that, at that time, he was\nstanding on the threshold and had one foot inside of the home. Officer Salvatore explained that\nhe asked defendant to come outside to talk, and they both stepped outside to the front stairway,\nwith the officer standing approximately two feet away from defendant. After stepping outside,\ndefendant said, “That f---ing neighbor.” When he then asked defendant if he had any guns or\nknives on him, defendant angrily said, “F--- this,” pushed him in the chest, and retreated back\ninto the home.', 'Officer Salvatore testified that he then pursued defendant into the house, entering the\nlanding between the first and second floors. He tried to grab defendant and repeatedly told\ndefendant that he was under arrest. He testified that, because defendant was “flailing his arms”\nand “trying to kick,” defendant’s momentum caused him to trip down the stairs and fall sideways\nto the lower level. He then ran down the stairs and grabbed defendant, who was still kicking and\npunching in an apparent attempt to get away. According to Officer Salvatore, defendant was still\nswinging and kicking towards him before Officer Salvatore had his whole body on top of the\nface-down defendant, continually telling defendant that he was under arrest. He testified that\ndefendant put his hands underneath his body after defendant was on his stomach and Officer\nSalvatore was on top of him. At this time, while trying to grab defendant’s left arm, Officer\nSalvatore first became aware that two other Cranston patrolmen, Officers Aldrich and Escobar,\nhad arrived. Officers Salvatore and Aldrich grabbed defendant’s arms and handcuffed him.', '-3-', 'Officer Salvatore testified that, as he escorted defendant to the police car, defendant was\n“yelling the whole time[,]” as were members of his family. He stated that defendant was “very\ntense when [Officer Salvatore] was getting him into the car, [and defendant] continued to call me\na yellow bastard.” According to him, defendant screamed and threatened to kill him while he\nwalked defendant to the police car.', '2', 'Officer Aldrich’s Testimony', 'Officer Seth Aldrich testified that he also received the dispatch shortly before 6 p.m. and\narrived at defendant’s residence soon after Officer Salvatore. He testified that he was in the\nstreet, about twenty-five to thirty feet away, when he observed Officer Salvatore speaking with\nMercurio. He did not hear much of what was said but did hear Officer Salvatore state that he\nwould rather speak with Mercurio outside. He stated that Officer Salvatore was standing on the\noutside front steps of the house while Mercurio was standing in the open doorway. Officer\nAldrich did not see defendant strike Officer Salvatore; he did see defendant quickly turn towards\nOfficer Salvatore and re-enter the house and Officer Salvatore run into the house after him.\nOfficer Aldrich then ran into the house, and “observed Officer Salvatore and * * * defendant\nwrestling on the [lower-level] floor.” He stated that defendant was “lying on his stomach with\nhis hands underneath his chest [and that he] attempted to get [defendant’s] right arm from\nunderneath him [as] Officer Salvatore was on [defendant’s] left side.” Officer Aldrich stated that\nhe handcuffed defendant after a “brief struggle.” During this time, defendant yelled toward his\nfamily members to get the video camera while saying that the officers should not have been in\nhis home.

Notably, Officer Aldrich was not questioned as to whether he heard\nOfficer Salvatore inform defendant that defendant was under arrest.', '3', 'The Defendant’s Testimony', 'The defendant gave a different version of the events. He stated that, at the time Officer\nSalvatore arrived, he was eating dinner at the kitchen table with his mother, brother, and sister.\nAccording to defendant, his family’s dinner was interrupted when they heard someone open the\ndoor and ask for “Todd.” He became upset on seeing a police officer completely inside the\nhouse, with his foot on a stair and hand on the railing. He testified that he first asked Officer\nSalvatore “what he was doing in our home[,]” to which Officer Salvatore did not respond. When\ndefendant next asked if the officer had a warrant, Officer Salvatore only responded by saying,\n“Just come down, I want to talk to you.” The defendant then came down the stairway while\npointing his finger at Officer Salvatore and telling him to leave. He stated that he was angry, but\ndid not yell. The defendant then testified that he stopped on one of the first three steps when the\nofficer, standing inside of the home approximately two feet away, grabbed defendant’s right arm\nand collar, pulling him down the stairs and into the railing. The railing gave way and he fell to\nthe bottom floor on his hands and knees. The defendant then testified that he received a blow to\nthe left side of his rib and that the pain of the blow caused him to lie down flat on the ground.\nHe stated that he received a blow on the left side of his head, and Officer Salvatore then put his\nknee in defendant’s back.

See Vargas, 991 A.2d at 1061. Accordingly, “[t]his Court will not disturb a trial\njustice’s finding regarding the admissibility of prior conviction evidence for impeachment\npurposes unless our review of the record reveals an abuse of discretion on the part of the trial\njustice.” State v. Silvia, 898 A.2d 707, 718 (R.I. 2006) (quoting State v. Morel, 676 A.2d 1347,\n1357 (R.I. 1996)).', 'Here, the trial justice took note of the fact that “[t]he * * * conviction in 1987 * * * is not\ncharged as something involving dishonesty or false statements, but it does concern conduct\nwhich is similar to the conduct which the defendant is now faced with.” The trial justice\ndetermined, however, that he would permit the state to use defendant’s prior convictions to\nimpeach defendant but stated that he would “inform the jury of the limited purpose for which\nthat evidence was being offered * * *.”', 'We perceive no abuse of discretion in the trial justice’s decision to deny defendant’s\nmotion in limine. The record in this case reflects that defendant was given an abundantly “fair\nopportunity to contest the [state’s] use of [the] evidence [of his prior convictions],” as required\nby Rule 609(b). Absent some indication of a clear error on the trial justice’s part, we will not\ndisturb the trial justice’s decision on review. “[T]he decision whether to admit evidence of prior\nconvictions involves the balancing of several factors that turns on the particular facts of each\ncase.” State v. Gillespie, 960 A.2d 969, 981 (R.I. 2008). The trial justice was within his\ndiscretion to conclude at the pretrial stage that defendant’s multiple prior convictions, in spite of\ntheir age, had a probative value in demonstrating a disdain for the law so as to affect a jury’s\nassessment of defendant’s credibility. In particular, we note that this case, with the general lack\nof any physical evidence, largely hinged on a credibility determination, making the ability to\nimpeach a witness’s credibility of even greater importance. We cannot find that the trial justice', '-9-\nwas clearly wrong in his decision and, accordingly, will not disturb his denial of defendant’s\nmotion in limine.', 'B', 'The Use of Defendant’s Prior Convictions on Cross-Examination', 'The defendant next argues that the trial justice erred in finding that defendant had\n“opened the door” to the prosecutor’s specific mention that two of defendant’s prior convictions\nwere of assaults on police officers. He contends that the prosecutor’s questioning exceeded the\nscope of defendant’s testimony on direct and cross-examination. The defendant asserts that the\nprosecutor “manufactured” the issue of defendant’s respect for police officers in order to be able\nto bring in these prior convictions.', 'It is axiomatic that cross-examination is generally limited to the scope of the direct\nexamination. State v. Carvalho, 892 A.2d 140, 144 (R.I. 2006). However, “questions calculated\nto explain, contradict[,] or discredit a witness’s testimony or designed to test the witness’s\naccuracy, memory, veracity, credibility or bias are” also permitted. State v. Gordon, 880 A.2d\n825, 838 (R.I. 2005).', 'In addition, it is well-settled that “a witness’s credibility may be\nchallenged by evidence that the witness has been convicted of a crime * * *.” State v. Price, 68\nA.3d 440, 446 (R.I. 2013). The admission into evidence of previous crimes is, however, limited\nto certain enumerated purposes. See Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. 4 This\nCourt has previously stated that', '“evidence that may not be admissible in the prosecution’s case in', 'chief may be used in rebuttal in order to counter false statements\n4', 'Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence states, in pertinent part, that “[e]vidence of\nother crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show\nthat the person acted in conformity therewith.

During the cross-examination\nof defendant, the state first broached the topic of defendant’s like or dislike of the police by\ninquiring why defendant asked Officer Salvatore “Do you have a warrant?” and why he was\n“angry” that Officer Salvatore was in his home. The defendant explained that “it’s [his] personal\nunderstanding and knowledge that the police require a warrant or some type of consent upon\nentering a dwelling place.” The following exchange then ensued:', '“[The State]: You don’t like the police, do you?', '“[Defendant]: That’s not true.

O’Dell, 576 A.2d 425, 429 (R.I. 1990), involved evidence that was inadmissible in the\nprosecution’s case in chief because it had not been disclosed to the defendant as required under\nRule 16 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. This Court has since applied this\nrule concerning the prosecution manufacturing an issue during cross-examination in the context\nof Rule 404(b) in State v. McDowell, 620 A.2d 94, 95-96 (R.I. 1993).', '- 11 -\nThe trial justice overruled an objection made by defense counsel. The defendant was thus\npermitted to answer.', '“[Defendant]: I respect law and order, yes, I do.', '“[The State]: You respect law and order?', '“[Defendant]: Yes, I do.”\nThe cross-examination of defendant then continued, before the following colloquy took place,\nagain regarding defendant’s sentiments about the police:', '“[The State]: You never got angry with the officer * * * and', 'pushed him?', '“[Defendant]: I never said that.', '“[The State]: Because you respect police; right?', '“[Defendant]: I respect law and order, yes, I do.', '“[The State]:', 'And you wouldn’t put your hands on a police', 'officer.', '“[Defendant]: No, I would not.”', 'At a sidebar immediately following this exchange, the state argued that defendant had\n“opened the door” to the fact that two of his prior convictions for assault involved police\nofficers. The trial justice determined that defendant had “opened the door” to the nature and\ncircumstances surrounding the prior convictions. Therefore, he permitted the state to confront\ndefendant with specific evidence of the prior convictions.', 'This Court has recently been faced with a similar situation involving a prosecutor’s\nalleged manufacturing of an issue in order to impeach a witness’s testimony in Rosario. In\nRosario, 14 A.3d at 207-08, the defendant was charged with assault with a dangerous weapon on\na police officer. In ruling upon two motions in limine, the trial justice in Rosario held inter alia', '- 12 -\nthat evidence of one particular previous interaction between the defendant and the police officer\nwho had been the victim of the alleged assault as well as of specific comments that the defendant\nhad made with regard to the police officer would be admissible. Id. at 208-09. The trial justice\nfurther held that evidence of “generalized references to threats of assault on police officers in\ngeneral” would be precluded but noted that her decision on the motions in limine might be\nchanged depending on what the defendant testified to during trial. Id. at 209.', 'At trial, during cross-examination of the defendant, Rosario was asked specifically if he\nliked the victim-police officer. Rosario, 14 A.3d at 212. The defendant responded, “Yes, I like\nhim. He is an officer. I respect authority.” Id. The prosecutor then asked the defendant for\nconfirmation: “Sir, you testified to this jury under oath that you respect all authority and you\nrespect all Providence police officers; didn’t you say that?” Id. The defendant answered in the\naffirmative. Id. At this point, the prosecutor questioned the defendant regarding a previous\ngeneralized negative statement defendant had made about “all Providence police officers[.]” Id.\nThe trial justice permitted the cross-examination of the defendant to proceed with that line of\nquestioning, finding that the defendant had “opened the door” with his answer that he respected\nauthority. Id. at 212. This Court affirmed the trial justice’s ruling, noting that “[the] defendant\nchose to answer a question about his attitude towards one person * * * with an extremely broad\nand unqualified declaration about his respect for authority in general[,]” in holding that\ndefendant had “opened the door” to the rebuttal testimony which followed. Id. at 218.', 'The state relies on Rosario to support its contention that the trial justice did not err in\ndetermining that defendant had “opened the door” to being impeached based on his prior\nconvictions for assault on police officers. We are of the opinion, however, that the facts of\nRosario are different from the facts here. We emphasize, in particular, that in Rosario it was the', '- 13 -\ndefendant who answered a specific question about one police officer with a broad, generalized\nstatement about his respect for authority. See Rosario, 14 A.3d at 218. In contrast, here, the\nprosecutor was the first one to ask a broad leading question about defendant’s sentiments\ntowards the police by asking, “You don’t like the police, do you?” 6 Prior to the prosecutor’s\nasking this question, the defendant had not “opened the door” through any general declarations\nabout his respect for authority. Indeed, we note that in both this first exchange and in the one\nwhich followed, it was the prosecutor who persisted in questioning defendant in such broad\nterms. 7 We conclude that defendant had not “opened the door” to these questions. We find no\nsupport in the record for the proposition that defendant had previously volunteered any broad\ndeclarations of his respect for either the police or law and order generally so as to “open the\ndoor” to the prosecutor’s questions.', 'Our careful review of the record compels us to the\nconclusion that the repeated broad questions about defendant’s sentiments towards police\nofficers in general elicited a response from defendant which then enabled the state to bring in\ndefendant’s prior convictions of assault against police officers. We are persuaded that these\nrepeated questions constituted improper “manufacturing” of an issue to bring in evidence which\nthe trial justice had previously ruled inadmissible.', 'Our conclusion is further buttressed by the fact that, during the pretrial motion in limine\nhearing, the prosecutor stated that he would use defendant’s prior convictions only “if the\ndefendant testifies and he gets up there and starts saying he’s a peaceful guy, that he respects\npolice, or something along those lines.” (Emphasis added.) We are struck by the prosecutor’s\nuse of this very phrase in several different permutations during the course of defendant’s cross-\n6', 'In phrasing the question thusly, we note that the prosecutor had essentially “painted defendant\ninto a corner” where the only possible response was a broad statement of liking the police.\n7', 'As noted above, the prosecutor asked defendant “Because you respect police; right?” and then\n“And you wouldn’t put your hands on a police officer.”', '- 14 -\nexamination. It was only after broadly leading questions along these lines that the prosecutor\ndirectly asked, “And you wouldn’t put your hands on a police officer,” thereby referring\nobliquely to defendant’s prior convictions in such a way as to lead inevitably to further questions\nregarding the exact nature of those convictions. We conclude that these questions on cross-\nexamination were improper. 8 Accordingly, we hold that the trial justice erred in permitting the\nstate to impeach defendant’s testimony using his prior convictions of assault against police\nofficers.', 'Finally, this Court will address whether the trial justice’s error was harmless. “In order to\nmeet the harmless-error test, there must be proof ‘beyond a reasonable doubt that the error\ncomplained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.’” State v. Smith, 446 A.2d 1035, 1036\n(R.I. 1982) (quoting Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24 (1967)). This Court has listed\nvarious factors to be considered in determining whether an error was harmless,', '“including the relative degree of importance of the witness', 'testimony to the prosecution’s case, ‘* * * the presence or absence', 'of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the', 'witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination', 'otherwise permitted, and * * * the overall strength of the', 'prosecution’s case.’” State v.

Texter, 594 A.2d 376, 378 (R.I. 1991)).\nWe are of the opinion that the trial justice’s error in permitting the state to cross-examine the\ndefendant concerning the exact nature of his prior convictions was not harmless. As previously\nnoted, this case was largely devoid of physical evidence, rendering the credibility of each of the\nwitnesses central to the case.', 'We cannot be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the\n8', 'We note that we do not believe the prosecutor acted deliberately in improperly cross-examining\ndefendant. Indeed, we are satisfied that the prosecutor was fulfilling his duty as a zealous\nadvocate for the state. We reiterate, however, our admonition in a recent case: “[w]hen a\ndefendant is testifying at his trial, prosecutors and trial justices must be scrupulous to ensure that\nimpeachment of defendant by reference to prior convictions or past criminal conduct is effected\nin a proper manner * * *.” State v. Price, 68 A.3d 440, 448 (R.I. 2013).', '- 15 -\nimproper admission into evidence of the defendant’s prior convictions was not overly\nprejudicial.

Because we cannot conclude\nthat the use of the defendant’s prior convictions was harmless, we are perforce required to hold\nthat their admission into evidence was a reversible error. Consequently, we conclude that the\ndefendant is entitled to a new trial.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, the defendant’s judgment of conviction is vacated.

But one thorny issue to be determined in these consolidated\ncases is the duration of that obligation. Is he required to register for life, as the state argues, or\nfor a period of ten years, as he maintains? An equally vexing question that must be addressed by\nthis Court in this case of first impression is whether changes to the law requiring Gibson to\nregister—namely, two amendments to G.L. 1956 § 11-37.1-4(a), which governs the duration and\nfrequency of registration, and an increase in the punishment for the failure to comply with the', '-1-\nsex-offender registration laws—violate the ex post facto clauses of the United States and Rhode\nIsland Constitutions.', 'Gibson seeks review on certiorari of a decision of a magistrate of the Superior Court\ndenying his motion to dismiss a 2012 charge for failing to notify law enforcement of a change in\nresidence, in violation of §§ 11-37.1-9 and 11-37.1-10. In denying Gibson’s motion to dismiss,\nthe magistrate determined that Gibson had a lifetime duty to register; therefore, his duty to\nregister had not expired, and the 2012 charge would not be dismissed. Also, Gibson appeals\nfrom a judgment embodying a decision of a justice of the Superior Court denying his application\nfor postconviction relief from three failure-to-notify convictions in 2007, 2009, and 2010, in\nviolation of § 11-37.1-9. 1 The hearing justice in the postconviction relief matter also found that\nGibson was burdened by a lifetime duty to register. In addition, she ruled that Gibson’s three\nfailure-to-notify convictions did not violate the ex post facto clause.', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm both the magistrate’s denial of\nGibson’s motion to dismiss and the judgment of the Superior Court denying Gibson’s application\nfor postconviction relief. However, in so doing, we deviate slightly from the reasoning on which\nthe decision and judgment were based. We depart from the conclusions of the magistrate and the\nhearing justice that Gibson has a lifetime duty to register. Rather, we hold that, in accordance\nwith the language of §§ 11-37.1-18 and 11-37.1-4(a), Gibson’s duty to register expires “ten (10)\n1', 'Because of the considerable overlap of the issues presented in these cases, we consolidated\nGibson’s petition for a writ of certiorari and his appeal from the denial of his application for\npostconviction relief. Gibson’s challenge to the denial of postconviction relief comes to us on\nappeal, not certiorari, because he filed his notice of appeal prior to the 2015 amendment to G.L.\n1956 § 10-9.1-9 requiring an applicant seeking review of a final judgment regarding\npostconviction relief to do so “by filing a petition for writ of certiorari * * *.” See P.L. 2015, ch.\n91, § 1; P.L. 2015, ch. 92, § 1. Still, final judgment in the Superior Court did not enter until July\n7, 2015, shortly after that amendment’s date of enactment.

Under the provisions of § 11-37-16, a statute that the General Assembly had\nenacted in 1992, Gibson was required to register as a sex offender. 4 In 1996, the General\nAssembly repealed § 11-37-16 and enacted a more comprehensive registration regime entitled\nthe “Sexual Offender Registration and Community Notification Act,” chapter 37.1 of title 11 (the\n“Registration Act”).

To this charge, though, Gibson did not plead nolo\ncontendere. Rather, he moved to dismiss the criminal information, arguing that his duty to\nregister as a sex offender had expired in 2004—ten years from the date of his conviction in 1994\nand well before the 2012 charge.', 'However, a magistrate of the Superior Court decided\notherwise. In a written decision, the magistrate denied Gibson’s motion to dismiss, concluding\nthat Gibson was saddled with a lifetime duty to register. Gibson then filed a petition for a writ of\ncertiorari with this Court, seeking review of the magistrate’s decision. We granted his petition.', 'Several months after the magistrate denied his motion to dismiss, Gibson filed an\napplication for postconviction relief from his three prior failure-to-notify convictions that had\noccurred in 2007, 2009, and 2010. Before a justice of the Superior Court, Gibson made the same\nargument that he had raised in his motion to dismiss: the duration of his duty to register was\nlimited to ten years, not for the remainder of his life. He further argued that his prior failure-to-\nnotify convictions violated the ex post facto clauses of the United States and Rhode Island\nConstitutions because (a) amendments to the Registration Act impermissibly extended the\nduration of his duty to register, and (b) the Registration Act increased the punishment for failing\nto comply with the sex-offender registration laws from a misdemeanor to a felony. After two\nhearings on the matter, the hearing justice denied Gibson’s application for postconviction relief,', '-5-\ndetermining first that Gibson had a lifetime duty to register, and second that there was no\nviolation of the ex post facto clause.

In the alternative, the state also argued\nthat Gibson’s duty to register, as a consequence of the child molestation conviction, even if not\nfor life, would not expire until at least November 2019, ten years after the expiration of his\nsentence for second-degree child molestation sexual assault, in accordance with § 11-37.1-4(a).', 'In a written decision, the magistrate denied Gibson’s motion to dismiss, holding that the\nstatute in effect at the time of his plea, § 11-37-16, burdened him with lifetime registration.\nRelying on an opinion from the United States District Court for the District of Maine that\ninterpreted the repealed Rhode Island statute, the magistrate held that the clear and unambiguous\nlanguage of § 11-37-16 imposed a lifetime duty to register, because it lacked a durational\nrequirement. 9 Then, quoting from this Court’s opinion in State v. Flores, 714 A.2d 581 (R.I.\n1998), the magistrate reasoned that Gibson, who was charged with a crime prior to the enactment\nof the Registration Act in 1996, “must register as a sex offender pursuant to the registration\nrequirements in effect at the time he was charged, that is, pursuant to § 11-37-16.” Flores, 714\nA.2d at 583.

Gibson, who does not dispute that he was under a duty to\nregister, argues that the ten-year duration contained in § 11-37.1-4(a) controls. However, he\nfurther argues that the duration of his duty to register was set as of 1996, when the version of the\nRegistration Act in effect at that time stated that the duty to register for offenders such as him ran\n“for a period of ten (10) years subsequent to the date of conviction * * *.” See P.L. 1996, ch.\n104, § 1. According to Gibson, because his conviction for second-degree child molestation\nsexual assault was in 1994, his duty to register concluded ten years later, in 2004.', 'The state does not agree. It first posits that the duration of Gibson’s duty to register is\ngoverned by § 11-37-16, the statute in effect at the time of the sex offense. Under the state’s\ninterpretation of that statute, Gibson has a lifetime duty to register because he was convicted in', '-8-\n1994, and because the statute was silent on the issue of how long an offender must register.\nIndeed, the state maintains that § 11-37.1-4 applies by its specific and unambiguous terms only\nto offenses occurring after its enactment in 1996.', 'In the alternative, the state contends that the duration of Gibson’s duty to register, if\ngoverned by chapter 37.1 of title 11, ends in 2019, ten years from the expiration of his fifteen-\nyear sentence, pursuant to the terms of the current version of § 11-37.1-4, and not, as Gibson\nmaintains, ten years from the date of his 1994 conviction, under the terms of the since-amended\n1996 version of that section.', 'According to Gibson, his duty to register expired in 2004. But, to accept that argument\nwould require us to ignore changes to § 11-37.1-4(a) that extended the duration of the duty to\nregister for those subject to its terms from “ten (10) years subsequent to the date of conviction”\nto “ten (10) years subsequent to the date of release from confinement or placement on parole,\nsupervised release or probation” to the current requirement of “ten (10) years from the expiration\nof sentence for the offense * * *.” See P.L. 1996, ch. 104, § 1; P.L. 1997, ch. 156, § 1; P.L.\n2003, ch. 162, § 1; P.L. 2003, ch. 170, § 1.', 'With respect to the state’s argument that there is a lifetime obligation, it does not escape\nus that we cannot overlook the specific language of § 11-37.1-18, which provides, in pertinent\npart, that:', '“Any person who pursuant to the provisions of former § 11-37-16', 'had a duty to register under that section after having been', 'convicted of any violation of the provisions of chapter 37 of this', 'title * * * shall have the duty to register in accordance with the', 'provisions of this chapter.” (Emphasis added.)\nThat language preserves only Gibson’s duty to register, not its duration.

Of course, the sex offense to which Gibson later pled was in 1993, three years\nprior to the effective date of the Registration Act. See Flores, 714 A.2d at 583.', 'After considering the thoughtful arguments of counsel, we are persuaded that a slightly\ndifferent rationale resolves the question of the duration of Gibson’s duty to register. Starting\nwith § 11-37.1-18, it is clear to us that, in enacting the Registration Act, the Legislature\npreserved Gibson’s duty to register because he had an obligation to do so under the former § 11-\n37-16. Therefore, in our opinion the passage of the Registration Act did not free Gibson from\nthe responsibility to register. However, the General Assembly’s mandate that offenders “shall\nhave the duty to register in accordance with the provisions of [chapter 37.1 of title 11]” included\nthe ten-year duration period set forth in § 11-37.1-4(a). Section 11-37.1-18 (emphasis added). It\nis important to note that the savings clause in § 11-37.1-18 says nothing about the duration of the\nduty to register. Id. (“Nothing in this section shall be construed to abrogate any duty to register\nwhich exists or existed under the provisions of former § 11-37-16.” (Emphasis added.)). This\nclear and unambiguous language constrains us to conclude that, in accordance with chapter 37.1,\nthe duration of Gibson’s duty to register is governed by § 11-37.1-4(a). 10 In other words, when it\nrepealed and replaced § 11-37-16, the General Assembly not only preserved the duty to register\n10', 'Looking at the Registration Act as a whole, we also note that the crime for which Gibson was\nconvicted—second-degree child molestation sexual assault in violation of § 11-37-8.3—is\ndefined in § 11-37.1-3(a)(1) as “a criminal offense against a victim who is a minor[,]” bringing\nGibson within the universe of persons whose annual duty to register is governed by § 11-37.1-\n4(a). See § 11-37.1-4(a) (stating that “[a]ny person required to register under § 11-37.1-3(a)(1)\n* * * shall annually register * * * for a period of ten (10) years from the expiration of sentence\nfor the offense * * *”); § 11-37.1-3(a)(1) (requiring “[a]ny person who, in this or any other\njurisdiction * * * has been convicted of a criminal offense against a victim who is a minor” to\nregister as a sex offender “for the time period specified in § 11-37.1-4”); § 11-37.1-2(e)(3)\n(defining a “[c]riminal offense against a victim who is a minor” to include “[a]ny violation of\n* * * [§] 11-37-8.3”).', '- 10 -\nfrom that statute, but it also imposed the provisions of the new enactment, including the duration\nof registration. 11 Therefore, it is our opinion that Gibson’s duty to register is for a period of ten\nyears, not a lifetime.', 'The next question we must address is, ten years from when? We do not agree with\nGibson that the duration of his duty to register was fixed as of the enactment of the Registration\nAct in 1996. As we explained above, in 1997 and again in 2003, the General Assembly amended\nthe durational period contained in § 11-37.1-4(a), extending it from, in 1996, “ten (10) years\nsubsequent to the date of conviction” to, in 1997, “ten (10) years subsequent to the date of\nrelease from confinement or placement on parole, supervised release or probation” and, as of\n2003, “ten (10) years from the expiration of sentence for the offense * * *.” See P.L. 1996, ch.\n104, § 1; P.L. 1997, ch. 156, § 1; P.L. 2003, ch. 162, § 1; P.L. 2003, ch. 170, § 1; see also § 11-\n37.1-4(a).', 'Those amendments extended Gibson’s duty to register beyond 2004, and, in\naccordance with the provisions of the present version of the Registration Act, see § 11-37.1-18,\nGibson’s duty to register is “ten (10) years from the expiration of sentence for the offense * * *.”\nSection 11-37.1-4(a).', 'Accordingly, it is our opinion that the magistrate was correct in denying Gibson’s motion\nto dismiss the 2012 charge for failing to notify in violation of §§ 11-37.1-9 and 11-37.1-10.\nHowever, we differ from the reasoning on which the magistrate based his decision. Instead, we\nhold that § 11-37.1-18 preserved Gibson’s duty to register, not its duration. Thus, in accordance\n11', 'We offer no opinion as to whether the duration of the duty to register under the former § 11-\n37-16 was a lifetime. Because the duration of Gibson’s duty to register was shoehorned into the\nRegistration Act by virtue of § 11-37.1-18, we need not reach that issue.', '- 11 -\nwith § 11-37.1-18, the duration of Gibson’s duty to register is controlled by § 11-37.1-4(a).\nSimply put, he does not have a lifetime duty to register. 12', 'In reaching this conclusion, however, we do acknowledge that there has been\nunderstandable uncertainty on this issue based on this Court’s previous language in Flores—\nlanguage on which the magistrate relied in his decision. As the magistrate noted, in Flores, “this\nCourt conclude[d] that petitioner must register as a sex offender pursuant to the registration\nrequirements in effect at the time he was charged, that is, pursuant to § 11-37-16.” Flores, 714\nA.2d at 583. Moreover, it is true that this Court “reach[ed] [that] conclusion by noting that the\nregistration requirements of chapter 37.1 of title 11 [did] not apply to petitioner by the clear and\nexpress language of the public law that enacted that statute.”', 'Id.', 'However, Flores is\ndistinguishable from this case. The petitioner in Flores argued that, because of the timing of his\nconviction and the effective date of the Registration Act in 1996, he had no duty to register\nwhatsoever. 13 Id. at 582. Here, however, Gibson contested the duration of his duty to register,\nnot the duty itself. Thus Flores resolved an issue distinct from the issue with which we are\nconfronted here.', 'Despite this Court’s language in Flores regarding the interplay between the effective date\nof the 1996 Registration Act and that particular petitioner’s duty to register, we are firm in our\nview that the provisions of the Registration Act control here.

In his application, Gibson challenged\nhis convictions on constitutional grounds. His primary contention was that each of those failure-\nto-notify convictions violated the ex post facto clause, pointing out two grounds as to why those\nconvictions were constitutionally infirm. First, based on Gibson’s contention that the duration of\nhis duty to register was not for the remainder of his life, but for only ten years, he argued that the\nGeneral Assembly unconstitutionally extended his duty to register when it amended the\nRegistration Act in 1997 and 2003. According to Gibson, the duration of his duty to register was\nset under the 1996 version of § 11-37.1-4, which required him to register “for a period of ten (10)\nyears subsequent to the date of conviction * * *.” See P.L. 1996 ch. 104, § 1.

As\nGibson pointed out, under the 1992 Act, failure to notify was a misdemeanor, but, in 1996, under\nthe Registration Act, it became a felony. See § 11-37-16(g) (1994 Reenactment); P.L. 1996, ch.\n104, § 1. Nevertheless, the hearing justice held that there was no constitutional violation. She\nreasoned that at the time Gibson committed each criminal offense of failing to notify—in 2007,\n2009, and again in 2010—the punishment for the offense was already in place.', 'As she\nexplained, there was no retroactive punishment because the “penalty for failing to [notify] did\nnot change after [Gibson] was charged with the criminal offense of failing to [notify].” The ten-\nyear penalty was added to § 11-37.1-10 in 2003—at least three years prior to Gibson’s first\nfailure-to-notify offense in 2006, an offense for which he was convicted in 2007.', 'However, before turning to the merits of Gibson’s ex post facto arguments, we must\nbriefly summarize the history of the Registration Act.', 'B', 'History of the Registration Act', 'In 1992, the General Assembly enacted § 11-37-16, as enacted by P.L. 1992, ch. 196, § 1,\nimposing on sex offenders a duty to register.

Gibson reasons that, in 1993, when the\noffense that precipitated his 1994 conviction for second-degree child molestation sexual assault\noccurred, he had a duty to register in accordance with the since-repealed § 11-37-16. As\ndiscussed above, in 1996, however, his duty to register—preserved by the savings clause set\nforth in § 11-37.1-18—became governed by the Registration Act, chapter 37.1 of title 11. Under\nthe Registration Act, as it was constituted in 1996, the duty to register for an offender like\nGibson was limited to “ten (10) years subsequent to the date of conviction * * *.” See P.L. 1996,\nch. 104, § 1. Gibson argues that the duration of his duty to register became fixed as of that time,\nmeaning that his duty to register expired in 2004, ten years from the date of his conviction.\nThus, Gibson reasons that, in 1997, when the General Assembly extended the duty to register to\n“ten (10) years subsequent to the date of release from confinement or placement on parole,\nsupervised release or probation[,]” and again in 2003 to “ten (10) years, from the expiration of\nsentence for the offense[,]” it impermissibly increased a punishment—the duty to register—\nannexed to his original crime of second-degree child molestation sexual assault. According to', '1214-15 (R.I. 1991)); see also Calder v. Bull, 3 U.S. 386, 390-91', '(1798).\nGibson focuses on the third category: he alleges an increase in punishment from the one initially\nannexed to the sex offense of 1993.', '- 20 -\nGibson, because his duty to register should have expired in 2004, his convictions for failing to\nnotify in 2007, 2009, and 2010 are unconstitutional because they violate the ex post facto clause.', 'Under our caselaw, however, Gibson’s argument that the duration of his duty to register\namounted to an unconstitutional extension of his punishment does not pass muster. There is a\ndistinction between the imposition of a duty to register as a sex offender, which we have held to\nbe a civil, nonpunitive regulatory measure, and the criminal offense of failing to register or\nnotify. As this Court explained in Germane, “[a]lthough it follows as a consequence of a\ncriminal conviction, sexual offender registration and notification is a civil regulatory process.”\nGermane, 971 A.2d at 593. In Germane, we held that the retroactive imposition of the duty to\nregister did not implicate “the Rhode Island ex post facto clause because the registration\nrequirement is simply part of a nonpunitive, civil regulatory scheme.” Id. The United States\nSupreme Court has held likewise with respect to the federal ex post facto clause. See Smith v.\nDoe I, 538 U.S. 84, 105-06 (holding that Alaska’s sex-offender registration act, modeled after\nMegan’s Law, was “nonpunitive, and its retroactive application [did] not violate the Ex Post\nFacto Clause”). Thus, the duty to register and the civil, nonpunitive regulatory conditions\nattached to that duty did not implicate the ex post facto clause’s prohibition on retroactive penal\nlegislation in Germane.', 'In our opinion, we face precisely the same situation here. Gibson’s core contention is\nthat the combination of changes to the Registration Act transformed his requirement to register\nfrom a civil regulation to a criminal punishment. The duration of his duty to register went from\n(arguably) a lifetime, under the former § 11-37-16, to 2004 (ten years from the date of his\nconviction) under the 1996 Registration Act, to 2009 (ten years from his release or the beginning\nof his parole, supervised release or probation) under the 1997 amendment, and to 2019 (ten years', '- 21 -\nfrom the expiration of his fifteen-year sentence, imposed in 1994) under the 2003 amendment.\nHowever, it is our firm opinion that the ex post facto clause is not implicated here because the\nduration of his duty to register is merely a condition attached to a civil, nonpunitive regulatory\nmeasure. See Germane, 971 A.2d at 593. The extension of his obligation to register from 1996\nonward is the product of the General Assembly’s fine-tuning a civil regulatory scheme, not the\nimposition of retroactive punishment. As the United States Supreme Court has noted, the federal\nex post facto clause “does not preclude a State from making reasonable categorical judgments\nthat conviction of specified crimes should entail particular regulatory consequences.” Doe I, 538\nU.S. at 103-04. We conclude that the same is true of the Rhode Island ex post facto clause; the\nextension of the expiration of Gibson’s duty to register from 2004 to 2019 does not transform a\ncivil, nonpunitive regulatory requirement into retroactive penal legislation. See id.; Germane,\n971 A.2d at 593.', 'Our opinion on this issue gains support from the “intent-effects” test that the United\nStates Supreme Court has applied in determining whether sex-offender registration and\nnotification requirements implicate the ex post facto clause. Under this test, a court first “must\nascertain whether the legislature meant the statute to establish ‘civil’ proceedings.” Doe I, 538\nU.S. at 92 (citation omitted). This requires us to discern the intent of the Legislature:', '“If the intention of the legislature was to impose punishment, that', 'ends the inquiry. If, however, the intention was to enact a', 'regulatory scheme that is civil and nonpunitive, we must further', 'examine whether the statutory scheme is ‘so punitive either in', 'purpose or effect as to negate [the State’s] intention to deem it', 'civil.’” Id. (citation omitted).\nFurthermore, “only the clearest proof will suffice to override legislative intent and transform\nwhat has been denominated a civil remedy into a criminal penalty.” Id. (quoting Hudson v.\nUnited States, 522 U.S. 93, 100 (1997)).', '- 22 -', 'This Court previously has explained that the overall purpose of the Registration Act is\ncivil and nonpunitive:', '“It is evident that the purpose of the Registration Act is not to', 'punish the offending [individual], but rather to protect the safety', 'and general welfare of the public. Supplying the names and', 'addresses of sex offenders to law enforcement agencies enables the', 'agencies to deal more successfully with the serious problem of', 'recidivist sex offenders. * * * [T]he proceeding remains', 'rehabilitative, rather than punitive * * *.” Germane, 971 A.2d at', '593 (quoting In re Richard A., 946 A.2d 204, 213 (R.I. 2008)).\nIn our judgment, with respect to the first prong of the “intent-effects” test, see Doe I, 538 U.S. at\n92-93, the intent behind the specific amendments extending Gibson’s duty to register was\nsimilarly civil and nonpunitive. See Germane, 971 A.2d at 593. In extending the duration of the\nduty to register by amendment in 1997 and 2003, the General Assembly intended not to impose\npunishment, but merely to further the civil, nonpunitive sex-offender registration and notification\nscheme. As we concluded in Germane, we are of the opinion that this was done in furtherance of\n“protect[ing] the safety and general welfare of the public[,]” not for the purpose of imposing\nfurther punishment on Gibson. Id. (quoting In re Richard A., 946 A.2d at 213).', 'Having concluded that the General Assembly’s intent was nonpunitive, we turn next to\nthe “effects” part of the analysis; that is, “whether the statutory scheme is ‘so punitive either in\npurpose or effect as to negate [the General Assembly’s] intention to deem it civil.’” See Doe I,\n538 U.S. at 92. The United States Supreme Court has identified seven factors that serve as\n“useful guideposts” in analyzing whether the effects of a law are sufficiently punitive to\novercome a legislature’s nonpunitive intent. Id. at 97 (quoting Hudson, 522 U.S. at 99). Known\nas the “Mendoza-Martinez factors,” they are: whether the law (1) “has been regarded in our\nhistory and traditions as a punishment”; (2) “imposes an affirmative disability or restraint”; (3)\n“promotes the traditional aims of punishment”; (4) “has a rational connection to a nonpunitive', '- 23 -\npurpose”; (5) “is excessive with respect to this purpose”; (6) “comes into play on a finding of\nscienter”; and (7) “whether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime[.]” Id. at 97, 105.\nAccordingly, our analysis must be whether, after applying those factors, the General Assembly’s\nextension of Gibson’s duty to register evidences a punitive effect or purpose so onerous as to\nnegate its intent to enact a civil, nonpunitive statutory scheme. See id. at 92, 97.', 'It is our considered opinion that the Mendoza-Martinez factors do not militate in\nGibson’s favor. Since we first addressed this issue in 2008, we have considered the registration\nrequirement itself to be nonpunitive. See In re Richard A., 946 A.2d at 213. We are not\npersuaded that the extension of the duration of Gibson’s registration requirement by amendments\nto the Registration Act in 1997 and 2003 strays from that historically nonpunitive intent.\nFurthermore, the duration of the duty to register neither “imposes an affirmative disability or\nrestraint” on Gibson nor does it “promote[] the traditional aims of punishment.” See Doe I, 538\nU.S. at 97. In addition, of particular import, extending the duty to register is not so excessive as\nto stray from the requirement’s purposes, which are to curb recidivism and protect the public.\nSee id.; Germane, 971 A.2d at 593. Finally, the last two factors are of no significance here; there\nis no issue of scienter, and it is well settled that the registration requirement and the duration\nattached thereto flow from the commission of a criminal, sexual offense. See Doe I, 538 U.S. at\n105. Therefore, there is no punitive effect as applied to Gibson, nor were the amendments in\nfurtherance of a punitive purpose. Gibson’s argument that those amendments violate the ex post\nfacto clause of either the federal or state constitutions must therefore fail.', 'We do pause to note, however, that although Gibson’s constitutional right against the\npassage of ex post facto laws has not been violated by the amendments that have been enacted to\ndate, this does not foreclose the possibility that there is some threshold that the General', '- 24 -\nAssembly could someday cross that might lead to a different conclusion. In fact, the New\nHampshire Supreme Court recently held that its state’s sex-offender registration act was so\npunitive in its effects on an offender that it negated the civil, nonpunitive purpose of the\nlegislation. In Doe v. State, 111 A.3d 1077 (N.H. 2015), that court applied the “intent-effects”\ntest to several changes in New Hampshire’s onerous sex-offender registration and notification\nstatute.', 'Doe, 111 A.3d at 1093-1100.', 'While “[n]o one amendment or provision [was]\ndeterminative, * * * the aggregate effects of the statute” compelled the court to hold that the\nstatute “ha[d] a punitive effect as applied to the [offender].” Id. at 1100. The court emphasized\nthat two requirements of the statute were particularly punitive: the lifetime registration\nrequirement and the requirement that the offender register in person. Id. at 1094, 1096, 1100.', 'We are satisfied that the extended duration of Gibson’s duty to register pales in\ncomparison with the situation that was held to be constitutionally deficient in Doe. First, in\ncontrast to the history of Gibson’s duty to register, the first iteration of New Hampshire’s\nregistration statute was passed four years after the Doe offender’s probation ended. Doe, 111\nA.3d at 1082. Further, Gibson, unlike the offender in Doe, has not been subjected to a cascading\neffect of onerous registration requirements.', 'For example, it was significant to the New\nHampshire Supreme Court that the offender there, unlike Gibson, was required to register in\nperson four times per year, a requirement that he had no opportunity to alleviate under the\nregistration statute. Id. at 1094-95, 1096. Also, contrary to Gibson’s present scenario, the law in\nNew Hampshire imposed on the offender a lifetime duty to register, a duration that the court\nconsidered particularly excessive in light of the fact that the offender had not reoffended. See id.\nat 1100. While Gibson, too, has not reoffended, he does not, in our opinion, have a lifetime duty\nto register.', 'Moreover, the offender in Doe suffered from a serious permanent disability,', '- 25 -\nfurthering the court’s conclusion that the more onerous changes to the registration statute had\nconstrained his ability to change addresses. Id. at 1082.', 'Those facts, when churned through the “intent-effects” analytical framework, weigh far\nmore heavily in the Doe offender’s favor than they do in Gibson’s. This is especially true\nbecause we do not believe that the extension of Gibson’s duty to register is excessive in relation\nto the nonpunitive purpose underlying the 1997 and 2003 amendments. See Doe, 111 A.3d at\n1100 (stating that “[a] number of courts give greatest weight” to the factor that asks whether the\nlaw “appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned” (citations omitted)).\nGibson is not subject to a lifetime duty to register, nor must he register in person multiple times\nper year. See id. at 1100. We conclude that the extension of Gibson’s duty to register is an\nexample of the General Assembly’s modification of the civil, nonpunitive regulatory\nrequirements of the Registration Act, and nothing more.', '2', 'The Penalty for Failure to Register or Notify: From a Misdemeanor to a Felony', 'Gibson also argues that the General Assembly’s enhancement of the punishment for\nfailing to notify from a misdemeanor to a felony violates the ex post facto clause. Again, we\ndisagree. It is true that in 1993, when the offense that precipitated his 1994 conviction for\nsecond-degree child molestation sexual assault occurred, the failure to register as a sex offender\nor notify local law enforcement was a misdemeanor, punishable by ninety days in jail and one\nyear probation. See P.L. 1992, ch. 196, § 1. It is also true that, in 1996, the failure to register or\nnotify became a felony, punishable by up to two years in jail and fines of up to $2,000, see P.L.\n1996, ch. 104, § 1, penalties which were increased in 2003 when the sentence for failing to', '- 26 -\nregister or notify became up to ten years in jail and fines of up to $10,000. See § 11-37.1-10(a);\nP.L. 2003, ch. 162, § 1; P.L. 2003, ch. 170, § 1.', 'However, what Gibson’s argument overlooks is that at the times when he failed to notify\nin multiple years, leading to his convictions in 2007, 2009, and 2010, the punishment for that\ncrime already was in full force and effect. See §§ 11-37.1-9, 11-37.1-10(a); P.L. 2003, ch. 162,\n§ 1; P.L. 2003, ch. 170, § 1. Furthermore, his failures to notify were offenses separate and apart\nfrom the second-degree child molestation sexual assault of 1993, rendering them insufficiently\nannexed to that crime as to trigger a violation of the ex post facto clause. See State v. Pelz, 765\nA.2d 824, 830-31 (R.I. 2001). Therefore, there has been no retroactive punishment and no ex\npost facto violation. See Pereira, 973 A.2d at 32. Accordingly, as applied to Gibson, the\namended statutory framework does not violate the ex post facto clause.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth above, we affirm in part and quash in part the decision of the\nmagistrate on the motion to dismiss. We affirm that part of the decision denying the motion to\ndismiss, but reverse the magistrate’s ruling that Gibson has a lifetime duty to register as a sex\noffender. With respect to the application for postconviction relief, we affirm the judgment\ndenying relief, but reverse the hearing justice’s ruling that Gibson’s obligation to register is for\nthe remainder of his life. 18 The papers in this case are remanded to the Superior Court for further\nproceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n18', 'We note that the hearing justice who denied Gibson’s application for postconviction relief\nconcluded that Gibson’s duty to register, if not a lifetime in length, will expire in November\n2030.

In the Matter of B.H.","['Id.', 'This Court then\nacknowledged that “[s]tate and federal appellate courts have long exercised the power to reverse', '- 20 -\na conviction while at the same time ordering the entry of judgment on a lesser-included offense.”\nId. (quoting Dickenson v. Israel, 482 F.Supp. 1223, 1225 (E.D. Wis. 1980)). But, noting that our\nCourt had “never availed itself of the opportunity to adopt this practice,” it nonetheless\ndetermined that it would employ it in Eiseman because the evidence of guilt was overwhelming,\nbecause the defendant had conceded at trial and on appeal that the state had proven beyond a\nreasonable doubt that he indeed possessed cocaine, and that, as a result, there would be no\nprejudice to the defendant if this Court simply ordered the Superior Court to enter judgment on\nthe lesser-included offense. Id. Therefore, the Court concluded “that a reduction of [the]\ndefendant’s conviction to the lesser-included offense * * * would serve the interests of justice\nand would not prejudice [the] defendant since the sufficiency of evidence on this charge is\nuncontroverted on appeal.” Id.', 'The rationale employed in Eiseman is singular in our jurisprudential history and it simply\nis not appropriate for the case before us at present.', 'Here, respondent has not conceded\nculpability, the evidence is not uncontroverted on appeal, and respondent would be manifestly\nprejudiced on remand. The majority here is significantly departing from our well-settled law and\nembracing what it maintains is the rationale of Eiseman in ordering the entry of judgment on a\nlesser-included offense. It has done this despite the fact that the Eiseman Court specifically\nexplained that the Court had never before adopted such a practice. We have been unable to find\nany other case in which we employed that approach after doing so in Eiseman. Furthermore, it is\nsignificant that, in each of the cases cited in Eiseman as examples of appellate courts exercising\nthe power to modify a judgment, none of those courts wielded that power sua sponte, as the\nmajority does here. See United States v.

The two complainants, Kevin and Henry, are twin brothers who were eleven years\nold at the time of the offenses.1 The state alleged that respondent committed first-degree child\nmolestation against Kevin and Henry when he forced the victims to penetrate his anus with their\npenises and that he committed second-degree child molestation when he touched Kevin’s penis\nwith his hand.2 Because the testimony of the two complainants is central to the primary issue\nrespondent raises on appeal, we recount it in some detail.', 'The conduct giving rise to all three offenses occurred during a sleepover in August 2011.\nAfter a day of fishing, Kevin, Henry, and respondent had a sleepover at the home of the twins’\nmaternal grandparents. During the sleepover, the three boys shared the same room. Kevin\ntestified that, after the three boys had retired to the bedroom that evening, respondent asked\nKevin to put Kevin’s penis “in [respondent’s] butt.” Because Kevin trusted respondent, who was\nhis best friend, and because respondent threatened to tell his grandmother “something” if he\nrefused, Kevin complied. When asked whether his penis went “inside of [respondent’s] butt,”\nKevin responded in the affirmative. Kevin also testified that respondent expressed a desire to\ninsert respondent’s penis into Kevin’s “butt” but that Kevin refused. On cross-examination, it\nbecame apparent that Kevin was unable to recall the specifics of this episode with any great\ndetail, and he repeatedly stated that he did not remember the details. However, Kevin was\n1', 'To afford the complainants a measure of privacy, we use fictitious names to identify them.\n2', 'The trial justice ultimately concluded that the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat respondent committed second-degree child molestation by touching Kevin’s penis, and this\nfinding is not pertinent to the issues on appeal. Accordingly, we have no need to discuss the\nevidence relating to this charge.', '-2-\nemphatic that his penis went “in” and “inside” respondent’s “butt.”3 It is evident from the\ntranscript that it was difficult for Kevin to testify about what transpired during the sleepover.\nThe trial justice later explained in her bench decision that Kevin “was noticeably upset, crying,\n[and] sometimes almost sobbing” during the course of his testimony.', 'Like Kevin, Henry had difficulty testifying about this episode; he testified that “I don’t\nlike talking about it.” The trial justice later described each twin as “visibly shaken” during his\ntestimony. Henry’s testimony was similar to his brother’s. He testified that respondent proposed\nthat the boys engage in “[a]n experiment to see if we wanted to be gay” and that the experiment\nwas “[t]o stick my penis in his butt.”', 'Henry testified that he placed his penis “inside\n[respondent’s] butt.”4 Like Kevin, Henry explained that he complied with respondent’s request\nbecause respondent threatened to tell his grandmother that they “were trying to do something” if\nhe did not. Henry also testified that respondent placed his penis on Henry’s body and that he,\nlike his brother, refused to allow respondent to insert his penis into Henry’s “butt.” As was true\nfor Kevin’s testimony, cross-examination revealed that Henry could not recall many specifics of\nthe episode. Nevertheless, when defense counsel asked whether Henry put his penis “inside of\n[respondent],” Henry responded that he did.', 'On redirect examination, Henry was asked,\n“[W]hen you mean [respondent’s] butt, what is that part of [the] body used for?” Henry did not\nanswer this question.5\n3', 'Henry also testified that he observed Kevin “[stick] his penis in [respondent’s] butt.”\n4', 'Confirming Henry’s testimony, Kevin testified that he observed his brother “[p]utting his penis\nin [respondent’s] butt.”\n5', 'During closing argument, the state asserted that “[Henry] clarified that [the term] ‘butt’ [meant]\nthe part of the body that one uses to poop.” However, this assertion does not comport with the\ntranscript of the delinquency proceeding. The pertinent passage of the transcript reads as\nfollows:', '-3-', 'The twins’ mother testified that, when she picked up her children the day after the\nsleepover, a hysterical Kevin told her that “[respondent] wanted them to do it in the bum bum of\nthem, and * * * [respondent] looks like he enjoyed it.” Finally, Det. Sean Maloney of the\nCranston Police Department testified that, after he explained the arraignment procedure in\nFamily Court to respondent, respondent stated: “I understand. I did it. I did not force them. It\nwas experimental.”', 'At the close of the state’s case, respondent moved to dismiss the petitions. With respect\nto the first-degree child molestation charges, defense counsel argued that the twins’ testimony\nthat they placed their penises “in” or “inside” respondent’s “butt” was insufficient to establish\nsexual penetration—an essential element of the offense.', 'Defense counsel also argued—\nincorrectly, we conclude—that, if the state had established sexual penetration, the state was\nrequired, in the circumstances of this case, to prove that respondent “acted with the intent for\nsexual arousal or sexual gratification” and that it had not done so.', 'The trial justice denied respondent’s motion, concluding that the testimony of both Kevin\nand Henry was sufficient to establish sexual penetration. The trial justice explained her rationale\nas follows:', '“[I]n or inside the butt, as described by each victim, is more than', 'sufficient to satisfy the requirement of the statute for sexual', 'penetration.

In passing on the sufficiency of the evidence, “the\nrelevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the\nprosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.” Jackson v.

In re Miguel A.,\n990 A.2d at 1223 (reciting a similar standard for this Court’s review of a motion for a judgment\nof acquittal).', 'Analysis', 'Sufficiency of Evidence on Sexual Penetration', 'The respondent argues that the evidence in this case, which establishes, at most, that\nKevin and Henry each inserted his penis “in” and “inside” respondent’s “butt,” is insufficient to\nestablish sexual penetration—an essential element of the offense of first-degree child\nmolestation. We agree.', 'Section 11-37-8.1 provides that “[a] person is guilty of first[-]degree child molestation\nsexual assault if he or she engages in sexual penetration with a person fourteen (14) years of age\nor under.” (Emphasis added.) In turn, § 11-37-1(8) defines the term “[s]exual penetration” as\nfollows:', '“‘Sexual penetration’ means sexual intercourse,', 'cunnilingus, fellatio, and anal intercourse, or any other intrusion,', 'however slight, by any part of a person’s body or by any object', 'into the genital or anal openings of another person’s body, or the', 'victim’s own body upon the accused’s instruction, but emission of', 'semen is not required.”', '-6-\nThis case requires us to decide whether testimony that Kevin’s and Henry’s penises were “inside\nof [respondent’s] butt” is sufficient to establish “anal intercourse[] or any other intrusion,\nhowever slight, by any part of a person’s body or by an object into the * * * anal opening[] of\nanother person’s body * * *.” Id. We unanimously hold that this evidence is not sufficient.', 'Although the focus below and in the briefs on appeal was whether the evidence was\nsufficient to establish an “intrusion, however slight, * * * into the * * * anal opening[],” § 11-37-\n1(8), the state contended at oral argument that what transpired during the sleepover qualifies as\n“anal intercourse” as that term is used in the statute. We reject this assertion. The terms “sexual\nintercourse” and “anal intercourse” are not defined in § 11-37-1. Dictionaries typically provide a\nprimary definition of “sexual intercourse” that involves the penetration of the vagina by the\npenis.6 See, e.g., Mosby’s Medical, Nursing, and Allied Health Dictionary 276, 1075 (3d ed.\n1990) (Mosby’s) (defining “sexual intercourse” and “coitus” as “the sexual union of two people\nof opposite sex in which the penis is introduced into the vagina”); Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate\nDictionary 1074 (10th ed. 1997) (Merriam-Webster’s) (defining “sexual intercourse” as\n“heterosexual intercourse involving penetration of the vagina by the penis”). Although the\nparties have not cited, and we have not found, a dictionary definition of the term “anal\nintercourse,” we are persuaded that that term, like sexual intercourse, involves penetration by the\npenis. Therefore, the term “anal intercourse” means penetration of the anal opening by a penis.\nSee State v. DeLeonardo, 340 S.E.2d 350, 353 (N.C. 1986) (“Anal intercourse requires\npenetration of the anal opening of the victim by the penis of the male.”); 70C Am. Jur. 2d\n6', 'When confronted with an undefined term contained in G.L. 1956 § 11-37-1(8), we turn to\ndictionary definitions for that term. See, e.g., In re Ryan B., 739 A.2d 232, 235 n.2 (R.I. 1999)\n(consulting dictionary definition for term “fellatio”); State v. Beaulieu, 674 A.2d 377, 378 (R.I.\n1996) (same for term “cunnilingus”).', '-7-\nSodomy § 3 at 644 (2011) (“One act that is almost universally prohibited by sodomy statutes is\nanal intercourse, which requires the penetration of the anal opening of the victim by the penis of\na male.”); cf. State v. Bryant, 670 A.2d 776, 778, 783 (R.I. 1996) (referring to “count 3[, which\ncharged ‘anal intercourse,’] where anal penetration by the penis was charged and found to have\noccurred”).', 'Thus, if the twins’ testimony established only an intrusion into the area between\nrespondent’s buttocks and not an intrusion into respondent’s anal opening, such an intrusion does\nnot constitute anal intercourse. See State v. Gallagher, 668 A.2d 55, 61 (N.J. Super. Ct. App.\nDiv. 1995) (“While insertion of the penis between the left and right buttocks may be sufficient to\nprove sexual contact in that there is a touching of the victim’s intimate part, it is not sufficient to\nprove anal intercourse.”). The precise issue we must decide, then, is whether the testimony of\neach twin that his penis went “in” and “inside” respondent’s “butt” is sufficient to qualify as an\nintrusion into the anal opening.', 'The word “butt” in the context in which it was used by Kevin and Henry is slang for\nbuttocks. See 1 J.E. Lighter, Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang 333\n(1994); Richard A. Spears, NTC’s Dictionary of American Slang and Colloquial Expressions 61\n(3d ed. 2000); Kenneth G. Wilson, The Columbia Guide to Standard American English 82\n(1993); see also Merriam-Webster’s, at 155. The buttocks are defined as “[t]he prominence\nformed by the gluteal muscles of either side.” Stedman’s Medical Dictionary 283 (28th ed.\n2006) (Stedman’s); see also Dorland’s Illustrated Medical Dictionary 248 (27th ed. 1988)\n(defining “buttock” as “one of the gluteal prominences; called also clunis or breech and, in the\nplural, nates”); Mosby’s, at 795 (defining “nates” and “buttocks” as “the large fleshy\nprotuberances at the lower posterior portion of the torso comprising fat and the gluteal', '-8-\nmuscles”). The anus or anal orifice, by contrast, is defined as “[t]he lower opening of the\ndigestive tract. It is associated with the anal sphincter and lies in the cleft between the buttocks,\nthrough which fecal matter is extruded.” Stedman’s, at 114. “The words [buttocks and anus] are\nnot synonyms as they describe entirely different parts of the anatomy.” Downey v. State, 726\nN.E.2d 794, 797 (Ind. Ct. App. 2000).', 'When enacting the chapter of our general laws relating to sexual assault, the General\nAssembly drew a distinction between the buttocks and the anus.', 'The term “sexual\npenetration”—an essential element of first-degree sexual assault, see § 11-37-2, and first-degree\nchild molestation, see § 11-37-8.1—is defined to include intrusions into the “anal opening[].”\nSection 11-37-1(8). By contrast, the offenses of second-degree sexual assault and second-degree\nchild molestation require “sexual contact.” Section 11-37-4; § 11-37-8.3. Sexual contact is\ndefined as “the intentional touching of the victim’s or accused’s intimate parts, clothed or\nunclothed, if that intentional touching can be reasonably construed as intended by the accused to\nbe for the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification, or assault.” Section 11-37-1(7). In turn, the\nphrase “[i]ntimate parts” is defined as “the genital or anal areas, groin, inner thigh, or buttock of\nany person or the breast of a female.” Section 11-37-1(3) (emphases added). It is clear from this\ncarefully constructed statutory framework that the General Assembly appreciated the distinction\nbetween the buttocks and the anus or anal opening.', 'This Court’s decision in State v. McDonald, 602 A.2d 923 (R.I. 1992), is instructive. In\nthat case, the defendant was charged with first-degree sexual assault arising from digital\npenetration of the complainant’s vagina. Id. at 924, 925. The complainant testified that the\ndefendant “touched her ‘in the vagina.’” Id. at 924. She also testified that the defendant had\n“touched her ‘in the breasts.’” Id. at 925. We held that this evidence was insufficient to', '-9-\nestablish sexual penetration. Id. In so holding, we explained that, “in respect to such a serious\nallegation [as digital vaginal penetration], precise and specific testimony is necessary to support\nit” and that “[t]o infer penetration from [the complainant’s] testimony would be to draw an\ninference that could scarcely justify a finding of digital penetration beyond a reasonable doubt.”\nId.', 'In this case, the necessary precise and specific testimony was lacking. The twins’ use of\nthe term “butt” rendered their testimony too imprecise and vague on the pertinent question of\nwhether sexual penetration occurred in this case: that is, whether there was an intrusion, however\nslight, into respondent’s anal opening. In reaching this conclusion, we necessarily reject the trial\njustice’s reasoning that “[i]n or inside the butt is certainly where the anal opening is located.”\nThis circumstance is beside the point. To sustain a prosecution for first-degree child molestation,\nthe state had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that sexual penetration—an\nintrusion into an anal opening in the circumstances of this case—occurred. By eliciting only\ntestimony about an intrusion into respondent’s “butt,” the state failed to carry its burden.', 'An\nintrusion into the space between a person’s buttocks, while perhaps a necessary step on the path\nto intrusion of the anal opening, is not, in itself, an intrusion into the anal opening. See Downey,\n726 N.E.2d at 798 (“Despite their proximity, the buttocks and anus are not the same, and an\ninference that contact with the buttocks necessarily includes contact with the anus[7] cannot be\nmade beyond a reasonable doubt in this case.”).', 'Although we reaffirm today that “precise and specific testimony is necessary to support”\na prosecution for first-degree sexual assault or first-degree child molestation, McDonald, 602\n7', 'Unlike Rhode Island’s first-degree child molestation statute, which requires an intrusion,\nhowever slight, into the anal opening, the statute in Downey v.

Walsh, 113 R.I.\n118, 122-23, 318 A.2d 463, 466 (1974) (“[General Laws 1956] § 12-17-14 is but a reaffirmation\nof the common[-]law rule that where an indictment charges an offense which includes within it\nanother lesser offense, it is sufficient to prove so much of the charge as demonstrates that the\naccused is guilty of a crime therein contained, although not to the full extent charged against', '- 14 -\nrespondent delinquent on the greater offense, the trial justice necessarily found that all of the\nelements of the lesser-included offense had been met. In fact, it was respondent who argued that\nthe state was required to prove that he acted with the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification,\nand the trial justice complied, finding beyond a reasonable doubt that respondent acted with such\nintent.12 On appeal, respondent argues that there was insufficient evidence to support this\nfinding. We reject this contention.', 'In State v. Erminelli, 991 A.2d 1064 (R.I. 2010), we held that evidence that the defendant\n“intentionally touched [the complainant’s] naked buttocks with his penis” was sufficient to\nsustain a conviction for second-degree child molestation because “[s]uch contact ‘can be\nreasonably construed as intended by [the defendant] to be for the purpose of sexual arousal,\ngratification, or assault.’” Id. at 1070 (quoting § 11-37-1(7)). Similarly, in this case, there is\nsufficient evidence that the contact between respondent’s “butt” and the twins’ penises can be\nreasonably construed as intended by respondent to be for the purpose of sexual arousal or\ngratification. The trial justice found that respondent, by asking the twins to penetrate his “butt”\nwith their penises and by voluntarily engaging in the act of contact between his intimate parts\nand those of Kevin and Henry, acted “for the sole and exclusive purpose of sexual gratification\nor arousal.” She further noted that respondent’s expressed desire to switch roles with Kevin and\nhim. * * * Consequently, a defendant is charged with the knowledge that an accusation of the\ngreater crime carries with it the charge that he has committed all the necessarily included lesser\noffenses that make up the greater crime. He will not be heard to complain that he is not prepared\nto defend against the lesser offenses or that the statute authorizing the return of a guilty verdict\non the lesser offenses deprives him of his constitutional right to a presentment on indictment\nrelative to the ‘infamous crime’ which the jury believes he has committed.”).\n12', 'The dissent characterizes the trial justice’s action in this regard as “mention[ing], almost as an\naside, that the element of sexual gratification was present.” In our opinion, this is not accurate.\nIn the course of three paragraphs of her bench decision, the trial justice explained that she was\n“convinced” that respondent acted “for the sole and exclusive purpose of sexual gratification or\narousal” and that “[t]here was no other reason or purpose” for respondent’s conduct.', '- 15 -\nHenry and put his penis on or in their intimate parts was further evidence of his purpose in\nengaging in this conduct.', 'Moreover, the twins’ mother testified that Kevin told her that\nrespondent “look[ed] like he enjoyed it.” After viewing the evidence in the light most favorable\nto the prosecution, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to\nconclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the contact between respondent and the twins can be\nreasonably construed as intended by respondent to be for the purpose of sexual arousal,\ngratification, or assault. See Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319.', 'Contrary to respondent’s suggestion, the mere fact that he characterized the exchange as\nan “experiment” does not foreclose this conclusion. Cf. State v. Rossi, 520 A.2d 582, 583, 584\n(R.I. 1987) (rejecting sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge in second-degree child molestation\ncase where the defendant argued that the purpose of the contact between his penis and the minor\ncomplainant’s vaginal area was to rehearse the minor’s testimony that she was molested by the\ndefendant’s landlord, a story that was concocted by the defendant to combat a rent increase\nimposed by the landlord; the Court explained that, when “view[ing] the evidence in the light\nmost favorable to the prosecution, drawing all reasonable inferences therefrom, one can\nreasonably infer from this record that when [the defendant] was ‘contacting’ the eight-year-old\nafter removing all her clothing, other things were on his mind than attempting to gain revenge on\nhis landlord for increasing the rent”). The evidence was sufficient on this element.', 'When, as in this case, this Court determines on appeal that the evidence adduced at a\nbench trial was insufficient only on the element that differentiates the greater offense from the\nlesser-included offense, such that a conviction or adjudication on the greater offense cannot be\nupheld, we have directed the entry of judgment on the lesser-included offense. See State v.\nEiseman, 461 A.2d 369, 383-84 (R.I. 1983), abrogated in part on other grounds by Horton v.', '- 16 -\nCalifornia, 496 U.S. 128 (1990).13', 'Therefore, we remand this matter to Family Court with\ndirections to enter an adjudication of delinquency on the lesser-included offense of second-\ndegree child molestation and for resentencing.', 'Although the dissent suggests that we are “significantly departing from our well-settled\nlaw,” our remand in this case follows from a straightforward application of the law of lesser-\nincluded offenses. On the way to adjudging the respondent delinquent on the greater offense, the\ntrial justice necessarily adjudged him delinquent on the lesser-included offense. See Douglas v.\nJacquez, 626 F.3d 501, 506 (9th Cir. 2010) (“[The defendant] was convicted of the greater\noffense [of arson of an inhabited structure]. On the way to finding him guilty of arson of an\ninhabited structure, the [factfinder] had necessarily found adequate proof that [the defendant]\ncommitted [the lesser-included offense,] arson of a structure. * * * In this circumstance, the\nprosecution necessarily already proved the elements of a lesser-included offense.”). Therefore,\nthat the respondent has not conceded culpability and the evidence is not uncontroverted on\nappeal is entirely beside the point. As a matter of law, the respondent has been adjudged\ndelinquent on the lesser-included offense because the trial justice’s adjudication of delinquency\non the greater offense necessarily included an adjudication of delinquency on the lesser-included\noffense. There is no way to avoid this conclusion.\n13', 'The dissent points out that §§ 12-17-14 and 11-37-9 refer only to the trial court’s authority to\nfind a defendant guilty on a lesser-included offense. This is true, because criminal cases arise in\nthe trial court, but it is beside the point in this case. We cite these statutes merely to establish\nthat respondent was, as a matter of law, on notice of the lesser-included offense. Our authority to\nremand for entry of judgment of conviction or adjudication on a lesser-included offense does not\ndepend on an express grant of such power by the General Assembly. To the contrary, as we\nexplained in State v. Eiseman, 461 A.2d 369 (R.I. 1983), “[s]tate and federal appellate courts\nhave long exercised the power to reverse a conviction while at the same time ordering the entry\nof judgment on a lesser-included offense.” Id. at 384 (quoting Dickenson v. Israel, 482 F. Supp.\n1223, 1225 (E.D. Wis. 1980)).', '- 17 -', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons articulated above, we conclude that the evidence was insufficient to\nsustain the Family Court’s adjudications of delinquency on the two charges of first-degree child\nmolestation.', 'Accordingly, we remand this case to Family Court with directions to enter\nadjudications of delinquency on the lesser-included offense of second-degree child molestation\nand for resentencing.', 'Justice Flaherty with whom Justice Robinson joins, concurring in part and\ndissenting in part. We concur with the majority’s well-reasoned and articulate conclusion that\nthere was insufficient evidence at trial of penetration to sustain a finding of delinquency by\nreason of first-degree child molestation sexual assault. However, we depart from the majority\nwhen it concludes that this case should be remanded to the Family Court for entry of judgment of\nadjudication of delinquency by reason of second-degree child molestation sexual assault\n(second-degree child molestation), a lesser-included offense.', 'It is our opinion that this Court’s ruling is grossly unfair to this respondent because, in the\nFamily Court, this case was tried solely as a case of first-degree child molestation sexual assault.\nThere was no argument by either party that the trial justice should make a finding of second-\ndegree child molestation if she found insufficient evidence of first-degree child molestation.\nAlthough the trial justice did mention, almost as an aside, that the element of sexual gratification\nwas present, that was neither necessary for her finding of first-degree child molestation nor was\nit an essential part of her decision. When the case was appealed to this Court, neither party\nbriefed nor argued that the respondent could be adjudicated as delinquent because he committed\nan act of second-degree child molestation. Indeed, on appeal, the state’s sole argument was that', '- 18 -\nthe evidence was sufficient to prove penile penetration to support an adjudication of delinquency\non first-degree child molestation. As a result, the unsuspecting respondent has been waylaid by\nthe sua sponte decision of this Court.', 'We agree with the majority that second-degree child molestation is a lesser-included\noffense of first-degree child molestation. See State v. Silvia, 798 A.2d 419, 424-25 (R.I. 2002);\nState v. Malouin, 433 A.2d 176, 178 (R.I. 1981). However, it is our opinion that that does not\nprovide an adequate basis for allowing this respondent to be subjected to further proceedings. In\neach case decided by this Court involving the interplay between greater and lesser-included\noffenses, the controversy has been initiated in the trial court, either because a trial justice refused\nto charge or decide on a lesser-included offense or because, over the defendant’s objection, the\ntrial justice actually did so. See Silvia, 798 A.2d at 424 (citing G.L. 1956 § 11-37-9 on joinder\nof offenses for the trial court’s authority to enter judgment on lesser-included offenses). We are\naware of no case in which this Court, on its own initiative and without argument of the parties or\na decision in a trial court, remanded for entry of judgment on a lesser-included offense after\nvacating a conviction based on insufficient evidence.', 'The majority cites two statutes, G.L. 1956 § 12-17-14 and § 11-37-9, to support its\nreasoning that respondent was on notice of all lesser-included offenses. Section 12-17-14 says,', '“[w]henever any person is tried upon an indictment, information,', 'or complaint and the court or jury, as the case may be, shall not be', 'satisfied that he or she is guilty of the whole offense, * * * the', 'court or jury may find him or her guilty of the lower offense or', 'guilty of an attempt to commit the offense, as the case may be, and', 'the court shall proceed to sentence the person for the offense', '* * *.”\nIn adopting this language, the General Assembly was clearly referring to the trial court, not this\nCourt. Similarly, § 11-37-9 provides that, “If upon trial the jury shall acquit the person of any of', '- 19 -\nthe charges of sexual assault and shall find him or her guilty of any of the other offenses,\njudgment and sentence may be entered against him or her accordingly.” The wording of this\nstatute, likewise, can lead to no rational conclusion other than that the General Assembly was\nreferring to the trial court and only the trial court. Although we do not disagree with the majority\nthat respondent was on notice when he went to trial that he could be found delinquent on any\nlesser-included offense, that fact does nothing to support the majority’s disposition in this matter.', 'Rather, the majority claims to derive authority for directing entry of delinquency on the\nlesser-included offense from this Court’s decision in State v. Eiseman, 461 A.2d 369, 384 (R.I.\n1983), abrogated in part on other grounds by Horton v. California, 496 U.S. 128 (1990). In\nEiseman, the defendant was charged with possession with intent to deliver cocaine. Id. at 372.\nAfter a justice of the Superior Court denied his motion in limine to suppress the cocaine, the\ndefendant conceded during a bench trial that the quantity of cocaine found in his possession was\nwholly consistent with personal use, but argued that it was not sufficient to support a conviction\nfor possession with intent to deliver. Id. Nonetheless, the trial justice found the defendant guilty\nof the greater offense. Id.', 'On appeal, this Court agreed with the defendant. Eiseman, 461 A.2d at 383. Having\narrived at that conclusion, the Court then found itself in a quandary about how to resolve the\ncase. Id. at 383-84. We observed that, “in a jury trial of a charge of possession with intent to\ndeliver, the trial justice would instruct the jury on the elements of the lesser offense,” and that it\ncould find him guilty of that lesser charge. Id. at 384. This Court further noted that “[c]learly,\nthis alternative was available to the trial justice in this case if he had determined, as he should\nhave, that the state had failed to prove intent to deliver * * *.”', 'Id.', 'This Court then\nacknowledged that “[s]tate and federal appellate courts have long exercised the power to reverse', '- 20 -\na conviction while at the same time ordering the entry of judgment on a lesser-included offense.”\nId. (quoting Dickenson v. Israel, 482 F.Supp. 1223, 1225 (E.D. Wis. 1980)). But, noting that our\nCourt had “never availed itself of the opportunity to adopt this practice,” it nonetheless\ndetermined that it would employ it in Eiseman because the evidence of guilt was overwhelming,\nbecause the defendant had conceded at trial and on appeal that the state had proven beyond a\nreasonable doubt that he indeed possessed cocaine, and that, as a result, there would be no\nprejudice to the defendant if this Court simply ordered the Superior Court to enter judgment on\nthe lesser-included offense. Id. Therefore, the Court concluded “that a reduction of [the]\ndefendant’s conviction to the lesser-included offense * * * would serve the interests of justice\nand would not prejudice [the] defendant since the sufficiency of evidence on this charge is\nuncontroverted on appeal.” Id.', 'The rationale employed in Eiseman is singular in our jurisprudential history and it simply\nis not appropriate for the case before us at present.', 'Here, respondent has not conceded\nculpability, the evidence is not uncontroverted on appeal, and respondent would be manifestly\nprejudiced on remand. The majority here is significantly departing from our well-settled law and\nembracing what it maintains is the rationale of Eiseman in ordering the entry of judgment on a\nlesser-included offense. It has done this despite the fact that the Eiseman Court specifically\nexplained that the Court had never before adopted such a practice. We have been unable to find\nany other case in which we employed that approach after doing so in Eiseman. Furthermore, it is\nsignificant that, in each of the cases cited in Eiseman as examples of appellate courts exercising\nthe power to modify a judgment, none of those courts wielded that power sua sponte, as the\nmajority does here. See United States v. Swiderski, 548 F.2d 445, 452 (2nd Cir. 1977) (case had\nbeen tried twice and government argued that the appellate court should enter judgment on lesser-', '- 21 -\nincluded offense); Austin v. United States, 382 F.2d 129, 140, 142-43 (D.C. Cir. 1967) (federal\nstatute conferred power to modify judgments only where no prejudice results to the defendant;\ncourt found that the defendant had a full and fair adjudication on all elements of the lesser-\nincluded offense and based his defense on insanity, which the jury clearly rejected); State v.\nGrant, 411 A.2d 917, 920 n.6 (Conn. 1979) (noting that the jury was instructed on both burglary\nin the first degree and the lesser-included offense of burglary in the third degree); Miller v. State,\n426 A.2d 842, 844 (Del. 1981) (the defendant specifically requested instruction on lesser-\nincluded offense of second-degree arson and was denied by the trial judge); State v. Smith, 603\nP.2d 638, 642 (Kan. Ct. App. 1979) (lesser-included offense of possession is not contested);\nPeople v. Monaco, 197 N.E.2d 532, 534 (N.Y. 1964) (the defendant argued on appeal that the\nmost the facts could support was the lesser-included offense of manslaughter in the first degree).', 'Thus, by remanding for entry of judgment, the majority’s decision greatly expands the\nholding enunciated by this Court in Eiseman. As a result, it is our firm opinion that a remand to\nthe trial court for entry of judgment on second-degree child molestation unfairly prejudices the\nrespondent.', 'For these reasons, we respectfully dissent from the opinion of the majority.

In her statement to the police, Lisa explained\nthat she had “been friends with Devina since the both of [them] attended middle school\ntogether.” She further stated that “Devina lives on Anthony St[reet] * * * in a white house.”\nAccording to Lisa’s statement, on the evening of the incident, defendant invited her into his\nhome and then attempted to have sex with her.', 'On August 15, 2008, defendant also made a statement to the East Providence police, in\nwhich he confirmed that Lisa had visited his home and admitted to touching Lisa on her hip,\nbuttocks, and breasts.

Defense counsel then learned during a\ndiscussion that took place in chambers on the previous morning that Lisa was now expected to\ntestify that she went to defendant’s house on the evening of the incident because she had heard\nthat Devina was visiting from out of town. Defense counsel requested that the new statement be\nexcluded or that the state provide her with additional information about the circumstances\nsurrounding Lisa’s decision to alter her statement. Specifically, counsel asked the prosecutor to\ndisclose when he had learned that Lisa was changing her statement; who was present when the\nnew statement was made; and who and/or what had prompted the change.', 'In response to defense counsel’s motions, the prosecutor informed the trial justice that he\nand a victims’ services advocate had met with Lisa on Friday, June 3, 2011 at the Attorney\nGeneral’s offices.

Lisa answered, “I told the police that. They\nprobably didn’t write it down[.]”', 'At one point during cross-examination, the court recessed and defense counsel renewed\nher earlier motion for supplemental discovery. Defense counsel argued that, in order for her to\neffectively cross-examine Lisa, the state needed to disclose all of the circumstances surrounding\nLisa’s new statement, including everyone who was present at the meeting, if there were any\nnotes from the meeting, and if Devina’s testimony was discussed. The trial justice denied the\nmotion, reasoning that the information that the state had provided earlier that morning was\nsufficient. After the jury returned, cross-examination concluded and the state completed redirect\nexamination of Lisa.', 'When recross-examination began, defense counsel asked Lisa to review a portion of her\nstatement from August 7, 2008. Lisa responded, “Before I read this, we revised this at my\nattorney’s office. We went over it and we highlighted the parts that weren’t accurate and I put in\nthe rest of the information.” Lisa then revealed that her father had also been present during her\nmeeting with the prosecutor on Friday, June 3. Lisa indicated that her father had made some\nhandwritten additions to her statement. Defense counsel asked Lisa if the prosecutor had spoken\nwith her on Friday about Devina’s expected testimony. Lisa explained that, during the meeting,\nshe had spoken on the telephone with another prosecutor who had previously worked on her\ncase. According to Lisa, the other prosecutor had informed her that Devina would be coming', '-4-\nfrom Georgia to Rhode Island to testify. She admitted that the other prosecutor specifically\nquestioned her about why she went to defendant’s house on August 6, 2008 if Devina had\nalready moved to Georgia at that time. Lisa insisted, however, that the Friday meeting was not\nthe first time that she had mentioned hearing that Devina was visiting from out of town. She\nmaintained that she had given this information to the police when she first met with them the day\nafter the incident.', 'The trial justice then allowed the prosecutor to conduct further redirect examination,\nduring which the prosecutor had the following exchange with Lisa:', '“[Prosecutor]: * * * you made—actually, you didn’t make the', 'marks on the statement, right, your father did?', '“[Lisa]: Yes.', '“[Prosecutor]: All right.

She emphasized that the information that the\nprosecutor was now using to lead the witness on re-redirect examination was exactly the kind of', '-5-\ninformation she had repeatedly asked him to disclose in her requests for supplemental discovery.\nIn response, the prosecutor asserted that the document was the same statement that Lisa had\ngiven to the police on August 7, 2008 but with some inconsequential additions.

Now, what I would like to do is move this statement as a full exhibit because I have * * *\nabsolutely nothing to hide.”', 'The trial justice allowed the document to be marked for\nidentification but refused to allow the document to be admitted as a full exhibit. After the\nsidebar, the state presented one more witness before resting.', 'When the trial continued the following morning, defendant moved for a mistrial. In\nruling on defendant’s motion, the trial justice found that the prosecutor’s failure to turn over the\nrevised statement to defense counsel was a violation of Rule 16 of the Superior Court Rules of\nCriminal Procedure. The trial justice then went on to consider whether the discovery violation\nrequired him to grant a mistrial. According to the trial justice, the undisclosed information was\ncentral to defendant’s case since its disclosure likely would have prompted defense counsel to\nadopt a different trial strategy. He emphasized that had the state been more forthcoming when\ndefendant first requested the information, the nondisclosure could have been rectified by\ngranting a continuance. The trial justice ultimately concluded that the only available remedy at\nthat point in the proceedings was to declare a mistrial. Accordingly, the trial justice granted\ndefendant’s motion for a mistrial.', 'The defendant thereafter moved to dismiss the sexual-assault charge on double jeopardy\ngrounds. At a hearing on defendant’s motion on August 5, 2011, defense counsel argued that the\nprosecutor’s attempt to submit the revised version of Lisa’s statement into evidence was a\ndeliberate effort to goad defendant into moving to pass the case. She emphasized that she had', '-6-\nrepeatedly requested that the prosecutor disclose the circumstances under which Lisa changed\nher statement at the June 3 meeting. It was only after Lisa had unexpectedly revealed some of\nthose circumstances on recross-examination that the prosecutor produced the revised statement.\nAccording to defense counsel, the momentum of the trial had swung in defendant’s favor after\nrecross-examination because the jury had begun to suspect that Lisa had altered her statement\nafter learning of Devina’s expected testimony.', 'Defense counsel suggested that, as an\nexperienced attorney for the state, the prosecutor knew that producing the revised statement\ncould save his unraveling case by prompting defendant to request a mistrial.', 'In response, the prosecutor insisted that he did not turn over the revised statement\nbecause he did not believe the statement contained any “significant impeachment evidence.”\nAccording to the prosecutor, the granting of the mistrial did not provide him with any tactical\nadvantage since he had successfully completed his case-in-chief.', 'In a bench decision rendered that same day, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion to\ndismiss. He explained that a mistrial granted at defendant’s behest will only bar a retrial if the\nprosecutor engaged in extreme misconduct intended to goad defendant into moving to pass the\ncase. The trial justice ultimately concluded that the prosecutor in Rolle’s case did not have the\nspecific intent to provoke Rolle into requesting a mistrial. In reaching this conclusion, the trial\njustice rejected defense counsel’s suggestion that the prosecutor had attempted to abort an\nunraveling case. He reasoned that the prosecutor was “more overzealous than Machiavellian,”\nsince the withholding of the revised statement appeared to be no more than a good-faith error in\njudgment. 5 An order denying defendant’s motion to dismiss entered on June 12, 2012.\n5', 'The trial justice ordered the Attorney General’s office to reimburse the Public Defender’s office\nfor the cost of flying Devina Rolle from Georgia to Rhode Island to testify at trial.', '-7-', 'The defendant filed a timely notice of appeal on August 18, 2011. 6 On September 24,\n2013, defendant filed a motion to hold this appeal in abeyance because state’s exhibit No. 5 for\nidentification, Lisa’s revised statement, had been irretrievably lost. The defendant argued that,\nwithout a copy of the revised statement, retrial would be impossible because he would be unable\nto adequately cross-examine his accuser. He therefore requested that this Court remand the\nmatter for the limited purpose of allowing him to file another motion to dismiss in Superior\nCourt. In an order entered on November 14, 2013, this Court denied Rolle’s motion.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'In instances “where a defendant has moved for a mistrial and asserts on appeal that\ndouble jeopardy bars his retrial because of prosecutorial goading, we defer to the trial court’s\nfindings of fact.” State v.

At this time, we\nare not convinced that retrial is impossible. We hold out hope that the exhibit may yet be\nlocated. In the event it is not, the possibility of a retrial in its absence is a question more\nappropriately answered, in the first instance, by the trial justice. We will therefore go on to\naddress whether double jeopardy prohibits retrying defendant on the sexual-assault charge.', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion to dismiss\nthe charge on double jeopardy grounds. In particular, he ascribes error to the trial justice’s\nconclusion that the prosecutor lacked the specific intent to provoke a mistrial.', 'The prohibitions on double jeopardy contained in the United States and Rhode Island\nConstitutions ordinarily do not prevent the retrial of a criminal defendant when a mistrial has\nbeen granted at the defendant’s behest. 7 State v. Casas, 792 A.2d 737, 739 (R.I. 2002). There is\nan exception, however, for instances where a prosecutor has engaged in extreme misconduct\nintended to provoke the defendant into moving to pass the case. Id. This exception is a narrow\none. See State v. Beltre, 764 A.2d 190, 191 (R.I. 2000) (mem.). We have steadfastly adhered to\nthe rule announced in Oregon v.

Casas, 792 A.2d at 739. “Mere prosecutorial error, therefore, although it\nmay incite a mistrial, will not preclude retrial.” O’Connor, 936 A.2d at 222. In rejecting any\nattempt to broaden this exception, we have explained that the Kennedy rule strikes “a careful\nbalance between the right of a defendant to obtain a completion of his trial by the first tribunal\nassembled * * * and the societal interest in apprehending and punishing those who are guilty of\n7', 'Article 1, section 7 of the Rhode Island Constitution and the Fifth Amendment to the United\nStates Constitution prohibit a defendant from twice being put in jeopardy for the same offense.', '-9-\nserious crimes.” State v. Diaz, 521 A.2d 129, 133 (R.I. 1987); see Casas, 792 A.2d at 740; State\nv.

O’Connor, 936\nA.2d at 223 n.6. Some of those relevant facts and circumstances include the timing of the\nmisconduct, the experience of the prosecutor, and whether there was a legitimate reason for the\nmisconduct. See, e.g., Casas, 792 A.2d at 740; Hull, 754 A.2d at 87; McIntyre, 671 A.2d at 807.', 'According to defendant, the objective facts and circumstances in this case compel the\nconclusion that the prosecutor’s production of the revised statement was intended to provoke a\nmistrial. He relies heavily upon the prosecutor’s experience and the timing of the misconduct,\narguing that the prosecutor did not reveal the revised statement until after his case had begun to\nunravel.', 'The defendant is correct that one of the evils that the Kennedy rule seeks to guard against\nis “an unscrupulous prosecutor, faced with a rapidly derailing trial, conceivably * * * seek[ing] a\npremature end of the proceedings in hope of returning another day.” Casas, 792 A.2d at 740; see\nalso State v. Perez, 605 A.2d 1305, 1309 (R.I. 1992) (Retrial is prohibited when a prosecutor has\nengaged in “bad-faith conduct designed to afford the prosecution a more favorable opportunity to\nconvict the defendant.”) (quoting State v. Gordon, 508 A.2d 1339, 1345 (R.I. 1986)). After\ncarefully reviewing the record, however, we agree with the trial justice’s conclusion that no such\nevil was present in this case.', 'Here, the trial justice specifically took into consideration the prosecutor’s experience and\nthe fact that the prosecutor’s attempt to introduce the revised statement came deep into the state’s\ncase. Notwithstanding these facts, he concluded that “it does not follow that [the prosecutor’s]', '- 10 -\nmisconduct was [the] voluntary derailing of a trial going badly.” In reaching this conclusion, the\ntrial justice acknowledged that “cross-examination * * * might have been considered a setback\nfor the prosecution” but indicated that he “was not convinced that the [s]tate was by any means\non the verge of losing this case.”', 'Although defendant disagrees with the trial justice’s finding that the prosecutor’s case\nwas not progressing badly, we conclude that this finding is amply supported by competent\nevidence of record. In finding that the state was not on the brink of losing the case, the trial\njustice characterized Lisa as a convincing and consistent witness for the state. Since we are\n“relegated to reading from a ‘lifeless record,’ [we] justifiably defer to trial justices who\nexperience firsthand the delivery and demeanor of a witness’s testimony.” State v. Ferreira, 21\nA.3d 355, 366 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Guerrero, 996 A.2d 86, 90 (R.I. 2010)). At trial, Lisa\nrepeatedly insisted that when she made her initial statement to the police, she mentioned hearing\nthat Devina was visiting from out of town and speculated that the police officer had accidentally\nomitted that fact from the typed statement. We cannot fault the trial justice for crediting this\ntestimony.', 'The defendant also quarrels with the trial justice’s conclusion that the prosecutor’s\nmisconduct was the result of a good-faith error in judgment. He asserts that the prosecutor’s\nrepeated failure to disclose the circumstances of the June 3 meeting is highly suggestive of bad\nfaith. Again, our review of the record convinces us that the trial justice appropriately considered\nthis factor and made a well-supported finding.', 'The trial justice admonished the prosecutor for not being more forthcoming about the\nJune 3 meeting and warned that he would not tolerate “trial[] by ambush.” He ultimately found,\nhowever, that the prosecutor’s withholding of the revised statement was an error of judgment.', '- 11 -\nThe prosecutor explained that he believed—albeit erroneously—that he was not obligated under\nRule 16 to turn over the revised statement to defense counsel because he deemed the changes to\nthe statement to be largely inconsequential. If the prosecutor did not believe that his initial\ndecision to withhold the document was a discovery violation, it is unlikely that he would believe\nthat his later decision to produce the document would be grounds for a mistrial. In fact, the\nprosecutor offered a legitimate explanation for producing the statement. When he submitted the\ndocument into evidence, he explained that he wished to correct any impression the jurors might\nhave that he was concealing the circumstances surrounding Lisa’s changed statement. We are\ncognizant of the fact that the prosecutor’s own lack of openness created the unfavorable\nimpression that he was attempting to dispel. Nonetheless, it appears that the prosecutor was not\nseeking a more favorable opportunity to try his case in front of a new jury, but rather was\nseeking to redeem himself in the eyes of the original jurors. The trial justice correctly concluded\nthat such overzealousness was grounds for a mistrial but would not preclude retrial.', 'After considering all of the defendant’s arguments, we are satisfied that the trial justice\nperformed a balanced and conscientious analysis of the objective facts and circumstances in this\ncase. We conclude that there was sufficient evidence of record to support the trial justice’s\nfinding that those objective facts did not give rise to an inference of intentional goading.\nAccordingly, we uphold the trial justice’s denial of the defendant’s motion to dismiss the charge.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons articulated in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.

This case came before the Supreme Court on April 3,\n2012, on appeal from a Superior Court judgment of conviction after a jury verdict finding the\ndefendant, Kayborn Brown (defendant or Brown), guilty of first-degree robbery. Brown was\nsentenced to forty years at the Adult Correctional Institutions, with fifteen years to serve and\ntwenty-five years suspended, with probation. On appeal, the defendant contends that the trial\njustice (1) erred in denying his motion to suppress the out-of-court identification based on a\nphotographic array he contends was unduly suggestive; and (2) abused his discretion under Rule\n403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence by denying the defendant‟s motion in limine to\nexclude evidence of a fraudulent charge to the complainant‟s credit card that occurred shortly\nafter the robbery. We affirm the judgment of conviction.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On the afternoon of June 26, 2008, James Torres (complainant or Torres) was beaten and\nrobbed by two men as he walked home from the Providence campus of Community College of\nRhode Island, where Torres was a student and employee. On October 24, 2008, a grand jury', '-1-\nreturned an indictment charging defendant and his brother, Keishon Brown (Keishon), with first-\ndegree robbery in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-39-1(a).', 'In September and October 2009,\ndefendant and Keishon were tried together before a jury. Before trial, the trial justice entertained\ntwo preliminary motions filed by defendant, and it is those rulings that form the basis of\ndefendant‟s appellate arguments.', 'At trial, Torres testified that as he was walking home from campus around 4 p.m. on the\nafternoon of the robbery, he noticed two men across the street. Torres described the men: “[o]ne\nwas about five ten, he was wearing a black hoodie, had braids [and] dark skin [and the] second\none was wearing a yellow shirt, was also dark skinned and was wearing a wave, a nylon cap.”\nThe two men crossed the street and approached Torres—inquiring about the time. Torres\ntestified that in order to answer that question, he took out his cellular phone and the man in the\nblack hoodie demanded that Torres relinquish the phone to him. When Torres refused, the man\nproduced a firearm, held the gun to Torres‟s head, and ordered him to turn over the phone.\nWhen Torres—who testified that he was frozen with fear—made no response, the man with the\ngun bashed him over the head with the weapon, and then both men proceeded to “pummel[]”\nhim. As the onslaught continued, Torres attempted to shield himself from the blows. The\nassailants forced him to the ground, continuously stomping and kicking him in the head until he\nwas bleeding. When Torres finally was able to break free, he fled the scene. Torres testified that\nhe had his MP3 player and phone in his hand as he ran away, and his backpack was still in place;\nhis wallet, however, was missing from the pocket of his pants.', 'Torres testified that as he ran home, he encountered several youths in his neighborhood\nwho inquired about what had happened. When Torres told them that he had been “mugged” and\nbeaten, the youths responded, “Oh, it must have been Comstock boys” or “C-block.” Torres', '-2-\nproceeded home, and the police were called. He was taken to the hospital and treated for injuries\nto his shoulders, arm, and head. From the hospital, Torres contacted his credit card company in\norder to cancel his card and inquire about whether any charges had been made. Torres was\ninformed that a charge for $102 had been made to T-Mobile—a wireless telephone service\nprovider; Torres reported the charge as fraudulent.1', 'At trial, Torres identified defendant and his brother as the two men who robbed and beat\nhim. The record also disclosed that Torres had made an out-of-court identification of defendant\nfrom a photographic array shown to him at the Providence Police Department six days after the\nrobbery. Torres identified defendant as the man with the gun and recalled that he “recognized\nhim instantly” when shown the array.2', 'Providence Police Detective Robert DeCarlo (Det.\nDeCarlo), who investigated the robbery, testified that he had compiled the photographic array\nbased on Torres‟s description of his attackers as “two dark-skinned males * * *, one wearing a\nyellow shirt, one wearing a black hoodie.” He further testified that Torres identified defendant‟s\npicture from the array “[r]ight away, [with] no hesitation.”', 'Ronald Witt (Witt), the keeper of the records for T-Mobile, also testified at trial. Witt\nstated that a credit card, which evidence revealed was issued to James Torres, was used at\n5:12 p.m.—approximately an hour after the robbery—to make a payment of $102.36 to a\nT-Mobile cellular telephone account in the name of Dechana Vicoria. The T-Mobile records\nindicated that Dechana Vicoria resided at 100 Daboll Street in Providence—a short distance\nfrom the scene of the robbery—and that the account holder had a birthdate of August 6, 1973.\n1', 'Torres testified that he did not make any charges to his credit card on the day of the robbery\nand that he did not have a T-Mobile account.\n2', 'Torres also later identified Keishon from another photographic array.', '-3-\nEvidence introduced at trial showed that defendant‟s mother, Charlotte Brown, had the same\naddress and birthdate as that of the T-Mobile account holder. According to the police database,\ndefendant and his brother also resided at 100 Daboll Street in Providence, which was described\nas a multiunit tenement dwelling.', 'After the close of evidence, the jury returned a verdict finding defendant guilty but\nacquitting Keishon.3 The defendant filed a motion for a new trial, which the trial justice denied.\nThe defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.', 'Standard of Review', 'A trial justice‟s decision denying a motion to suppress an identification will not be\ndisturbed on appeal unless it is deemed to be clearly erroneous. State v. Texter, 923 A.2d 568,\n573 (R.I. 2007). In determining whether the trial justice‟s decision was clearly erroneous, this\nCourt must “assess the available evidence in the light most favorable to the state.” Id. (citing\nState v. Luciano, 739 A.2d 222, 226 (R.I. 1999)).', 'Furthermore, it “is well settled that we review a trial justice‟s decision admitting or\nexcluding evidence under an abuse of discretion standard.” State v.

This Court will not reverse a trial justice‟s ruling admitting evidence\nover a Rule 403 objection unless it constitutes a clear abuse of discretion. See State v. Shelton,\n990 A.2d 191, 202 (R.I. 2010) (citing State v.

The defendant\nsought to exclude this evidence, contending that the photographic array from which Torres\nidentified defendant was unduly suggestive. Specifically, defendant asserted that of the six\nphotographs in the array, only two depicted “dark-skinned black males” and, consequently, only\ntwo of the six pictures matched Torres‟s description of his attackers. The defendant further\naverred that the improperly suggestive out-of-court identification tainted Torres‟s in-court\nidentification of defendant to the extent that the trial justice also should have suppressed the\nin-court identification. See State v. Holland, 430 A.2d 1263, 1269 (R.I. 1981) (noting that\nimproper pretrial identification procedures may taint a subsequent in-court identification).', 'When faced with determining whether an identification procedure was improper, a trial\njustice must perform a two-step analysis. Texter, 923 A.2d at 573-74 (citing Luciano, 739 A.2d\nat 226; State v. Mastracchio, 612 A.2d 698, 704 (R.I. 1992)). The trial justice first must\n“consider whether the procedure used in the identification was unnecessarily suggestive.” Id. at\n574 (citing Luciano, 739 A.2d at 226; Mastracchio, 612 A.2d at 704). Only if the trial justice\nanswers that first question in the affirmative does he or she proceed to the second step―\ndetermining “whether in the totality of the circumstances the identification was nonetheless\nreliable.” Id. (quoting Luciano, 739 A.2d at 226).', 'Before ruling on defendant‟s motion to suppress the out-of-court identification, the trial\njustice heard testimony from Det. DeCarlo, who testified that several days after the robbery,\nTorres gave a statement to the police in which he described his attackers. In that statement,\nTorres described one perpetrator―defendant―as being around twenty years old, “five foot ten,', '-5-\nwearing a black hoodie, a dark-skinned male with a thin build;” the second he described as being\na “dark-skinned male, around 20 years old, five ten, chunky, wearing a yellow shirt and black\npants.” Detective DeCarlo also testified that a police incident report was generated on the day of\nthe robbery and recorded Torres‟s description of the perpetrators as “two black males.”', 'Detective DeCarlo explained that the police compiled the photographic array based on\nTorres‟s description of the suspects and the fact that the police believed that the suspects were\nlikely from the Comstock or Congress Avenue area of the city, based on the statements made to\nTorres by the youths he encountered after the robbery. On cross-examination, Det. DeCarlo\ntestified that although the average person may consider only two of the photographs in the array\nto depict dark-skinned black males, it was his opinion that “there could be three, four, five or\nsix” in the array. Torres also testified at the suppression hearing and stated that he would\nclassify four of the photographs as depicting dark-skinned black males. He also testified that he\nindependently identified defendant from the array, without any suggestion from the police.', 'At the conclusion of the testimony, the trial justice denied the motion to suppress. He\nrecounted the eyewitness identification procedures the police followed when showing the\nphotographic array to Torres, and determined that the identification was conducted in a non-\nsuggestive manner. Additionally, the trial justice underscored the fact that Torres identified\ndefendant “right away,” when shown the photographs. The trial justice noted that the pictures in\nthe array were selected based upon Torres‟s description of the suspects and “seemed to me to be\nan attempt to try to pick out people who were similar in looks, complexion and facial structure.”\nAccordingly, the trial justice ruled that the array was not unduly suggestive.', 'We discern no error in the decision of the trial justice. “In determining whether the\nphotographic array poses a substantial risk of misidentification, we must „compare the physical', '-6-\ncharacteristics of each individual featured in the display to the general description of the suspect\ngiven to the police by the victim.‟” State v. Gatone, 698 A.2d 230, 235 (R.I. 1997) (quoting\nState v. Barnes, 559 A.2d 136, 140 (R.I. 1989)). We accord great weight to the finding by the\ntrial justice that the pictures in the array featured men who were similar in appearance and\nconsistent with Torres‟s description of his assailants. This Court is not persuaded by defendant‟s\nargument that the array was unnecessarily suggestive because, defendant contends, only two\ndark-skinned black males were featured. We note at the outset that the record does not disclose\nthat Torres described the assailants to the police as “dark-skinned black males.”4 Additionally, it\nis a matter of opinion how many African-American males with dark complexions were depicted\nin the array; Torres testified that in his opinion, up to four men fit that description, and the trial\njustice opined that as many as five men in the array could be characterized as dark-skinned black\nmales.', 'Consequently, we affirm the trial justice‟s denial of defendant‟s motion to suppress the\nout-of-court identification.', 'Accordingly, once a finding is made that the “out-of-court\nidentification is not impermissibly suggestive, then the in-court identification is likewise proper.”\nId. at 236 (citing State v. Gardiner, 636 A.2d 710, 716 (R.I. 1994); Mastracchio, 612 A.2d at\n706). We are satisfied, therefore, that defendant‟s contention that Torres‟s in-court identification\nof defendant was improperly tainted is without merit.', 'We now consider the subject of defendant‟s second assertion of error: the trial justice‟s\ndecision to allow into evidence business records showing payment made to a T-Mobile account\nin the name of Dechana Vicoria and charged to Torres‟s credit card. The defendant argues that\n4', 'The record reveals that Torres described his assailants as “black males” in his initial police\nreport and as “dark-skinned” males in a subsequent statement to the police, but never as dark-\nskinned black males. We are of the opinion that the police cannot be faulted for compiling a\nphotographic array containing a smaller ratio of dark-skinned black males when the complainant\ndid not describe his assailants as such.', '-7-\nthe evidence was irrelevant and highly misleading because the state never established that\n“Dechana Vicoria” was a fictitious name or that defendant had any connection with the T-Mobile\naccount holder who shared his address, his mother‟s address, and his m other‟s date of birth—\nsimilarities that defendant argues could be mere coincidences. Accordingly, defendant avers that\nthe trial justice abused his discretion by denying defendant‟s motion in limine because the\nevidence was only marginally relevant and highly prejudicial. We disagree.', 'Rule 401 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence broadly defines relevant evidence as\n“evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the\ndetermination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the\nevidence.” Rule 403 provides for a balancing test by which a trial justice determines whether\nrelevant evidence should nonetheless be excluded. Rule 403 states that relevant evidence “may\nbe excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,\nconfusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of\ntime, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.” It is a well-settled principle of our law\nthat “the discretion to exclude evidence under Rule 403 must be exercised sparingly.” Shelton,\n990 A.2d at 202 (quoting State v. Hak, 963 A.2d 921, 928 (R.I. 2009)).', 'Before Witt testified about the T-Mobile business records, the trial justice conducted a\nvoir dire examination and heard argument from counsel regarding defendant‟s motion in limine\nto exclude the evidence.5 At the conclusion of arguments, the trial justice determined that:', '“the State has presented evidence that would show that these', 'defendants had some linkage with 100 Daboll Street. * * * Now,', 'add to that the fact that the person named on the account happens\n5', 'The trial justice had deferred definitively ruling on defendant‟s pretrial motion in limine\npending a determination of whether the state would call a representative from T-Mobile to testify\nand to provide a foundation for the admission of T-Mobile‟s business records.', '-8-', 'to have the same date of birth as the defendants‟ mother, certainly,', 'to me is enough to present a situation where a reasonable inference', 'could be drawn that these defendants were involved somehow in', 'the use of this credit card for the benefit of someone at that', 'address.”', 'We are not persuaded that the trial justice‟s decision to admit this evidence was an abuse\nof discretion. The fact that Torres‟s credit card was used approximately an hour after he was\nrobbed and beaten by a man he identified as defendant—who lived at the address listed on the\nT-Mobile account—and the fact that the fraudulent charge benefitted a woman with the same\naddress and date of birth as defendant‟s mother, constitute relevant evidence tending to show that\ndefendant was involved in the robbery.', 'The trial justice astutely observed the multiple\nconnections between defendant and the T-Mobile account holder—which was circumstantial\nevidence connecting defendant to the crime.', 'However, it was within the purview of the jury to determine what, if any, inferences to\ndraw from the myriad of similarities between the named account holder and the defendant‟s\nmother.', 'The defendant was free to argue to the jury that the T-Mobile records were not\nprobative evidence against him, and in fact he did so.6 The defendant‟s argument that the state\nfailed to establish a sufficient nexus between the defendant and the fraudulent charge made on\nTorres‟s credit card is a matter that goes to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility. See\nBeaton v.

In this appeal, we review the denial of an application\nfor postconviction relief.

We affirmed\nthose convictions in his direct appeal. See State v. Merida, 960 A.2d 228, 240 (R.I. 2008).\nMerida then applied for postconviction relief, arguing that he was deprived of his right to the\neffective assistance of counsel. Merida’s application for postconviction relief was denied. The\napplicant sought review by this Court, and both parties appeared pursuant to an order directing\nthem to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be decided summarily.

See State v. Merida, 960 A.2d 228, 239 (R.I. 2008). Accordingly, the doctrine\nof res judicata bars the relitigation of this issue, despite appellate counsel’s attempt to breathe', '-4-', 'The applicant contends that trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to investigate,\ncall witnesses, or properly cross-examine witnesses about the complainant’s motive to lie. This\nargument focuses on allegations of tension that existed between Betsy’s maternal grandmother,\nDonna, and the Merida family that arose at the time the complainant was born. According to\ntrial counsel, the defense’s theory at trial was that her grandmother pressured Betsy into making\nthe allegations against Merida. Although trial counsel acknowledged that he was aware of the\nanimosity between the families at the time of Betsy’s birth, he contends that the Merida family\nnever told him “why [Donna] wanted to see Javier Merida prosecuted for child molestation.”', 'The applicant testified at the hearing and averred that he provided trial counsel with the\ndetails of an ongoing inter-familial conflict—in particular, issues regarding Betsy’s custody,\nchanging her last name, and changing her health insurance—and that he asked trial counsel to\nhire an investigator to explore the family dynamics. Trial counsel, however, testified that he did\nnot recall any discussion with the Merida family about changes to Betsy’s custody, last name, or\nhealth insurance. The trial justice found trial counsel’s version of the discussions with his client\nto be “highly credible” and based on both his memory and his detailed notes. Conversely, she\nfound that Merida’s version lacked credibility. Accordingly, the trial justice was satisfied that\ntrial counsel adequately explored any motives Betsy may have had to fabricate her testimony.', 'Before this Court, applicant asserts that trial counsel’s actions were not a “reasonable\nexercise of strategy.” However, this argument is largely predicated upon Merida’s version of\nevents, which the trial justice found to be not credible. This Court defers to a trial justice’s\nfindings on credibility.', 'See Doctor v. State, 865 A.2d 1064, 1068 n.5 (R.I. 2005) (“[I]n\nnew life into it. See Taylor v. Wall, 821 A.2d 685, 688 (R.I. 2003) (“Res judicata bars the\nrelitigation of any issue that could have been litigated in a prior proceeding, including a direct\nappeal, that resulted in a final judgment between the same parties, or those in privity with\nthem.”).', '-5-\nreviewing an application for postconviction relief, we defer to the trial justice’s findings on\ncredibility unless clearly wrong.”). Accepting trial counsel’s version—that he did not know the\nspecifics of the ongoing animosity between the families—we agree with the trial justice that it\nwas reasonable for trial counsel to not pursue it any further. See Rice v. State, 38 A.3d 9, 17\nn.11 (R.I. 2012) (“We note that ‘[o]n review of an application for post-conviction relief we are\nbound by the trial justice’s determination concerning credibility.’”) (quoting State v. Feng, 421\nA.2d 1258, 1273 (R.I. 1980)). An attorney cannot pursue a potential defense if he or she is\nunaware of the specifics of that defense. Furthermore, the record discloses that trial counsel\nexamined Betsy for any potential influence by Donna, and he argued that issue to the jury.\nTherefore, trial counsel was not constitutionally deficient with respect to the complainant’s\nmotive to lie.', 'The applicant next contends that trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to present\na medical expert to rebut the testimony of Dr. Christine Barron (Dr. Barron). Doctor Barron\nexamined Betsy after she disclosed Merida’s abuse. Testifying during the state’s case-in-chief,\nDr. Barron testified that the results of Betsy’s examination were normal. When asked whether a\nnormal examination may nonetheless be consistent with allegations of vaginal penetration, Dr.\nBarron stated that “[a] normal examination neither rules out nor confirms the possibility of\nsexual abuse or prior penetration.”', 'The applicant attempts to assign constitutional deficiency to his trial counsel’s failure to\ncall a medical expert to rebut Dr. Barron’s opinion. However, there was nothing for applicant to\nrebut. Doctor Barron’s conclusion was equivocal: her testimony did not indicate that Betsy was\nsexually abused (much less, sexually abused by Merida). Furthermore, trial counsel did engage\nan expert, Dr. Patricia Crane (Dr. Crane), to review the records of Betsy’s examination.', '-6-\nAlthough the record discloses that Dr. Crane requested additional information and trial counsel\ndid not comply with that request, her evaluation of the medical records she did review similarly\nwas equivocal. She stated that (1) “Any expert, defense or prosecution[,] would have to say that\nthere is always the possibility of no physical injuries”; (2) the hymen “may remain with smooth\nretracted edges after digital penetration”; (3) “No one would be able to say for sure if the notch is\nrelated to a past tear in the tissue or if it is a normal variation”; and (4) “With no definitive\nclinical findings, as in this case, there is no way to say for sure who did what [and] when, unless\nthe child has a sexually transmitted disease.” (Emphases added.) Thus, Dr. Crane’s opinion was\nconsistent with Dr. Barron’s opinion. Because Dr. Barron’s conclusion was equivocal and\nbecause the expert advice that trial counsel received did not contradict it, trial counsel’s\nperformance was not constitutionally deficient based on his decision to not present a medical\nexpert to testify.', 'See Linde, 78 A.3d at 745 (noting strong presumption that counsel’s\nperformance was in the permissible range of assistance).', 'Finally, regarding the medical testimony, applicant asserts that trial counsel was\nineffective for his failure to request a continuance to review an article referenced by Dr. Barron\nduring her testimony.', 'Trial counsel testified that it would have prolonged Dr. Barron’s\ntestimony and would have had little impact in light of her previously stated medical opinion.\nThe trial justice agreed and found trial counsel’s decision to be a reasonable strategic decision.\nWe are satisfied that the trial justice did not err in concluding that this was a reasonable tactical\ndecision, particularly in light of the fact that Dr. Barron’s testimony on the issue was equivocal.', 'The applicant next contends that trial counsel was ineffective because he prevented\napplicant from testifying in his own defense. Merida did not testify at trial, but his version of the\nevents leading to this decision varied greatly from that of counsel. Trial counsel testified that he', '-7-\ndiscussed the pros and cons of testifying with his client. In fact, he conducted a mock exercise\nconsisting of both direct and cross-examination with Merida and told him that it went well.\nHowever, after the conclusion of the state’s case, trial counsel testified that he recommended\nMerida not testify because trial counsel thought he had established a reasonable doubt defense,\nand, if Merida testified, the case would turn into a credibility contest for the jury, and not\nwhether there was reasonable doubt. Trial counsel testified that he thought a great deal about\nthis recommendation and consulted another veteran defense attorney regarding this decision.\nTrial counsel testified that he did not recall Merida telling him that he wanted to take the stand;\nhe testified that Merida concurred with his recommendation. Merida, on the other hand, testified\nthat trial counsel knew that he wanted to testify, and that Merida left the mock examination\nsession with the impression that he would testify the next day. According to Merida, he was\nsurprised when trial counsel did not call him to testify.', 'The trial justice found trial counsel’s testimony on this issue more credible than\napplicant’s testimony. Furthermore, the Court found that Merida and trial counsel discussed the\nissue and that Merida “knowingly and voluntarily accepted [trial counsel’s] recommendation that\nhe not testify.” We defer to the trial justice’s ruling on this point. See Doctor, 865 A.2d at 1067.\nAccordingly, we are satisfied that the trial justice’s finding—that it was a reasonable strategic\ndecision for trial counsel to recommend that Merida not testify—also is supported by the\nevidence and is not clearly wrong. See id.', 'The applicant next contends that trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to\nproperly cross-examine Lisa and neglected to object to the state’s order of proof at trial. The\nindictment against Merida charged him with abusing both Betsy and Lisa; the first trial ended in\na mistrial because Lisa did not appear to testify, and the charges against Merida pertaining to', '-8-\nLisa’s allegations were dismissed. The applicant contends that trial counsel was deficient by not\nexamining Lisa about her failure to appear at the first trial. Trial counsel, however, testified that\nhe did not do so because it would highlight to the jury that a grand jury had indicted Merida on\nseparate counts concerning Lisa as well as Betsy and that information could result in prejudice to\nMerida. Regarding his failure to object to the order of witnesses, trial counsel testified that he\nconsidered the order of proof to be immaterial because he had solid grounds for effective cross-\nexamination of Lisa. The trial justice found this decision to be a reasonable and strategic one.\nClearly, vigorous examination of Lisa, another putative victim, was a risky undertaking, and\nreference to an additional indictment would have exacerbated the impact of Lisa’s testimony.\nBecause trial counsel believed that he had better cross-examination material against Lisa and that\nthe order in which the evidence was presented was of no moment, his decision not to object to\nthe order of witnesses was a reasonable tactical decision.', 'Finally, the applicant stated in his initial Rule 12A statement that he wished to assert\nseven additional grounds for postconviction relief on appeal that were raised below and\narticulated in an exhibit attached to his memorandum. Although these issues were raised in the\nSuperior Court, they were not argued in any detail nor were they addressed by the trial justice.\nAdditionally, the Rule 12A statements themselves contain no argument on these issues.\nTherefore, these issues are waived.4 Kaveny v.

The defendant, Adrian Shepard, by way of a\npetition for writ of certiorari, seeks review of a Superior Court judgment declaring him to be in\nviolation of the terms of his probation and revoking three years of an eight-year suspended\nsentence. He also appeals from a Superior Court order denying his motion to correct and\nreconsider his sentence. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument pursuant to\nan order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this petition and\nappeal should not summarily be decided. After reviewing the record and considering the parties’\nwritten and oral submissions, we are satisfied that the issues may be resolved without further\nbriefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm both the judgment and\norder of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On May 6, 2004, defendant pled nolo contendere to one count of conspiracy to commit a\nfelony, for which he was sentenced to ten years at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI),\nconsisting of two years to serve and eight years suspended, with probation (the 2003 case). On', '-1-\nApril 5, 2006, defendant was found to have violated the terms of his probation, resulting in the\nrevocation of ten months of his suspended sentence. 1', 'The defendant’s second sojourn in prison failed to achieve rehabilitation because\ndefendant again was arrested and charged with possession of cocaine with intent to deliver (the\n2007 case). He eventually pled nolo contendere to an amended charge of possession of cocaine\nand was sentenced to eight years at the ACI, with twenty months to serve and seventy-six\nmonths suspended, with probation. 2 Upon his release from the ACI, defendant was arrested yet\nagain, this time for an alleged domestic assault upon Deanna Monroe, the mother of his son. 3 As\na result of this incident, defendant was presented as a violator of his probation in both the 2003\nand 2007 cases.', 'On June 9, 2009, defendant’s violation hearing was held in the Superior Court. The state\npresented two witnesses: Detective Sarkis Zeitountzian of the Providence Police Department and\nMs. Monroe, the complaining witness. Detective Zeitountzian testified that on March 14, 2009,\nhe responded to Women and Infants Hospital to meet with the victim of an alleged sexual\nassault. At the hospital, he introduced himself to Ms. Monroe, the alleged victim, whom he\ndescribed as having a “black eye under her left eye,” which was “clearly bruised.” He estimated\nthat this injury was two to three days old.', 'Ms. Monroe testified about two particular incidents involving defendant.', 'The first\noccurred on March 11, 2009, when defendant arrived at her residence while she was taking a\nshower. She testified that defendant walked into the bathroom and threatened her, saying, “I’ll\n1', 'The remaining eighty-six months of the eight-year sentence remained suspended, with\nprobation.\n2', 'As will be discussed in footnote 4, infra, the eight-year sentence exceeded the maximum\npermissible penalty for a possession conviction.\n3', 'A criminal complaint for domestic assault also was filed against defendant in District Court.', '-2-\nleave you dead in the shower.” Ms. Monroe said she had confronted him earlier in the day about\nhis relationship with her cousin. According to Ms. Monroe, when she got out of the shower\ndefendant asked her “to do a sexual favor for him,” which she refused. They then started\n“tussling,” which she described as defendant trying to hold her down as she attempted to push\nhim off. She further testified that she “finally just stopped resisting and * * * let him have sex\nwith [her].” Ms. Monroe stated that she suffered a black eye in this scuffle. Ms. Monroe also\ndescribed a second incident on the following evening at the same residence. She testified that\nshe resisted as defendant tried to touch her “private areas” and have sex with her.', 'Two days later, Ms. Monroe called the police to report these two incidents. She testified\nthat a police officer came to her residence, took pictures of her eye and brought her to the\nemergency room, where she later met with and gave a statement to Det. Zeitountzian. Ms.\nMonroe further acknowledged that on March 16, 2009, while in the presence of defendant, she\ncalled the police to modify her statement. During that call, she told Sergeant Marandi “that the\nviolence did happen but the sexual assault didn’t happen.” She testified that she made this\ntelephone call and partially recanted her original statement because defendant had told her that\nhe would “kill [her] before he [went] to jail for rape.” Ms. Monroe swore that her testimony at\nthe violation hearing was true and that her recantation was a lie.', 'The defendant presented no witnesses, but introduced into evidence two police reports\nand a tape recording of a phone conversation between Ms. Monroe and defendant. The hearing\njustice summarized the contents of the recording as follows:', '“The tape of the conversation between the complaining', 'witness and the defendant shortly after these incidents was played', 'for the [c]ourt, and in that tape, it seems clear that there was', 'reference to the complaining witness saying to the defendant that', 'she wanted to keep the relationship together for the benefit of the', '-3-', 'child and that if she had to, she could testify against him to get him', 'in jail to keep him away from the cousin.”', 'In his closing argument, defendant characterized Ms. Monroe’s testimony as “completely\nunreliable.” According to defendant, Ms. Monroe falsely accused him of sexually assaulting her\nbecause she was angry that he was dating her cousin.', 'The most telling evidence of her\nmendacity, he suggested, was the tape recording in which she is purported to have said that “if\nshe had to put him in jail to keep him away from ‘that bitch’ then that is ‘what the fuck she was\ngoing to do.’”', 'In his bench decision, the hearing justice explained that “cases like this are never clear\ncut and that’s the reason why the [c]ourt, ultimately, has to make determinations as to\ncredibility.” He acknowledged that Ms. Monroe “had some inconsistencies in her testimony,”\nbut he concluded that he was “confident, after hearing her testify, that the thrust of her testimony\n[was] accurate.” Ultimately, the hearing justice found that defendant did violate his probation in\nrelation to this incident:', '“So, while there are some inconsistencies in [the', 'complaining witness’s] testimony, the thrust of it is believable and', 'I accept it. And, I think as a result of that, enough has been shown', 'to me that he was assaultive on the night in question, that there was', 'a battery resulting in the injury that was described by the police', 'officer, and because he did not keep the peace and was not of good', 'behavior, I believe the State has proven this to the Court to a', 'reasonable satisfaction and I find that he is in clear violation of the', 'probation that he is on.”', 'Consequently, the hearing justice revoked three years from the remaining eighty-six-\nmonth suspended sentence in the 2003 case. The defendant’s sentence for the 2007 case was left\nunaltered. Later that month, defendant filed a timely notice of appeal; however, this appeal was\nfiled only in relation to the 2007 case, not the 2003 case.', '-4-', 'On January 14, 2010, the sentencing justice in the 2007 possession of cocaine case, sua\nsponte, corrected defendant’s original eight-year sentence to the statutory maximum sentence for\nthat crime of three years of incarceration, consisting of twenty months to serve, retroactive to\nJune 6, 2007, and sixteen months suspended, with probation. 4 Meanwhile, the domestic-assault\ncharge, which formed the basis of defendant’s violation charge, was dismissed voluntarily by the\nstate in District Court, under Rule 48(a) of the District Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.\nSeveral months thereafter, defendant filed a motion to correct and reconsider the sentence he\nreceived for violating his probation. In this motion, defendant requested that the “drastic remedy\nof imposing three years to serve in prison” be reconsidered under Rule 35 of the Superior Court\nRules of Criminal Procedure and that the hearing justice order his release from custody.', 'At the hearing on defendant’s motion, defendant acknowledged that because the hearing\njustice had not revoked any portion of his suspended sentence in the recently corrected 2007\ncase, the three-year sentence imposed was not an illegal sentence. 5 He still wished to be heard\non his motion to reconsider, however, arguing that the hearing justice should reconsider the\nthree-year prison sentence in light of the dismissal of the underlying domestic assault charge.\nThe hearing justice allowed defendant to proceed on the motion. At the conclusion of the\nhearing, the hearing justice noted that a subsequent dismissal of the underlying charges upon\nwhich a violation is predicated does not require the violation adjudication to be vacated. He then\nexplained why he determined the sentence to be appropriate, and denied defendant’s motion.\n4', 'The maximum penalty for possession of a schedule I through IV controlled substance, the\namended charge to which defendant pled, is three years. See G.L. 1956 § 21-28-4.01(b)(2)(i).\n5', 'At the hearing on the motion, defendant conceded that Rule 35 of the Superior Court Rules of\nCriminal Procedure was not the proper mechanism to bring his motion to reconsider before the\ncourt.

This\ntestimony, when viewed in the light most favorable to the state, is sufficient to establish beyond a\nreasonable doubt that defendant, and his unidentified counterpart, conspired to unlawfully enter\nthe apartment. The state presented a witness who overheard the suspects discuss their plans. We\nare therefore satisfied that the statements overheard by the second-floor tenant constitute direct\nevidence of the conspiracy. Nothing more is required.', 'The defendant also attacks the conviction on the ground that the state did not identify\ndefendant’s co-conspirator.', 'However, we have recently held that there can be sufficient\nevidence to establish a conspiracy conviction despite the fact that the co-conspirators’ identities\nwere unknown. See State v. Tully, 110 A.3d 1181, 1195 (R.I. 2015). Here, the record clearly\nreflects that defendant entered into an agreement with another person to unlawfully enter the\napartment.

The fact that\nthe co-conspirator was unidentified is of no moment to the sufficiency of the evidence in support\nof defendant’s conspiracy conviction.', 'The defendant further contends that the evidence to support a conspiracy charge was\nnothing more than a pyramiding of inferences that was based on speculation and conjecture.

The crime of conspiracy consists of an agreement between “two or more persons\nto commit an unlawful act or perform a lawful act for an unlawful purpose.” Lassiter, 836 A.2d\nat 1104 (quoting State v. Mastracchio, 612 A.2d 698, 706 (R.I. 1992)). The crime is complete\nwhen the agreement is made. Conspiracy does not require an overt act or even an attempt to\nperform an act in furtherance of the agreement.', 'In the case at bar, abundant and direct evidence was introduced from which a factfinder\ncould find—without drawing any inferences—that these suspects agreed to enter the dwelling.\nThey were overheard discussing how to break in, and an eyewitness saw them enter the\napartment through the window. To the extent that defendant challenges whether there was an\nambiguous inference that the intruders knew that the entry was unlawful (that is, they entered\nwithout consent) this would constitute the only inference, drawn from the eyewitness testimony\nand “by proof of the relations, conduct, circumstances, and actions of the parties.” Lassiter, 836', '-7-\nA.2d at 1104 (quoting Mastracchio, 612 A.2d at 706).

58,"I Facts1 and Travel Detective Brian Macera (Detective Macera) is a ten-year veteran of the Rhode Island
State Police (RISP), and is currently assigned to the Computer Crimes Unit (CCU) and the
Rhode Island Internet Crimes against Children (ICAC) Task Force. 2 Aff. at 3. Members of the
CCU and ICAC Task Force engage in undercover investigation of computer-related crimes to
identify criminals trading child pornography on the Internet using peer-to-peer networks. Id.
1 Pursuant to the applicable standard of review, the following facts are garnered from the
Affidavit. State v. Byrne, 972 A.2d 633, 638 (R.I. 2009); State v. Verrecchia, 880 A.2d 89, 94
(R.I. 2005).
2 The ICAC Task Force is administered by the RISP and “supports a national network of multi-
agency, multi-jurisdictional task forces engaged in investigations, forensic examinations, and
prosecutions related to Internet crimes against children and technology-facilitated child sexual
exploitation.” Id. Peer-to-peer networks facilitate the sharing of electronic files between participating
members over the Internet. Id. To be a participating member, a computer user must install a
file-sharing software and “sharing folder” in which files can be stored and shared with other
participating members of the peer-to-peer network. Id. Members of the peer-to-peer network
can search the network and download any shared file in that network. Id. at 3-4. Each file in the
peer-to-peer network is attached to the Internet Protocol (IP) address3 of the computer that is
sharing the file. Id. at 2. Further, each file in the peer-to-peer network is identifiable by a “hash”
value, which is an “alpha-numeric string . . . that is calculated by applying a mathematical
algorithm to the electronic data that is contained in the electronic file.” Id. Therefore, if an
electronic file has identical content to another file, their hash values will also be identical. As a
result, hash values are “commonly referred to as electronic fingerprints.” Id. Any changes to the
content of an electronic file, no matter how slight, will change the file’s hash value. Id. Law
enforcement, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), and the ICAC
Task Force have identified certain hash values as confirmed child pornography. Id. In June 2015, Detective Macera was contacted by Detective Lieutenant Stephen
Riccitelli—a detective in the North Smithfield Police Department and member of the ICAC Task
Force—who informed him that the ICAC Task Force computer system had downloaded a file
suspected to be child pornography from IP address 100.10.41.6.4 Id. at 5. Detective Macera
3 An IP address is a “unique routing number associated with a computer connected to the Internet
which functions in the routing of data between source and destination. IP addresses are assigned
to Internet service providers . . . who, in turn, assign them to customers for Internet access.” Id.
4 At the evidentiary hearing, Detective Macera explained that the ICAC Task Force subscribes a
system of computers to common peer-to-peer file sharing programs. These computers are
programed to continuously look for child pornography files on the peer-to-peer network, and will
download files from another participating member’s computer when such files contain certain
hash values or descriptions that match child pornography. When an ICAC Task Force computer
downloads a child pornography file from another computer, a member of the ICAC Task Force is 2
viewed the downloaded file and confirmed that it contained child pornography as defined in
§ 11-9-1.3 of Rhode Island’s General Laws. Id. Detective Macera described the file as follows: “File Name: Jamtien.mpeg Date/Time: June 15, 2015 at 11:42 PM (UTC) HASH Value: 2aad88e182cc9c66ccd7ba15aa186ecfac39f370 Description: This video file depicts a prepubescent female on the beach removing her bathing suit exposing her genitals.” Id. Detective Macera conducted a search of the American Registry of Internet Numbers
(ARIN) and determined that IP address 100.10.41.6 was owned by Verizon Internet Services,
2701 South Johnson Street, San Angelo, Texas 76904 (Verizon). Id. Verizon was served with a
subpoena, which directed it to provide to RISP the name, address, and telephone number of the
subscriber of IP address 100.10.41.6. Id. Verizon identified the subscriber of the IP address
100.10.41.6 as Heather Reisner (Heather) of 15 Harding Street, West Warwick, Rhode Island.
Id. Detective Macera searched law enforcement databases and confirmed that Heather
resided at 15 Harding Street, West Warwick, Rhode Island 02893. Id. Although Heather’s
driver’s license indicated that her address was 8 ½ Lachance Street, West Warwick, Rhode
Island, she indicated in a previous communication with the West Warwick Police Department
that her residence was 15 Harding Street, West Warwick, Rhode Island. Id. at 5-6. Detective
Macera also confirmed with the United States Postal Service that Heather was receiving mail at
15 Harding Street, West Warwick, Rhode Island. Id. at 6. On several occasions in July 2015,
Detective Macera set up surveillance at 15 Harding Street, West Warwick, Rhode Island and
observed a female exiting the residence. Id. Detective Macera recognized the female exiting the
house as Heather from her driver’s license photograph. Id.
notified and the download is documented in a log file along with the IP address from which the
child pornography file was downloaded. 3 On July 29, 2015, Detective Macera used the above information to apply for a search
warrant (the Search Warrant) of 15 Harding Street, West Warwick, Rhode Island and requested
that a member of the RISP CCU conduct an on- and off-site forensic review of seized evidence
related to the possession and transfer of child pornography. On the same day, the Search
Warrant was approved. Subsequently, on August 3, 2015, RISP executed the Search Warrant,
seizing Defendant’s computer—a Mac Pro desktop (serial number WCAU40341527)
(Defendant’s Computer). A police forensic examination of Defendant’s Computer revealed
seven videos of child pornography. Based on this evidence, the RISP obtained an arrest warrant
for Defendant, and Defendant was subsequently arrested. On December 24, 2015, the State filed
a criminal information, charging Defendant with possession of child pornography, in violation of
§ 11-9-1.3(b)(2); and delivery or transfer of child pornography, in violation of § 11-9-1.3(b)(1). II Standard of Review “The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, section 6 of the
Rhode Island Constitution, prohibits the issuance of a search warrant absent a showing of
probable cause.” Verrecchia, 880 A.2d at 94. “The United States Supreme Court has indicated
that the existence of probable cause should be determined pursuant to a flexible ‘totality-of-the-
circumstances analysis.’” Id. (quoting Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238-39 (1983)). The
Supreme Court of the United States explained: “The task of the issuing magistrate is simply to make a practical, common-sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him, including the ‘veracity’ and ‘basis of knowledge’ of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place. And the duty of a reviewing court is simply to ensure that the magistrate had a ‘substantial basis for . . . 4 conclud[ing]’ that probable cause existed.” Gates, 462 U.S. at 238-39.
“In other words, the approach to the probable cause question should be pragmatic and flexible.”
Verrecchia, 880 A.2d at 94 (citing State v. Spaziano, 685 A.2d 1068, 1069 (R.I. 1996); State v.
Correia, 707 A.2d 1245, 1249 (R.I. 1998); State v. Hightower, 661 A.2d 948, 959 (R.I. 1995)).
Therefore, “[t]he magistrate is permitted to draw reasonable inferences from the affidavit
presented to him or her.” Id. (citing State v. Pratt, 641 A.2d 732, 736 (R.I. 1994)). “Because there is ‘a strong preference for searches conducted pursuant to a warrant,’
affidavits are to be interpreted in a realistic fashion that is consistent with common sense, and not
subject to rigorous and hypertechnical scrutiny.” Byrne, 972 A.2d at 638 (quoting Gates, 462
U.S. at 235-39); see also United States v. Ventresca, 380 U.S. 102, 109 (1965) (“[W]hen a
magistrate has found probable cause, the courts should not invalidate the warrant by interpreting
the affidavit in a hypertechnical, rather than a commonsense, manner.”). In fact, “[i]t is
incumbent upon the trial justice and the reviewing court to accord great deference to the issuing
magistrate’s probable-cause determination, so long as there is a showing of ‘a substantial basis
from which to discern probable cause.’”5 Id. (citing State v. Correia, 707 A.2d 1245, 1249 (R.I.
1998)). “[I]n close cases, the validity of the warrant should be upheld.” Id. at 642. “‘Probable
cause exists when the affidavit demonstrates in some trustworthy fashion the likelihood that an
offense has been or is being committed.’” Id. (quoting United States v. Santana, 342 F.3d 60, 65
(1st Cir. 2003)).
5 Our Supreme Court has held that “a deferential standard of review should be applied when
reviewing a magistrate’s decision to issue a warrant because ‘[t]he Fourth Amendment
demonstrates a strong preference for searches conducted pursuant to a warrant . . . and the police
are more likely to use the warrant process if the scrutiny applied to a magistrate’s probable-cause
determination to issue a warrant is less than that for warrantless searches.’” Id. (internal citations
omitted). 5 III Analysis Defendant argues that evidence seized as a result of the Search Warrant should be
suppressed because (1) Detective Macera’s description of the video was insufficient; (2) the
video was not child pornography as defined by § 11-9-1.3(c)(1)(ii); and (3) the issuing
magistrate did not view the video to determine if it was, by law, child pornography. The State
maintains that the Search Warrant was supported by probable cause because (1) the Affidavit
established a fair probability that the evidence of crime would be located at 15 Harding Street;
(2) the issuing magistrate is not required to view the video to establish probable cause; and (3)
suppression is not warranted because the RISP relied upon the Search Warrant in good faith. A Issuing Magistrate’s Review of Alleged Child Pornography The Court first addresses Defendant’s argument that because the issuing magistrate did
not view the video himself, the Search Warrant should be deemed invalid. The State counters
that the issuing magistrate need not view the alleged child pornography to make a “pre-charge
decision” as to whether the video constitutes child pornography. Whether or not an issuing magistrate of a search warrant needs to review an alleged
image or video of child pornography is a matter of first impression in Rhode Island. In instances
of first impression, and when there is a nearly identical federal statute, our Supreme Court has
looked to federal court jurisprudence for guidance. State v. Brown, 62 A.3d 1099, 1109 (R.I.
2013). It has been noted that the State’s child pornography statute is substantially similar to its
federal counterpart, 18 U.S.C. § 2256(2)(B)(iii). Byrne, 972 A.2d at 641 n.11. Therefore, the
Court looks to United State v. Brunette, 256 F.3d 14, 17-18 (1st Cir. 2001), in which the First 6
Circuit discussed the necessity of a magistrate to review alleged child pornography images or
video when issuing a warrant in a child pornography investigation.6 In Brunette, an investigator applied for a search warrant after discovering that a defendant
had downloaded thirty-three images of child pornography. 256 F.3d at 15-16. The affidavit
submitted in support of the search warrant application did not append any of the allegedly
pornographic images and did not contain a description of them. Id. at 16. Rather, the affidavit
merely asserted that the images “met the statutory definition of child pornography.” Id. The
warrant issued and other allegedly pornographic images were found on the defendant’s
computer. Id. Subsequently, the defendant moved to suppress the images contained on the
computers seized under the warrant, arguing that the affidavit had a “nondescript legal
conclusion” and the warrant lacked probable cause because the issuing magistrate did not view
the images and determine that they were child pornography. Id. In its review of the grant of the search warrant, the First Circuit held that “[a]lthough the
affidavit included sufficient indicia to link the images to the defendant, i.e., that the postings
originated from the defendant’s [] Internet access account, it did not specify with any detail the
6 Defendant has alleged violations of the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution,
and article I, section 6 of the Rhode Island Constitution, both of which prohibit unreasonable
searches and seizures. The applicability of Brunette in the instant suit is illustrative of the
protections awarded by the Federal and State Constitutions. For instance, the First Circuit has
held Brunette awards certain protections to citizens under the Fourth Amendment. As “[t]he
Federal Constitution only establishes a minimum level of protection,” the Rhode Island
Constitution must provide the same protections as the Federal Constitution, and thus utilize the
standard set forth in Brunette in analyzing searches and seizures. Pimental v. Dep’t of Transp.,
561 A.2d 1348, 1350 (R.I. 1989). The Supreme Court of the United States clarified that “state
courts [are] final interpreters of state law ‘to impose higher standards on searches and seizures
[under state constitutions] than required by the Federal Constitution.’” Id. (citing Cooper v.
California, 386 U.S. 58, 62 (1967)). Accordingly, the State Constitution may offer protections
against searches and seizures that award more protection than Brunette, but Brunette must be
found as the minimum protections under the Fourth Amendment, and thus any state constitution. 7
basis for believing that those images were pornographic.”7 Id. at 17. Further, the First Circuit
noted that “[t]he evidence on the nature of the images consisted solely of [the investigator’s]
legal conclusion parroting the statutory definition.” Id. The Brunette court concluded the
following: “[a] court reviewing a warrant application to search for pornographic materials ordinarily is unable to perform the evaluation required by the Fourth Amendment if the application is based on allegedly pornographic images neither appended to, nor described in, the supporting affidavit . . . If copies cannot feasibly be obtained, a detailed description, including the focal point and setting of the image, and pose and attire of the subject, will generally suffice to allow a magistrate judge to make a considered judgment.” Id. at 20. Here, Detective Macera’s description of the “Jamtien” video as “a prepubescent female
on the beach removing her bathing suit exposing her genitals” is sufficient to withstand the
requirements of Brunette, and the issuing magistrate thus was not required to view the video
before issuing the warrant. See 256 F.3d at 20. Detective Macera described the setting of the
video—a beach; the pose of the female—undressing; the attire the female was wearing—a
bathing suit; and the focal point of the video—a prepubescent female and her genitals. See id.;
Aff. at 5. While sparse, Detective Macera’s definition does not merely “parrot” the statutory
definition of child pornography. Instead, it describes the contents of the “Jamtien” file. See
Brunette, 256 F.3d at 17. The Court notes that while Detective Macera’s description meets the
requirements of Brunette, it barely does so. See id. In fact, the Court deems such description as
the bare minimum—anything less would not be sufficient to provide an issuing magistrate with
enough information to make a probable cause determination. Accordingly, the Court finds
7 The image was described as “a prepubescent boy lasciviously displaying his genitals.” The
Brunette court held that this was “an attempt on [the investigator’s] part to mirror the language”
of the child pornography statute. Id. at 17. 8
Detective Macera’s description of the “Jamtien” file sufficient under Brunette. See id.
However, the sufficiency of the description is a question separate from whether the Affidavit as a
whole was supported by probable cause. B Affidavit Supported by Probable Cause Defendant avers that the Affidavit did not establish probable cause because Detective
Macera did not provide a sufficient description of the video to enable a magistrate to determine
that the video constituted “child pornography” as statutorily defined. Specifically, Defendant
maintains that based on Detective Macera’s description of the video in the Affidavit, the video
was not a graphic or lascivious exhibition of the genitals. The State argues that the Affidavit
need only establish probable cause, not a certainty, that the picture is child pornography. The possession, transfer or production of child pornography is prohibited by § 11-9-1.3.
A finding that an image or video depicts child pornography “requires more than mere nudity.”
United States v. Amirault, 173 F.3d 28, 33 (1st Cir. 1999). Under § 11-9-1.3, child pornography
is defined as: “any visual depiction, including any photograph, film, video, picture, or computer or computer-generated image or picture, whether made or produced by electronic, mechanical, or other means, of sexually explicit conduct where: [...] “(ii) Such visual depiction is a digital image, computer image, or computer-generated image of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct . . .”
“Sexually explicit conduct” is defined as actual “[g]raphic or lascivious exhibition of the genitals
or pubic area of any person.” Sec. 11-9-1.3(c)(6) (emphasis added). “Graphic,” “when used
with respect to a depiction of sexually explicit conduct, means that a viewer can observe any part 9
of the genitals or pubic area of any depicted person or animal during any part of the time that the
sexually explicit conduct is being depicted.”8 Sec. 11-9-1.3(c)(8). Despite defining what
constitutes a “graphic” image, § 11-9-1.3 does not define what amounts to a “lascivious”
depiction of the genitals. In defining “lascivious,”9 state courts have looked to federal jurisprudence and have
employed the six factors articulated in United States v. Dost, 636 F. Supp. 828, 832 (S.D. Cal.
1986), which was adopted by the First Circuit in Amirault, 173 F.3d at 33. See Byrne, 972 A.2d
at 641 n.11 (noting the similarities between § 11-9-1.3 and its federal counterpart, 18 U.S.C.
§ 2256(2)(B)(iii)). In Dost, a defendant sought to dismiss the indictment against him, arguing
that the images that he possessed did not display or constitute a lascivious exhibition of the
genitals or pubic area of the minor that he photographed. 636 F. Supp. at 830. In denying the
motion to dismiss, the Dost court considered the following factors instructive on whether the
image depicted “lascivious” conduct: “(1) whether the focal point of the visual depiction is on the child’s genitalia or pubic area; “(2) whether the setting of the visual depiction is sexually suggestive, i.e., in a place or pose generally associated with sexual activity; “(3) whether the child is depicted in an unnatural pose, or in inappropriate attire, considering the age of the child; “(4) whether the child is fully or partially clothed, or nude;
8 The Court recognizes that the application of the definition of “graphic” is circular. See § 11-9-
1.3(c)(8). For instance, “sexually explicit conduct” is a “graphic” exhibition of the genitals; and
a “graphic exhibition of the genitals” means a depiction of any part of the genitals or pubic area
during “any part of the time that the sexually explicit conduct is being depicted.” Compare
§§ 11-9-1.3(c)(6) with (8). Simply, an image is sexually explicit conduct when it is graphic, and
the image is graphic when it is sexually explicit. See id.
9 Our Supreme Court has addressed “lascivious” only once, observing that “visual depictions of
clothed genitalia may fall within the meaning of ‘lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic
area,’ and thereby qualify as child pornography.” Byrne, 972 A.2d at 640 n.11 (quoting United
States v. Knox, 32 F.3d 733, 743-51 (3d Cir. 1994)). 10 “(5) whether the visual depiction suggests sexual coyness or a willingness to engage in sexual activity; “(6) whether the visual depiction is intended or designed to elicit a sexual response in the viewer.” Id. at 832.
The Dost court explained that “[o]f course, a visual depiction need not involve all of these
factors to be a ‘lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area.’ The determination will have
to be made based on the overall content of the visual depiction, taking into account the age of the
minor.” Id. Further, in employing the Dost factors, the Amirault court cautioned that the factors
are “neither comprehensive nor necessarily applicable in every situation.” 173 F.3d at 32. The
court explained that “[a]lthough Dost provides some specific, workable criteria, there may be
other factors that are equally if not more important in determining whether a photograph contains
a lascivious exhibition. The inquiry will always be case-specific.” Id. While § 11-9-1.3 and Dost may be instructive on what constitutes child pornography,
such a determination is not required for a finding of probable cause for a search warrant. See
Byrne, 972 A.2d at 642 (“Probable cause exists when the affidavit demonstrates in some
trustworthy fashion the likelihood that an offense has been or is being committed”). The
question before the Court is not whether the “Jamtien” video constitutes child pornography under
§ 11-9-1.3, but whether the Affidavit was sufficient to establish probable cause for the issuance
of the Search Warrant. It is important that the instant task of the Court not be confused with that
of the jury, whose task is to decide beyond a reasonable doubt whether the “Jamtien” and other
images or videos found on Defendant’s computer constitute child pornography. State v.
Guzman, 752 A.2d 1, 4 (R.I. 2000) (“[T]he existence of probable cause . . . does not require the
same degree of proof needed to determine whether that person is guilty of the crime in
question.”); see also United States v. Frabizio, 459 F.3d 80, 85 (1st Cir. 2006) (“it is up to the 11
jury to determine whether the images identified in the bill of particulars . . . constitute visual
depictions of ‘sexually explicit conduct.”’). In fact, in the purview of child pornography, our Supreme Court has held that in addition
to the fact alleged in the Affidavit, the nature of the offense can lend reasonable inferences to
support probable cause for a search warrant. Byrne, 972 A.2d at 640-42. The Byrne Court
explained that “‘[t]he requisite nexus between the criminal article or activity described in the
affidavit and the place to be searched need not be based on direct observation.’” Byrne, 972
A.2d at 640 (quoting Commonwealth v. Anthony, 883 N.E.2d 918, 926 (Mass. 2008)). Instead,
“it may be found in ‘the type of crime, the nature of the . . . items [sought], the extent of the
suspect’s opportunity for concealment, and normal inferences as to where a criminal would be
likely to hide [items of the sort sought in the warrant].’” Id. (quoting Anthony, 883 N.E.2d at
926). For instance, child pornography, like the crime of voyeurism, “is, by its nature, a solitary
and secretive crime.” Id. at 641. The Court noted that: “The observation that images of child pornography are likely to be hoarded by persons interested in those materials in the privacy of their homes is supported by common sense and the cases. Since the materials are illegal to distribute and possess, initial collection is difficult. Having succeeded in obtaining images, collectors are unlikely to destroy them. Because of their illegality and the imprimatur of severe social stigma such images carry, collectors will want to secret them in secure places, like a private residence.” Id. (quoting United States v. Riccardi, 405 F.3d 852, 861 (10th Cir. 2005)).
The type of the crime, viewed in conjunction with any instrumentality sought to be seized, also
may provide reasonable inferences necessary to establish probable cause. Id. at 641-42. For
example, it would be a reasonable inference that a camera containing sexually explicit material
would be in a defendant’s residence, charged with the illegal possession of the sexually explicit
images. Id. 12 Here, the Court finds that the Affidavit established probable cause. The definitions in
§ 11-9-1.3(c) and the factors in Dost provide guidance on what constitutes child pornography,
although such an affirmative finding on the merits is not necessary at this stage in the
proceedings. See Byrne, 972 A.2d at 642. Still, the Court looks to § 11-9-1.3 and Dost to “guide
the inquiry” in determining whether the Affidavit supplied information that amounted to
establishing probable cause. See Brunette, 256 F.3d at 18. At the outset, the Court notes that the “Jamtien” video file is likely “graphic” as defined
by § 11-9-1.3(c)(8) because the minor female’s genitals can be seen during the video. See Aff. at
5; § 11-9-1.3(c)(8). While the definition of “graphic” may appear circular in its application, the
Court also finds that the video is likely lascivious. See supra n.6. Turning to the factors in Dost, the Court notes that the first factor is not necessarily met
as the description of “Jamtien” does not state whether the focus of the video is on the minor
female’s genitals or pubic area. See Aff. at 5; Dost, 636 F. Supp. at 832. It also cannot be said
with certainty that the beach is a place that is sexually suggestive or generally associated with
sexual activity. See Aff. at 5; Dost, 636 F. Supp. at 832. Despite the fact that the beach may be
a place for romantic encounters, Detective Macera’s description does not provide any details to
allow the Court to make such an inference as to the setting of the photograph. See Aff. at 5.
However, a prepubescent female taking off her bathing suit in a public place (such as a beach)
does seem to be an unnatural pose for a person of her age. See Aff. at 5; Dost, 636 F. Supp. at
832. Furthermore, Detective Macera described the female in the video as “removing her bathing
suit” and “exposing her genitals,” allowing the Court to infer that the female was either nude or
partially nude at the time the “Jamtien” video was being taken. See Aff. at 5; Dost, 636 F. Supp.
at 832. A female undressing in front of a camera also likely suggests some degree of sexual 13
coyness or willingness to engage in sexual activity, making the “Jamtien” video likely to be
intended or designed to elicit a sexual response in the viewer. See Aff. at 5; Dost, 636 F. Supp.
at 832. In reviewing Detective Macera’s description of the “Jamtien” video file in conjunction
with all the Dost factors, and without making an affirmative finding that the “Jamtien” video file
is child pornography, the Court is satisfied that the Affidavit and Detective Macera’s description
therein were sufficient to provide and trustworthy information to demonstrate a likelihood that
child pornography images or videos were in 15 Harding Street. As previously stated, at the search warrant stage of the investigation, all that was required
was that the Affidavit demonstrate “in some trustworthy fashion the likelihood” that child
pornography was in 15 Harding Street, which it did. See id. The Affidavit asserted that the
Jamtien video file—which is likely to be child pornography—was downloaded from IP address
100.10.41.6, a member of a peer-to-peer sharing network that was suspected of containing child
pornography. See Aff. at 5. IP address 100.10.41.6 was registered to Heather, who lived at 15
Harding Street, West Warwick, Rhode Island. Id. The video downloaded was named “Jamtien”
and was described as “a prepubescent female on the beach removing her bathing suit exposing
her genitals.” Id. Based on these facts, the Affidavit has provided sufficient and trustworthy
facts to establish a “likelihood” that a resident of 15 Harding Street, West Warwick, Rhode
Island was downloading and possessed child pornography. See Byrne, 972 A.2d at 642. The facts of the Affidavit are further supported by the reasonable inferences that may be
made by the inherent nature of the crime and the instrumentalities used in the commission of the
crime. See id. at 641. The nature of the crime of child pornography reasonably infers that
evidence of the crime is within the defendant’s personal residence. See id. Specifically,
evidence of the crime would be on a device that was capable of connecting to IP address 14
100.10.41.6, including a computer or cellphone. See id. The Search Warrant was directed at
“the premises located at 15 Harding Street, West Warwick, Rhode Island 02893,” which
identified the Defendant’s home. See Aff. at 2; Byrne, 972 A.2d at 641. Further, it was directed
at “mobile devices, computer hardware, computer software, computer-related documentation,”
among others, all of which are used in the commission of an Internet-related crime, and able to
connect to IP address 100.10.41.6. See id.; Byrne, 972 A.2d at 641. In viewing the information in the Affidavit in the totality of the circumstances, awarding
appropriate deference to the issuing magistrate’s finding of probable cause, and making
reasonable inferences from the inherent nature of the crime and instrumentalities used, the Court
finds that the Affidavit provided the issuing magistrate a “substantial basis from which to discern
probable cause.” See Gates, 462 U.S. at 238-39; see also Byrne, 972 A.2d at 638. IV Conclusion In conclusion, the Court denies Defendant’s motion to suppress because the issuing
magistrate was not required to review the alleged child pornography and the Affidavit
established a substantial basis from which the issuing magistrate could conclude that probable
cause existed. Counsel shall submit an appropriate Order for entry. 15 RHODE ISLAND SUPERIOR COURT Decision Addendum Sheet

Before the Court is Ralph Reisner’s (Defendant) motion to suppress evidence seized\nwithin his home, arguing that the affidavit in support of the search warrant (the Affidavit) did not\nestablish probable cause. Conversely, the State of Rhode Island (the State) maintains that the\nAffidavit was sufficient and established probable cause. Jurisdiction is pursuant to G.L. 1956\n§ 8-2-15. For the following reasons, the Court denies Defendant’s motion to suppress.', 'I', 'Facts1 and Travel', 'Detective Brian Macera (Detective Macera) is a ten-year veteran of the Rhode Island\nState Police (RISP), and is currently assigned to the Computer Crimes Unit (CCU) and the\nRhode Island Internet Crimes against Children (ICAC) Task Force. 2 Aff. at 3. Members of the\nCCU and ICAC Task Force engage in undercover investigation of computer-related crimes to\nidentify criminals trading child pornography on the Internet using peer-to-peer networks. Id.\n1', 'Pursuant to the applicable standard of review, the following facts are garnered from the\nAffidavit. State v. Byrne, 972 A.2d 633, 638 (R.I. 2009); State v. Verrecchia, 880 A.2d 89, 94\n(R.I. 2005).\n2', 'The ICAC Task Force is administered by the RISP and “supports a national network of multi-\nagency, multi-jurisdictional task forces engaged in investigations, forensic examinations, and\nprosecutions related to Internet crimes against children and technology-facilitated child sexual\nexploitation.” Id.', 'Peer-to-peer networks facilitate the sharing of electronic files between participating\nmembers over the Internet. Id. To be a participating member, a computer user must install a\nfile-sharing software and “sharing folder” in which files can be stored and shared with other\nparticipating members of the peer-to-peer network. Id. Members of the peer-to-peer network\ncan search the network and download any shared file in that network. Id. at 3-4. Each file in the\npeer-to-peer network is attached to the Internet Protocol (IP) address3 of the computer that is\nsharing the file. Id. at 2. Further, each file in the peer-to-peer network is identifiable by a “hash”\nvalue, which is an “alpha-numeric string . . . that is calculated by applying a mathematical\nalgorithm to the electronic data that is contained in the electronic file.” Id. Therefore, if an\nelectronic file has identical content to another file, their hash values will also be identical. As a\nresult, hash values are “commonly referred to as electronic fingerprints.” Id. Any changes to the\ncontent of an electronic file, no matter how slight, will change the file’s hash value. Id. Law\nenforcement, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), and the ICAC\nTask Force have identified certain hash values as confirmed child pornography. Id.', 'In June 2015, Detective Macera was contacted by Detective Lieutenant Stephen\nRiccitelli—a detective in the North Smithfield Police Department and member of the ICAC Task\nForce—who informed him that the ICAC Task Force computer system had downloaded a file\nsuspected to be child pornography from IP address 100.10.41.6.4 Id. at 5. Detective Macera\n3', 'An IP address is a “unique routing number associated with a computer connected to the Internet\nwhich functions in the routing of data between source and destination. IP addresses are assigned\nto Internet service providers . . . who, in turn, assign them to customers for Internet access.” Id.\n4', 'At the evidentiary hearing, Detective Macera explained that the ICAC Task Force subscribes a\nsystem of computers to common peer-to-peer file sharing programs. These computers are\nprogramed to continuously look for child pornography files on the peer-to-peer network, and will\ndownload files from another participating member’s computer when such files contain certain\nhash values or descriptions that match child pornography. When an ICAC Task Force computer\ndownloads a child pornography file from another computer, a member of the ICAC Task Force is', '2\nviewed the downloaded file and confirmed that it contained child pornography as defined in\n§ 11-9-1.3 of Rhode Island’s General Laws. Id. Detective Macera described the file as follows:', '“File Name: Jamtien.mpeg', 'Date/Time: June 15, 2015 at 11:42 PM (UTC)', 'HASH Value: 2aad88e182cc9c66ccd7ba15aa186ecfac39f370', 'Description: This video file depicts a prepubescent female on the', 'beach removing her bathing suit exposing her genitals.” Id.', 'Detective Macera conducted a search of the American Registry of Internet Numbers\n(ARIN) and determined that IP address 100.10.41.6 was owned by Verizon Internet Services,\n2701 South Johnson Street, San Angelo, Texas 76904 (Verizon). Id. Verizon was served with a\nsubpoena, which directed it to provide to RISP the name, address, and telephone number of the\nsubscriber of IP address 100.10.41.6. Id.', 'Verizon identified the subscriber of the IP address\n100.10.41.6 as Heather Reisner (Heather) of 15 Harding Street, West Warwick, Rhode Island.\nId.', 'Detective Macera searched law enforcement databases and confirmed that Heather\nresided at 15 Harding Street, West Warwick, Rhode Island 02893. Id. Although Heather’s\ndriver’s license indicated that her address was 8 ½ Lachance Street, West Warwick, Rhode\nIsland, she indicated in a previous communication with the West Warwick Police Department\nthat her residence was 15 Harding Street, West Warwick, Rhode Island. Id. at 5-6. Detective\nMacera also confirmed with the United States Postal Service that Heather was receiving mail at\n15 Harding Street, West Warwick, Rhode Island. Id. at 6. On several occasions in July 2015,\nDetective Macera set up surveillance at 15 Harding Street, West Warwick, Rhode Island and\nobserved a female exiting the residence. Id. Detective Macera recognized the female exiting the\nhouse as Heather from her driver’s license photograph. Id.\nnotified and the download is documented in a log file along with the IP address from which the\nchild pornography file was downloaded.', '3', 'On July 29, 2015, Detective Macera used the above information to apply for a search\nwarrant (the Search Warrant) of 15 Harding Street, West Warwick, Rhode Island and requested\nthat a member of the RISP CCU conduct an on- and off-site forensic review of seized evidence\nrelated to the possession and transfer of child pornography. On the same day, the Search\nWarrant was approved. Subsequently, on August 3, 2015, RISP executed the Search Warrant,\nseizing Defendant’s computer—a Mac Pro desktop (serial number WCAU40341527)\n(Defendant’s Computer). A police forensic examination of Defendant’s Computer revealed\nseven videos of child pornography. Based on this evidence, the RISP obtained an arrest warrant\nfor Defendant, and Defendant was subsequently arrested. On December 24, 2015, the State filed\na criminal information, charging Defendant with possession of child pornography, in violation of\n§ 11-9-1.3(b)(2); and delivery or transfer of child pornography, in violation of § 11-9-1.3(b)(1).', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, section 6 of the\nRhode Island Constitution, prohibits the issuance of a search warrant absent a showing of\nprobable cause.” Verrecchia, 880 A.2d at 94. “The United States Supreme Court has indicated\nthat the existence of probable cause should be determined pursuant to a flexible ‘totality-of-the-\ncircumstances analysis.’” Id. (quoting Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238-39 (1983)). The\nSupreme Court of the United States explained:', '“The task of the issuing magistrate is simply to make a practical,', 'common-sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set', 'forth in the affidavit before him, including the ‘veracity’ and ‘basis', 'of knowledge’ of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a', 'fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be', 'found in a particular place. And the duty of a reviewing court is', 'simply to ensure that the magistrate had a ‘substantial basis for . . .', '4', 'conclud[ing]’ that probable cause existed.” Gates, 462 U.S. at', '238-39.\n“In other words, the approach to the probable cause question should be pragmatic and flexible.”\nVerrecchia, 880 A.2d at 94 (citing State v. Spaziano, 685 A.2d 1068, 1069 (R.I. 1996); State v.\nCorreia, 707 A.2d 1245, 1249 (R.I. 1998); State v. Hightower, 661 A.2d 948, 959 (R.I. 1995)).\nTherefore, “[t]he magistrate is permitted to draw reasonable inferences from the affidavit\npresented to him or her.” Id. (citing State v. Pratt, 641 A.2d 732, 736 (R.I. 1994)).', '“Because there is ‘a strong preference for searches conducted pursuant to a warrant,’\naffidavits are to be interpreted in a realistic fashion that is consistent with common sense, and not\nsubject to rigorous and hypertechnical scrutiny.” Byrne, 972 A.2d at 638 (quoting Gates, 462\nU.S. at 235-39); see also United States v. Ventresca, 380 U.S. 102, 109 (1965) (“[W]hen a\nmagistrate has found probable cause, the courts should not invalidate the warrant by interpreting\nthe affidavit in a hypertechnical, rather than a commonsense, manner.”).', 'In fact, “[i]t is\nincumbent upon the trial justice and the reviewing court to accord great deference to the issuing\nmagistrate’s probable-cause determination, so long as there is a showing of ‘a substantial basis\nfrom which to discern probable cause.’”5 Id. (citing State v. Correia, 707 A.2d 1245, 1249 (R.I.\n1998)). “[I]n close cases, the validity of the warrant should be upheld.” Id. at 642. “‘Probable\ncause exists when the affidavit demonstrates in some trustworthy fashion the likelihood that an\noffense has been or is being committed.’” Id. (quoting United States v. Santana, 342 F.3d 60, 65\n(1st Cir. 2003)).\n5', 'Our Supreme Court has held that “a deferential standard of review should be applied when\nreviewing a magistrate’s decision to issue a warrant because ‘[t]he Fourth Amendment\ndemonstrates a strong preference for searches conducted pursuant to a warrant . . . and the police\nare more likely to use the warrant process if the scrutiny applied to a magistrate’s probable-cause\ndetermination to issue a warrant is less than that for warrantless searches.’” Id. (internal citations\nomitted).', '5', 'III', 'Analysis', 'Defendant argues that evidence seized as a result of the Search Warrant should be\nsuppressed because (1) Detective Macera’s description of the video was insufficient; (2) the\nvideo was not child pornography as defined by § 11-9-1.3(c)(1)(ii); and (3) the issuing\nmagistrate did not view the video to determine if it was, by law, child pornography. The State\nmaintains that the Search Warrant was supported by probable cause because (1) the Affidavit\nestablished a fair probability that the evidence of crime would be located at 15 Harding Street;\n(2) the issuing magistrate is not required to view the video to establish probable cause; and (3)\nsuppression is not warranted because the RISP relied upon the Search Warrant in good faith.', 'A', 'Issuing Magistrate’s Review of Alleged Child Pornography', 'The Court first addresses Defendant’s argument that because the issuing magistrate did\nnot view the video himself, the Search Warrant should be deemed invalid. The State counters\nthat the issuing magistrate need not view the alleged child pornography to make a “pre-charge\ndecision” as to whether the video constitutes child pornography.', 'Whether or not an issuing magistrate of a search warrant needs to review an alleged\nimage or video of child pornography is a matter of first impression in Rhode Island. In instances\nof first impression, and when there is a nearly identical federal statute, our Supreme Court has\nlooked to federal court jurisprudence for guidance. State v. Brown, 62 A.3d 1099, 1109 (R.I.\n2013). It has been noted that the State’s child pornography statute is substantially similar to its\nfederal counterpart, 18 U.S.C. § 2256(2)(B)(iii). Byrne, 972 A.2d at 641 n.11. Therefore, the\nCourt looks to United State v. Brunette, 256 F.3d 14, 17-18 (1st Cir. 2001), in which the First', '6\nCircuit discussed the necessity of a magistrate to review alleged child pornography images or\nvideo when issuing a warrant in a child pornography investigation.6', 'In Brunette, an investigator applied for a search warrant after discovering that a defendant\nhad downloaded thirty-three images of child pornography. 256 F.3d at 15-16. The affidavit\nsubmitted in support of the search warrant application did not append any of the allegedly\npornographic images and did not contain a description of them. Id. at 16. Rather, the affidavit\nmerely asserted that the images “met the statutory definition of child pornography.” Id. The\nwarrant issued and other allegedly pornographic images were found on the defendant’s\ncomputer. Id. Subsequently, the defendant moved to suppress the images contained on the\ncomputers seized under the warrant, arguing that the affidavit had a “nondescript legal\nconclusion” and the warrant lacked probable cause because the issuing magistrate did not view\nthe images and determine that they were child pornography. Id.', 'In its review of the grant of the search warrant, the First Circuit held that “[a]lthough the\naffidavit included sufficient indicia to link the images to the defendant, i.e., that the postings\noriginated from the defendant’s [] Internet access account, it did not specify with any detail the\n6', 'Defendant has alleged violations of the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution,\nand article I, section 6 of the Rhode Island Constitution, both of which prohibit unreasonable\nsearches and seizures. The applicability of Brunette in the instant suit is illustrative of the\nprotections awarded by the Federal and State Constitutions. For instance, the First Circuit has\nheld Brunette awards certain protections to citizens under the Fourth Amendment. As “[t]he\nFederal Constitution only establishes a minimum level of protection,” the Rhode Island\nConstitution must provide the same protections as the Federal Constitution, and thus utilize the\nstandard set forth in Brunette in analyzing searches and seizures. Pimental v. Dep’t of Transp.,\n561 A.2d 1348, 1350 (R.I. 1989). The Supreme Court of the United States clarified that “state\ncourts [are] final interpreters of state law ‘to impose higher standards on searches and seizures\n[under state constitutions] than required by the Federal Constitution.’” Id. (citing Cooper v.\nCalifornia, 386 U.S. 58, 62 (1967)). Accordingly, the State Constitution may offer protections\nagainst searches and seizures that award more protection than Brunette, but Brunette must be\nfound as the minimum protections under the Fourth Amendment, and thus any state constitution.', '7\nbasis for believing that those images were pornographic.”7 Id. at 17. Further, the First Circuit\nnoted that “[t]he evidence on the nature of the images consisted solely of [the investigator’s]\nlegal conclusion parroting the statutory definition.” Id. The Brunette court concluded the\nfollowing:', '“[a] court reviewing a warrant application to search for', 'pornographic materials ordinarily is unable to perform the', 'evaluation required by the Fourth Amendment if the application is', 'based on allegedly pornographic images neither appended to, nor', 'described in, the supporting affidavit . . . If copies cannot feasibly', 'be obtained, a detailed description, including the focal point and', 'setting of the image, and pose and attire of the subject, will', 'generally suffice to allow a magistrate judge to make a considered', 'judgment.” Id. at 20.', 'Here, Detective Macera’s description of the “Jamtien” video as “a prepubescent female\non the beach removing her bathing suit exposing her genitals” is sufficient to withstand the\nrequirements of Brunette, and the issuing magistrate thus was not required to view the video\nbefore issuing the warrant. See 256 F.3d at 20. Detective Macera described the setting of the\nvideo—a beach; the pose of the female—undressing; the attire the female was wearing—a\nbathing suit; and the focal point of the video—a prepubescent female and her genitals. See id.;\nAff. at 5. While sparse, Detective Macera’s definition does not merely “parrot” the statutory\ndefinition of child pornography. Instead, it describes the contents of the “Jamtien” file. See\nBrunette, 256 F.3d at 17. The Court notes that while Detective Macera’s description meets the\nrequirements of Brunette, it barely does so. See id. In fact, the Court deems such description as\nthe bare minimum—anything less would not be sufficient to provide an issuing magistrate with\nenough information to make a probable cause determination. Accordingly, the Court finds\n7', 'The image was described as “a prepubescent boy lasciviously displaying his genitals.” The\nBrunette court held that this was “an attempt on [the investigator’s] part to mirror the language”\nof the child pornography statute. Id. at 17.', '8\nDetective Macera’s description of the “Jamtien” file sufficient under Brunette.', 'See id.\nHowever, the sufficiency of the description is a question separate from whether the Affidavit as a\nwhole was supported by probable cause.', 'B', 'Affidavit Supported by Probable Cause', 'Defendant avers that the Affidavit did not establish probable cause because Detective\nMacera did not provide a sufficient description of the video to enable a magistrate to determine\nthat the video constituted “child pornography” as statutorily defined. Specifically, Defendant\nmaintains that based on Detective Macera’s description of the video in the Affidavit, the video\nwas not a graphic or lascivious exhibition of the genitals. The State argues that the Affidavit\nneed only establish probable cause, not a certainty, that the picture is child pornography.', 'The possession, transfer or production of child pornography is prohibited by § 11-9-1.3.\nA finding that an image or video depicts child pornography “requires more than mere nudity.”\nUnited States v. Amirault, 173 F.3d 28, 33 (1st Cir. 1999). Under § 11-9-1.3, child pornography\nis defined as:', '“any visual depiction, including any photograph, film, video,', 'picture, or computer or computer-generated image or picture,', 'whether made or produced by electronic, mechanical, or other', 'means, of sexually explicit conduct where:', '[...]', '“(ii) Such visual depiction is a digital image, computer image,', 'or computer-generated image of a minor engaging in', 'sexually explicit conduct . . .”\n“Sexually explicit conduct” is defined as actual “[g]raphic or lascivious exhibition of the genitals\nor pubic area of any person.” Sec. 11-9-1.3(c)(6) (emphasis added). “Graphic,” “when used\nwith respect to a depiction of sexually explicit conduct, means that a viewer can observe any part', '9\nof the genitals or pubic area of any depicted person or animal during any part of the time that the\nsexually explicit conduct is being depicted.”8', 'Sec. 11-9-1.3(c)(8). Despite defining what\nconstitutes a “graphic” image, § 11-9-1.3 does not define what amounts to a “lascivious”\ndepiction of the genitals.', 'In defining “lascivious,”9 state courts have looked to federal jurisprudence and have\nemployed the six factors articulated in United States v. Dost, 636 F. Supp. 828, 832 (S.D. Cal.\n1986), which was adopted by the First Circuit in Amirault, 173 F.3d at 33. See Byrne, 972 A.2d\nat 641 n.11 (noting the similarities between § 11-9-1.3 and its federal counterpart, 18 U.S.C.\n§ 2256(2)(B)(iii)). In Dost, a defendant sought to dismiss the indictment against him, arguing\nthat the images that he possessed did not display or constitute a lascivious exhibition of the\ngenitals or pubic area of the minor that he photographed. 636 F. Supp. at 830. In denying the\nmotion to dismiss, the Dost court considered the following factors instructive on whether the\nimage depicted “lascivious” conduct:', '“(1) whether the focal point of the visual depiction is on the child’s', 'genitalia or pubic area;', '“(2) whether the setting of the visual depiction is sexually', 'suggestive, i.e., in a place or pose generally associated with', 'sexual activity;', '“(3) whether the child is depicted in an unnatural pose, or in', 'inappropriate attire, considering the age of the child;', '“(4) whether the child is fully or partially clothed, or nude;\n8', 'The Court recognizes that the application of the definition of “graphic” is circular. See § 11-9-\n1.3(c)(8). For instance, “sexually explicit conduct” is a “graphic” exhibition of the genitals; and\na “graphic exhibition of the genitals” means a depiction of any part of the genitals or pubic area\nduring “any part of the time that the sexually explicit conduct is being depicted.” Compare\n§§ 11-9-1.3(c)(6) with (8). Simply, an image is sexually explicit conduct when it is graphic, and\nthe image is graphic when it is sexually explicit. See id.\n9', 'Our Supreme Court has addressed “lascivious” only once, observing that “visual depictions of\nclothed genitalia may fall within the meaning of ‘lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic\narea,’ and thereby qualify as child pornography.” Byrne, 972 A.2d at 640 n.11 (quoting United\nStates v. Knox, 32 F.3d 733, 743-51 (3d Cir. 1994)).', '10', '“(5) whether the visual depiction suggests sexual coyness or a', 'willingness to engage in sexual activity;', '“(6) whether the visual depiction is intended or designed to elicit a', 'sexual response in the viewer.” Id. at 832.\nThe Dost court explained that “[o]f course, a visual depiction need not involve all of these\nfactors to be a ‘lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area.’ The determination will have\nto be made based on the overall content of the visual depiction, taking into account the age of the\nminor.” Id. Further, in employing the Dost factors, the Amirault court cautioned that the factors\nare “neither comprehensive nor necessarily applicable in every situation.” 173 F.3d at 32. The\ncourt explained that “[a]lthough Dost provides some specific, workable criteria, there may be\nother factors that are equally if not more important in determining whether a photograph contains\na lascivious exhibition. The inquiry will always be case-specific.” Id.', 'While § 11-9-1.3 and Dost may be instructive on what constitutes child pornography,\nsuch a determination is not required for a finding of probable cause for a search warrant. See\nByrne, 972 A.2d at 642 (“Probable cause exists when the affidavit demonstrates in some\ntrustworthy fashion the likelihood that an offense has been or is being committed”). The\nquestion before the Court is not whether the “Jamtien” video constitutes child pornography under\n§ 11-9-1.3, but whether the Affidavit was sufficient to establish probable cause for the issuance\nof the Search Warrant. It is important that the instant task of the Court not be confused with that\nof the jury, whose task is to decide beyond a reasonable doubt whether the “Jamtien” and other\nimages or videos found on Defendant’s computer constitute child pornography.', 'State v.\nGuzman, 752 A.2d 1, 4 (R.I. 2000) (“[T]he existence of probable cause . . . does not require the\nsame degree of proof needed to determine whether that person is guilty of the crime in\nquestion.”); see also United States v. Frabizio, 459 F.3d 80, 85 (1st Cir. 2006) (“it is up to the', '11\njury to determine whether the images identified in the bill of particulars . . . constitute visual\ndepictions of ‘sexually explicit conduct.”’).', 'In fact, in the purview of child pornography, our Supreme Court has held that in addition\nto the fact alleged in the Affidavit, the nature of the offense can lend reasonable inferences to\nsupport probable cause for a search warrant. Byrne, 972 A.2d at 640-42. The Byrne Court\nexplained that “‘[t]he requisite nexus between the criminal article or activity described in the\naffidavit and the place to be searched need not be based on direct observation.’” Byrne, 972\nA.2d at 640 (quoting Commonwealth v. Anthony, 883 N.E.2d 918, 926 (Mass. 2008)). Instead,\n“it may be found in ‘the type of crime, the nature of the . . . items [sought], the extent of the\nsuspect’s opportunity for concealment, and normal inferences as to where a criminal would be\nlikely to hide [items of the sort sought in the warrant].’” Id. (quoting Anthony, 883 N.E.2d at\n926). For instance, child pornography, like the crime of voyeurism, “is, by its nature, a solitary\nand secretive crime.” Id. at 641. The Court noted that:', '“The observation that images of child pornography are likely to be', 'hoarded by persons interested in those materials in the privacy of', 'their homes is supported by common sense and the cases. Since', 'the materials are illegal to distribute and possess, initial collection', 'is difficult. Having succeeded in obtaining images, collectors are', 'unlikely to destroy them. Because of their illegality and the', 'imprimatur of severe social stigma such images carry, collectors', 'will want to secret them in secure places, like a private residence.”', 'Id. (quoting United States v. Riccardi, 405 F.3d 852, 861 (10th Cir.', '2005)).\nThe type of the crime, viewed in conjunction with any instrumentality sought to be seized, also\nmay provide reasonable inferences necessary to establish probable cause. Id. at 641-42. For\nexample, it would be a reasonable inference that a camera containing sexually explicit material\nwould be in a defendant’s residence, charged with the illegal possession of the sexually explicit\nimages. Id.', '12', 'Here, the Court finds that the Affidavit established probable cause. The definitions in\n§ 11-9-1.3(c) and the factors in Dost provide guidance on what constitutes child pornography,\nalthough such an affirmative finding on the merits is not necessary at this stage in the\nproceedings. See Byrne, 972 A.2d at 642. Still, the Court looks to § 11-9-1.3 and Dost to “guide\nthe inquiry” in determining whether the Affidavit supplied information that amounted to\nestablishing probable cause. See Brunette, 256 F.3d at 18.', 'At the outset, the Court notes that the “Jamtien” video file is likely “graphic” as defined\nby § 11-9-1.3(c)(8) because the minor female’s genitals can be seen during the video. See Aff. at\n5; § 11-9-1.3(c)(8). While the definition of “graphic” may appear circular in its application, the\nCourt also finds that the video is likely lascivious. See supra n.6.', 'Turning to the factors in Dost, the Court notes that the first factor is not necessarily met\nas the description of “Jamtien” does not state whether the focus of the video is on the minor\nfemale’s genitals or pubic area. See Aff. at 5; Dost, 636 F. Supp. at 832. It also cannot be said\nwith certainty that the beach is a place that is sexually suggestive or generally associated with\nsexual activity. See Aff. at 5; Dost, 636 F. Supp. at 832. Despite the fact that the beach may be\na place for romantic encounters, Detective Macera’s description does not provide any details to\nallow the Court to make such an inference as to the setting of the photograph. See Aff. at 5.\nHowever, a prepubescent female taking off her bathing suit in a public place (such as a beach)\ndoes seem to be an unnatural pose for a person of her age. See Aff. at 5; Dost, 636 F. Supp. at\n832. Furthermore, Detective Macera described the female in the video as “removing her bathing\nsuit” and “exposing her genitals,” allowing the Court to infer that the female was either nude or\npartially nude at the time the “Jamtien” video was being taken. See Aff. at 5; Dost, 636 F. Supp.\nat 832.

See Aff. at 5; Dost, 636 F. Supp.\nat 832. In reviewing Detective Macera’s description of the “Jamtien” video file in conjunction\nwith all the Dost factors, and without making an affirmative finding that the “Jamtien” video file\nis child pornography, the Court is satisfied that the Affidavit and Detective Macera’s description\ntherein were sufficient to provide and trustworthy information to demonstrate a likelihood that\nchild pornography images or videos were in 15 Harding Street.', 'As previously stated, at the search warrant stage of the investigation, all that was required\nwas that the Affidavit demonstrate “in some trustworthy fashion the likelihood” that child\npornography was in 15 Harding Street, which it did. See id. The Affidavit asserted that the\nJamtien video file—which is likely to be child pornography—was downloaded from IP address\n100.10.41.6, a member of a peer-to-peer sharing network that was suspected of containing child\npornography. See Aff. at 5. IP address 100.10.41.6 was registered to Heather, who lived at 15\nHarding Street, West Warwick, Rhode Island. Id. The video downloaded was named “Jamtien”\nand was described as “a prepubescent female on the beach removing her bathing suit exposing\nher genitals.” Id. Based on these facts, the Affidavit has provided sufficient and trustworthy\nfacts to establish a “likelihood” that a resident of 15 Harding Street, West Warwick, Rhode\nIsland was downloading and possessed child pornography. See Byrne, 972 A.2d at 642.', 'The facts of the Affidavit are further supported by the reasonable inferences that may be\nmade by the inherent nature of the crime and the instrumentalities used in the commission of the\ncrime. See id. at 641. The nature of the crime of child pornography reasonably infers that\nevidence of the crime is within the defendant’s personal residence.', 'See id.', 'Specifically,\nevidence of the crime would be on a device that was capable of connecting to IP address', '14\n100.10.41.6, including a computer or cellphone.

Is a motorist, who had been charged with a first\nviolation of operating a motor vehicle after his license has been suspended, entitled to have his\nrecords sealed under the provisions of Rhode Island General Laws § 12-1-12? We granted the\npetition of Zachary Charlwood (Charlwood or defendant) for a writ of certiorari seeking review of\nan order of the District Court denying his motion to seal his record. This case came before us\npursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause as to why the issues raised by\nthis appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral\nsubmissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this\ncase may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth below, we\nquash the order of the District Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'In October 2017, a Coventry police officer stopped Charlwood for driving a motor vehicle\nafter his license had been suspended. Thereafter, Charlwood was charged in District Court with a\nviolation of G.L. 1956 § 31-11-18, specifically that he “did * * * operate a motor vehicle * * *', '-1-\nafter his license to operate had been suspended[,]” first violation. The charge was later dismissed\npursuant to Rule 48(a) of the District Court Rules of Criminal Procedure because defendant’s\nlicense had been reinstated. Charlwood then moved to seal his court records under G.L. 1956\n§ 12-1-12. The trial judge granted this motion in an order dated October 24, 2017 (October Order).\nOn November 1, 2017, however, the trial judge sua sponte denied the same motion by handwriting\n“DENIED” on the original order (November Order).', 'Charlwood filed a petition for writ of certiorari asking this Court to review the denial of\nhis motion. On September 25, 2018, we granted defendant’s petition, summarily vacated the order\ndenying defendant’s motion to seal, and remanded the case to the District Court with instructions\nto “conduct a hearing forthwith on the petitioner’s motion to seal with all parties present.” We\nalso ordered that the papers be returned to this Court, subsequent to the “entry of an order granting\nor denying petitioner’s motion to seal.”', 'On remand before the trial judge, Charlwood made both procedural and substantive\narguments. He argued that, because this Court had vacated the November Order denying his\nmotion, the October Order granting his motion was still in effect. Thus, he asserted, the trial judge\ndid not have the authority to vacate the October Order because there was no motion pending before\nher to do so. With respect to the merits of his motion, Charlwood contended that, under the\nprovisions of § 12-1-12(b), the sealing statute applies to persons “detained by police, but not\narrested or charged with an offense,” precisely the situation in which, Charlwood maintained, he\nfound himself. The state did not object to defendant’s motion.1\n1', 'The state made an additional argument as to why defendant’s motion to seal should be granted\nand referred the trial judge to G.L. 1956 § 12-1.3-2(g): “[A] person may file a motion for the\nexpungement of records related to an offense that has been decriminalized subsequent to the date\nof their conviction[.]”', '-2-', 'The trial judge denied Charlwood’s motion to seal and determined that “the language of\nthe sealing and expungement statute makes it clear that that statute is for criminal offenses only,\nnot civil.”2 Because defendant was charged with a first violation of driving with a suspended\nlicense, a civil violation, the trial judge found that no relief was provided to defendant by the plain\nand ordinary meaning of § 12-1-12. The trial judge looked to the language of the statute and noted\nthat the statute speaks only to criminal cases and is silent with respect to civil violations; therefore,\nshe concluded that the Legislature had not provided a mechanism to seal or expunge civil\nviolations. Thus, the trial judge denied the motion. The papers were then returned to this Court\nin accordance with our order of September 25, 2018.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'It is well settled that this Court’s “review of a case on certiorari is limited to an examination\nof the record to determine if an error of law has been committed.” Sandy Point Farms, Inc. v.\nSandy Point Village, LLC, 200 A.3d 659, 662 (R.I. 2019) (quoting DeCurtis v.

Franklin, 439 U.S. 379, 392 (1979)).', 'We begin our analysis of § 12-1-12(b)’s application to the facts of this case by noting that\nthe charging document was entitled “State of Rhode Island District Court Criminal Complaint”\nand assigned a criminal docket number. Moreover, the ultimate disposition of the case was a\ndismissal under Rule 48(a) of the District Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. It would appear,\ntherefore, that Charlwood was charged with a criminal offense, and thus clearly the provisions of\n§ 12-1-12(b) would not apply to him. A closer analysis, however, reveals several anomalies in the\nstatutory framework at play in the case.', '-5-', 'The “criminal complaint” charges Charlwood with a violation of § 31-11-18, specifically\nstating that he did “operate a motor vehicle * * * after his license to operate had been suspended.”\nFurther, it indicates that this was Charlwood’s first violation. The complaint also contains a series\nof four boxes indicating the nature of the illegal act with which Charlwood has been charged; the\nboxes are designated: felony, misdemeanor, violation, and ordinance. The only box checked on\nCharlwood’s complaint was “violation[.]” Indeed, § 31-11-18(b) provides that “[u]pon a first\nviolation under this section, a civil penalty of not less than two hundred fifty dollars ($250), nor\nmore than five hundred dollars ($500), shall be imposed.” In light of these circumstances, we\nconclude that Charlwood was not “charged with an offense” within the meaning of § 12-1-12(b).\nAlthough procedurally the charge against Charlwood had the trappings of a criminal complaint, it\nis clear that he was liable only for a civil penalty.', 'Our analysis is further informed by the statutory language of § 31-11-18, as well as by its\nstatutory history. Subsection (a) provides, in relevant part, that “[a]ny person who drives a motor\nvehicle on any highway of this state * * * at a time when his or her license to operate is suspended\n* * * may be guilty of a misdemeanor.” Significantly, the statute was amended in 2016 to enact\nthe current language that any such person “may be guilty of a misdemeanor.” The previous version\nprovided that any such person “shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.” Subsection 31-11-18(b)\nclarifies, however, that first and second violations are subject to a civil penalty only. It is clear to\nus, therefore, that Charlwood was charged with a civil violation and not a criminal offense.', 'Section 12-1-12(b) extends the requirements of § 12-1-12(a) “to persons detained by\npolice, but not arrested or charged with an offense, or to persons against whom charges have been\nfiled by the court, and the period of such filing has expired.” Charlwood was in fact detained by\npolice, but he neither was charged with a criminal offense nor were charges against him filed by', '-6-\nthe court in accordance with G.L. 1956 § 12-10-12.3 Accordingly, under the facts of this case we\nare of the opinion that the defendant falls squarely within the purview of § 12-1-12(b) as a person\n“detained by police, but not arrested or charged with an offense,” and we hold that the defendant\nis entitled to the benefits of § 12-1-12(a) with respect to the destruction and sealing of his records.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, this Court quashes the order of the District Court and remands\nthe case for entry of an order consistent with this opinion.\n3', 'General Laws 1956 § 12-10-12 contains provisions related to the filing of a criminal complaint\n“other than a complaint for the commission of a felony or a complaint against a person who has\nbeen convicted of a felony or a private complaint.” If such a complaint is filed, the court has\ndiscretion to place conditions on such filing, for example, “performance of services for the public\ngood.” Section 12-10-12(a).', '-7-\nSTATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND', 'PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS', 'SUPREME COURT – CLERK’S OFFICE', 'OPINION COVER SHEET', 'State ex rel.

Raymond A. Peltier. :","['It is my further opinion that, had the analysis been completed, Rule 403 nonetheless\nshould have barred the admission of the contested evidence. Clearly, this is not an easy burden\nto meet. We have said that it is only “when evidence is marginally relevant and enormously\nprejudicial that a trial justice must exclude it.” State v. Pona, 948 A.2d 941, 950 (R.I. 2008)\n(citing State v. Silvia, 898 A.2d 707, 717 (R.I. 2006)). However, we have held such evidence to\nbe inadmissible when “its utility was clearly outweighed by the danger that it would confuse,\nmislead, and unfairly prejudice the jury.” Gaspar, 982 A.2d at 149. In Gaspar, we found that\nevidence of prior consensual sexual encounters had little bearing on an alleged sexual assault and\nit “was very likely to confuse the jury and invite an emotional response.” Id. Here, the\ndefendant’s resistance to arrest cast very little light on whether he had earlier assaulted the\ncomplaining witness.', 'Instead, in my view, it encouraged the jury to make an emotional\nresponse, to associate the defendant with violent behaviors, and to agree with the state’s\ncharacterization of the defendant as a “combative person” who lacked the “demeanor of an\ninnocent man.” In a case that featured limited testimony and very little physical evidence, the\nfact that the defendant may have been violent during the process of his arrest was, in my opinion,\nenormously prejudicial.\n7', 'I disagree with the majority’s characterization that defendant did not properly develop his Rule\n403 argument. From the record, it is clear that Rule 403 was raised and argued before the trial\njustice. Even though defendant’s written argument on Rule 403 before this Court was sparse, it\nwas raised in his Rule 12A statement. See Article I, Rule 12A of the Supreme Court Rules of\nAppellate Procedure.

The defendant, Raymond A.\nPeltier (defendant or Peltier), appeals from a judgment of conviction after a jury trial of one\ncount of simple domestic assault. The trial justice subsequently denied the defendant’s motion\nfor a new trial and sentenced Peltier to one year’s probation. Before this Court, the defendant\nargues that the trial justice erred when he allowed into evidence the fact that Peltier resisted\narrest in this case, a complaint to which the defendant had entered a plea of nolo contendere\nimmediately before the start of trial. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the\nmemoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown, and we\nproceed to decide the appeal at this time. We affirm the judgment of conviction entered by the\nSuperior Court.', '-1-', 'Facts and Travel', 'A criminal complaint was filed against Peltier on September 19, 2012. After a bench trial\nin District Court, defendant was found guilty of one count of simple domestic assault and one\ncount of resisting arrest. The defendant appealed these convictions to the Superior Court and\nexercised his right to a jury trial.', 'Prior to the commencement of the jury trial in Superior Court, Peltier entered a plea of\nnolo contendere to the complaint of resisting arrest. The trial justice continued the matter for\nsentencing after accepting the plea. During the course of the prosecutor’s opening statements,\ndefense counsel objected and moved for a mistrial when the prosecutor referenced the resisting\narrest. The defense counsel contended that this was evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts by\ndefendant that was irrelevant and inadmissible in accordance with Rule 404(b) of the Rhode\nIsland Rules of Evidence. The trial justice overruled defense counsel’s objection and denied his\nmotion for a mistrial. The record of this case discloses that defense counsel was notified of the\nstate’s intention to introduce evidence that Peltier resisted arrest before defendant entered a plea\nof nolo contendere.', 'The state first called the complaining witness, Kelly Thurber (Thurber), to testify.\nThurber recounted that she had known Peltier for almost twenty years and that he is her\ndaughter’s father.', 'Thurber testified that Peltier typically cared for their daughter on\nWednesdays. Thurber stated that on Tuesday, September 18, 2012, she attempted, without\nsuccess, to call Peltier numerous times in order to finalize their plans for the next morning.\nThurber testified that on the morning of Wednesday, September 19, 2012, when Peltier did not\ncome to pick up their daughter, she first called defendant repeatedly and then drove to his home\nin West Warwick with the child. At approximately 8 a.m., Thurber and her daughter walked up', '-2-\na flight of stairs to Peltier’s second-floor apartment, and Thurber began knocking on the window\nand door. After about five minutes, Peltier answered the door. Almost immediately, a verbal\nspat ensued. According to Thurber, when she extended her hand to separate herself from Peltier,\nshe was pushed back by defendant and fell down a few stairs. Peltier then began to punch her\nand kick her. Once Peltier saw that his twenty-month-old daughter was crying and throwing\nherself on the floor, he abandoned Thurber and took the child inside his apartment. Thurber then\ncalled 9-1-1.', 'Officer Joshua D. Kennedy (Officer Kennedy) of the West Warwick Police\nDepartment arrived at the location, and Thurber recounted the events to him.', 'The second, and final, witness was Officer Kennedy. Officer Kennedy testified that at\n8:16 a.m. on September 19, 2012, he was dispatched to defendant’s apartment for a domestic\ndisturbance. Upon arriving at the scene, Officer Kennedy encountered a visibly upset Thurber\nstanding in the driveway. Officer Kennedy called for backup when he learned that the child was\ninside with Peltier. Moments later three other officers arrived. Officer Kennedy testified that he\nmade contact with defendant and told him to “calm down because he was pacing throughout\ninside the house.” Defense counsel interposed an objection on the same grounds raised during\nthe state’s opening statement—that the testimony regarding the facts surrounding the charge of\nresisting arrest was inadmissible under Rule 404(b). The objection was overruled by the trial\njustice. Thereafter, Officer Kennedy testified that Peltier was not listening to the officers’\ninstructions and was breathing and sweating heavily. Peltier was then advised that he was being\nplaced under arrest for domestic simple assault and domestic disorderly conduct. Officer\nKennedy instructed Peltier to place his hands behind his back, but Peltier did not comply. As the\nofficers began to place Peltier in handcuffs, he actively resisted and tried to pull the officers to\nthe ground. Peltier continued his resistance as the officers walked him down the stairs, and at', '-3-\none point he pulled all four officers against an adjoining building—causing one officer to fall\ndown.', 'Throughout Officer Kennedy’s testimony, defense counsel continuously objected to the\nline of questioning detailing the circumstances of Peltier’s arrest, and he eventually moved to\npass the case. After hearing argument, outside the presence of the jury, the trial justice denied\ndefense counsel’s motion, but did grant him a continuing objection to that line of questioning.\nAdditionally, after Officer Kennedy concluded testifying, the trial justice gave the following\ninstruction to the jury:', '“[T]o the extent that you’ve heard testimony that on the morning in', 'question relating to Mr. Peltier’s, the defendant’s, alleged', 'misconduct during the attempt by the West Warwick Police to', 'investigate the complaint by Miss Thurber and to effectuate an', 'arrest, that conduct, of course, goes beyond the charge for which', 'Mr. Peltier is on trial here, which is, of course, simple assault,', 'domestic in nature.

It is not admitted for purposes of proving the', 'kind of person that Mr. Peltier is or bearing on his character.”', 'The state rested, and the defense opted not to present any witnesses. During closing\narguments, attorneys for both the state and defendant referenced the fact that Peltier had resisted\narrest. 1 When the prosecutor suggested that Peltier’s “demeanor [was not that] of an innocent\nman[,]” defense counsel moved for a mistrial based on the same grounds that he had previously\n1', 'Defense counsel posited to the jury that:', '“Raymond Peltier resisted arrest. He did resist arrest. An innocent person may', 'very well resist arrest when they are falsely accused of a crime. Is it right? No,', 'it’s not right. Is it legal? It’s not legal. Does it mean he’s guilty of this? No. He', 'is not guilty of assaulting her.”\nAlso, although Peltier did not testify at trial, defense counsel argued to the jury that defendant\n“resisted arrest because he was angry for being arrested for something he didn’t do.”', '-4-\nargued. The trial justice denied the motion. 2 Peltier was found guilty of simple domestic\nassault.', 'On July 22, 2013, defendant’s motion for a new trial was denied by the trial justice.\nDefense counsel indicated that one of the bases of the motion was the fact that the circumstances\nof his conduct in resisting arrest came before the jury and that he was “incorporating into my\nargument the arguments I made throughout the trial.” In response, the trial justice informed\ndefense counsel that “the [c]ourt incorporates the rulings I made throughout the trial on those\nissues.” The trial justice then sentenced Peltier to one year of probation and required him to\nparticipate in the batterer’s intervention program and substance-abuse counseling and complete\nforty hours of community service. 3 The defendant timely appealed.', 'Standard of Review', '“In reviewing the admission or exclusion of evidence, it is well settled that ‘[t]he\nadmissibility of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial justice, and this Court will not\ninterfere with the trial justice’s decision unless a clear abuse of discretion is apparent.’” State v.\nClay, 79 A.3d 832, 838 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v.

However, “we have treated the list\ncontained within the second sentence of Rule 404(b) as examples, rather than a complete\nenumeration, of permitted purposes.” Rodriguez, 996 A.2d at 150.', 'Evidence of prior acts is admissible when the “prior acts are interwoven or in instances\nwhen introduction is necessary for a trier of fact to hear a complete and, it is to be hoped,\ncoherent story so as to make an accurate determination of guilt or innocence.” Clay, 79 A.3d at\n838 (quoting Rodriguez, 996 A.2d at 150-51); see also State v.

In this case, the\nrecord discloses that from the time Thurber arrived at defendant’s apartment until the time of his\narrest, less than thirty minutes had elapsed. In State v. St. Jean, 554 A.2d 206, 209 (R.I. 1989),\nthis Court held that evidence of acts which occurred twenty-three minutes before an alleged\ncrime was admissible because it “demonstrate[d] that [the defendant] was in a particular frame of\nmind.” See also State v. Morey, 722 A.2d 1185, 1189 (R.I. 1999) (“Because the uncharged acts\nwere related so closely in both time and place to the charged acts * * * committed by the\ndefendant and were so intricately interwoven with the charged acts, their admission was proper.”', '-7-\nciting State v.

The defendant argued that any\npost-shooting conduct would be irrelevant to the subsequent retrial on the singular charge of\nreckless manslaughter. Id. at 92. The New Jersey Supreme Court disagreed and concluded that\nconduct that occurs after the charged offense can circumstantially support inferences about the\ndefendant’s consciousness of guilt.

When they attempted to effectuate an arrest, defendant\nactively and continuously struggled to thwart their attempts and resist arrest. The defendant\ncontinued his behavior even as the officers were escorting him down the stairs of his apartment\nbuilding. This behavior is indicative of defendant’s consciousness of guilt. See Palmer, 962', '-9-\nA.2d at 769. The fact that resisting arrest is an independent criminal act does not negate the\nrelevance of defendant’s action with respect to his state of mind at the time of the assault.', 'As we said in Acquisto, “a defendant has no right to be insulated from relevant truths\n‘even if such truths might lead the jury to draw less favorable inferences concerning [the]\ndefendant than if they were not exposed.’” Acquisto, 463 A.2d at 129 (quoting State v.

Pona, 66 A.3d 454,\n468 (R.I. 2013). The defendant’s plea of nolo contendere to the charge of resisting arrest does\nnot insulate him from conduct that is inextricably linked to the crime on trial. Criminal conduct\nneed not be compartmentalized into separate categories; nor can a defendant choose which\ncategory can be excluded from trial by strategically entering a plea before trial. See State v.\nClark, 974 A.2d 558, 579 (R.I. 2009) (“A criminal trial is a search for the truth; it is not a game\nof chess.” quoting State v. Oster, 922 A.2d 151, 163 (R.I. 2007)). The defendant’s conduct in\nresisting arrest was relevant both because it was interwoven with the charged offense and\nbecause it was probative of defendant’s earlier state of mind. The jury could logically infer from\nsuch evidence that defendant’s conduct in resisting arrest was indicative of his consciousness of\nguilt. Allowing a defendant to preclude this relevant evidence by entering a plea of nolo\ncontendere would be tantamount to allowing a defendant to sanitize the evidence that the state\nmay present to a jury. See State v. Marmolejos, 990 A.2d 848, 852 (R.I. 2010) (declaring that the\nstate has the right to present evidence establishing its case in chief).', 'The trial justice concluded that the evidence was admissible because it was interwoven\nwith the charged offense, offered the complete story, and was indicative of the defendant’s state\nof mind the morning of the offense. Additionally, the trial justice in this instance offered a', '- 10 -\ncautionary instruction to the jury on the use of the testimony regarding the resisting arrest. “The\nCourt presumes that members of the jury follow the trial justice’s instructions.” State v.\nWhitfield, 93 A.3d 1011, 1022 (R.I. 2014) (citing State v.

It is our opinion that any prejudice to the defendant was cured by the comprehensive\ncautionary instruction issued by the trial justice, which was timely, appropriate, and a model of\nclarity. 4 For these reasons, we see no abuse of discretion in the trial justice’s decision to admit\nevidence of the facts regarding the charge of resisting arrest.', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of conviction of the Superior Court\nand return the papers thereto.\n4', 'In a passing reference, defendant contended that the evidence was admitted in violation of Rule\n403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence.

Accordingly, defendant’s contention that the trial justice admitted the evidence\nin violation of Rule 403 has not been sufficiently developed for review by this Court. See id.', '- 11 -', 'Justice Robinson, concurring in part and dissenting in part. I am pleased to concur\nin the opinion of the majority to the extent that it holds that the trial justice did not abuse his\ndiscretion in admitting evidence of the defendant’s resisting arrest as constituting evidence of the\ndefendant’s agitated state of mind at the time of the alleged assault. In view of the very close\ntemporal connection between the alleged simple domestic assault and the act of resisting arrest,\nthe trial justice did not abuse his discretion in admitting the evidence for this limited purpose.\nHowever, I respectfully disassociate myself entirely from the majority’s statement that the\ndefendant’s act of resisting arrest is “indicative of his consciousness of guilt” and its suggestion\nthat consciousness of guilt and state of mind are largely indistinguishable concepts.', 'In the first place, I am both mystified and troubled by the choice of the majority to\naddress an issue that is entirely unnecessary to reach—viz., the issue of consciousness of guilt.\nSignificantly, there was no discussion provided by the parties to support any contention that\ndefendant’s act of resisting arrest should have been admitted as evidence of his consciousness of\nguilt. Moreover, although the trial justice admitted evidence of defendant’s resisting arrest, he\ndid so with an appropriately focused instruction, which simply directed the jury to consider the\nresistance as revealing defendant’s state of mind at the time of the alleged offense; the trial\njustice made no mention of consciousness of guilt. The trial justice’s instruction deftly and\ncorrectly straddled the competing interests at hand—allowing the prosecution to present its case\nin an understandable way, while simultaneously cautioning the jury not to draw improper and\nunjust inferences. As a result of that instruction, the jury had ample information upon which to\nreach a verdict without the necessity of considering whether the act of resisting arrest was\nsomehow indicative of defendant’s consciousness of guilt. By unnecessarily addressing the issue\nof consciousness of guilt, the majority has disregarded our strong and oft articulated policy', '- 12 -\nfavoring judicial restraint. See, e.g., Grady v. Narragansett Electric Co., 962 A.2d 34, 42 n. 4\n(R.I. 2009) (explicitly adhering to “our usual policy of not opining with respect to issues about\nwhich we need not opine”); 1 Barone v. State, 93 A.3d 938, 939 n. 1 (R.I. 2014); State v. Keenan,\n68 A.3d 588, 594 (R.I. 2013). It is especially disconcerting to me that the majority chooses to\naddress this issue—which was not the basis of admission of the evidence in Superior Court\naccording to the trial justice’s instruction—after expressly stating in its opinion that “this Court\nhas not had the occasion to address whether evidence of resisting arrest is indicative of\nconsciousness of guilt * * *.”', 'It is even more distressing that, in its entirely unnecessary discussion of consciousness of\nguilt, the majority seems to suggest that state of mind and consciousness of guilt are close to\nbeing synonymous. Unquestionably, when a person takes an action prompted by his or her\nconsciousness of guilt, that consciousness of guilt can rightly be said to be part of that person’s\nstate of mind. See State v. Santos, 122 R.I. 799, 821, 413 A.2d 58, 70 (1980). But state of mind\nis a broad and generic umbrella covering many different mental stances in addition to\nconsciousness of guilt—including, simply by way of brief example, fear, jealousy, malice, or\nagitation. Moreover, a person resisting arrest could be in one of many different states of mind at\nthe moment when he or she resists arrest. It is self-evident to me that, as a precondition to\nadmissibility, there must be evidence from which a jury could infer that the state of mind of the\nperson resisting arrest was consciousness of guilt and not one of the other myriad possible states\nof mind.\n1', 'That “usual policy” of ours is consistent with the following jurisprudentially sage\nobservation of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit: “Discretion is often the\nbetter part of valor, and courts should not rush to decide unsettled legal issues that can easily be\navoided.” United States v. Gonzalez, 736 F.3d 40, 40 (1st Cir. 2013).', '- 13 -', 'Although I feel strongly that the majority has rushed in unnecessarily and imprudently in\nreaching the issue, in view of the fact that the majority has now opined that the act of resisting\narrest is indicative of a consciousness of guilt in the instant case and not simply of an agitated\nstate of mind, I feel compelled to forcefully state that the facts of this case do not lead me to\ndraw the same conclusion. I am not even remotely persuaded by the majority’s argument, which\nin a conclusory manner treats the act of resisting arrest as the equivalent of fleeing from a crime\nscene. In reaching its conclusion, the majority cites two cases from jurisdictions that have\naddressed the issue, neither of which do I find convincing—viz., State v. Williams, 919 A.2d 90\n(N.J. 2007), and People v. Sustak, 153 N.E.2d 849 (Ill. 1958). After thoroughly reviewing these\ncases, I am not at all persuaded that the act of resisting arrest as occurred in the instant case is\nindicative of consciousness of guilt. First, the defendant in Williams, 919 A.2d at 99, engaged in\na cover-up after a shooting in which he was involved; the Supreme Court of New Jersey held that\nevidence of that cover-up was admissible to show a consciousness of guilt. In the instant case,\nhowever, without meaningful analysis, the majority treats defendant’s act of resisting arrest as\nsomehow being factually similar to the cover-up in Williams and thereby deserving of the same\nevidentiary treatment. In Sustak, 153 N.E.2d at 854, the Supreme Court of Illinois admitted\nevidence of resisting arrest as being indicative of consciousness of guilt, but it failed to provide a\nmeaningful explanation as to why the act of resisting arrest was actually demonstrative of that\nmental state.', 'There are myriad reasons, which the majority in the instant case does not\nacknowledge, and which Sustak, 153 N.E.2d at 854, does not discuss, that could inform a\nparticular defendant’s resisting arrest, including that a defendant simply felt he was being\nunjustly arrested or because he harbored a deep and long-standing dislike for police officers in\ngeneral. Therefore, in my view, Williams and Sustak are not instructive in the instant case.', '- 14 -', 'After long and careful perusal of the record, I can find no basis therein for the majority’s\ninference that defendant resisted arrest because he was conscious of his own guilt. Nor have we\never opined that resistance to arrest alone is sufficient to be indicative of consciousness of guilt.\nIt is clear to me that a person may resist arrest for a variety of reasons unrelated to consciousness\nof guilt.', 'The majority cites to this Court’s opinion in State v. Palmer, 962 A.2d 758 (R.I. 2009), to\nsupport its contention that resistance to arrest is admissible as evidence of consciousness of guilt\nin the instant case. 2 Specifically, it points to the following language in Palmer, which is actually\na quotation from a treatise on the law of evidence:', '“It is universally conceded today that the fact of an accused’s flight', '* * *, resistance to arrest, concealment, assumption of a false', 'name, and related conduct, are admissible as evidence of', 'consciousness of guilt, and thus of guilt itself.” Id. at 769 (quoting', '2 John H. Wigmore, Evidence in Trials at Common Law, § 276 at', '122 (Chadbourn rev. 1979)).\nI do not believe that my position is inconsistent with what this Court said in Palmer. The quoted\nlanguage does not state that resistance to arrest, by itself, is evidence of consciousness of guilt. I\nreadily acknowledge that resistance to arrest coupled with flight or concealment or such related\nconduct might, in a different case, be sufficient to be admitted to show that a defendant was\nconscious of his or her guilt. However, such facts are strikingly absent from the case at bar.', 'What the evidence in the record in this case does disclose is that defendant was in an\nagitated state of mind 3 while he was engaged in very actively resisting arrest just a very few\n2', 'It should be borne in mind that the behavior of the defendant that was at issue in this\nCourt’s evidentiary discussion in State v.

Indeed, it is clear to me that the only logical and proper inference the jury could have\nreached from defendant’s actions was that he was in an agitated state of mind, not that he was\nconscious of his guilt.', 'For the foregoing reasons, I concur in the judgment of the majority with respect to the\ndefendant’s resisting arrest being admissible to show his agitated state of mind, but I\nrespectfully, yet very vigorously, dissent from every jot and tittle of the majority’s discussion of\nconsciousness of guilt.\nfind in the record any evidentiary basis for a conclusion that defendant’s agitated state of mind\nand resistance to arrest are, as the majority states, “indicative of his consciousness of guilt.”', '- 16 -', 'Justice Flaherty, dissenting.

For the reasons that follow, I would vacate the judgment of conviction and remand\nthis case for a new trial.', 'Rule 404(b) Should Have Barred Admission', 'In my opinion, this case stretches, beyond its limits, the admittedly elastic characteristics\nof Rule 404(b). At trial, evidence of defendant’s resistance to arrest, which took place both after\nthe alleged assault had occurred and after the complaining witness had left the scene, was\nadmitted over defendant’s objection. The mere fact that defendant may have resisted the police’s\nefforts to arrest him fits neither into the illustrated examples that are delineated in Rule 404(b)\nnor the spirit of other permitted purposes.

Compare State v. Garcia, 743 A.2d 1038, 1050\n(R.I. 2000) (noting the “general exclusionary rule of Rule 404(b)”), with State v.

However,\nthere is no question that this Court has invariably allowed evidence of other crimes or bad acts\nwhen those acts are “interwoven with the charged offense,” and when it would “allow a trier of\nfact to hear a complete and, it is to be hoped, coherent story so as to make an accurate\ndetermination of guilt or innocence.” State v.

Sustak, 153 N.E.2d 849, 854 (Ill.\n1958) (the defendant fled police and entered a tavern where he drew a weapon and wounded a\nresponding officer). Both of these cases involved intricate post-crime conduct that was deemed\nadmissible under the guise of “consciousness of guilt.” While I need not agree or disagree with\nthose holdings, it is my opinion their applicability to this case is marginal. Further, I agree with\nJustice Robinson’s separate opinion that this issue was not part of the trial record.', '- 18 -', 'In its opinion, the majority relies on St. Jean, 554 A.2d at 208. In that case, the trial\njustice approved the admission of evidence that, twenty-three minutes before an accident giving\nrise to a charge of reckless driving, an offense that has an element of mens rea, the defendant had\nbeen involved in a ‘“tire squealing’ episode,” and had come within inches of striking another\nvehicle. 4 Id. The Court reasoned that the temporally proximate prior incident was relevant to\nthe defendant’s state of mind with respect to the charge of reckless driving. Id. at 209. Although\nthis Court has never said that it is only prior bad acts that are contemplated by Rule 404, the\ntiming should be a consideration in the analysis of whether evidence is relevant. In the matter\nbefore us, the fact that defendant may have resisted arrest after the alleged assault is, in my\nopinion, less probative of whether he was similarly agitated at the time of the alleged assault. As\ndefense counsel argued to the trial justice, “[a]n innocent person who is falsely accused of a\ncrime * * * sometimes resists arrest.” 5', 'Further, I am not persuaded that the state needed the evidence of resisting arrest to tell a\n“complete and, it is to be hoped, coherent story” of the simple domestic assault.

In closing argument defense counsel said, “[a]n innocent person may very well resist arrest\nwhen they are falsely accused of a crime.”', '- 19 -\nwitness testified, as did the responding officer who testified as to the “red marks” he saw on the\ncomplaining witness’s “arms and her face.” There was sufficient evidence before the jury and,\neven if Rule 404(b) is best described as an inclusive rule, “it is not all-inclusive.” United States\nv. Briley, 770 F.3d 267, 276 (4th Cir. 2014) (holding that admission of evidence was error\nbecause “in this instance [the contested evidence] came too close to pure propensity evidence”). 6', 'Indeed, it is instructive to see how the state made use of the contested evidence once it\nwas determined to be admissible; in my opinion, it was argued that this evidence reflected on\ndefendant’s character. In the prosecutor’s opening remarks he referred to the resistance to arrest\nand said that it would show that on the day of the incident “[the police] met with a combative\nperson,” and, in his closing argument, the prosecutor reiterated that this conduct showed\ndefendant lacked the “demeanor of an innocent man.” It is my opinion that these remarks were\nintended to cast light on defendant’s character. Because this is prohibited by Rule 404, the\nevidence should not have been admitted.', 'Alternatively, Rule 403 Should Have Barred the Evidence', ""In a case where there was only one witness to the alleged assault, the complaining\nwitness, it is my opinion that this evidence was enormously prejudicial and should not have been\nadmitted under Rule 403. It is axiomatic that “Rule 403 cuts across the rules of evidence and is\nalways a consideration in a trial justice's ruling on the admissibility of Rule 404(b) evidence.”\nState v.

The defendant’s resistance to arrest is not a key piece of\nevidence that “gives the jury the body of the story,” it is instead the opposite; as Wright advises,\nit is “just the ending.” Id. (holding admission of contested evidence appropriate because it was\nnot simply the end of the story but “inextricably intertwined”).', '- 20 -\nevidence of resisting arrest, there is nothing on the record that would support any conclusion that\nthe trial justice performed a Rule 403 balancing test. Because we have consistently maintained\nthat Rule 403 is implicated in a Rule 404(b) determination, it is my opinion that the failure to\nperform that analysis, in and of itself, is fatal. 7 See Mlyniec, 15 A.3d at 997.', 'It is my further opinion that, had the analysis been completed, Rule 403 nonetheless\nshould have barred the admission of the contested evidence. Clearly, this is not an easy burden\nto meet. We have said that it is only “when evidence is marginally relevant and enormously\nprejudicial that a trial justice must exclude it.” State v. Pona, 948 A.2d 941, 950 (R.I. 2008)\n(citing State v. Silvia, 898 A.2d 707, 717 (R.I. 2006)). However, we have held such evidence to\nbe inadmissible when “its utility was clearly outweighed by the danger that it would confuse,\nmislead, and unfairly prejudice the jury.” Gaspar, 982 A.2d at 149. In Gaspar, we found that\nevidence of prior consensual sexual encounters had little bearing on an alleged sexual assault and\nit “was very likely to confuse the jury and invite an emotional response.” Id. Here, the\ndefendant’s resistance to arrest cast very little light on whether he had earlier assaulted the\ncomplaining witness.', 'Instead, in my view, it encouraged the jury to make an emotional\nresponse, to associate the defendant with violent behaviors, and to agree with the state’s\ncharacterization of the defendant as a “combative person” who lacked the “demeanor of an\ninnocent man.” In a case that featured limited testimony and very little physical evidence, the\nfact that the defendant may have been violent during the process of his arrest was, in my opinion,\nenormously prejudicial.\n7', 'I disagree with the majority’s characterization that defendant did not properly develop his Rule\n403 argument. From the record, it is clear that Rule 403 was raised and argued before the trial\njustice. Even though defendant’s written argument on Rule 403 before this Court was sparse, it\nwas raised in his Rule 12A statement. See Article I, Rule 12A of the Supreme Court Rules of\nAppellate Procedure. Because the analysis of Rule 404(b) evidence is always bifurcated with\nRule 403 considerations, I believe that it was sufficiently raised to this Court.', '- 21 -', 'For the reasons set forth above, I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion of this\nCourt.', '- 22 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet\nTITLE OF CASE:', 'State v.

We summarize\nbelow the salient aspects of what transpired at trial.', 'C. The Testimony at Trial', '1. The Testimony of Terrell Judd', 'The first witness for the state was Terrell Judd, who had pled guilty to several felony\ncharges in connection with the robbery at issue. Mr. Judd pled guilty to one count of first-degree\nrobbery, one count of assault with intent to rob, and one count of conspiracy to commit robbery.\nHe testified pursuant to a “MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT,” according to which the\nstate, in consideration of his testimony, agreed to recommend that concurrent sentences of twelve\nyears imprisonment be imposed, with between three and five years to serve.', 'According to Mr. Judd’s testimony, on January 12, 2009 (the day before the robbery), he,\nalong with defendant and codefendant Stokes, drove to the home of defendant’s girlfriend, one\nLiz Guzman.', 'Mr. Judd testified that Mr. Stokes and defendant went into Ms. Guzman’s\nresidence and then returned to the car; he added that later, while the trio was driving around, he\nobserved a chrome revolver with a black handle in the possession of Mr. Stokes. Mr. Judd\ntestified that he thereafter went his separate way; he added that later the same day he saw his two\ncompanions in the parking lot at Ms. Guzman’s residence, where they were sitting in a gray\nNissan Altima that he had never seen before.', '-3-', 'Mr. Judd further testified that the next day (January 13) defendant and codefendant\nStokes picked him up at his home at approximately 10 a.m. in the same gray Nissan Altima that\nhe had observed on the previous day. Mr. Judd stated that the three men proceeded to drive to\ndefendant’s house and that, at defendant’s direction, he retrieved from inside the house the gun\nthat he had seen in codefendant Stokes’s possession the day before. Mr. Judd identified the gun\nshown to him at trial as being the one that he used in the robbery.', 'Mr. Judd further testified that defendant later drove away on his own, after first leaving\nthe gun with him; he added that defendant had said that he thought he recognized someone in\nanother car as being a particular person with whom the three men did not get along. It was Mr.\nJudd’s further testimony that defendant thereafter returned, stating that he had been mistaken\nabout the identity of the person in the other car, but also stating that he had spotted a man and\nwoman who “looked * * * drunk;” Mr. Judd stated that defendant suggested that the three men\nshould “go lick them,” and Mr. Judd acknowledged that he understood that expression to mean\ngo “rob” them. Mr. Judd testified that he wanted to carry out the robbery and that defendant\n“wanted to go” as well, whereas Mr. Stokes was “hesitant,” “didn’t want to do [the robbery],”\nand “seemed confused.” Mr. Judd stated that he, along with defendant and Mr. Stokes, drove to\nthe next block and parked the Nissan Altima in a driveway. He added that Mr. Stokes remained\nin the car talking on the phone as Mr. Judd and defendant exited the vehicle.', 'It was the further testimony of Mr. Judd that, after he and defendant had raised the hoods\nof their sweatshirts, he went to the side door of the vehicle on the driver’s side where Mr. Moran\nwas seated, while defendant went to the side door on the passenger side where Ms. Kovacs was\nseated. Mr. Judd added that, at that point, defendant engaged in a “tug-o-war[sic]” with Ms.\nKovacs in an effort to take a purse. Mr. Judd further testified that, once defendant had the purse', '-4-\nin his possession, he began to run away. At about the same time, according to the testimony of\nMr. Judd, he approached Mr. Moran, pointed the gun at his chest, and ordered him out of the car.\nIt was the further testimony of Mr. Judd, however, that Mr. Moran then released a large dog from\nthe car that began to chase him. Mr. Judd stated that he ran back to the Nissan Altima, where he\nfound defendant as well as codefendant Stokes. He added that, after defendant drove the trio in\nthe Nissan Altima to a Shell gas station, defendant handed Ms. Kovacs’s purse to codefendant\nStokes, who proceeded to remove money from it and then throw it out of the window of the\nvehicle. The money was then divided among the three occupants of the Nissan Altima.', 'Mr. Judd further stated that, after the three men left the Shell station and began driving\nalong Interstate 95, they were pursued by the police. He testified that, as a result, the fleeing\nmen drove off the interstate highway while he looked for a good place where he might throw the\ngun—which he said that he did. Mr. Judd stated that, upon reaching Gordon Avenue, the trio\nabandoned the vehicle and fled. It was Mr. Judd’s further testimony that a police officer\nthereafter spotted him hiding under another vehicle and proceeded to place him in handcuffs.\nMr. Judd explained that he was taken to a nearby “housing unit,” where he was identified by the\nvictims. Mr. Judd also showed the police where he had thrown the gun, and he was then brought\nto the police station; there, he spoke to the police about the robbery and identified defendant and\nMr. Stokes as the other men involved in the criminal activity.', '2. The Testimony of Joan Kovacs2', 'Ms. Kovacs testified that she had been consuming alcoholic beverages at Paul Moran’s\nhouse on Georgia Avenue for “a couple of hours” on the morning of the robbery.

According to Ms. Kovacs, one of those individuals went to the\ndriver’s side (where Mr. Moran was seated), while the other came to her side of the vehicle and\nshowed her the gun. Ms. Kovacs testified that she was in fear and that, “[b]ecause of the gun,”\nshe turned over her purse, which contained between $1,000 and $2,000 in cash; upon being\nfurther questioned, she denied that there was a “tug-of-war” over the purse.', '3. The Testimony of Kevin Perkins', 'Kevin Perkins, a neighbor of Paul Moran, testified that, on the morning of January 13,\n2009, he had spoken with Mr. Moran and Ms. Kovacs while they were sitting in a car in front of\nMr. Moran’s home. It was Mr. Perkins’ testimony that, as he was walking away, he observed\n“two kids” near a gray car parked in a neighbor’s “yard.” Mr. Perkins recalled that the hood of\nat least one of the “kids” was raised. Mr. Perkins further testified that he continued walking\naway and that he then observed Mr. Moran’s dog chasing a young man who jumped into the\nback seat of the gray car as it was driving away. Mr. Perkins acknowledged that, later that day,\nhe had been taken by the police to observe the vehicle abandoned by the suspects on Gordon\nAvenue, which he identified as the same gray car that he had seen the morning of the robbery.', '4. The Testimony of Detective Stephen Gencarella', 'Detective Stephen Gencarella of the Providence Police Department’s robbery squad\ntestified that, on January 13, 2009, upon hearing a police broadcast that an armed robbery had\noccurred and that the suspects had abandoned their vehicle near the corner of Gallop Street and\nGordon Avenue, he went to that area. He stated that, while canvassing the surrounding area for\nsuspects, he observed a black male jump over a fence and begin running; he added that he', '-6-\npursued and apprehended that person. At trial, Detective Gencarella identified defendant as\nbeing the person whom he had pursued and apprehended on the day of the robbery.', '5. The Testimony of Officer David DePina', 'Officer David DePina of the Providence Police Department testified that, on February 2,\n2009, having been dispatched to Narragansett Avenue, he met with a person (not previously\nknown to him) who had come across a gun; he said that that person pointed out the gun on the\nsidewalk in front of 116 Narragansett Avenue. A loaded .32 caliber revolver, silver in color and\nwith a black handle was recovered from the sidewalk. At trial, he identified the gun in\nphotographs shown to him as the gun that had been pointed out to him at 116 Narragansett\nAvenue.', 'D. The Motions for Judgment of Acquittal', 'After the prosecution rested on November 8, 2010, defendant moved, pursuant to Rule 29\nof the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, for a judgment of acquittal with respect to\nCounts One through Five of the indictment; he based that motion on what he contended was the\ninsufficiency of the evidence presented by the prosecution. The trial justice denied defendant’s\nRule 29 motion in its entirety.', 'Codefendant Stokes also moved pursuant to Rule 29 for a judgment of acquittal with\nrespect to Counts One through Six of the indictment. The trial justice granted Mr. Stokes’s\nmotion in part, finding that there was insufficient evidence from which a jury could find\ncodefendant Stokes guilty of the conspiracy charge (Count Four) beyond a reasonable doubt.\nThe trial justice found that codefendant Stokes did not participate in any way in the robbery from\nMs. Kovacs or in the assault with intent to rob of Mr. Moran. The trial justice said that, for that\nreason, codefendant Stokes could not be found vicariously liable for the alleged criminal conduct', '-7-\nof defendant or Mr. Judd as a coconspirator; and the trial justice expressly cited the leading case\nof Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640 (1946). Accordingly, the trial justice granted Mr.\nStokes’s Rule 29 motion only with respect to Counts Two through Five, and he reduced the\ncharge of first-degree robbery (Count One) to the lesser included charge of receiving stolen\nproperty. The trial justice denied Mr. Stokes’s motion for acquittal as to Count Six, the charge of\ncarrying a handgun without a license.', 'At the close of all the evidence, defendant, having opted not to present any evidence,\nrenewed his Rule 29 motion for a judgment of acquittal. In reference to the conspiracy charge\n(Count Four), defendant stated that the state must prove the involvement of at least two people in\na conspiracy; and defendant then argued that, in view of that principle and the fact that\ncodefendant Stokes had been acquitted on the conspiracy count and that Mr. Judd was not\ncharged as a coconspirator, defendant must be acquitted of the conspiracy charge. Ruling in a\nmanner that was consistent with defendant’s reasoning and citing State v. DeSanto, 603 A.2d\n744 (R.I. 1992), the trial justice granted defendant’s Rule 29 motion as to the conspiracy charge.', 'The trial justice also noted that Mr. Judd’s use of a gun in the attempted robbery of Mr.\nMoran could not be imputed to defendant under the theory of coconspirator liability in view of\nthe fact that Mr. Judd had not been indicted in the instant case. Accordingly, the trial justice\nreduced the first-degree robbery charge against defendant to that of second-degree robbery. The\ntrial justice stated: “The case will go to the jury with regard to Mr. Gadson only as to Joan\nKovacs, either as second-degree robbery or as larceny from the person.”', 'E. The Jury Instructions and the Ensuing Verdict', 'After both the prosecution and the defense had made their closing arguments, the trial\njustice instructed the jury as to the “Verdict Form;” he stated in pertinent part:', '-8-', '“[W]ith respect to Nayquan Gadson, it asks whether or not you', 'find him guilty * * * of second-degree robbery [from] Joan', 'Kovacs. * * * [T]hen you should ask yourselves whether or not he', 'committed the lesser offense, as I’ve explained to you, of larceny', 'from the person.

At\nthat point, the trial justice, looking at the verdict form, stated that he had “misheard [the verdict]\nentirely.” The jury was escorted back into the courtroom, at which time the trial justice made the\nfollowing statement:', '“Ladies and gentlemen, I’m sorry to trouble you, but some of the', 'lawyers and, indeed, the Court misheard the foreman’s', 'announcement as to the nature of the verdict.

The defendant seeks to\nraise that issue for the first time on appeal.', 'It is true that, after the jury had been polled individually with respect to the finding of\nguilt on the charge of second-degree robbery, defense counsel drew the trial justice’s attention to\nthe fact that the jury foreman had initially announced a verdict of not guilty with respect to the\nlarceny charge whereas no such verdict was indicated on the verdict form. However, the fatal\nflaw in defendant’s argument before this Court is that he explicitly told the trial justice that he\ndid not believe that it was necessary that there be an indication on the verdict form of the jury’s\nverdict concerning the charge of larceny from the person. Defense counsel went as far as to\nexpressly agree with the trial justice that the charge of larceny from the person was “of no\nmoment” in view of the fact that defendant had been found guilty of second-degree robbery.\nAccordingly, it is our view that defendant did not properly preserve this issue for appeal;\ntherefore, we shall proceed to consider the next issue on appeal.', 'B. Joinder and the Motion to Sever', 'The defendant contends that he was unduly prejudiced by the joinder of Count Six, which\nrelated only to codefendant Stokes, in the same indictment with Counts One through Five, which\nrelated to both defendants.

Whether viewed through the prism of Rule 8(a) or Rule 8(b),\nthere is more than sufficient relationship between the factual basis of Count Six and the factual\nbases of Counts One through Five to justify their joinder as a matter of law. Accordingly, we\nnext turn to defendant’s contention that the trial justice erred in denying his motion to sever\nunder Rule 14.6', 'Even when (as in this case) joinder under Rule 8 is proper, a defendant may nonetheless\nseek to show that he or she faces the possibility of being prejudiced to such an extent that relief\nfrom joinder is appropriate under Rule 14.

This Court has\nrepeatedly stated that severance under Rule 14 is “not a matter of right but rather is an issue\n5', 'Rule 8(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure is entitled “Joinder of\nOffenses,” while Rule 8(b) is entitled “Joinder of Defendants.”\n6', 'The pertinent portion of Rule 14 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure reads\nas follows:', '“If it appears that a defendant or the State is prejudiced by a', 'joinder of offenses or of defendants in an indictment, information,', 'or complaint or by such joinder for trial together, the court may', 'order an election or separate trials of counts, grant a severance of', 'defendants or provide whatever other relief justice requires.”', ""- 13 -\ndirected to the sound discretion of the trial justice.” State v. Ashness, 461 A.2d 659, 668 (R.I.\n1983); see State v. Botas, 71 A.3d 430, 433 (R.I. 2013); State v. Vanasse, 593 A.2d 58, 66 (R.I.\n1991); Cassey, 543 A.2d at 673. In considering whether there is sufficient prejudice to warrant\nseverance, the trial justice must balance “efficiency and convenience in judicial administration\non the one hand and the defendant's right to a fair trial without prejudice on the other.” State v.\nViveiros, 45 A.3d 1232, 1241 (R.I. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Pereira,\n973 A.2d at 28; State v. Day, 898 A.2d 698, 705 (R.I. 2006). Accordingly, “denial of a motion\nto sever will not be reversed on [appellate] review unless there has been a clear abuse of\ndiscretion.” Cassey, 543 A.2d at 673; see Vanasse, 593 A.2d at 66; see also State v. Goulet, 21\nA.3d 302, 309 (R.I. 2011). To prevail in an effort to show that a trial justice has abused his or\nher discretion in this regard, “[t]he defendant must affirmatively show that in fact he has suffered\nprejudice as a result of the joint trial to the extent that it has impinged upon his right to a fair\ntrial.” Cassey, 543 A.2d at 673; see Ashness, 461 A.2d at 669; State v. Gibbons, 418 A.2d 830,\n835 (R.I. 1980)."", 'In our judgment, the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in denying defendant’s\nmotion to sever. The evidence which the state needed to introduce in order to meet its burden of\nproof with respect to Count Six (which related to Mr. Stokes’s possession of a handgun on\nJanuary 12, 2009) would be easily distinguishable by a reasonable jury as being applicable only\nto Mr. Stokes and not to defendant. See Cassey, 543 A.2d at 674 (holding that denial of the\nmotion to sever was not an abuse of discretion where the evidence was relatively simple and\nstraightforward and the jury would have no significant difficulty in separating out the evidence\nagainst each defendant); see also Day, 898 A.2d at 705. Moreover, in our opinion, a charge of\npossession of a handgun without a license is not the type of charge that would tend to confuse', '- 14 -\nand mislead the jury, nor is it a charge that would cause the jurors to become more easily\nconvinced of defendant’s guilt with respect to the robbery than would be the case in the absence\nof such evidence. See Zafiro v. United States, 506 U.S. 534, 539 (1993) (stating that severance\nshould be granted “only if there is a serious risk that a joint trial would * * * prevent the jury\nfrom making a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence”). In addition, and significantly,\namong the instructions given to the jury before it began deliberations was one that specifically\ninstructed the jury not to let the guilt or innocence of one defendant influence its verdict with\nrespect to the other defendant.', 'In addition, we are not persuaded that defendant has shown that he in fact suffered real\nand substantial prejudice from the joinder of Count Six to such a degree that he was denied a fair\ntrial. See Day, 898 A.2d at 705 (“It is not sufficient for the defendant to cite the potential for and\nthe likelihood of prejudice. His burden is to demonstrate substantial prejudice resulting from the\njoinder.”) (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted); Ashness, 461 A.2d at 669\n(“Mere allegations of potential prejudice are not sufficient. The defendant must support his\nmotion with more than a showing of disadvantage.”). We note that Mr. Stokes was ultimately\nacquitted of unlawfully carrying a handgun without a license. Moreover, defendant was not\nconvicted of any crime involving a firearm since the trial justice reduced the first-degree robbery\ncharge against him to that of the lesser included offense of second-degree robbery, which offense\nis statutorily defined as “robbery or other larceny from the person by force or threat, where there\nis no weapon and no injury * * * .” Section 11-39-1(b). In the absence of a showing of\nsubstantial prejudice or unfairness that would outweigh this Court’s consideration of the trial\njustice’s legitimate concerns for judicial economy, we perceive no basis for holding that the trial\njustice abused his discretion in denying defendant’s motion to sever Count Six.', '- 15 -', 'C. The Motion in Limine', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion in limine seeking\nto “preclude the State from submitting or referring to: * * * any alleged connection between\nGadson and the firearm used by Judd to commit the robbery.” “The preliminary grant or denial\nof an in limine motion need not be taken as a final determination of the admissibility of the\nevidence referred to in the motion.” State v. Torres, 787 A.2d 1214, 1220 (R.I. 2002) (internal\nquotation marks omitted); see also State v. Merida, 960 A.2d 228, 238 (R.I. 2008). This Court\nhas consistently held that a failure to object “in the vital context of the trial itself (except where\nthe in limine ruling was unequivocally definitive) [constitutes] a waiver of the evidentiary\nobjection and [is] therefore an issue that may not be raised on appeal.” State v. Andujar, 899\nA.2d 1209, 1222 (R.I. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Gomes, 881\nA.2d 97, 108 (R.I. 2005) (“[E]xcept when the in limine ruling is clearly definitive, it would at the\nvery least be prudent for counsel to articulate the objection once again in the vital context of the\ntrial itself.”) (emphasis in original). In the present case, the record does not reflect that the trial\njustice’s ruling on the defendant’s motion at issue was “unequivocally definitive.” Andujar, 899\nA.2d at 1222. Therefore, we conclude that the defendant did not preserve this evidentiary\nchallenge for appellate review because defense counsel did not renew his objection to the\nadmission of the contested evidence at the trial itself.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the Superior Court’s judgment of\nconviction.

The complainant suffered a head\nwound that required eight stitches, a severe concussion, a broken nose, and multiple lacerations\nand contusions over his entire body. After a four-day jury trial, the defendant, Antonio O.\nWhitfield (Whitfield or defendant), was convicted of two counts of assault with a dangerous\nweapon and one count of simple assault for his role in the fracas. On appeal, the defendant\nargues that (1) the trial justice abused his discretion by allowing the state to impeach his\ncredibility with fourteen prior criminal convictions and (2) the trial justice erred by denying\ndefense counsel’s motion to pass the case after the prosecutor allegedly vouched for the\ncredibility of two witnesses during her closing argument. The parties appeared before this Court\non February 25, 2014, pursuant to an order directing them to show cause why the issues raised in\nthis appeal should not summarily be decided.

For the reasons that follow, we affirm the\nconvictions.', '-1-', 'Facts and Travel', 'Michael Newell (Newell or complainant) lived in a third-floor apartment on Angell Street\nin Providence.', 'The basement of the building housed a club: the Liquid Lounge.', 'At\napproximately 3:30 a.m. on November 27, 2008, a friend of Newell’s—a bouncer at the Liquid\nLounge—knocked on his door and asked whether Newell had a wire coat hanger because another\nLiquid Lounge employee, named Kelsey, was locked out of her car. Although he could not find\na wire hanger, Newell went outside to assist Kelsey with her attempts to access her vehicle,\nwhich was parked in the driveway adjacent to the building.', 'Within minutes, Newell watched as another female employee left work and began\nwalking down Angell Street toward her car. She did not walk far. A black Dodge Charger\nstopped on Angell Street and the occupants began shouting catcalls at the woman, who\nimmediately turned around and began walking back toward the group gathered in the vicinity of\nKelsey’s car, which included the complainant, Kelsey, three Liquid Lounge bouncers, and two\npatrons. Undeterred, the Charger reversed direction and pulled into the driveway where the\ngroup was standing. At that point, Newell and the bouncers told those in the Charger to leave.\nAccording to Newell, rather than depart, the occupants of the Charger responded by hurling\nunopened beer bottles at them from the rear driver’s side window.', 'Newell testified that as he approached the rear driver’s side door of the Charger, he was\npulled through the window of the vehicle, and the Charger backed out of the driveway and sped\nforward about 150 feet. When the vehicle came to a stop, the door opened, and Newell fell to the\nground. As he attempted to stand, he was struck in the temple with an unopened beer bottle and\nagain fell to the ground. Newell was repeatedly kicked and stomped on his head and upper body\nby three individuals for an extended period of time. Newell testified that he knew that there were', '-2-\nthree assailants during the attack because there were distinct sets of legs and feet simultaneously\nassaulting him; however, he could not see the faces of his attackers.1 According to Newell, the\nbouncers finally reached the Charger and attempted to intervene. Eventually, the police arrived\non the scene; Newell was transported to Rhode Island Hospital, where he received eight stitches\naround his temple. Newell also suffered “a severe concussion, a broken nose, and multiple\nlacerations and contusions from head to toe.”', 'A Providence police officer and a Brown University security officer responded to the\nmelee: Providence police officer Joshua Greeno (Officer Greeno) and Brown University security\nofficer Nicholas Gonsalves (Gonsalves).', 'Gonsalves was on foot patrol—checking the\nUniversity’s Environmental Lab—when he heard a loud commotion coming from Angell Street.\nGonsalves testified that as he walked toward the noise, he saw a Dodge Charger stopped in the\nmiddle of the road and that individuals in the car and on the sidewalk were shouting at each\nother. Gonsalves testified that a beer bottle was thrown from the rear of the vehicle towards\nNewell, who was standing on the sidewalk.', 'Gonsalves then saw Newell approach the vehicle “towards the rear window” and\n“actually go into the vehicle,” at which time the car started to move and then abruptly stopped.2\nGonsalves testified that three men exited the vehicle: “[t]he driver, * * * a lighter-skinned male;\na rear passenger, * * * also a lighter-skinned male; and a darker-skinned male, [from] the front\npassenger side, who later identified himself to police as Keeron Hardmon.” “Keeron Hardmon”\nwas later identified as defendant, Antonio Whitfield. Gonsalves made an in-court identification\n1', 'Newell also admitted that he had consumed about eight beers that night.\n2', 'It is not clear from the direct examination of Gonsalves whether he was referring to the driver’s\nor passenger’s side rear window. Furthermore, in contrast to Newell’s testimony, during his\ncross-examination, Gonsalves testified that the car moved only one to two feet forward.', '-3-\nof defendant.3 Gonsalves testified that defendant threw a beer bottle at Newell, striking him in\nthe face. He next saw a white male approach the vehicle from the sidewalk, and a fight ensued\nbetween Newell, defendant, “the other darker-skinned male,” and the white male who had just\napproached.4 Gonsalves testified that defendant and “the other male” got Newell and the other\nman onto the ground and began kicking them; the kicks were so forceful that Gonsalves could\nhear “knocking sounds” from his vantage point fifty feet away.', 'According to Gonsalves, he did not approach the fracas because his job was limited to\nthat of a security officer with no arrest power; however, he broadcast a call to Brown University\npolice.', 'Within minutes, a police cruiser approached with audible sirens.', 'At that point,\nGonsalves saw two assailants return to the vehicle, while defendant fled on foot. The vehicle\nwas stopped by police, and a Brown University police unit located defendant and brought him\nback to the scene for a show-up. Gonsalves identified him as one of the assailants.', 'While these events were unfolding, Officer Greeno arrived on the scene to find Newell\non the ground. He then learned that the black Dodge Charger had been stopped by the police a\nshort distance away, with two suspects in the vehicle and that the third suspect also had been\napprehended.', 'After the close of the state’s case, defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal was\ndenied by the trial justice.

The state sought to admit fourteen prior convictions, and defendant argued that\nthe convictions were inadmissible under Rule 609 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. The\ntrial justice, however, overruled defendant’s motion and allowed the prior convictions in\naccordance with Rule 609.', 'The defendant testified in his own defense and gave an account of the events that\nmarkedly differed from the state’s case. According to defendant, in the early morning hours of\nNovember 27, 2008, he had just left a club in Providence with two friends: Mario and Kenny.\nAs Kenny proceeded down Angell Street, Mario was trying to talk to a girl, but she “was running\naway from something.” According to defendant, Kenny then reversed direction and pulled into a\nparking lot where there was a group of men. The defendant testified that the group of men\nstarted hitting the car and yelling obscenities. The defendant contends that, while he sat in the\nrear driver’s side seat, someone hit him in the face and then tried to pull him through the\nwindow. He did not, however, identify that man as Newell. At the same time, a similar\naltercation began through the front passenger window, but that passenger—presumably Mario—\ngot out of the car. The defendant testified that he was unable to exit the vehicle because of the\nchild locks, but that the door was opened from the outside. At that point, according to defendant,\na fight erupted with him and Mario against four or five other people. The defendant admitted\nthat he had a beer bottle in the car, but testified that it fell to the ground when he was pulled\npartially through the window. He denied throwing a beer bottle or striking anyone with it. The\ndefendant testified that, during the altercation, he turned around “like when everybody went to\ngo run back to the car, because there [were] so many other people, [and] the car was gone,\nKenny had left.” Knowing that the police were coming, defendant testified that he ran away\nbecause he knew he had an outstanding warrant for failure to pay court fines.', '-5-', 'On cross-examination, defendant’s credibility was impeached through the introduction of\nhis fourteen prior criminal convictions. The trial justice immediately gave a limiting instruction,\ninforming the jury that evidence of defendant’s prior convictions could only be considered in\nrelation to his credibility and not for propensity purposes. Additionally, on cross-examination,\ndefendant stated that he did not give the police the name “Keeron Hardmon,” but that he had his\ncousin’s ID in his pocket, and the police took that ID as his. The defendant admitted that he did\nnot correct the police officers’ misimpression regarding his identity because he was aware of the\noutstanding warrant for his arrest.', 'On two occasions during the prosecutor’s closing arguments, defense counsel objected\nand moved to pass the case. The defendant argued that the prosecutor’s remarks amounted to a\ncomment on his right to remain silent and also alleged that the prosecutor had vouched for the\ncredibility of Officer Greeno.5 The trial justice refused to pass the case, but stated that he would\ngive a limiting instruction on both points.', 'Although defense counsel wanted a limiting\ninstruction in the event the trial justice refused to pass the case, he argued nonetheless that he did\nnot think that “there’s any instruction that can cure the prejudice that’s inured to Mr. Whitfield.”\nIn addition to an instruction regarding defendant’s right to remain silent, the trial justice\ninstructed the jury that the drawing of inferences and the assessment of credibility is a function\nexclusively reserved for the jury.', 'The defendant was found guilty on all counts: assault with a dangerous weapon (beer\nbottle), assault with a dangerous weapon (shod foot), and simple assault. After trial, defendant\nmoved for a new trial, and the trial justice denied the motion.

(quoting State v.\nSilvia, 898 A.2d 707, 718 (R.I. 2006)). “‘This Court will not disturb a trial justice’s finding\nregarding the admissibility of prior conviction evidence for impeachment purposes unless our\nreview of the record reveals an abuse of discretion on the part of the trial justice’ that prejudices\nthe complaining party.” Id. (quoting State v. Rodriquez, 731 A.2d 726, 731 (R.I. 1999)).', 'Similarly, “a decision to pass a case and declare a mistrial are matters left to the sound\ndiscretion of the trial justice.” State v. McRae, 31 A.3d 785, 789 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v.\nSuero, 721 A.2d 426, 429 (R.I. 1998)). This Court defers to the trial justice on such a motion\nbecause he or she “has a ‘front row seat,’ allowing him or her to ‘best determine the effect of the\nimprovident remarks upon the jury.’” Id. (quoting State v. Tempest, 651 A.2d 1198, 1207 (R.I.\n1995)). “As such, the trial justice’s determination concerning the prejudicial effect of evidence\nand the jury’s ability to render a fair and impartial verdict are reviewed by this Court under an\nabuse of discretion standard.” Id.', '-7-', 'Analysis', 'Prior Criminal Convictions', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice abused his discretion by allowing the state to\nimpeach his credibility with fourteen prior criminal convictions. The defendant accumulated\nthose fourteen convictions in less than five years after his eighteenth birthday. The convictions\ninclude possession of marijuana, operating under the influence of alcohol, resisting arrest, and\nnumerous assaults and batteries, among other offenses. In his ruling, the trial justice considered\ndefendant’s “series of crimes”—detailing the different types of offenses involved—and, although\nhe was concerned about the jury’s potential consideration of the convictions as propensity\nevidence, he concluded that the potential danger to defendant could be cured by a limiting\ninstruction at the appropriate time.', '“Rule 609 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence permits the admission of a witness’s\nprior conviction to attack that witness’s credibility unless the court determines that the\nprejudicial effect of the conviction substantially outweighs its probative value.” McRae, 31 A.3d\nat 791. “In making a determination under Rule 609, a trial justice must consider the remoteness\nof the conviction, the nature of the crime, and the defendant’s disdain for the law as reflected by\nhis or her criminal record.” Tetreault, 31 A.3d at 784. Rhode Island’s Rules of Evidence do not\nlimit the types of prior criminal convictions that may be admitted to impeach a witness, as\nopposed to the more limited set of convictions set forth in Rule 609 of the Federal Rules of\nEvidence, because this Court has declared that “the jury should be able to consider whether or\nnot a person who has previously broken the law may have such disrespect for the law as to\nrender him or her unwilling to abide by the oath requiring truthfulness while testifying.” State v.\nRemy, 910 A.2d 793, 798 (R.I. 2006).', '-8-', 'In 2011, this Court decided two cases on nearly the same issue as presented in this case.\nIn Tetreault, 31 A.3d at 781-82, 783, the trial justice allowed the state to impeach the defendant\nwith fifteen prior convictions which spanned sixteen years. On appeal, the defendant argued that\neleven of the fifteen convictions were too remote and unduly prejudicial. Id. at 783. We agreed\nwith the trial justice that “given defendant’s long and continuous record of criminal behavior\nthroughout most of his adult life, the jury was entitled to consider the proffered convictions.” Id.\nat 784. Accordingly, we upheld the admission of the convictions “[i]n light of the defendant’s\nvoluminous criminal record and the probative value of prior convictions as bearing on his\ncredibility as a witness * * *.” Id.', 'In McRae, 31 A.3d at 791, the trial justice allowed the state to impeach the defendant\nwith seven prior convictions. On appeal, the defendant argued that three different categories of\nprior convictions were inadmissible: convictions involving “assaultive behavior,” misdemeanor\nconvictions, and a conviction for obtaining food or accommodations with the intent to defraud.\nId. at 792-93. We held that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion as to any of the groups of\ncrimes for impeachment purposes. Id. Specifically, although the defendant was charged with\ndomestic assault, we held that the defendant’s prior “assaultive” convictions were no more\nprejudicial than those admitted in other cases decided by this Court. Id. at 792.', 'Here, because at the time of trial all of defendant’s prior convictions were less than five\nyears old, none of the convictions were remote. While some of defendant’s prior convictions\nwere for assault and battery—the same type of offense with which defendant was charged—we\nrepeatedly have declared, most recently in McRae, 31 A.3d at 792, that the similarity of the prior\noffenses does not render them per se inadmissible for the purpose of impeaching a testifying\ndefendant’s character for truthfulness. Finally, although his record was not as lengthy as the', '-9-\ndefendant’s record in Tetreault, defendant nonetheless displayed his disdain for the law by\naccumulating fourteen adult criminal convictions before his twenty-third birthday. A crime\nspree spanning fewer than five years that resulted in fourteen criminal convictions is relevant on\nthe issue of whether a testifying defendant will honor his oath to testify truthfully, given his\ndemonstrated disrespect for the law. Thus, considering the factors set out in Tetreault, the\nprejudicial effect of evidence of defendant’s prior convictions did not substantially outweigh\ntheir probative value. In addition, we note that the trial justice gave a limiting instruction to the\njury before the prosecutor asked a series of questions about his prior convictions. Accordingly,\nin these circumstances, the trial justice did not abuse his discretion by allowing the state to\nimpeach defendant’s credibility with his prior criminal convictions.', 'Motion to Pass', 'The defendant also argues that the trial justice erred by denying defense counsel’s motion\nto pass the case after the prosecutor allegedly vouched for the credibility of two witnesses during\nher closing argument.', 'First, we must address whether and to what extent this issue was\npreserved. To preserve an objection to a prosecutor’s closing argument, defense counsel “must\nnot only make an objection at the time, but must make a request for cautionary instructions * * *\nor move for a mistrial.” State v. Horton, 871 A.2d 959, 964 (R.I. 2005) (quoting State v. Portes,\n840 A.2d 1131, 1141 (R.I. 2004)).', 'Although defendant contends that the prosecutor vouched for the credibility of\nGonsalves, it is clear that defense counsel made no objection during the prosecutor’s remarks\nconcerning Gonsalves. Defense counsel’s two objections, posited during closing argument,\nsolely related to the prosecutor’s comments about defendant’s flight from the scene (which\ndefendant does not contest on appeal) and the prosecutor’s comments about Officer Greeno', '- 10 -\n(which are discussed below). Therefore, the issue of the prosecutor vouching for Gonsalves is\nwaived. See Horton, 871 A.2d at 964 (noting that the defendant must object at the time of the\ncomment and either request a cautionary instruction or move for a mistrial to preserve a claim of\nprejudicial error in a closing argument).', 'Regarding the prosecutor’s remark about Officer Greeno, it is the state’s position that the\nissue was not preserved because defense counsel failed to move for a mistrial or object to the\ntrial justice’s cautionary instruction. Although the state contends that the transcript of the\nhearing at sidebar is clear on this point, we are not convinced. The defendant raised two\nobjections in a single, mid-argument sidebar, and each objection separately was argued by\ncounsel.', 'The trial justice declared that he would give a cautionary instruction as to each\nobjection. Defense counsel immediately responded, “Just note, Judge, my exception. I don’t\nthink there’s any instruction that can cure the prejudice that’s inured to Mr. Whitfield.” Because\nthe trial justice’s ruling encompassed both of defendant’s objections, it is unclear whether\ndefendant’s exception related to one objection or to both. We are cognizant of the setting: the\nparties and the trial justice were at sidebar, in the midst of a closing argument, during a criminal\ntrial that spanned several days. A fair reading of defense counsel’s remark is that he was\nobjecting to the trial justice’s refusal to pass the case and to give a cautionary instruction as to\nboth of his objections. Therefore, we conclude that the issue was preserved for our review.', 'Satisfied that the issue properly is before us, we next address whether the prosecutor’s\ncomments about Officer Greeno actually constitute vouching for the credibility of a witness.\nDuring closing argument, the prosecutor stated, “Do you think Officer Greeno, who appears, I\nwould suggest to you, to be a very by-the-book officer, he stood there at military attention the\nwhole time that he testified to you, do you think he’s going to risk his career?” This sentence', '- 11 -\ncontains two remarks of questionable appropriateness: the reference to Officer Greeno being a\n“by-the-book officer” and the reference to the risk to the officer’s career, presumably in the event\nthat he gave false testimony. We address the latter instance first.', 'The proper divide between appropriate remarks about an officer’s credibility and\nimproper comments regarding the impact of perjured testimony on an officer’s career can be\ndifficult to discern. This tension was highlighted in a decision by the Court of Appeals of\nMaryland when confronted with the following closing argument by a state’s attorney:', '“You have to weigh the credibility of each individual. Who has a', 'motive to tell you the truth. The Officer in this case would have to', 'engage in a lot of lying, in a lot of deception and a conspiracy of', 'his own to come in here and tell you that what happened was not', 'true. He would have to risk everything he has worked for. He', 'would have to perjure himself on the stand.', '“* * *', '“[Y]ou have to understand that Officer Williams has no motive to', 'lie, because he has everything to risk in this case.

There’s absolutely no incentive', 'for him to come in here and tell a story about Mr. Spain.” Spain v.', 'State, 872 A.2d 25, 28, 29 (Md. 2005).\nThe court’s reaction to this argument was twofold. The court first declared that the prosecutor’s\nremarks regarding the officer’s motivation to lie did not constitute improper vouching because\nthere was no expression of the prosecutor’s personal belief about the credibility of the officer and\nthe comment did not “explicitly invoke the prestige or office of the State or the particular police\ndepartment or unit involved.” Id. at 31. Nevertheless, the court also held that the prosecutor’s\ncomments about the adverse consequences to the police officer’s career were improper:', '“Although the State is free to highlight the incentive, or lack of', 'incentive, of a witness to testify truthfully, courts consistently have', 'held that it is improper to argue that a police officer may be', 'deemed more credible simply because he or she is a police officer.', '* * * By invoking unspecified, but assumed, punitive', 'consequences or sanctions that might result if a police officer', 'testifies falsely, a prosecutor’s arguments imply that a police', '- 12 -', 'officer has a greater reason to testify truthfully than any other', 'witness with a different type of job. Although the factfinder', 'generally is made aware that a witness who is a police officer is', 'testifying as to events witnessed while on duty as a police officer, a', 'prosecutor must be careful not to insinuate that the credibility of', 'statements made in this capacity may be assessed at a level of', 'scrutiny other than that given to all witnesses.” Id. at 32.', 'We also find the First Circuit’s decision in United States v. Torres-Galindo, 206 F.3d 136\n(1st Cir. 2000) persuasive and evincive of the sensitivity regarding comments about a\ngovernment agent’s career. In Torres-Galindo, 206 F.3d at 142, the court addressed a comment\nduring closing argument of an Assistant United States Attorney that, if the jury believed a\nstatement by a codefendant, the jury “would also have to believe that [a FBI agent who testified]\nwould actually jeopardize [his] ten years [as an FBI agent].” The First Circuit began its analysis\nby analyzing whether this remark actually constituted vouching—it contained no statement of\npersonal belief and the FBI agent’s service time was in evidence, yet the use of the term\n“jeopardize” in relation to the agent’s career, while falling short of vouching, did suggest “some\nknowledge outside the record of punishment that [the FBI agent] could receive for lying in\ncourt.” Id. The court declared:', '“[W]e hold that this kind of general appeal to believe the police or', 'FBI because of their history, integrity, or public service is', 'inappropriate, although not the worst offense that a prosecutor can', 'commit. While not vouching in the most familiar sense, it does', 'invite the jury to rely on the prestige of the government and its', 'agents rather than the jury’s own evaluation of the evidence; to this', 'extent, the argument presents the same danger as outright', 'vouching.” Id. (citing United States v. Young, 470 U.S. 1, 18-19', '(1985)).', 'Thus, although courts tend to allow a general reference to a specific officer’s credibility\nor lack of motive to lie, a prosecutor’s reference to the “risk” to an officer’s career should he or\nshe commit perjury is not appropriate. See Torres-Galindo, 206 F.3d at 142; Spain, 872 A.2d at\n32; see also United States v. McMath, 559 F.3d 657, 667 (7th Cir. 2009) (holding that', '- 13 -\nprosecutor’s comment that police witnesses would lose their jobs if they lied was improper);\nPeople v. Adams, 962 N.E.2d 410, 414 (Ill. 2012) (holding that prosecutor’s comment that\nofficer was “risking his credibility, his job, and his freedom” was improper).6 While a witness’s\nstatus as a police officer certainly mandates that he or she testify truthfully, we are mindful that,\nin the context of the criminal justice system, all witnesses are expected to give truthful\ntestimony. We agree with the First Circuit’s evaluation that a comment during closing argument\nabout the risk to an officer’s career may invite the jury “to rely on the prestige of the government\nand its agents rather than the jury’s own evaluation of the evidence.” Torres-Galindo, 206 F.3d\nat 142. Therefore, in the circumstances of this case, the prosecutor’s rhetorical question about\nwhether Officer Greeno would risk his career, while not vouching in the true sense, nonetheless\nwas inappropriate.', 'Regarding the remaining portion of the challenged remark—“Officer Greeno, who\nappears, I would suggest to you, to be a very by-the-book officer, he stood there at military\nattention the whole time that he testified to you”—we perceive no impropriety given the full\ncontext of the prosecutor’s comment. It is important to note that the prosecutor preceded her\ncomment with “I would suggest,” and followed it with a reference to his demeanor on the\nwitness stand: “he stood there at military attention the whole time that he testified to you.” It is\ncommon to instruct the jury, as occurred here, that they may consider the appearance and\n6', 'Notably, despite holding that the comments were improper, in none of these cases did the\nappellate court vacate the jury’s verdict for this reason. See United States v. McMath, 559 F.3d\n657, 668 (7th Cir. 2009) (holding that remark did not jeopardize the fairness or integrity of the\ntrial); United States v. Torres-Galindo, 206 F.3d 136, 142-43 (1st Cir. 2000) (holding that\nprosecutor’s comment was harmless); People v. Adams, 962 N.E.2d 410, 416 (Ill. 2012) (holding\nthat comments did not amount to plain error); Spain v. State, 872 A.2d 25, 34 (Md. 2005) (court\nwas “convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the error in no way influenced the verdict”).', '- 14 -\ndemeanor of a witness when assessing the witness’s credibility.7 Therefore, considering the\nwhole of the prosecutor’s remark and the jury instructions, the argument that Officer Greeno\nappeared to be a “by-the-book officer” was merely a comment meant to draw the jury’s attention\nto his demeanor while testifying. Accordingly, that comment was not improper vouching.', 'Although we conclude that a portion of the prosecutor’s closing argument was akin to\nvouching, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not err by refusing to pass the case. A trial\njustice is vested with considerable discretion when ruling on a motion to pass a case. See\nMcRae, 31 A.3d at 789; State v. Nelson, 982 A.2d 602, 607 (R.I. 2009). The trial justice’s front-\nrow seat at the trial places him or her in the best position to determine the effect of the remarks\non the jury and the proper remedy for any prejudice. See McRae, 31 A.3d at 789. “As such, the\ntrial justice’s determination concerning the prejudicial effect of evidence and the jury’s ability to\nrender a fair and impartial verdict are reviewed by this Court under an abuse of discretion\nstandard.” Id.', 'Here, the trial justice was faced with an objection to a comment that was on the\nborderline of improper vouching. In his cautionary instruction, the trial justice told the jury that\nfindings of fact and assessment of credibility were exclusively within their province.\nSpecifically, he stated,', '“I can assure you that no one, from the State to the defense', 'counsel, to the witnesses, have any inside information. There is no', 'magical formula with regard to credibility. The witnesses were', 'sworn to tell the truth; and the assessment of their credibility is', 'exclusively within your prerogative once the final 12 are chosen to', 'deliberate.”\n7', 'In this case, the trial justice instructed the jury that they “may be guided by the\n* * * appearance of a witness, as well as the conduct and demeanor of that witness while\ntestifying * * *.”', '- 15 -\nThe Court presumes that members of the jury follow the trial justice’s instructions. State v.\nLaRoche, 683 A.2d 989, 1000 (R.I. 1996). We are satisfied that this cautionary instruction was\nsufficient to quell the effect of any prejudice caused by the prosecutor’s remark about Officer\nGreeno’s career. See Torres-Galindo, 206 F.3d at 142-43 (holding prosecutor’s remark harmless\nbecause “(1) * * * it was not a severe infraction, (2) * * * the court properly instructed the jury\nthat the statements and arguments of counsel are not evidence, and (3) the substantial weight of\nthe evidence against appellants”); LaRoche, 683 A.2d at 1000 (concluding that instructions\n“were more than adequate to cure any possible prejudice that may have resulted from the\nprosecutor’s arguably overzealous remarks”); see also supra, note 6 (noting several appellate\ncourt decisions refusing to overturn jury verdicts for similar vouching remarks during closing\nargument). Accordingly, the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in declining to pass the\ncase.', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the defendant’s convictions.

In this case, we are confronted with a ten-hour police\nstandoff in Hopkinton, Rhode Island, precipitated by a 911 call by the longtime girlfriend of the\ndefendant, Michael Neugent, arising from a domestic dispute. The defendant’s mother—who\nwas also his landlord—provided the responding officer with keys to the defendant’s apartment.\nThe defendant was barricaded inside the dwelling and threatened to shoot the officer if he\nentered. Within minutes, officers from multiple police departments, including the Rhode Island\nState Police SWAT team and approximately twenty police vehicles, surrounded the apartment\nbuilding. After hours of fruitless negotiations, the SWAT team, garbed in full tactical gear and\narmed with assault weapons and explosives, executed a forced entry into the defendant’s\napartment.', 'The defendant struck the first officer who came through the door with an\napproximately three-foot-long construction level. A brief struggle ensued; and, despite strenuous\nresistance, the defendant was apprehended. He was later charged with several counts, ultimately\nbeing convicted of assault with a dangerous weapon and resisting arrest.', '-1-', 'This case came before the Supreme Court on October 2, 2019, on a writ of certiorari from\na judgment of conviction following a jury trial.1 Before this Court, defendant argues that the trial\njustice erred by denying his motion for a new trial because, he alleges, the trial justice\noverlooked and misconceived material evidence. The parties were directed to appear and show\ncause why the issues raised in the case should not be summarily decided. After hearing the\narguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion\nthat cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the case at this time. For the reasons\nset forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On February 11, 2015, defendant was charged by criminal information, in W2/15-54A,\nwith one count of assault with a dangerous weapon, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2 (count\none), and one count of resisting arrest, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 12-7-10 (count two).2 A jury\ntrial commenced on October 25, 2016, and the jury heard from several witnesses, including\ndefendant and his girlfriend. We summarize the testimony presented at trial.', 'Detective John Forbes (Det. Forbes) of the Hopkinton Police Department testified that,\non October 11, 2014, he responded to a 911 call from defendant’s longtime girlfriend, Joyce\n1', 'Because defendant’s trial counsel failed to file a timely notice of appeal from the judgment of\nconviction, the public defender’s office filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on defendant’s\nbehalf, to which the state had no objection.\n2', 'The defendant was also charged by a separate criminal information, in W2/15-70A, with one\ncount of threatening a public official, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-42-4, one count of domestic\nassault, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-3, and one count of disorderly conduct, in violation of\nG.L. 1956 § 11-45-1. The charges of domestic assault and disorderly conduct were dismissed in\naccordance with Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure after defendant’s\nlongtime girlfriend refused subpoena service, thereby depriving the state of the direct evidence\nnecessary to proceed to trial. The charge of threatening a public official was tried along with the\ncounts of assault with a dangerous weapon and resisting arrest, and the jury found defendant not\nguilty on that count. Therefore, W2/15-70A is not before us in this case.', '-2-\nKreyssig (Kreyssig), about a domestic dispute at a duplex apartment building located at 5 Side\nHill Street in the town. Kreyssig told Det. Forbes that she lived with defendant in apartment 5A\nand that he was the only person in the apartment at that time. She also informed Det. Forbes that\nthere was a .22–caliber rifle in the bedroom.', 'Detective Forbes testified that he proceeded to the common doorway of the building,\nknocked on the separate inside door for apartment 5A, announced himself as a Hopkinton police\nofficer, and requested that defendant open the door. After receiving no response, Det. Forbes\nobtained keys to the apartment from defendant’s mother and landlord, Sandra Neugent. When\nDet. Forbes returned to defendant’s apartment, he unlocked the doorknob; but before he could\nunlock the deadbolt, he heard someone lock the door from the inside. Detective Forbes again\nannounced himself as a police officer and instructed defendant to open the door. The defendant\nrefused, stating, among other things: “I have a weapon pointed at you through this door. If you\ncome through this door, I’m going to use it on you.” Detective Forbes immediately evacuated\nthe remaining residents in the building, took cover, and called for backup. A phalanx of police\nofficers from the state police and the Hopkinton and Richmond police departments responded to\nthe scene and surrounded the apartment building.', 'Sergeant David Bassignani (Sgt. Bassignani), the commander of the state police SWAT\nteam, testified that, when he arrived, state troopers from the Crisis Negotiation team were\ncommunicating with defendant by cell phone. However, at some point, defendant ended all\ncommunication. Because the police believed that defendant’s phone was no longer working, the\nSWAT team approached the house, broke the front window, and tossed a phone in a box—aptly\ndescribed as a “throw phone”—into the residence. The defendant threw the box back out\nthrough the window.

The entry team swarmed defendant,\nwho, Sgt. Bassignani testified, “was in full resist mode.” He was ordered to stop resisting and\nget on the ground.', 'Corporal Thomas Chabot (Cpl.

We deem defendant’s arguments to be\nwithout merit and therefore reject them.', 'Under Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, “the court may grant a\nnew trial to the defendant if required in the interest of justice.” When ruling on a motion for a\nnew trial, the trial justice, acting as the thirteenth juror, “must (1) consider the evidence in light\nof the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the\nevidence, and (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that\nreached by the jury.” State v. Lopez, 149 A.3d 459, 462 (R.I. 2016) (quoting State v. Staffier, 21\nA.3d 287, 290 (R.I. 2011)).

Perkins, 966 A.2d 1257, 1260 (R.I. 2009)). Conversely, if the trial\njustice finds that the state did not meet its burden on the weight of the evidence and the\ncredibility of the witnesses, a new trial must be ordered. E.g., id.; State v. Peoples, 996 A.2d 660,\n666 (R.I. 2010).', 'In this case, the trial justice, in his bench decision denying defendant’s motion for a new\ntrial, summarized the trial testimony, exercised his independent judgment as to the credibility of\n5', 'The defendant asserted the defense of self-defense at trial, and the trial justice properly\ninstructed the jury on self-defense and the state’s burden of proof.', '-7-\neach witness and the weight of the evidence, and declared that he agreed with the jury’s verdict.\nThe trial justice found Sgt. Bassignani to be “very professional” and a “credible witness.” The\ntrial justice also noted that the testimony of Cpl. Chabot was consistent with that of Sgt.\nBassignani. By contrast, regarding Kreyssig’s testimony that defendant did not know where the\ngun was located in the apartment, the trial justice stated: “I don’t believe what she said for a\nminute. All I believe is that she told * * * [Det.] Forbes that he was in there and he had access to\na gun. Anything else was an afterthought after she saw the predicament that her boyfriend got\nhimself into.” Further, he stated that Kreyssig’s testimony in support of defendant’s “ludicrous”\ndefense at trial was, according to the trial justice, nothing but “an effort to defend the\nindefensible[.]” What is more, the trial justice found that defendant’s “suggestion that [he]\ndidn’t know that there were police outside [who] wanted to arrest him” was “absolutely\nincredible.” The trial justice further acknowledged defendant’s position at trial that he did not\nknow who was on the other side of his door and did not even look outside, declaring, “I don’t\nbelieve it for a second.”', 'Finally, the trial justice concluded that he would have reached the same result as the jury:', '“In the final analysis I find absolutely no fault whatsoever with the', 'jury’s verdict in this case.

E.g., Rogers, 207 A.3d at 462; State v.\nBaptista, 79 A.3d 24, 29-30 (R.I. 2013). The trial justice weighed the evidence establishing that\nthe defendant was aware of the police presence outside his apartment. He found the state’s\nwitnesses to be credible and both the defendant’s and Kreyssig’s testimony to be completely\nunbelievable. After the trial justice declared that he would have reached the same result as the\njury, his analysis was complete.

However, Correa\ntestified that her relationship with defendant soured after Bartlett kicked Correa out of the house\nand engaged in a relationship with defendant.', 'According to Correa, on April 3, 2016, she called Bartlett to get money for diapers and\nwipes for their son, and they agreed to meet. After she determined Bartlett’s location, Correa\nobtained a ride from Corina Walker, who was like a sister to Correa, to meet him. Correa\ntestified that, when she and Walker arrived at the location, Bartlett pulled up behind them,\ndriving defendant’s vehicle. Correa testified that she got out of Walker’s car, approached the\ndriver’s side of defendant’s vehicle, and opened the door to ask Bartlett for the money. When\nshe approached defendant’s vehicle, she noticed defendant sitting in the front passenger’s seat.\nCorrea testified that she saw defendant reach toward the center console and retrieve a black case.\nShe further testified that defendant then pulled the case open and threw it into her vehicle.\nCorrea testified that she reached into the car to see what the object was; and that, by the time she\nturned around, defendant had exited the car, run around the back of it, and was standing\napproximately a foot away from Correa when she stabbed Correa in the chest. Correa testified\nthat she held her chest and tried to run, but that defendant continued to swing the knife, and that\ndefendant cut Correa’s left wrist as she was rushing at Correa. Correa testified that defendant', '-2-\neventually stopped chasing her with the knife, but only after Walker helped Correa back into\nWalker’s car.', 'Although defendant did not testify at trial, her recorded interview with the police was\nadmitted into evidence as a full exhibit. In her interview, defendant admitted that she stabbed\nCorrea, but claimed that her action was in self-defense because Correa had rushed at her and\nwielded a knife of her own. According to defendant, Correa initially attacked Bartlett while he\nsat in the driver’s seat of her vehicle, then tried to reach over Bartlett to attack defendant. The\ndefendant told police that she then got out of the vehicle, and Correa rushed at her. According to\ndefendant, Correa saw defendant’s knife, but she attempted to stab defendant anyway; however,\naccording to defendant she stabbed Correa first. The defendant further claimed that Correa hated\nher and had reason to attack her because Correa blamed defendant for “snitching on her,” which\nhad led to the previous arrest of Correa and Bartlett for gun and drug charges.', 'Prior to trial, the state filed a motion in limine regarding Correa’s prior contacts with\npolice and her criminal convictions. The state acknowledged that Correa had a conviction for\npossession of a controlled substance and conspiracy to violate the Controlled Substances Act, but\nit sought to prevent the portion of defendant’s statement wherein she indicated to police that the\ndrug for which Correa was convicted of possessing was heroin. The state also sought to preclude\nthe jurors from learning that Correa had been arrested on gun-related charges. The state argued\nthat any mention of guns was irrelevant because Correa did not plead to any gun charges, nor had\nshe been convicted of any—only Bartlett had pled to those charges. The state further noted that\nCorrea did not use a gun in this incident.', 'In opposition to the motion in limine, defendant argued that the gun charges against\nCorrea were relevant to defendant’s claim of self-defense; specifically, regarding Correa’s', '-3-\nalleged bias toward defendant and defendant’s state of mind and motive for stabbing Correa.\nAccording to defendant, Correa believed that defendant had “snitched” and caused Correa and\nBartlett to be charged with the gun crimes. However, the trial justice granted the state’s motion,\nfinding significance in the fact that Bartlett “pled to the specific gun charges and [Correa] didn’t”\nand that “this [wa]s not a gun case[.]” The trial justice further found that the record of the drug\nconviction itself was admissible, but she noted that the defense could not “use the word heroin or\nthe term heroin.”1 The trial justice also found that defendant would be permitted to question\nCorrea at trial regarding “the issue of snitching[,]” motive, and bias toward defendant through\nher conviction for drug charges alone.', 'The state also filed a motion in limine to preclude defendant from introducing into\nevidence three videos that had been posted to Facebook that showed Correa engaged in prior acts\nof aggression. The state contended that the videos were inadmissible under Rule 403 of the\nRhode Island Rules of Evidence because they were needless, cumulative, and inflammatory, and\nthat any probative value to defendant was outweighed by unfair prejudice. The state claimed that\nCorrea was expected to testify that she had carried a knife on prior occasions, that she had been\narrested in December 2015 with a knife in her possession, had stabbed someone before, and that\nshe had fought with others. Moreover, the state argued that, in accordance with this Court’s\nholding in State v. Tribble, 428 A.2d 1079 (R.I. 1981), defendant had to prove she was aware of\neach of these acts of aggression prior to the incident in question and that that would “turn into a\nminitrial within a trial, just to prove when each video was taken, [and] when the defendant\nlearned of the acts depicted in each video[.]” Therefore, the state argued, the videos were not\nnecessary to prove that Correa had engaged in violent behavior in the past, were cumulative in\n1', 'On appeal, defendant does not take issue with this part of the trial justice’s ruling and only\nalleges error based on excluding any reference to Correa’s arrest on gun charges.', '-4-\nthat Correa would testify to those acts, and that the only purpose the videos served was to\ninflame the passions of the jurors.', 'The defendant contended that the three videos were admissible because “[t]he video of\nthese instances is what [defendant] saw. That is what created the fear in her.” The defendant\nfurther argued that the videos actually showed the level of Correa’s aggression and what she was\ncapable of doing.', 'After viewing the three videos in chambers, the trial justice granted the state’s motion in\nlimine because “such evidence would be cumulative” given that Correa would testify to the\ninformation contained in the videos and would not deny that she had stabbed people in the past.\nThe trial justice found that the first video, from 2013, was remote in time from the April 2016\nincident and was therefore not admissible. Additionally, the trial justice noted that the second\nand third videos were cumulative and would be offered solely to inflame the passions of the\njurors. Finally, the trial justice determined that the videos would “cause confusion as to what the\nultimate issue in this case was.” As such, none of the videos were admitted into evidence.', 'Following four days of trial, the jury found defendant guilty of assault with a dangerous\nweapon. Subsequently, defendant filed a motion for a new trial. The trial justice denied the\nmotion and sentenced defendant to five years at the Adult Correctional Institutions, but\nsuspended the sentence and placed her on probation for five years.', 'The defendant timely\nappealed to this Court.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“It is well established that decisions concerning the admissibility of evidence are ‘within\nthe sound discretion of the trial justice, and this Court will not interfere with the trial justice’s', '-5-\ndecision unless a clear abuse of that discretion is apparent.’” State v.

(quoting State v. Evans, 742 A.2d 715, 719 (R.I. 1999)).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'Before this Court, defendant asserts that the trial justice “caused continual constitutional\nproblems throughout [defendant]’s trial” by granting both motions in limine.', 'Specifically,\ndefendant claims that she was prevented from demonstrating Correa’s proclivity to use physical\nviolence when angered, which established, according to defendant, that it was reasonable for her\nto act “quickly, and forcefully” when Correa charged at her with a knife. We address each\nevidentiary argument in turn.', 'A', 'The Gun Charges', 'The defendant contends that the trial justice erred by precluding evidence that Correa had\nbeen arrested on gun charges because, defendant argues, it prevented the jurors from fully\nunderstanding why defendant was afraid on the date in question, and the extent of Correa’s bias\ntoward defendant. The defendant argues that this would have helped the jury to understand why\ndefendant struck the “first physical blow” during the altercation and why that blow was in\nself-defense. In support of her contention, defendant asserts that gun charges are a more violent\noffense than drug charges with longer mandatory sentences and that, because Correa believed\ndefendant had caused her to be arrested for the gun charges, Correa would be even more biased\ntoward defendant.', '-6-', 'After careful review of the record, we are of the opinion that the trial justice did not abuse\nher discretion. The trial justice provided more-than-adequate grounds to support her decision to\ngrant the state’s motion in limine to prevent defendant from mentioning that Correa had been\narrested on gun charges. Specifically, the trial justice noted that such charges were eventually\ndismissed as to Correa and that only Bartlett had pled to them. She further noted, importantly,\nthat use of a gun was not in issue in the present case. Moreover, the trial justice determined that\nthere were “sufficient ways to establish [the snitching] without * * * the gun piece.” Indeed, at\ntrial, defendant established that Correa had been arrested in December 2015 with a knife on her\nperson; Correa believed defendant was engaged in a relationship with Bartlett, the father of her\nchild; and Correa blamed defendant for her arrest with Bartlett on the drug charges.\nAccordingly, we conclude that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion when she prevented\nany mention that Correa had been arrested on the gun charges.', 'B', 'The Facebook Videos', 'Next, defendant maintains that the trial justice “looked at the evidence the wrong way\nround” when she determined that the Facebook videos illustrating Correa’s acts of violence were\ncumulative in light of Correa’s testimony regarding those acts. According to defendant, due to\nCorrea’s “misleading and sanitized recollection of events[,]” the jurors were unable to appreciate\nthe level of fear that defendant had of Correa. The defendant further claims that she could not\nadequately cross-examine and impeach Correa regarding her misleading statements about the\nfights depicted in the videos, which was essential to defendant’s self-defense claim. Again, we\ndisagree.', '-7-', 'With regard to “the admissibility of specific-acts evidence, pursuant to Rule 404(b) [of\nthe Rhode Island Rules of Evidence], our ruling in Tribble is controlling.” State v. Dellay, 687\nA.2d 435, 439 (R.I. 1996). In Tribble, this Court held that a defendant claiming self-defense is\n“entitled to adduce relevant evidence of specific acts of violence perpetrated by the victim\nagainst third parties, provided however, that the defendant was aware of these acts at the time of\nhis [or her] encounter with the victim.” Tribble, 428 A.2d at 1085. However, we noted that this\nrule is “not to be implemented without limitation[,]” as in cases where “such evidence might\nallow the principal issue to become lost in a maze of collateral matters[.]” Id. Accordingly, a\ndefendant must show awareness of the specific “acts of violence and that the act or acts sought to\nbe introduced are not too remote in time and are of such a quality as to be capable of contributing\nto the defendant’s fear of the victim.” Id. It is within the trial justice’s sound discretion “to limit\nthe extent to which the incidents are sought to be proved.” Id. at 1086.', 'Additionally, Rule 403 provides that relevant evidence “may be excluded if its probative\nvalue is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or\nmisleading the jury, or by considerations of * * * needless presentation of cumulative evidence.”', 'Turning to the case at bar, our careful review of the record leads us to conclude that the\ntrial justice did not abuse her discretion. The trial justice viewed all three videos and found that\nthe first video, from 2013, was remote in time. Moreover, she found that the second and third\nvideos would be cumulative because Correa was expected to testify to the specific acts depicted\nin them, and the videos were “highly inflammatory and would be offered solely to inflame the\npassions of the jurors.”', 'The trial justice further determined that the videos would “cause\nconfusion as to what the ultimate issue in this case was[,]” pointing out that the ultimate issue\nwas defendant’s perception of Correa, not the substance of the videos.', '-8-', 'At trial, both the state and defendant questioned Correa regarding the Facebook videos.\nCorrea admitted during her testimony to stabbing twin sisters and telling defendant about it. She\ndescribed that she had been in a fight while defendant was present and testified that defendant\nhad joined in that fight.

This case came before the Supreme Court on March 5,\n2019, on appeal by the defendant, Jamal Rogers (defendant), from a judgment of conviction\nentered in the Superior Court following a jury finding of guilty on five counts of second-degree\nsexual assault, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-37-4. Before this Court, the defendant argues that\nthe trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial and that the verdict failed to serve the\ninterests of justice. The case is before us pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and\nshow cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After hearing\nthe arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the\nopinion that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the appeal at this time. For the\nreasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On May 25, 2012, a grand jury returned an indictment that charged defendant with one\ncount of first-degree sexual assault, in violation of § 11-37-2 (count one); five counts of second-\ndegree sexual assault, in violation of § 11-37-4 (counts two through six); and one count of\nassault with intent to commit first-degree sexual assault, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-1', '-1-\n(count seven). In January 2017, a jury trial was held in Providence County Superior Court; the\nstate presented two witnesses: Molly,1 the complaining witness, and Detective Sergeant Matthew\nRyan (Det. Ryan), the lead investigator. We summarize below the pertinent testimony presented\nat trial.', 'Molly testified that, in February 2012, she was fifteen years old and a sophomore at\nWoonsocket High School; at that time, she was participating in an after-school online English\nmakeup class, which took place Monday through Thursday at the high school, from 2:30 p.m.\nuntil five in the evening. On Mondays, Molly would walk a short distance to her grandparents’\nhome after class, and her father would pick her up there.', 'On Monday, February 6, 2012, Molly testified that, after a “really rough day at school[,]”\nshe decided to skip the online course. Instead, she went to Cass Park, a playground adjacent to\nthe high school, to sit on the swings and “reflect and think about [her] day * * * before [she]\nwent home[.]” Noticing that dusk was fast approaching, Molly approached a passing stranger, a\n“big, chubby’ish” man, and asked if he knew the time. This stranger was defendant.2 The\ndefendant replied in the negative and asked her, “[W]ould you happen to have any weed on\nyou[?]” Molly responded in the negative, and defendant walked away. After waiting on the\nswings for several more minutes for someone else to walk by, Molly reluctantly decided to walk\nback to the high school in order to check the time in the main office.', 'The defendant suddenly approached Molly from behind, grabbed the hood of her jacket,\nand dragged her up a hill in the park, behind the swings. Molly attempted to dig her feet into the\nground to make him stop dragging her, and put her hands behind herself to make him let go of\n1', 'We refer to the complaining witness in this case by a pseudonym.\n2', 'The fact that defendant weighed over 300 pounds on the date of the incident was excluded from\nevidence.', '-2-\nher jacket but, at approximately 104 pounds, she “was not strong enough and after a while [she]\ngave up.” At the top of the hill, hidden in a wooded area near a big rock, defendant continued to\nrestrain Molly and asked her name, her bra size, and whether she was a virgin. “Out of fear,”\nMolly answered each question. She testified that, as defendant asked her the questions, “[h]e\ntouched my breasts over my clothes and * * * he touched in between my legs and my butt.”', 'When defendant began to kiss Molly, she testified, that she submitted because she was\nafraid that “something worse would happen.” The defendant removed Molly’s shirt and bra, and\ntouched her breasts. Molly testified that she “attempt[ed] to stop him and gave up because [she]\nwas too weak.” At trial, she explained that she was crying and had her eyes closed “a lot” of the\ntime, because she was afraid. The defendant next asked Molly to “give him a blow job for\n$20[.]” She refused. The defendant proceeded to unzip his pants and “tried to force [her] to give\nhim a blow job” by pushing her head down towards his penis. Molly struggled to lift her head\nup, and, after a few attempts, defendant released her head. The defendant pushed Molly onto the\nground and pulled her pants and underwear off. She testified: “He undid his pants and boxers\nand pulled them down to his ankles and then got on top of me.” As Molly lay on her back,\ndefendant laid “99 percent” of his body on top of her and “stuck his penis inside of [her] vagina.”\nAfter a few minutes or so, defendant stopped, got up from the ground, and began to put his\nclothes back on. According to Molly, when his back was turned, she jumped up, grabbed her\nclothes and ran, naked, down the hill.', 'At this point it was getting dark outside, and, as she ran to her grandparents’ home,\ncrying and vomiting, she put her clothes back on. Although it was rush hour and she ran past\nhomes and open businesses, Molly testified, she saw no one, nor did anyone ask if she needed\nhelp. When Molly arrived at her grandparents’ home, it was past 5:30—when she was expected', '-3-\nto be home—and her grandparents were irate. She did not tell her grandparents about the\nincident because she was not “comfortable telling them what happened” and she was “ashamed”;\nshe testified: “I felt defiled. * * * I felt dirty. Disgusting.” When Molly’s father arrived to pick\nher up, he was also furious. At trial, Molly testified that she and her father had a contentious\nrelationship and that her late arrival home that night had made matters worse. After he shouted\nat her and used demeaning names, the two went home; and, shortly thereafter, she was grounded.\nMolly did not tell her father about the assault because, she testified, she “was scared and\nashamed and embarrassed and it is definitely something that I was not comfortable talking with\nmy father about, something that he wouldn’t understand.”', 'The next day, Molly went to her guidance counselor, Robin Corrigan (Corrigan), and told\nher that defendant kissed and touched her inappropriately the night before—Molly did not\nmention that defendant allegedly had raped her. Corrigan contacted the school resource officer,\nOfficer David Chattman (Officer Chattman), to report the assault, and Molly told him what she\nhad told Corrigan. Officer Chattman contacted Det. Ryan, who was the officer in charge of the\nJuvenile Division of the Woonsocket Police Department, and informed him that a sexual assault\nhad occurred at Cass Park next to the high school. Later that day, Molly met with Det. Ryan at\nthe police station and positively identified defendant from a photo lineup as the man who\nassaulted her in Cass Park. She placed her initials and the date underneath his photograph; she\nconfirmed her identification of defendant as the man who had sexually assaulted her in court\nduring trial.3', 'Shortly thereafter, Woonsocket police officers were dispatched to locate defendant, who\nwas found in Cass Park. He was taken in for questioning. At the police station, Det. Ryan\n3', 'Eyewitness identification is not an issue before the Court.', '-4-\ninterviewed defendant about Molly’s allegations of sexual assault. The defendant stated that\nwhen he was in Cass Park the day before, he “got to be friends with this girl” named Molly.\nAfter he explained that they spoke for approximately thirty minutes, defendant stated that he\nasked Molly if he could remove her clothes and “kiss her[.]”4 The defendant stated that she\nconsented and explained that “there was no force or nothing.” He then admitted that he asked\nMolly to perform fellatio on him but, given the lateness, she instead asked defendant if they\ncould meet up at another time.', 'The detective made no mention to defendant of Molly’s\nallegation of vaginal penetration because, at that time, he was not aware of such an allegation.\nAt the conclusion of the interview, defendant was charged with second-degree sexual assault.', 'Approximately one week later, Molly went back to Corrigan and told her the “full\nstory”—that defendant also vaginally penetrated her. Molly testified that she had not initially\ntold Corrigan everything that had occurred on the night in question because she felt “very\nashamed[.]” On March 14, 2012, Det. Ryan went to Molly’s home and asked her to write a\nstatement of the events that transpired during the incident, including the touchings as well as the\nalleged penetration.5 The defendant was charged and subsequently indicted.', 'Almost five years later, on January 23, 2017, a jury found defendant guilty of five counts\nof second-degree sexual assault (counts two through six). The defendant was acquitted of both\nfirst-degree sexual assault (count one) and assault with intent to commit first-degree sexual\nassault (count seven). The defendant’s motion for a new trial subsequently was heard and\n4', 'During the interview, Det. Ryan told defendant that Molly’s shirt was ripped, and defendant\ninitially denied that he caused the rip. However, after further questioning, defendant admitted to\naccidentally ripping the shirt. Subsequently, it was later determined that the shirt had never been\nripped and that this was incorrect information given by Officer Chattman.\n5', 'Detective Ryan testified that a written statement was not taken until March 14, 2012, because,\nwithout an allegation of first-degree sexual assault, no statement is required by the police\ndepartment.', '-5-\ndenied.

The defendant, Javier Merida (Merida or defendant),\nappeals pro se from an order of the Superior Court denying his motion to correct sentence, pursuant\nto Rule 35 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. On February 28, 2019, this case\ncame before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause\nwhy the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After hearing the parties’\narguments and reviewing the memoranda submitted by the parties, we are satisfied that cause has\nnot been shown. Accordingly, further briefing or argument is not required to decide this matter.\nFor the reasons explained herein, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'This Court thoroughly recounted the underlying facts of this matter in our consideration of\ndefendant’s direct appeal and postconviction-relief appeal.1 Therefore, we only recount facts\nrelevant to this appeal and other facts necessary for context.\n1', 'See Merida v.

State v. Merida, 960 A.2d 228, 230, 231 (R.I. 2008). On July 7, 2006, the trial\njustice sentenced defendant to two forty-year terms of imprisonment, with twenty years to serve\nand twenty years suspended, with probation, on the two first-degree child molestation sexual\nassault counts; and one thirty-year term, with ten years to serve and twenty years suspended, with\nprobation, on the second-degree child molestation sexual assault count; all sentences were to be\nserved concurrently. Id. at 230.', 'From May 2004 until his determination of guilt in May 2006, defendant was on what he\ncharacterizes as “twenty-four hour electronic home confinement” as a condition of bail.2 In\nOctober 2016, following the completion of defendant’s direct and postconviction-relief appeals,\nhe filed a “motion for correction of sentence” pro se, pursuant to Rule 35, which was later heard\nby the same trial justice who presided over Merida’s trial. Merida also filed a motion to appoint\ncounsel for the hearing, but the trial justice denied the motion.', 'At the hearing on his motion to correct his sentence, defendant argued that the twenty-four\nmonths he spent on home confinement should be credited toward his overall sentence, pursuant to\nG.L. 1956 § 12-19-2(a). Specifically, he argued that this Court’s opinion in State v. Quattrocchi,\n687 A.2d 78 (R.I. 1996), established that home confinement was a form of “imprisonment” for\nwhich credit could be given pursuant to § 12-19-2(a). The trial justice then reviewed several\nrelevant cases decided by this Court, taking time to explain each case to defendant and\n2', 'The record reveals that defendant’s motion to set bail was granted on May 10, 2004, and a pretrial\norder was entered for pretrial community confinement pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 42-56-20.2,\nspecifying that “[e]lectronic monitoring devices shall be used.”', '-2-\ndistinguishing the cases based on their facts.3 Merida also argued that a prisoner, whom he knew,\nhad received credit toward his sentence for the time he spent on home confinement while awaiting\ntrial. However, at that hearing, defendant could not remember all the details of that case. The trial\njustice therefore continued the hearing, at defendant’s request, so that defendant could obtain more\ninformation regarding the case he had mentioned.', 'One week later, on November 9, 2016, at the continued hearing, Merida argued that two of\nhis cellmates, Mr. Bagley and Mr. DePina, received credit for home confinement toward their\noverall sentence. However, the trial justice found those cases distinguishable, explaining that, “[i]t\nappears that Mr. Bagley was sentenced for bail violation and asked for credit for time served and\nhome confinement, but it wasn’t a sentencing after trial where he was held in home confinement\nas a condition of bail prior to trial.” She further explained that Mr. DePina was sentenced after a\nplea agreement with a “capped” plea, stating that, “if I did give him credit for time served in home\nconfinement, it was in accordance with an agreement whereby he agreed to plead guilty and he\npled guilty.” Having heard defendant’s arguments, the trial justice issued a bench decision denying\ndefendant’s request to receive credit for time spent on home confinement.', 'Merida filed a timely notice of appeal on December 1, 2016.4 Before this Court, Merida\nargues that: (1) the trial justice erred in her interpretation of case precedent, specifically our opinion\n3', 'Most of the cases that the trial justice discussed involved home confinement as a condition of\nparole or a plea agreement.

The only case that the trial justice found to be relevant to the issue\nof whether home confinement should count as credit toward a completed sentence was a case from\nthe United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. See United States v. Zackular, 945 F.2d\n423, 424-25 (1st Cir. 1991) (holding that a defendant is not entitled to credit toward an overall\nsentence for a period spent in home confinement).\n4', 'This Court remanded the case to Superior Court for the entry of the order denying defendant’s\nmotion, and an order entered to that effect on November 8, 2018.

Specifically, defendant contends that he was entitled to twenty-four\nmonths of credit for time that he spent on home confinement between the dates of May 11, 2004,\nand May 9, 2006.', 'The defendant argues that, based on this Court’s interpretation of\n“imprisonment” in Quattrocchi, home confinement is a form of imprisonment, and, therefore, his\noverall sentence should be reduced by the two years he spent on home confinement while on bail\nawaiting trial. He bases this contention on certain language in § 12-19-2(a), which provides, in\nrelevant part:', '“Whenever it is provided that any offense shall be punished by a', 'fine or imprisonment, the court imposing punishment may, in its', 'discretion, select the kind of punishment to be imposed, and, if the', 'punishment is fine or imprisonment, its amount or term within the', 'limits prescribed by law; provided, if the punishment to be imposed', 'is imprisonment, the sentence or sentences imposed shall be reduced', 'by the number of days spent in confinement while awaiting trial and', 'while awaiting sentencing * * *.” (Emphasis added.)', '“We have previously held that the General Assembly’s enactment of the so-called dead-\ntime provisions of § 12-19-2 was a benevolent effort to assist the person who, because of an\ninability to make bail, has been cast into a sort of limbo as he awaited the disposition of the charge\nor complaint which had caused his incarceration.” State v. Ilacqua, 765 A.2d 822, 824 (R.I. 2001)\n(brackets omitted) (quoting State v. Skirvin, 113 R.I. 443, 446, 322 A.2d 297, 299-300 (1974)).\n“Such an individual is ‘in limbo because the time spent awaiting trial or sentence can not be\ncredited towards any future parole.’” Id. (brackets omitted) (quoting Skirvin, 113 R.I. at 446 n.1,', '-5-\n322 A.2d at 300 n.1). This Court has previously stated that “the phrase ‘while awaiting trial and\nwhile awaiting sentencing’ must be construed as embracing confinement time spent for any reason\nwhatsoever in connection with an offense for which a defendant is subsequently sentenced.” Id.\n(quoting State v. Holmes, 108 R.I. 579, 582, 277 A.2d 914, 916 (1971)).', 'In Holmes, we noted that § 12-19-2 “is subject to administrative rather than judicial\napplication.” Holmes, 108 R.I. at 585, 277 A.2d at 917. Thus, it is for the director of the ACI to\napply the provisions of § 12-19-2 and to give credits to those persons who were forced to await\ntrial in confinement prior to their conviction. See id. However, G.L. 1956 § 42-56-20.2(j), entitled\n“No incarceration credit for persons awaiting trial[,]” states that “[n]o detainee shall be given\nincarceration credit by the director [of the ACI] for time spent in community confinement while\nawaiting trial.” (Emphasis added.) That provision specifically prohibits the director from granting\na person credit for time spent on home confinement prior to trial and prior to conviction.', 'This Court has stated that, “when we are faced with statutory provisions that are in pari\nmateria, we construe them in a manner that attempts to harmonize them and that is consistent with\ntheir general objective scope.” State v. Dearmas, 841 A.2d 659, 666 (R.I. 2004). Because both\n§ 12-19-2 and § 42-56-20.2 govern sentencing of a person convicted of a crime, they may be read\ntogether as part of a greater statutory sentencing scheme created by the General Assembly. See id.\nReading the two provisions together, it is clear that, if the accused is unable to make bail and must\nawait trial at the ACI, then, pursuant to § 12-19-2, the director of the ACI must grant credit for that\ntime if the accused is later convicted. On the other hand, if the accused makes bail and is able to', '-6-\nawait trial in his home, then, pursuant to § 42-56-20.2(j), the director cannot give credit for that\ntime, even if the accused is confined in his home as a condition of bail.6', 'Nevertheless, Merida argues that our opinion in Quattrocchi, where we held that “[w]e are\npersuaded that home confinement is a form of imprisonment during which an employee’s liberty\nis significantly restrained[,]” when read in conjunction with § 12-19-2, entitles him to a reduced\nsentence for the time he spent on home confinement. Quattrocchi, 687 A.2d at 79. However, that\ncase involved an application of G.L. 1956 § 28-33-17.1(c) of the Workers’ Compensation Act,\nwhich prohibits an injured employee from collecting workers’ compensation benefits “for any\nperiod during which the employee was imprisoned as a result of a conviction of a criminal\noffense.” Id. As such, Quattrocchi is inapplicable here, where an application of the plain meaning\nof § 42-56-20.2(j) would bar the director of the ACI from awarding credit to a person convicted\nof a crime for the time that the person spent on community confinement while awaiting trial.', 'We also note that prohibiting credit for time spent on home confinement, as a condition of\nbail, is consistent with the spirit of § 12-19-2(a). The purpose of that statute is to relieve those\npersons who were unable to make bail from the burden of their confinement at the ACI before\ntrial. See Ilacqua, 765 A.2d at 824. That concern is inapplicable where, as here, the accused was\nable to make bail and remain at home pending the outcome of trial. Therefore, we hold that the\ntrial justice’s interpretation of § 12-19-2(a) and § 42-56-20.2(j) was correct, and that Merida should\nnot be credited with the time he spent on home confinement.\n6', '“[T]he right to bail, although guaranteed, is not absolute and may be granted subject to conditions\nreasonably calculated to further the purpose of bail itself, that is, to ensure the presence of the\naccused at court.” Bridges v.

However, because defendant did\nnot raise this argument below, we deem it waived.', 'The raise-or-waive rule is well settled in this state, and this Court generally “will not\nconsider on appeal an issue that was not raised before the trial court.” Harvey Realty v. Killingly\nManor Condominium Association, 787 A.2d 465, 466-67 (R.I. 2001). We have recognized that\nthe raise-or-waive rule “will not be disturbed unless ‘basic constitutional rights are concerned.’”\nState v. Gomez, 848 A.2d 221, 237 (R.I. 2004) (quoting State v. Donato, 592 A.2d 140, 141 (R.I.\n1991)). “To fall within this exception, the defendant must show: (1) that the error complained of\namounts to more than harmless error; (2) that a sufficient record exists to permit a determination\nof the issue; and (3) that ‘counsel’s failure to raise the issue before trial must be premised upon a\nnovel rule of law that counsel could not reasonably have known during the trial.’” State v. Florez,\n138 A.3d 789, 796 (R.I. 2016) (brackets omitted) (quoting Cronan ex rel. State v. Cronan, 774\nA.2d 866, 878 (R.I. 2001)). However, because defendant has not identified any of the criteria to\nthis narrow exception to the raise-or-waive rule as applicable to his equal-protection claim, we\nhold that his argument is waived.7\n7', 'Although we need not reach the issue because it was not raised below, we note, nonetheless, that\na review of the record fails to reveal any error. In each of the fact patterns that Merida offered to\nthe trial justice as examples of persons receiving credit for time spent on home confinement, the\ndefendant was provided credit as a condition of a plea, or in the context of parole.

Specifically,\ndefendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion to appoint counsel, given that\nEnglish is his second language and that he is not proficient enough to sufficiently argue the\ncomplex issues involved in this case pro se.', 'This Court has declined to extend Rule 44 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal\nProcedure,8 which requires the appointment of counsel in certain Superior Court proceedings, to a\nsentence-reduction hearing under Rule 35, at least where issues of fundamental fairness and due\nprocess are not implicated. See State v. Chase, 9 A.3d 1248, 1253 (R.I. 2010). However, in Chase,\n“we [did] not address the question of whether the dictates of fundamental fairness and due process\nmight require [a] * * * defendant to be appointed counsel in a Rule 35 proceeding in an appropriate\ncase[,]” because the defendant had not raised that particular issue. Id. at 1254. While Merida does\nraise due-process and fundamental-fairness concerns in the instant case, we nevertheless hold that\nhis arguments are without merit.', 'We have followed the lead of the federal courts, which have held that “[a] criminal\ndefendant’s right to counsel ‘flows from different constitutional provisions, depending on the\nconfinement were not held at home as a condition of bail and, therefore, were not similarly situated\nto defendant. Thus, defendant’s constitutional claim would have failed on the merits.\n8', 'Rule 44 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure states that:', '“If a defendant appears in Superior Court without an attorney, the', 'court shall advise the defendant of the defendant’s right to an', 'attorney and assign an attorney to represent the defendant at every', 'stage of the proceeding unless the defendant is able to obtain the', 'defendant’s own attorney or elects to proceed without an attorney.”', '-9-\nnature of the proceedings.’” Chase, 9 A.3d at 1252 (brackets omitted) (quoting United States v.\nPalomo, 80 F.3d 138, 141 (5th Cir. 1996)). “More specifically, the Sixth Amendment to the United\nStates Constitution provides a criminal defendant with the right to counsel during all ‘critical\nstages’ of a criminal prosecution, State v. Oliveira, 961 A.2d 299, 308-09 (R.I. 2008), ‘where\nsubstantial rights of a criminal accused may be affected.’” Chase, 9 A.3d at 1252-53 (footnote\nomitted) (quoting Mempa v.

Moreover, defendant has filed requests for\ncounsel that show that he is indigent and cannot afford his own attorney. Nevertheless, a Rule 35\nmotion is not a “critical stage of a prosecution” where the Sixth Amendment right to counsel\nattaches, because the proceeding occurs after a prosecution has been completed. See Oliveira, 961\nA.2d at 308-09. As this Court has stated, a Rule 35 motion “is essentially a plea for leniency.”\nSee, e.g., Ciresi, 151 A.3d at 754 (quoting Farooq, 115 A.3d at 964). Additionally, the issue at\nbar—whether § 12-19-2 afforded defendant time off his sentence for the time he spent on home\nconfinement—was not so complex as to require the appointment of counsel as a matter of\nfundamental fairness and due process.', 'In this case, a review of the record fails to reveal any error.

Valerie’s\ntestimony, which the hearing justice accepted as true, bespoke of behavior by defendant that\nclearly can be described as a sexual assault whereas defendant’s testimony, even if given\ncredence, amounted to an admission that he solicited a prostitute, conduct that would also\nsupport a violation adjudication. By crediting Valerie’s testimony, the hearing justice was\nnecessarily subscribing to the sexual-assault version as the basis for the violation finding.', '-7-', 'To the extent that defendant ascribes error to the hearing justice’s employment of the\npreponderance of the evidence standard, we need not ponder long. The defendant did not object\nto this at the hearing and, in fact, conceded at oral argument that he was not challenging the\nburden of proof standard that the hearing justice applied.', 'Finally, defendant asserts that the hearing justice abused her discretion in sentencing him\nto serve eighteen years of his previously suspended sentence.

After a trial in Providence County Superior Court, a\njury found the defendant, Ricardo Romero (Romero or defendant), guilty of three counts of\nsecond-degree child molestation sexual assault, in violation of G.L. 1956 §§ 11-37-8.3 and 11-\n37-8.4. On appeal, defendant contends that the trial justice improperly admitted testimony\nregarding previous restraining orders against defendant and erred in denying defendant’s motion\nfor a new trial. On September 25, 2018, this case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an\norder directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should\nnot be summarily decided. After hearing the parties’ arguments and reviewing the memoranda\nsubmitted by counsel, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown. Accordingly, further\nbriefing or argument is not required to decide this matter. For the reasons explained herein, we\naffirm the judgment of conviction.', '1', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On December 18, 2013, the state charged defendant by indictment with two counts of\nfirst-degree child molestation sexual assault and one count of second-degree child molestation\nsexual assault for acts alleged to have been committed against the victim, Mary,1 then six years\nold.2 Mary is the daughter of defendant’s then-girlfriend, Joann, and, at the time of the alleged\nincidents, Mary and Joann lived together in a small, two-bedroom apartment. In August 2012,\nJoann began dating defendant and he occasionally stayed overnight at the apartment.', 'According to the testimony at trial, on or about February 8, 2013, defendant spent the\nnight at the apartment.', 'Joann testified that she was aware that defendant got up from the bed\ntwo or three times during the night. Joann further testified that, when she asked defendant “if he\nwas okay and why he kept getting up[,]” he became defensive and agitated; Joann found\ndefendant’s reaction to be odd. Joann testified that, the next day, she asked Mary if defendant\nhad gone into her room the night before and that Mary had responded in the affirmative. That\nsame day, Joann called defendant and confronted him about his having gone into Mary’s room\nthe previous night. Joann testified that defendant became defensive and confirmed that he had\nbeen in Mary’s bedroom, but he stated that he had “always” checked on Mary. However, Joann\ntestified that this upset her because that was not true and defendant “ha[d] no reason to be in\n[her] daughter’s room.” After the phone call with defendant, Joann asked her sister to attempt to\nelicit more information from Mary concerning defendant’s presence in her bedroom the night\n1', 'Throughout this opinion, we use pseudonyms to identify the complaining witness and her\nmother.\n2', 'During the course of trial, counsel for both sides, as well as the trial justice, refer to Mary as a\nsix-year-old, as do we. However, the record reveals that Mary had, in fact, recently turned seven\nyears old at the time of the alleged sexual assaults.', '2\nbefore. Joann’s sister took Mary out to eat; when the two returned, Joann’s sister reported that\nMary told her that defendant had “rubbed her butt.”', 'According to Joann, later in the day on February 9, 2013, defendant arrived at the\napartment unannounced.', 'While there, defendant warned Joann, in what she characterized as a\n“very aggressive” manner, to “keep [her] windows locked.” That same day, Joann called the\npolice. When the police arrived, they spoke with Joann and then took Joann and Mary to Hasbro\nChildren’s Hospital. Mary was interviewed at a later date by the Child Advocacy Center.\nDefendant was arrested and the grand jury returned an indictment charging defendant with three\ncounts of first-degree child molestation sexual assault on December 18, 2013.', 'Mary, who was ten years old at the time of trial, testified as to three separate times—\ncomprising the three separate counts of the indictment—that defendant entered her bedroom on\nthe night in question. Mary testified that defendant came into her bedroom while she was\nsleeping and pulled down her pants and underwear; Mary then felt a fingernail and a finger go\ninside her buttocks. Mary then testified that defendant again “did something bad” to her.\nAccording to Mary, she heard someone stomping in her room and remembers feeling something\nwet on her buttocks. Mary testified that defendant again pulled down her pants and underwear;\nshe testified that, when she tried to move toward the wall, defendant grabbed her on the stomach.\nAccording to Mary, “[i]t was kind of in, but not that much”; she testified that defendant was\nmoving a little and she knew it was in her buttocks because it “hurted” her. Finally, Mary\ntestified that the final time defendant entered her bedroom she felt a hand, fingers, and\nfingernails squeeze her buttocks.', 'The state also called Joann as a witness. Defense counsel, during his cross-examination\nof Joann, attempted to elicit a motive for the accusations against defendant. In that inquiry,', '3\ndefense counsel asked Joann if she desired to have children with defendant, if she was aware that\ndefendant had five children, and if she knew that defendant had previously had a vasectomy.\nDuring this line of questioning, Joann denied wanting to have children with defendant,\nconfirmed knowledge of the fact that he had had a vasectomy, and further stated that defendant\nwas “not able to see” his children. The state’s redirect examination of Joann on the topic of\ndefendant not being able to see his children, discussed in more detail below, is at issue in this\nappeal.', 'At the conclusion of two days of trial, the jury found defendant guilty of the lesser-\nincluded offense of second-degree child molestation sexual assault on the first two counts, and\nalso guilty of second-degree child molestation sexual assault on the third count. Thereafter,\ndefendant moved for a new trial, arguing that the trial testimony lacked any indication of the\nnecessary element of sexual gratification as to all three counts of second-degree child\nmolestation sexual assault. Moreover, defendant averred that Mary’s testimony indicating that\nthere were two instances of penetration, particularly in light of the jury’s finding of not guilty on\nthe two counts of first-degree child molestation sexual assault, precluded a finding of guilty on\nthe lesser-included offense of second-degree child molestation sexual assault. Ultimately, the\ntrial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial and sentenced defendant to three\nconcurrent twenty-year terms of imprisonment, with seven years to serve and the remainder of\nthe sentences suspended, with probation. Defendant timely appealed to this Court, arguing that\nthe trial justice erred: (1) in overruling defendant’s objection to Mary’s testimony about existing\nrestraining orders that prevented defendant from seeing his children and failing to strike that\nportion of Joann’s testimony; and (2) in denying his motion for a new trial.', '4', 'II', 'Standards of Review', 'A', 'Admission of Testimony Regarding Prior Restraining Orders', '“Evidentiary rulings * * * are reviewed for abuse of discretion.” State v.

Specifically, defendant contends that the trial justice’s failure\nto respond to the objection or to strike Joann’s testimony allowed the jury to “speculate on why\nsuch an order had been necessary and what behavior it was intended to forestall.” The following\nexchange occurred during the state’s redirect examination of Joann:', '“[THE STATE:]', 'Defense counsel asked you about', 'wanting to have a child with the', 'defendant.

Accordingly, failure to make a specific objection—or any objection—will trigger the\nlongstanding “raise-or-waive” rule. The record reveals that defense counsel did not object to the\nstate’s question to Joann confirming her prior testimony on cross-examination as to her\nknowledge regarding whether defendant could see his children, and defense counsel similarly did\nnot object or move to strike after Joann answered that defendant “has restraining orders.”\nInstead, defense counsel made a blanket objection to the state’s question, “Why is that?” The\ndefendant never articulated a specific reason for the objection, and likewise did not specify\nwhich part of Joann’s testimony he believed should be stricken from the record. Moreover,\ndefendant did not request a limiting instruction or move for a mistrial at any point during the\nquestioning or thereafter. For these reasons, the “raise-or-waive” rule precludes defendant from\nraising the issue of the admission of Joann’s testimony—that defendant “has restraining\norders”—into evidence at trial.', 'Even if defendant had properly preserved this issue on appeal through a timely and\nspecific objection, the record reveals that defense counsel opened the door to the state’s inquiry\non the topic during his cross-examination of Joann. Notably, during the cross-examination,\ndefense counsel asked Joann if she was aware that defendant had had a vasectomy. Moreover,\ndefense counsel asked Joann whether she was aware that defendant had five children of his own.\nIn response, Joann testified that she knew defendant had five children and that “he can’t see', '8\nthem.” Accordingly, even if a proper objection to the testimony had been raised, it would not\nhave been an abuse of discretion to allow Joann’s testimony on this issue because defendant\nopened the door during his cross-examination of Joann. See Virola, 115 A.3d at 997 (holding\nthat the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in overruling the defendant’s objection, because\nthe defendant opened the door during cross-examination of the witness).', 'B', 'Motion for a New Trial', 'The defendant also appeals the trial justice’s denial of his motion for a new trial.\nSpecifically, defendant posits that the trial justice abused his discretion because the jury finding\ndefendant “guilty of second degree assaults instead of first degree assaults as charged was an\ninsufficient response to testimony that was essentially vague and incredible.”', 'Moreover,\ndefendant maintains that the trial justice’s analysis regarding Mary’s testimony was “entirely\nconclusory.”', 'As we have noted, “when ruling on a motion for a new trial, the ‘record should reflect a\nfew sentences of the justice’s reasoning on each point.’” Virola, 115 A.3d at 991 (quoting State\nv. Rosario, 35 A.3d 938, 947 (R.I. 2012)). In denying defendant’s motion for a new trial, the\ntrial justice thoroughly explained his reasoning and rationale. He first reviewed the language of\nhis jury instructions, which included the admonition to the jury that the state was required to\nprove that defendant engaged in the alleged activity “for the specific purpose of achieving sexual\ngratification or arousal[.]” He concluded that defendant’s actions were for the purpose of\narousal, “irrespective of whether it was also for sexual gratification.” The trial justice then\naddressed Mary’s testimony and acknowledged that certain aspects were not as clear on cross-\nexamination as they were on direct regarding the “penetration element.” However, the trial', '9\njustice also noted that the victim was testifying as a fourth-grader to events that transpired when\nshe was merely six years old and in the first grade. Additionally, the trial justice explained that\nMary’s testimony, in his view, was “unembellished, unvarnished, and, in a word, credible, to the\npoint of the sexual misconduct.” Finally, the trial justice expressed his agreement with the jury’s\nverdict and their decision to render guilty verdicts on the first two counts of the indictment for\nsecond-degree child molestation sexual assault, rather than first-degree child molestation sexual\nassault as charged, due to the lack of sufficiently explicit testimony on the issue of penetration.\nThe trial justice specifically found it clear that “the jury gave careful attention to all the evidence.\nThey deliberated several hours, they asked pertinent questions * * *. It is clear * * * that these\njurors did not rush to judgment.” For these reasons, we accept the credibility determinations of\nthe trial justice, and we see no reason to disrupt his decision denying defendant’s motion for a\nnew trial.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

The defendant, Christopher Forlasto, appeals from a\npretrial order of the Superior Court denying his motion to dismiss one count of first-degree\nsexual assault on the grounds of double jeopardy and prosecutorial misconduct.1 The defendant\nalso appeals from the same pretrial order granting the state’s motions in limine to exclude certain\nphotographic evidence and to admit evidence of a jury’s prior guilty verdict against the\ndefendant, as well as previously acquitted conduct. This case came before the Supreme Court on\nOctober 3, 2019, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the\nissues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After carefully considering the\nparties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not\nbeen shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the\nreasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.\n1', 'This Court has consistently held “that the denial of a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy\ngrounds is immediately appealable, even though such an appeal is interlocutory.” State v.\nCorleto, 161 A.3d 504, 506 n.1 (R.I. 2017); see also State v. O’Connor, 936 A.2d 216, 217 (R.I.\n2007); State v.

At a jury trial in Washington County\nSuperior Court, two contrasting versions of events were described by defendant and the\ncomplaining witness, Jane.2 The nine-day trial included seventeen witnesses, both lay and\nexpert, and a large number of exhibits pertaining to serious allegations of sexual assault by\ndefendant. Additionally, evidence of several surgeries that resulted in a lengthy recovery period\nfor Jane was introduced.', 'After the close of the state’s case-in-chief, the trial justice granted defendant’s motion for\na judgment of acquittal as to count one (first-degree sexual assault based on anal penetration).\nLater, the defense presented its case, the parties rested, and closing arguments were heard by the\njury. After the state’s closing argument, defendant objected to what he characterized as an\n“improper plea to the passions of the jury” when, according to defendant, the prosecutor cried at\nthe end of her closing argument.', 'The trial justice remarked that she had not noticed the\nprosecutor cry, but she added that the issue had been brought to her attention. The trial justice\n2', 'We refer to the complaining witness in this case by a pseudonym to protect her privacy.', '-2-\nquestioned the prosecutor, who admitted that she had become “choked up[,]” but stated that she\n“didn’t cry.” The trial justice suggested the following curative instruction for the jury:', '“As is the case in many trials, emotions run high. Witnesses', 'become emotional. Sometimes spectators become emotional.', 'Attorneys also can become emotional. You must disregard any', 'display of emotion so that it does not interfere with your ability to', 'decide this case fairly. When you were selected to sit on this case,', 'you promised us that you would decide this case solely on the', 'evidence properly put before you and on the law that you receive', 'from the court. We are human and not devoid of emotions;', 'however, you are duty bound not to let passion or prejudice', 'influence you in determining the issues in the case.”\nThe trial justice then asked defense counsel: “Is there something else you suggest?” Defense\ncounsel responded: “No, Your Honor. That’s fine.” The curative instruction was then given to\nthe jury, with no objection.', 'Also during her instructions to the jury, the trial justice informed the jurors that they\nwould be given a verdict form with six questions, one for each of the six remaining counts of the\nindictment. Each question referred to the specific acts that formed the basis for that particular\ncount. Ultimately, after deliberations, the jury found defendant not guilty on counts two and\nthree, first-degree sexual assault based upon two alleged acts of oral penetration. The jury also\nfound defendant not guilty on count four, assault with a dangerous weapon, which was based on\nthe allegation that defendant had choked Jane with his hands, and count seven, assault and\nbattery, which was based on the allegation that defendant had bitten Jane’s arm. The jury found\ndefendant guilty on count six, assault and battery, which was based on a bite to Jane’s cheek. On\ncount five, first-degree sexual assault based upon anal penetration, the jury deadlocked and did\nnot reach a verdict.', 'Based on the mistrial resulting from the hung jury, the trial justice scheduled a status\nconference for February 8, 2017, because it was evident that the state would retry defendant on', '-3-\nthe deadlocked count.', 'The state and defendant then filed several pretrial motions.', 'The\ndefendant filed a motion to dismiss the sole remaining count, arguing that double jeopardy\nbarred a retrial of acquitted conduct that arose from the same set of facts previously decided by\nthe jury and further arguing that the prosecutor had engaged in conduct that was intended to\ncause a mistrial. The defendant also filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude any reference to\nacquitted conduct from the first trial. The state objected to defendant’s motions and moved in\nlimine to permit evidence related to the acquitted conduct. The state filed two additional motions\nin limine: one to introduce evidence of defendant’s assault conviction (count six) under Rule 609\nof the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, and one to suppress certain photographic evidence under\nRule 403.3', 'The trial justice held a hearing on the parties’ motions on May 12, 2017. On June 2,\n2017, the trial justice, in a bench decision, denied defendant’s motion to dismiss count five on\ndouble jeopardy grounds. The trial justice found that the issues defendant sought to foreclose\nwere not actually litigated by the prior jury’s acquittal in counts two, three, four, and seven, or in\nthe court’s decision as to count one. The trial justice also denied defendant’s motion to dismiss\non prosecutorial misconduct grounds, finding that defendant had agreed to a curative instruction\nand had not moved for a mistrial. The trial justice granted the state’s motion in limine to permit\nRule 404(b) evidence of the conduct referenced in acquitted counts one, two, three, and four;\nhowever, the trial justice denied the motion as it pertained to the acquitted conduct referenced in\ncount seven. Finally, the trial justice granted the state’s motions in limine to introduce evidence\n3', 'As of the time of publication of this opinion, defendant has yet to be sentenced on his\nconviction for assault in count six.', '-4-\nof defendant’s assault conviction (count six) for a limited purpose, and to suppress certain\nphotographic evidence.

The defendant contends that the trial justice erred in ordering that facts alleged in\nthe counts for which he was acquitted are admissible into evidence in the retrial of count five, for\nfirst-degree sexual assault. According to defendant, the state would be relying on the same facts\nupon which a jury has already found defendant not guilty, in violation of his right to be free from\ndouble jeopardy.', '1', 'Standard of Review', 'When a defendant alleges a violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause, it “presents this\nCourt with a mixed question of law and fact.” State v. Footman, 196 A.3d 758, 764 (R.I. 2018).\n“Therefore, ‘our review of such a claim is de novo.’” Id. (quoting State v. Marsich, 10 A.3d 435,\n441 (R.I. 2010)). “Within the purview of a de novo review, a trial justice’s findings of historical\nfact are accorded great deference.” Id.\n4', 'We note that defendant’s appeal was filed prior to the docketing of the order in the Superior\nCourt, which occurred on February 28, 2019; however, “under circumstances such as the instant\ncase presents, this Court will treat a premature appeal as timely filed.” State v. Diamante, 83\nA.3d 546, 548 n.5 (R.I. 2014).', '-5-', '2', 'Analysis', 'This Court has “interpreted our state constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy in\na manner consistent with the Federal Constitution * * * so that our inquiry is ultimately the same\nunder either clause.” State v. One 1990 Chevrolet Corvette VIN: 1G1YY3388L5111488, 695\nA.2d 502, 505 (R.I. 1997). We have recognized that “the double jeopardy clause protects against\nthree distinct abuses: a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal; a second\nprosecution for the same offense after conviction; and multiple punishments for the same\noffense.” State v. Ciolli, 725 A.2d 268, 270 (R.I. 1999) (quoting One 1990 Chevrolet Corvette,\n695 A.2d at 505).', 'The defendant does not allege a violation of any of the three distinct abuses that have\nbeen recognized by this Court. The defendant is not being prosecuted for the same offense after\nan acquittal, because the state seeks retrial for only count five, which resulted in a mistrial. The\ndefendant is not being prosecuted for the same offense after a conviction, and he will not be\npunished twice for the same offense. The defendant merely asserts that admitting the acquitted\nconduct into evidence would force him to relitigate issues already decided by a valid judgment of\nacquittal.', 'The defendant cites to two United States Supreme Court cases, Yeager v. United States,\n557 U.S. 110 (2009), and Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436 (1970), for the proposition that the\nDouble Jeopardy Clause precludes the state “from relitigating any issue that was necessarily\ndecided by a jury’s acquittal in a prior trial.” Yeager, 557 U.S. at 119. The defendant correctly\nstates that those two cases explained that “‘when an issue of ultimate fact has once been\ndetermined by a valid and final judgment’ of acquittal, it ‘cannot again be litigated’ in a second', '-6-\ntrial for a separate offense.” Id. (quoting Ashe, 397 U.S. at 443). The defendant, however, does\nnot argue that the jury in the first trial necessarily decided the ultimate issue in count five, which\nresulted in a deadlocked jury and is the only count for which the state seeks a retrial. Instead,\ndefendant argues that the jury necessarily decided certain issues when they acquitted him on\ncounts two, three, four, and seven, and that admitting that acquitted conduct into evidence,\npursuant to Rule 404(b), would force defendant to relitigate those same issues already decided by\na valid judgment of acquittal, in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause. This argument\nconflates a double jeopardy contention with one that is evidentiary.', 'We have consistently held that collateral estoppel does not bar the use of acquitted\nconduct and that such evidence may be admissible. See, e.g., State v. Hewes, 666 A.2d 402, 403\n(R.I. 1995); State v. Bernier, 491 A.2d 1000, 1005 (R.I. 1985). “The fact of acquittal goes to the\nweight, not the admissibility, of the evidence.” Hewes, 666 A.2d at 403. Whether defendant’s\nacquitted conduct is admissible under Rule 404(b) at his retrial on count five is an issue that is\nnot properly before us at this time, as evidentiary issues are matters to be left to the time of trial\nand do not “fall within the exception * * * which permits a party to appeal, on double jeopardy\ngrounds, before the entry of a final judgment.” State v. O’Connor, 936 A.2d 216, 223 (R.I.\n2007). Accordingly, we will not address that issue at this time.5\n5', 'The defendant also asks this Court to reverse certain decisions of the trial justice, which\nreversal would effectively exclude evidence of defendant’s acquitted conduct pursuant to Rule\n403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence and defendant’s assault conviction in count six, and\nwould allow admission of certain photographic evidence. Again, however, those matters are to\nbe left to the time of trial and are not properly before this Court. See State v. O’Connor, 936\nA.2d 216, 223 (R.I. 2007) (holding that evidentiary issues are matters to be left to the time of\ntrial and are not considered on interlocutory appeal).', '-7-', 'B', 'Prosecutorial Misconduct', 'The defendant alleges that he suffered a second double jeopardy violation when the trial\njustice denied his motion to dismiss based upon an allegation of prosecutorial misconduct.\nSpecifically, defendant alleges that the prosecutor started visibly crying during her closing\nargument in order to intentionally cause a mistrial.', '1', 'Standard of Review', '“In instances ‘where a defendant has moved for a mistrial and asserts on appeal that\ndouble jeopardy bars his retrial because of prosecutorial goading, we defer to the trial court’s\nfindings of fact.’” State v. Rolle, 84 A.3d 1149, 1154 (R.I. 2014) (quoting O’Connor, 936 A.2d\nat 220). “Whether prosecutorial misconduct was intended to goad the defendant into seeking a\nmistrial is a question of fact for the trial justice to decide.” Id.

Defense counsel noted an objection after the conclusion of the\nprosecutor’s closing argument, and the trial justice questioned the prosecutor. The prosecutor\ncandidly admitted that she “choked up” during her closing argument. The trial justice informed\nthe parties that she would give a curative instruction, to which defense counsel agreed. When\ndefense counsel was asked by the trial justice if he suggested anything more, defense counsel\nstated: “No, Your Honor. That’s fine.” Defense counsel never moved for a mistrial, and a\nmistrial on count five was ultimately granted based upon the fact that the jury was deadlocked,\nnot based on the prosecutor’s behavior. “In accordance with this Court’s longstanding raise-or-\nwaive rule, if an issue was not properly asserted, and thereby preserved, in the lower tribunals,\nthis Court will not consider the issue on appeal.” Trojan v.

Black, Providence police officers working in the\nnarcotics division received information from police in the City of Newport that defendant\ntraveled to Providence several times per week for the purpose of purchasing heroin for later\nresale in the City of Newport. Detective Black testified that part of the information delivered to\nthe Providence police department included a description of defendant’s mode of transportation: a\nRhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) bus. He stated that, based on this information,\ndetectives from the Providence police department surveilled the Kennedy Plaza bus station.\nDetective Black went on to state that he was aware of defendant’s physical appearance because\nhe had arrested defendant previously.

Detective Black stated that,\nafter observing defendant’s vehicle for some time, officers watched as the vehicle parked on\nElmwood Avenue. Detective Black stated that he then observed defendant exit the vehicle, step\nonto the sidewalk, put his little finger into a clear plastic bag containing a white substance, and\ntouch his little finger to his tongue. Detective Black testified at the violation hearing that this\naction, known colloquially as “lacing,” is a known street-level drug test used to assay controlled\nsubstances.

In August 2009, however, their relationship ended for a period of approximately six\nmonths.', 'Ms. Andrew testified that the couple resumed dating when defendant visited Ms. Andrew\nat her parents’ house and proclaimed that “he couldn’t live without [her]. He said that he wanted\nto marry [her], and that he had changed, and he had sought counseling, and he * * * wanted to be\ntogether and enjoy [their lives] together and buy a home together and travel together.” On\nFebruary 14, 2010, defendant proposed to Ms. Andrew and she accepted. In November of 2010,\nthey moved into a house in North Kingstown, which defendant had purchased.', 'On January 13, 2012, the couple had an argument that led to the underlying charges\nagainst defendant. The facts of the altercation were very much in dispute at trial. Ms. Andrew\ntestified that she and defendant had returned home from dinner and were watching television in\nthe living room, when defendant “instigated an argument.” She explained that they “were\nwatching TV, and [defendant] was packing for his [weekend] trip. And he started to complain\nabout the house, and that it was a mess and complained that it was [her] fault and [her] children’s\nfault and yelled at [her].” Ms. Andrew testified that she refused to engage defendant and told\ndefendant that she was going to bed. At approximately 11 or 11:30 p.m., she took out her\ncontact lenses, went to bed, and fell asleep. Ms. Andrew described that sometime thereafter she\nwas awakened when defendant “came to bed yelling.” She testified that defendant was yelling\nthat the house was a mess and that it was her fault. Ms. Andrew asked defendant not to yell, but', '-3-\nhe did not respond. He then said, “[h]ow much f’ng money is it going to take me to get rid of\nyou?” Ms. Andrew testified that she told defendant, “I love you” and “[i]t’s not about the\nmoney.” Ms. Andrew stated that defendant then called her “a fucking whore” and exposed\nhimself to her. She said that she was “afraid” and “shocked.”', 'Ms. Andrew testified that she got out of bed, picked up the suitcase defendant had packed\nfor the weekend, and walked “toward the [bedroom] door to ask him to go sleep down in the\nbasement [bedroom], because he was scaring [her],” but that defendant “jumped out of the bed\nand grabbed the bag.” Ms. Andrew added that defendant pushed her in her abdomen. She\nattempted to “slap [defendant] to make him stop,” but defendant “grabbed [her] and screamed, ‘I\nhate you * * *’ [and he] threw [her] down on the floor.” Ms. Andrew further testified that she\nlanded on her left side and covered her face with her hands to protect herself while defendant\nheld her down and punched her head, ear, and neck. Ms. Andrew also testified that defendant\n“was kicking [her] in the back, in the buttocks, [her] legs, [and her] ankle. He stomped on [her]\nhips. Then he punched [her] head some more.” She added that, while she was on the ground,\ndefendant had been screaming, “I wish you were dead * * * I hate you.” She said she told\ndefendant that “[she] was bleeding from [her] head and that [she] needed help,” but he\nresponded, “[y]ou’re not hurt you fucking drama queen,” and he kicked her in the back “three,\nfour more times” before it stopped. Thereafter, defendant left the room and Ms. Andrew crawled\nto her phone on the bureau and called 911.', 'Conversely, defendant testified that, around 11 p.m. on January 13, 2012, he and Ms.\nAndrew decided to watch a television program. He stated that Ms. Andrew had fallen asleep on\nthe couch when he got up to pack his bags for the weekend because he was going to play tennis\nearly the next morning and then travel to see his sister in Maine. After he packed his bags, he', '-4-\nwoke Ms. Andrew to tell her “it was time for bed.” He said that he went to bed and then she\ncame into the room and started arguing with him. He testified that he did not “recall how it\nactually got started, but [he] kn[ew] she was upset that [he] was going up to Maine by [him]self\n* * *.” The defendant said that, at approximately 1:30 a.m., he told Ms. Andrew that he “had to\nget up in the morning and [he] wanted some sleep. * * * [He] picked up [his] bags to leave the\nroom, and she got up and just blocked the door.” He described Ms. Andrew’s stance as that of a\n“linebacker” who would not let him leave. He said Ms. Andrew told him, “we’re going to finish\nthis,” so he put his bags down and got back into bed, while they continued to argue. According\nto defendant, they argued for a “couple of hours” primarily about his family, her drinking, and\nfinancial matters. The defendant testified that Ms. Andrew referred to his daughter and his\nformer wife in derogatory terminology.', 'The defendant testified that, after arguing for another forty-five minutes, he got out of\nbed a second time and told Ms. Andrew that he had to go to sleep, but that she again blocked the\ndoor. He continued: “I was going to go downstairs. Um, I got out of bed, picked my bags up,\n* * * and that’s when she kind of came right up to me.” The defendant described Ms. Andrew as\nhaving “kind of a crazed look in her eye,” stating that “it was kind of a scary look that she gets.”\nHe testified that she swung at him “with a closed fist.” He added:', '“She hit me with her right hand in my left eye. And she hit me so', 'hard that, um, I, I kind of blacked out momentarily. * * * I came', 'to, and she was swinging at me with her left hand, and at that point', 'I must have dropped the bags because I was able to deflect her', 'swing a little bit. And she didn’t hit me as hard with her left hand', 'as she did with the right.”\nThe defendant continued: “I was pretty frightened at that point, and I punched her back with my\nright hand. I hit her above her left eye in the forehead. * * * I hit her hard.” He described\npunching her as a “reflex.” He stated that they continued to fight, describing it as a “wrestling', '-5-\nmatch.” He remembered that he “pushed her across the bed” and “she was wailing” on the floor.\nThereafter, he left the room as he saw Ms. Andrew making a phone call.', 'A compact disc containing a recording of Ms. Andrew’s call to 911 was admitted into\nevidence at trial. During the call, Ms. Andrew acknowledged that she slapped defendant after he\ncalled her a “fucking whore.” She stated that, subsequently, defendant threw her to the floor.\nThroughout the call, Ms. Andrew reiterated that she was in pain.', 'Detective Jesse Jarvis 4 of the Town of North Kingstown Police Department and\nLieutenant Ernest Robin, a paramedic for the Town of North Kingstown, were part of the team\nwho responded to Ms. Andrew’s 911 call. At trial, Det. Jarvis stated that, when he arrived at the\nhouse, Ms. Andrew opened the door and was “hysterical.” “She was crying, bleeding, * * *\nseemed pretty out of it.” Detective Jarvis observed blood “[o]n the right side of her head,”\ndescribing that “she ha[d] light-colored blond hair, * * * it looked pretty bad.” He testified that\nMs. Andrew told him that “her fianc[é] had beat her and kicked her, punched her, stomped on\nher.” Thereafter, Det. Jarvis searched the house for defendant and found him in a basement\nbedroom. Detective Jarvis testified that defendant told him, “I’m sorry, I hit her. I lost control.\n* * * She slapped me, so I hit her.”', 'Lieutenant Robin testified that, when he arrived at the scene, he noticed Ms. Andrew\n“was visibly upset, crying * * * she had some bleeding in * * * one of her ears.” He also\nobserved that her right hand “was swollen and bruised distal from her wrist and then\nencompassed her thumb and forefinger.” He stated that he took Ms. Andrew to Rhode Island\nHospital in an ambulance.\n4', 'Detective Jarvis was a patrolman at the time he responded to the 911 call.', '-6-', 'Doctor Elizabeth Nestor, an attending physician at Rhode Island Hospital, testified at trial\nbased on the medical records. She stated that she treated Ms. Andrew for “an ear contusion and\nlacerations, hand contusion, and ankle abrasion * * * and a leg contusion and a blow to the\nhead.” Four days later, Ms. Andrew returned to the hospital complaining of blood in her urine.\nDoctor Francesca Lynne Beaudoin, an emergency physician at Rhode Island Hospital, testified\nthat she treated Ms. Andrew for complaints of “hematuria, which is blood in the urine, and\nbruising to her flank, which is basically the side of her abdomen.” Doctor Beaudoin explained\nthat Ms. Andrew “probably had suffered some minor bruising to her kidney,” and she believed\nthat “the report of hematuria was related to trauma.”', 'Ms. Andrew’s therapist, Terry Giblin, and the couple’s therapist, Peter Olivieri, also\ntestified at trial. However, the trial justice denied defendant’s request to question these witnesses\non whether Ms. Andrew argued with defendant about his family during therapy sessions, stating\nthat it was not relevant to whether the assault had happened.', 'After the state rested its case, defendant made a motion to dismiss count 1, assault with a\ndangerous weapon.', 'The trial justice granted defendant’s motion to dismiss the count as\noriginally styled, i.e., “assault with a dangerous weapon, to wit, a foot,” and the charge was\namended to simple assault, a misdemeanor. 5 After the trial concluded, the trial justice issued a\nwritten decision on April 1, 2014, finding defendant guilty of simple assault and domestic\ndisorderly conduct.', 'In her decision, the trial justice accepted Ms. Andrew’s testimony as\n“wholly credible,” stating that her “in-court testimony [was] compellingly reinforced by the 911\n5', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-5-3(a) reads: “Except as otherwise provided in § 11-5-2, every person\nwho shall make an assault or battery or both shall be imprisoned not exceeding one year or fined\nnot exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000), or both.”', '-7-\nrecording, [Det.] Jarvis, the photographic evidence of her injuries and the expert testimony of the\nphysicians who cared for her.”', 'Subsequently, defendant made a motion for reconsideration of his motion to dismiss, or\nin the alternative, to grant a new trial pursuant to Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of\nCriminal Procedure. The trial justice denied both motions. The defendant was sentenced to a\none-year suspended sentence with probation on count 1 and six months probation on count 2.\nThe defendant timely appealed from the judgment of conviction.', 'II', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, defendant raises four issues. First, defendant contends that the trial justice\noverlooked and misconceived material evidence when considering the credibility of the\nwitnesses. Second, he asserts that the trial justice failed to apply the correct burden of proof with\nrespect to his claim of self-defense. Third, he asserts that the trial justice abused her discretion\n“by barring evidence and cross-examination as to motive and bias” and “allowing evidence that\npurportedly supported the prosecution and disallowing similar evidence that supported the\ndefense.” Fourth, defendant argues that the trial justice overlooked and misconceived material\nevidence when considering his motion for a new trial.', 'A', 'Credibility Determinations', '1.

Credibility of Ms. Andrew’s Testimony', 'As defendant acknowledges in his papers, “the standard for overturning factual findings\nof a trial justice sitting without a jury is quite high”; nevertheless, he maintains that “[t]his [case]\nis the rare outlier which exceeds that bar.” He recites a number of purported inconsistencies\nbetween Ms. Andrew’s testimony at trial and statements she made to medical personnel and the\npolice. He claims that her “accounts of a vicious beating with repeated kicks to her lower back”\nwere belied by photographs and medical records documenting only minor injuries.', 'The\ndefendant also asserts that the trial justice’s finding that Ms. Andrew was “wholly credible” was\n“impossible to reconcile with irrefutable objective evidence,” and that the trial justice abused her\ndiscretion by disregarding counseling records that contradicted Ms. Andrew’s testimony', '-9-\nconcerning her relationship with defendant. Moreover, defendant contends that the trial justice\nerred by failing to explain why she rejected evidence that Ms. Andrew struck the first blow,\ninjured her ear by hitting it on furniture or the floor, sought monetary damages from defendant\nafter the incident, and had made false assertions in sworn court documents about being sexually\nassaulted by defendant.', 'Even if we were to conclude that Ms. Andrew’s testimony as to the extent of her injuries\nwas exaggerated or that her account of the incident was indeed embellished or that the trial\njustice’s characterization of her testimony as “wholly credible” was somewhat hyperbolic, we\nare nevertheless satisfied that competent evidence existed on the record to support the\nconvictions.', 'Neither the purported inconsistencies in Ms. Andrew’s testimony nor any\ncontradictory evidence undermines the ultimate finding of the trial justice that the state proved\nthat defendant had committed both the offenses of simple assault and domestic disorderly\nconduct.', '“We have defined simple assault as an ‘unlawful attempt or offer, with force or violence,\nto do a corporal hurt to another, whether from malice or wantonness.’” State v.

The 911\nrecording provides a contemporaneous audio account of the immediate aftermath of the incident', '- 10 -\nin which Ms. Andrew’s distress is palpable. To be sure, she explains to the operator that she\nslapped defendant before he threw her to the floor, yet there can be little doubt that she had just\nendured a very distressing and tumultuous episode.', 'Detective Jarvis testified that, when he responded to the house, Ms. Andrew was\nhysterical, “[s]he was crying, bleeding, * * * seemed pretty out of it. * * * It looked pretty bad.”\nShe told him that “her fianc[é] had beat her and kicked her, punched her, stomped on her.” He\nobserved bruises on her forehead, face, and chin area. He also noticed blood on her right ear, but\nhe testified that she told him she had hit her head on a piece of furniture when defendant had\npushed her down. After searching for defendant and announcing himself as “North Kingstown\nPolice” in a loud voice approximately twenty times, Det. Jarvis located defendant in a basement\nbedroom. Significantly, defendant admitted to Det. Jarvis that he had hit Ms. Andrew after she\nhad slapped him, stating, “I’m sorry, I hit her. I lost control.” Detective Jarvis also testified that\ndefendant said, “I punched her” and made a punching motion with his hands.', 'Lieutenant Robin also responded to defendant’s house that morning in his capacity as a\nparamedic. He described Ms. Andrew as bleeding from a minor laceration and having a swollen\nright hand. Lieutenant Robin testified that Ms. Andrew told him that the physical altercation had\nstarted when defendant had called her a whore, then she slapped him in the face and he pushed\nher to the floor and “started to punch and kick her, and he wouldn’t stop when she cried.”', 'The court also heard testimony from Drs. Nestor and Beaudoin, the two emergency room\nphysicians who treated Ms. Andrew. Doctor Nestor testified that, on January 14, 2012, Ms.\nAndrew presented with “an ear contusion and lacerations, hand contusion, and ankle abrasion\n* * * and a blow to the head.” Her primary complaint was the head injury. No lab tests were\nordered, however, and she was discharged after receiving ten sutures. Doctor Beaudoin, who', '- 11 -\nwas qualified as an expert witness in emergency medicine, was on duty in the Rhode Island\nHospital Emergency Room on January 18, 2012, when Ms. Andrew presented with complaints of\nblood in the urine, and bruising to the side of her abdomen. The doctor stated that she examined\nMs. Andrew and observed “significant bruising” to her right flank. Although a urine test did not\nreveal the presence of blood, Dr. Beaudoin indicated that she assumed the hematuria was\ntemporary, and she did not change her diagnostic impression. She further testified that, in her\nopinion, Ms. Andrew’s complaint of hematuria was related to trauma to the kidney.', 'The defendant contends that the trial justice was “obligated to clarify why she rejected”\nevidence contrary to Ms. Andrew’s testimony.', 'We have stated that “[t]he failure to refer to\nother evidence contradictory to that on which the trial justice relied * * * does not constitute\nmisconceiving or overlooking material evidence, if the trial justice refers to the evidence on\nwhich he [or she] did rely and in so doing clearly indicates that evidence to the contrary is\nrejected by him [or her].” DiMaio v. Del Sesto, 102 R.I. 116, 122, 228 A.2d 861, 864 (1967). “It\nis well settled that where the testimony of two witnesses is conflicting and the trier of facts\nexpressly accepts the testimony of one of the witnesses, he implicitly rejects that of the other.”\nBlecha v.

Thus, the trial justice impliedly\nrejected defendant’s testimony by her express acceptance of Ms. Andrew’s conflicting\ntestimony. See id.', 'Accordingly, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not overlook or\nmisconceive any evidence.', 'We are of the opinion, therefore, that sufficient competent and credible evidence exists in\nthe record to support the trial justice’s finding beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant\ncommitted the offenses of simple assault and domestic disorderly conduct. The trial justice, an', '- 12 -\nexperienced justice who observed the demeanor and conduct of the two principal witnesses,\nemphatically accepted the testimony of Ms. Andrew. The defendant’s arguments on appeal\nprovide inadequate cause to reject her credibility determinations.', 'B', 'Self-Defense', 'The defendant contends that he presented “sufficient evidence to raise a self-defense\nclaim,” and that the trial justice erred by failing to require the state to disprove self-defense\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.', 'The defendant maintains that the trial justice “erroneously\noverlooked significant evidence of self-defense,” specifically, his testimony that Ms. Andrew\nstruck the first two blows, and his facial injuries. The defendant also asserts that Ms. Andrew\n“admitted to the 911 operator, investigating police officer, paramedic, and emergency room\nnurse that she initiated the physical attack.” 6', '“It is well settled that ‘[u]nder the law relating to self-defense, one may defend oneself\nwhenever one reasonably believes that he or she is in imminent danger of bodily harm at the\nhands of another.’” State v.

Based upon our review of the record, we are\nsatisfied that there was sufficient evidence to support the trial justice’s conclusions. In addition\nto Ms. Andrew’s testimony that defendant had punched and kicked her after throwing her to the\nfloor, defendant testified that he had punched her “hard” and admitted to Det. Jarvis that he had\n“lost control.” Also, photographic exhibits and medical evidence demonstrate that Ms. Andrew\ndid in fact sustain injuries and that her reported hematuria was related to trauma.', 'The pith of defendant’s argument concerning self-defense is again a challenge to the\ncredibility determinations and factual findings of the trial justice. It is a most difficult hurdle to\novercome in a jury-waived trial. As we have often stated: “[F]actual findings of a trial justice\nsitting without a jury are granted an extremely deferential standard of review.” State v.\nGianquitti, 22 A.3d 1161, 1165 (R.I. 2011).', 'C', 'Evidentiary Rulings and Cross-Examination', 'The defendant also takes issue with a number of evidentiary rulings that the trial justice\nmade during the course of the trial. He maintains that he “unsuccessfully sought to introduce\nevidence and elicit cross-examination to prove that Ms. Andrew, fueled by his rejection and her', '- 14 -\nprecarious financial position, was vengeful and motivated to instigate the incident, fabricate her\nclaims, and extract money from him.”', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice violated his constitutional rights and committed\nan abuse of discretion “by barring evidence and cross-examination as to motive and bias,” and\n“by allowing evidence that purportedly supported the prosecution and disallowing similar\nevidence that supported the defense.” Specifically, defendant contends that the trial justice erred\nby barring him from cross-examining Ms. Andrew as to her finances and by refusing to admit\ncounseling records that referenced Ms. Andrew’s financial conflicts with defendant, “her fear of\nbeing on her own,” her conflicts with his family members, her alcohol use, and a “showdown”\nover setting a wedding date. He contends that the trial justice either prevented him from\nintroducing such evidence or “failed to appreciate its significance” and that she barred\nimpeachment evidence that “exposed Ms. Andrew’s lack of candor and credibility.” Moreover,\ndefendant maintains that the trial justice erred by admitting only those portions of counseling\nrecords that purportedly supported Ms. Andrew’s account of the altercation.', '1. Standard of Review', 'Pursuant to the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution, and article 1, section\n10 of the Rhode Island Constitution, this Court has held that “it is axiomatic that ‘the trial justice\nmay not totally prevent the defendant from exploring the issues of motive, bias, or prejudice in\nthe testimony of the state’s chief witness.’” State v. Oliveira, 882 A.2d 1097, 1122 (R.I. 2005)\n(quoting State v. Parillo, 480 A.2d 1349, 1357 (R.I. 1984) (emphasis omitted)). As such, the\n“trial justice has no discretion at all under the confrontation clause to completely prohibit defense\ncounsel from attempting to elicit testimony from a crucial witness to demonstrate bias upon his\npart.” Id. (quoting Parillo, 480 A.2d at 1357 (emphasis omitted)). “For cross-examination to', '- 15 -\nsatisfy constitutional guarantees, the trial justice is required to afford the accused ‘reasonable\nlatitude’ to establish or reveal bias, prejudice, or ulterior motives as they may relate to the case\nbeing tried.” Id. at 1122-23 (quoting State v. Hazard, 745 A.2d 748, 756 (R.I. 2000)).', '“[O]nce sufficient cross-examination has been allowed, the constitutional safeguards are\nsatisfied, and any further cross-examination is left within the sound discretion of the trial\njustice.” Oliveira, 882 A.2d at 1123 (quoting Hazard, 745 A.2d at 756). Thus, when “the trial\njustice does not totally prevent or completely prohibit the defendant from exploring the issues of\nmotive, bias, or prejudice of the witness, we employ an abuse-of-discretion standard on review.”\nId. at 1122. “It is well settled that this Court will not disturb a trial justice’s ruling on an\nevidentiary issue unless that ruling constitutes an abuse of the justice’s discretion that prejudices\nthe complaining party.” Thomas v. Proctor, 63 A.3d 881, 884 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v.\nTetreault, 31 A.3d 777, 782 (R.I. 2011)).', '2. Analysis', 'In this case, defendant conducted an extensive cross-examination of Ms. Andrew, which\nincluded questioning Ms. Andrew on her finances, the engagement, and setting a wedding date.\nThus, defendant was not barred from “exploring the issues of motive, bias, or prejudice” in Ms.\nAndrew’s testimony. See Oliveira, 882 A.2d at 1122 (quoting Parillo, 480 A.2d at 1357). Nor do\nwe perceive any abuse of discretion in her rulings limiting cross-examination.', 'The record further reflects that, at the conclusion of the testimonial evidence, defendant\nmoved to admit into evidence many of the counseling records from Ms. Andrew’s individual\ntherapist and the couple’s therapist. He argued that “the records are probative of her increasing\nanger towards him for rejecting her and her bias against him, which apparently flowed from his\nexpressed intent to terminate their lifestyle arrangement, and as a motive to pick a fight and a', '- 16 -\nmotive to exaggerate her injuries in this case.” The trial justice admitted eight such records and\nruled six as inadmissible. In excluding the evidence, the trial justice stated that evidence of the\ncouple’s past arguments and disagreements at therapy sessions was not relevant, and would not\nhelp determine factually what happened on the night of the alleged assault. Moreover, the trial\njustice allowed testimony as to the couple’s (as she characterized it) “sometimes tempestuous[]\nrelationship,” and their disagreements over families, household work, and finances, which the\ncouple worked on at therapy. We agree with the trial justice that there was sufficient evidence\npresented concerning the night of the altercation and the relationship of the parties. Thus, we are\nsatisfied that the trial justice did not abuse her considerable discretion or prejudice defendant by\nexcluding certain counseling records.', 'D', 'Motion for New Trial', 'Finally, defendant avers that the trial justice erred by overlooking and misconceiving\nmaterial evidence in denying his motion for a new trial. Specifically, defendant contends that the\ntrial justice overlooked that Ms. Andrew’s testimony was not supported by her 911 call and the\nevidence presented at trial describing her injuries, and he also contends that Ms. Andrew varied\nher accounts of the incident and evaded answers about the state of her relationship with\ndefendant. The defendant maintains that the trial justice erred by ignoring his testimony about\nself-defense and refusing to consider or admit evidence of Ms. Andrew’s bias and motive,\nincluding counseling records.

This case came before the Supreme Court on May 8,\n2019, on appeal by the defendant, Joel Najera (defendant), from a judgment of conviction\nentered in the Providence County Superior Court following a jury trial. Before this Court, the\ndefendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial because the\njury’s verdict was against the weight of the evidence.1 The parties were directed to appear and\nshow cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After hearing\nthe arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the\nopinion that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the appeal at this time. For the\nreasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On March 23, 2016, defendant was charged by way of criminal information with one\ncount of assault with a dangerous weapon, to wit, a machete, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2\n(count 1), and one count of malicious injury to property, to wit, a car window and basement\n1', 'Before the Superior Court justice, defendant’s motion for a new trial was based on two\ngrounds: (1) newly discovered evidence, and (2) the verdict was against the weight of the\nevidence. On appeal, defendant challenges only the part of the decision in which the trial justice\nfound that the verdict was not against the weight of the evidence.', '-1-\nwindow, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-44-1 (count 2). A five-day jury trial commenced on\nOctober 30, 2017, in Providence County Superior Court. Several witnesses, including defendant,\npresented conflicting versions of events in this case, which occurred during the early hours of\nChristmas Day 2015. We proceed to summarize the pertinent testimony of the witnesses in the\ncase.', 'The complaining witness, Luis Portillo (Portillo), testified that, on December 25, 2015,\nhe was listening to music and having drinks with a group of friends in the basement apartment of\na building located at 164 Regent Avenue in Providence, Rhode Island. Portillo testified that\ndefendant knocked on the basement door and asked the group to turn down the music because\n“he had children upstairs”; defendant also indicated that if the volume was not lowered, “he was\ngoing to call the police.” Portillo testified that defendant looked “bothered” when he was\nspeaking to the group and that “[h]is eyes, they were angry, and he talked really upset.” After\nthe group turned the music off, defendant then asked Portillo to move his car because it was\nparked in defendant’s designated parking space; the two walked to the parking lot together.', 'As Portillo was getting into his car, he noticed in the driver’s side mirror that defendant\nwas approaching him with a “bladed weapon” in his hand; Portillo subsequently described the\nbladed weapon as a machete. The defendant swung the machete at Portillo, who ducked and\ntried to back away. The defendant swung the machete a second time, slicing the left side of\nPortillo’s face from his left eye to his left nostril. As Portillo retreated to the basement of the\napartment building, Rafael Sanchez, Sr. (Sanchez), another tenant of 164 Regent Avenue,\nwalked into the parking lot, approached defendant, and told him to “calm down.”', 'While Portillo was cleaning his wound in the basement apartment, his friend, Steven\nFigueroa, called 911 and told the dispatcher that there was a “guy with a machete.” The\ndispatcher notified the Providence Police Department that a “male with the machete hit another', '-2-\nman in the face with the machete.”2 As they waited inside the house for the police officers to\narrive, Portillo testified, he heard defendant breaking his car windows and the basement windows\nand heard defendant yell, “Come out. Come out because I’m going to kill you.” Once the police\narrived and Portillo came outside, he noticed that his rear car window and his right rear\npassenger window had been shattered. An officer asked Portillo who had assaulted him, and\nPortillo told the officer that it was defendant. The police detained defendant, and Portillo was\nsubsequently taken to the hospital.', 'At trial, Sanchez also testified for the prosecution. He recalled that, when his girlfriend\ndropped him off at 164 Regent Avenue on December 25, 2015, Portillo’s car was parked in\ndefendant’s designated parking space. When Sanchez went to tell the group in the basement that\nthey needed to move Portillo’s car, he “realized that [Portillo] was already going to move the\ncar.” He returned to the parking lot and witnessed defendant take a machete from the trunk of\nhis vehicle and hit Portillo in the face; Sanchez yelled, “Don’t do it,” to no avail. Sanchez\nproceeded to grab Portillo, brought him inside the house “so that he wouldn’t have more\ntrouble,” and detained the group of friends in the basement so “they couldn’t go out because that\nwas just going to make more problems[.]” Sanchez testified that he also heard defendant smash\nthe car windows and the basement windows and heckle the group in the basement. Sanchez also\nwent outside and spoke to the officers when they arrived.3 Sanchez testified that, during their\ninvestigation, the officers looked around the parking lot and inside defendant’s vehicle, but they\ndid not find the machete.\n2', 'The 911 tape was played for the jury.\n3', 'Because Sanchez does not speak English, the statement that he made to the police was\ntranslated by his son’s friend.', '-3-', 'Maria Chevez (Chevez), Sanchez’s girlfriend, next testified that, at approximately\n12 a.m. on December 25, 2015, she dropped Sanchez off at 164 Regent Avenue and proceeded to\ndrop another friend at his home about five minutes away. When she returned to 164 Regent\nAvenue, she parked her car at the entrance of the driveway because her parking space was\nblocked by defendant’s vehicle. Chevez testified that, as she got out of her car, she approached\ndefendant, who had a machete in his hand and appeared “nervous.” When she asked him what\nhappened, defendant said, “Neighbor, I didn’t want to do it. I didn’t want to do it, Neighbor.”\nChevez testified that she did not say anything else to defendant, but that, as she ran up the\ndriveway, she noticed that the windows of a car were broken and that defendant’s sister was\nexiting the apartment building and appeared to be “scared.” As Chevez entered the building, she\nbegan to hear sirens and watched defendant throw the machete in the trunk of his vehicle.\nChevez then saw Sanchez coming out of the basement while “trying to keep the kids who were\ninside from going outside.” She testified that when she spotted a bloodied Portillo with Sanchez,\nshe went into the apartment building for a wet towel to help clean him. When Chevez went back\noutside, the police had arrived and defendant was inside a police cruiser. She also testified that\nshe observed the officers searching the outside area for the machete, including defendant’s\nvehicle.', 'Patrolman Kyle Richards (Officer Richards) of the Providence Police Department was on\nduty on December 25, 2015, when he responded to a call at 164 Regent Avenue. Officer\nRichards testified that when he arrived he encountered two males and a female in the driveway,\nincluding Portillo. While Officer Richards and another Providence police officer were speaking\nwith Portillo, defendant came from behind the apartment building “yelling in Spanish” and “kind\nof frantic.” After Portillo told the officers what occurred, Officer Richards immediately placed\ndefendant in custody; Officer Richards testified that defendant was not bleeding, nor did he', '-4-\nappear to have any injuries. After defendant was placed in the police cruiser, the officers\nsearched the area surrounding the apartment building for the machete, but it was not located.', 'After the state rested its case, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal, which the\ntrial justice denied. The defense presented Stacy Rosario (Rosario), who also resided at 164\nRegent Avenue on December 25, 2015. Rosario’s account of what happened markedly differed\nfrom that of the state’s witnesses. She testified that defendant woke her by knocking on her\ndoor, at approximately 1:30 a.m., to ask if her car was parked in his parking space, to which she\nresponded in the negative and told him that it was probably a person from downstairs because\nthey usually “take my parking” space. When defendant walked downstairs, Rosario testified, she\nheard people arguing about defendant’s parking space.', 'She then went to a window that\noverlooked the parking lot and observed defendant and “three or four boys” arguing with him.\nShe testified that one of the boys got closer and closer to defendant and eventually pushed him.\nIn response, defendant punched the boy in the face and the boy fell to the ground. The boy,\nwhose face was bleeding, stood up with the aid of his friends and went back to the basement.', 'According to Rosario, she then went downstairs because, as someone who works in the\nmedical field, “that’s something that you do naturally[.]” As she made her way outside to the\nparking lot, she encountered defendant’s sister; however, she did not see Sanchez, who, she\ntestified, was not outside when the boy was punched and did not accompany the boy to the\nbasement. She did, however, observe defendant break the windows of a car with his bare hands.\nRosario testified that she attempted to calm defendant. At this point, according to Rosario,\nSanchez appeared and she told him what happened. When asked whether she saw a machete in\ndefendant’s possession, she responded, “No, I didn’t.” She also confirmed that the officers\nlooked in the backyard at 164 Regent Avenue and opened the door to defendant’s vehicle, but\ndid not locate a weapon.', '-5-', 'The defendant also called his sister, Jelen Najera, to testify.4 According to her testimony,\nit was between 2 and 3 a.m. when defendant arrived home and there was a car in his parking\nspace. She recalled that he first went upstairs to see if it was a second-floor tenant’s car, then he\nwent to the basement to see if the car belonged to anyone down there. Although she could hear\narguing, Jelen testified, she could not discern what was being said. She then observed defendant\ncome upstairs from the basement and walk out to the parking lot, followed by three men.', 'Jelen testified that, once everyone arrived in the parking lot, one of the men pushed\ndefendant “in the throat.” Jelen testified that, in response, defendant “slapped” the man, who fell\nto the ground, “[a]nd that’s where he got cut.” The other men helped the injured man inside the\nhouse; Jelen noticed that the man who fell was bleeding from his face. She also noticed that two\nfemale neighbors from upstairs were standing in the parking lot as the police officers arrived.\nNext, Jelen testified that defendant “was furious and broke the car windows * * * [w]ith a fist.”\nShe testified that she never saw defendant with a machete in his hands, but that she observed that\nhis hands were “bleeding all over” after he broke the car windows. Jelen recalled that the\nofficers took defendant into custody but failed to take any statements from Jelen or her female\nneighbors.', 'The defendant testified last and repeated much of Rosario and Jelen’s testimony.\nAccording to defendant, at approximately 2 a.m. on December 25, 2015, he arrived at\n164 Regent Avenue and discovered that an unknown car was parked in his parking space. The\ndefendant testified that he first went to the second floor of the apartment building and knocked\non his neighbor’s door to ask about the vehicle. His neighbor told him that he should go ask the\ntenants who lived on the first floor or those who lived in the basement. The defendant testified\nthat he went to the basement because he heard some music; and, when he knocked on the\n4', 'For clarity, we refer to Jelen by her first name; we intend no disrespect by doing so.', '-6-\nbasement door, defendant testified, he first asked the group in the basement to lower the music\nbecause he was going to rest; he testified that the group of people “were bothered” by his request\nand began arguing with him. The defendant testified that he told the group that “if they didn’t\ncalm down that I was going to call the police[,]” and then asked that the car be moved.', 'The defendant testified that he went out to the parking lot to wait; after a couple of\nminutes, three men came out and continued to argue with him. The defendant testified that one\nof the men pushed him and, in response, he hit the man with his fist; the man “fell hard” to the\npavement. The defendant testified that his sister told him to “calm down[,]” and the two other\nmen picked up their friend, whose face was bleeding, and took him back to the basement. While\nthe group retreated to the basement, defendant stayed outside because he was “very angry” and\nyelled at the group to “come outside.” When they did not exit the building, defendant testified,\nhe punched two car windows so hard that the windows broke. While defendant was breaking the\ncar windows, he testified, his sister and his two female neighbors were also outside standing\nbehind him in the parking lot.', 'According to defendant, when the police arrived, one officer went inside the building,\nwhile the other officer remained outside with him. A few minutes later, the first police officer\nexited the apartment building with a group of people from the basement, who pointed to\ndefendant as the person causing the problem. The defendant testified that the police officers:\n“grabbed me by my hands, they put my hands back, and they arrested me.” Contrary to Officer\nRichards’ testimony, however, defendant testified that his “right hand was bleeding a lot.” He\nalso testified that the officers took the key to his vehicle and searched it “[f]or about five\nminutes.” When asked by his counsel whether he attacked anyone with a machete that evening,\ndefendant replied in the negative and stated that he did not own a machete.', '-7-', 'The jury returned a verdict of guilty on both counts, and on November 29, 2017,\ndefendant’s motion for a new trial was heard and denied. Thereafter, defendant was sentenced to\nthree years at the Adult Correctional Institutions, with one year to serve and two years\nsuspended, with probation, on count one; and one year suspended, with probation, on count two.\nThe defendant timely appealed.', 'Standard of Review', 'When this Court reviews a motion for a new trial, we accord “great weight to a trial\njustice’s ruling” when that justice “articulated sufficient reasoning in support of the ruling.”\nState v. Kizekai, 19 A.3d 583, 589 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Guerra, 12 A.3d 759, 766 (R.I.\n2011)). “As long as ‘the trial justice has complied with this procedure and articulated adequate\nreasons for denying the motion, his or her decision will be given great weight and left\nundisturbed unless the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence or otherwise\nwas clearly wrong.’” State v. Phannavong, 21 A.3d 321, 325 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v.\nPeoples, 996 A.2d 660, 664 (R.I. 2010)).', 'Analysis', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice clearly erred when he denied\ndefendant’s motion for a new trial because, according to defendant, the verdict was against the\nweight of the evidence. The defendant also contends that the trial justice erred by relying on his\nown opinion about the nature of the injury defendant inflicted on Portillo and concluded that it\nwas consistent with a blade from a sharp instrument. The defendant argues that this observation\nwas beyond the knowledge of a layperson and not supported by medical evidence. Because we\ndeem this argument without merit, we summarily reject it.', 'Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure provides, in pertinent part,\nthat “the court may grant a new trial to [a] defendant if required in the interest of justice.” When', '-8-\na trial justice considers whether a verdict is against the weight of the evidence, “the trial justice\n[must] place ‘himself or herself in the role of a thirteenth juror and then exercise his or her\nindependent judgment as to the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence.’”\nState v. Rainey, 175 A.3d 1169, 1189 (R.I. 2018) (brackets omitted) (quoting State v. Grantley,\n149 A.3d 124, 131 (R.I. 2016)). “Specifically, ‘the trial justice must (1) consider the evidence in\nlight of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight\nof the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different\nfrom that reached by the jury.’” State v. Heredia, 10 A.3d 443, 446 (R.I. 2010) (quoting State v.\nTexieira, 944 A.2d 132, 140 (R.I. 2008)). “If, after conducting this independent review, the trial\njustice agrees with the jury’s verdict or if the evidence is such that reasonable minds could differ\nas to the outcome, the motion for a new trial should be denied.” State v. Perkins, 966 A.2d 1257,\n1260 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. Cerda, 957 A.2d 382, 385 (R.I. 2008)).', '“Conversely,\nhowever, if the trial justice finds that the state did not sustain its burden, then a new trial must be\nordered.” Peoples, 996 A.2d at 666.', 'In the case at bar, we are of the opinion that the trial justice summarized in great detail\nwhat he described as the credible evidence presented in this case. Specifically, in denying\ndefendant’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice independently assessed the credibility of each\nwitness. Beginning with Portillo, the trial justice noted that he found him “to be a credible\nwitness. * * * I believe that he truly related how this happened, how this assault occurred, and I\nfound his testimony as to how the assault occurred and the Defendant’s use of a machete to be\ncredible.” In addition, the trial justice found Sanchez and Chevez to be credible witnesses,\nstating: “Both corroborate Mr. Portillo’s version of events, and I believe their testimony * * *\n[i]n all essential respects was reasonably consistent.”', '-9-', 'Alternatively, turning to defendant’s credibility as a witness, the trial justice found\ndefendant and his witnesses to lack credibility. Specifically, the trial justice stated:', '“I don’t believe the defendant or his witnesses. I don’t believe the', 'witnesses saw what occurred, frankly. I think they were both inside', 'at the time of the assault, and if they came outside at all, it was', 'during the aftermath following the assault.', '“Frankly, to accept the Defendant’s version of events, I would', 'have to conclude that the use of the machete or of a machete, was a', 'total fabrication concocted from the very outset by Portillo, by', 'Steven Figueroa, who referred to it when he called 9-1-1, and then', 'confirmed by witnesses, Rafael Sanchez and Maria Chevez. I', 'don’t buy that, and neither did the Jury. Also, I feel supporting the', 'Jury’s conclusion in this case that the injury to Mr. Portillo was', 'consistent with being caused by a sharp object; for example, a', 'blade, and it’s not consistent with having been suffered as a result', 'or caused by a punch or by striking his side of his face on the', 'ground.”\nThe trial justice also took issue with defendant’s claim that he shattered Portillo’s car windows\nwith his hands, because Officer Richards did not observe any injuries or blood on defendant’s\nhands and it was “very unlikely that one could reap that kind of damage to a car’s windows with\nhis bare hands.” Finally, the trial justice decided that speculation as to what may have happened\nto the machete did not change his conclusion that “this happened as Mr. Portillo described[.]”\nThe trial justice agreed with the jury’s conclusion that a machete was involved, thus supplying\nthe essential element of the use of a dangerous weapon for count one. He also concluded that\ndefendant was the aggressor, especially given defendant’s admission that he broke the windows\nof Portillo’s car; accordingly, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'After a careful review of the trial testimony and of the decision denying the motion for a\nnew trial, we are satisfied that the trial justice “articulated adequate grounds for denying the\nmotion[.]” Grantley, 149 A.3d at 131 (quoting State v. Florez, 138 A.3d 789, 793 (R.I. 2016)).\nClearly, as summarized in this decision, the trial justice carefully reviewed the testimony and', '- 10 -\nweighed the evidence before him. He specifically noted the shortcomings and inconsistencies of\ncertain witnesses, but he ultimately concluded, based on his own credibility determinations, that\nthe weight of the evidence supported guilty verdicts as to both counts. The trial justice passed\nupon the credibility of Portillo, Sanchez, and Chevez, and found those witnesses to be quite\ncredible; at the same time, he found defendant and his witnesses to be lacking in credibility—\nfindings to which this Court accords great deference. See State v. Giard, 155 A.3d 1193, 1200\n(R.I. 2017) (“It is noteworthy that we ‘accord deference to the credibility determinations of the\nhearing justice,’ because ‘we do not have the same vantage point as him or her, and we are\nunable to assess the witness’ demeanor, tone of voice, and body language.’”) (brackets and\ninternal citation omitted) (quoting first State v.

Gregory Sion, a supervisor in the Providence Police\nDepartment’s narcotics unit, was operating an unmarked car on patrol in the north end of the\ncity. As Sgt. Sion was traveling east on Ledge Street, he “observed two vehicles approaching\n[him] at a high rate of speed.” One of those vehicles was a silver SUV bearing Massachusetts\nlicense plates, and the other vehicle had New York license plates. It appeared to Sgt. Sion that\nthe silver SUV was chasing the vehicle with New York plates and, as the two vehicles\napproached him, the silver SUV veered across the center of the road and into Sgt. Sion’s lane of\ntravel. Sergeant Sion said that, to avoid a collision, he “had to swerve to the right to get out of\n[the silver SUV’s] way,” causing the right-front wheel of the police vehicle to go up onto the\nsidewalk. In response, Sgt. Sion quickly executed a U-turn in an attempt to follow the two\nvehicles. He said that he initially lost sight of both vehicles but, with the aid of a passerby who\nwas walking his dog, he quickly located the vehicles near 33 Marietta Street. By the time Sgt.\nSion came upon the vehicles, both were unoccupied.', 'Using his police radio, Sgt. Sion alerted the six other members of his narcotics squad\nabout the incident that had occurred on Ledge Street, which he described as “a road rage type of\nincident.” While Sgt. Sion had been driving around the block to see if he could locate the drivers\nof the two vehicles, Det. John Bento and his partner Det. Leo Pichs, both of the Providence\nPolice Department’s narcotics unit, drove to Marietta Street and parked their unmarked police', '-2-\nvehicle approximately halfway down the street, facing towards Charles Street. Shortly after\narriving at Marietta Street, Det. Bento saw the silver SUV “pull out of the parking lot of 33\nMarietta” and come towards him. Detective Bento alerted Sgt. Sion that the silver SUV had\npulled out onto Marietta Street.', 'Soon, Sgt. Sion positioned his car behind the silver SUV, and Detectives Bento and Pichs\nwere in front of the car. Sergeant Sion observed a lone male driver in the silver SUV, who\nappeared to be the same person who was driving the car when it ran Sgt. Sion off the road. He\nthen ordered Detectives Bento and Pichs “to move in.” Detectives Bento and Pichs got out of\ntheir vehicle and approached the driver of the silver SUV, which was being driven by defendant,\nJosé Angeles.', 'There is conflicting testimony about what happened after the police “boxed in” the silver\nSUV. According to the testimony of Sgt. Sion and Det. Bento, the emergency lights on Det.\nBento’s vehicle were activated, and Detectives Bento and Pichs, who were in plainclothes,\nverbally identified themselves as police officers, and Det. Pichs’ badge was clearly visible.\nSeveral eyewitnesses, however, testified that the police did not turn on their emergency lights nor\ndid they identify themselves as they approached the silver SUV.

Sion’s vehicle, and proceeded to drive back and forth,\nramming into both Det. Bento’s vehicle and Sgt. Sion’s vehicle repeatedly until he had enough\nroom to escape. The defendant drove the silver SUV onto the sidewalk towards Det. Bento, at\nwhich point Sgt. Sion drew his service pistol and at “point blank range shot the left rear tire of', '-3-\nthe vehicle in hopes that it would somehow disable the vehicle from running down [Det.]\nBento.” However, Det. Bento was struck 2 and defendant fled the scene. A high speed chase\nensued.', 'The chase soon ended after defendant crashed into a parked car and lost control of the\nSUV, which went down a driveway, and ultimately through a yard and into a fence. The\ndefendant fled on foot, but the police quickly apprehended him. Officer Andres Perez, who at\nthe time of this incident was a detective in the Providence Police Department’s narcotics unit,\nparticipated in the pursuit and capture of defendant. After defendant was taken into custody,\nOfficer Perez returned to the abandoned SUV to see “if there was any evidence left there.” As it\nturned out, Officer Perez “seized [from the driver’s side floor] a clear plastic bag, and that clear\nplastic bag contained nine individually wrapped bags of suspected crack cocaine.”', 'The state filed a criminal information, charging defendant with the offenses enumerated\nearlier in this opinion. Before trial, defendant filed a motion to suppress the seized bag of\ncocaine, alleging that the police lacked probable cause to stop his vehicle or to arrest him, and\nthat the cocaine had been seized illegally. After a hearing on the issue, the trial justice denied\ndefendant’s motion. 3', 'During defendant’s jury trial, several references were made, especially during\ndefendant’s cross-examination of the police witnesses, about whether the cocaine that Officer\nPerez seized from the silver SUV had been in plain view, and whether the police had probable\ncause or a warrant allowing them to search the vehicle.

The trial justice did not err when he told the jury that\n“when reference was made to a hearing that occurred about six weeks or almost two months ago,\nthat was a hearing held before me to decide those particular issues * * *.” Even if his choice of\nwords was somewhat inartful, the trial justice did not disclose how, or even if, he had decided the\nissue. The defendant, however, would have us believe that this comment would lead a juror to', '-6-\nconclude that the trial justice had ruled in favor of the state because evidence of the seizure was\nadmitted, and then that juror would make the additional leap to believe that, because the trial\njustice sided with the state on that evidentiary issue, the trial justice must also be siding with the\nstate on other issues. We do not accept that argument. Trial justices make evidentiary decisions\nmany times throughout the course of a trial, and the mere fact that a trial justice admits or\nexcludes a piece of evidence is simply not a ground to believe that the trial justice is then biased\ntowards one party over another.', 'We hold that the trial justice’s jury instructions were acceptable. Indeed, the challenged\nportion of the jury instructions is but one paragraph amid twenty-three pages of transcript that\nmake up the jury instructions in this case. When we consider the challenged paragraph within\nthe context of the entire instruction, as we must, we see nothing that would be difficult for a\nperson of ordinary intelligence to understand.

It was not until\nBryant’s son Jarell returned home from school and noticed that his Nintendo Wii gaming console\nwas missing that Bryant realized that something was wrong. Upon further inspection, Bryant\ndiscovered that the dresser drawers in her second-floor bedroom were open; her jewelry boxes\nand a teapot in which she stashed coins were empty; a diamond necklace and other jewelry were\nmissing from her bedroom closet; and a computer and digital coin bank were nowhere to be\nfound. Essence, now home from school, noticed that her brother Oginga’s bedroom door was\najar, even though the door usually remained closed when he was away at college. Looking\ninside Oginga’s bedroom, located at the ground level, Essence found the window open and the\nbed pushed out from its usual spot against the window. Bryant called 9-1-1 and reported a\nbreak-in.', 'Several officers from the Johnston police department responded to the dispatch.\nDetective Raymond Peters (Det. Peters) of the department’s forensic unit took photographs and\ndusted the scene for fingerprints. The detective recovered fingerprint evidence from the window\nin Oginga’s bedroom, Bryant’s jewelry box, the door handle to her bedroom closet, and from\nother areas throughout the home. For the purpose of determining which fingerprints belonged to\npersons rightfully on the premises—and to eliminate them from the investigation—Det. Peters\nalso obtained fingerprints from Bryant and her daughter Imani. Photographs of fingerprint\nevidence were sent to the State of Rhode Island Crime Laboratory at the University of Rhode\n1', 'For the purpose of clarity, we refer to Bryant’s children by their first names. We intend no\ndisrespect.', '-2-\nIsland (crime lab) where they were analyzed by Edward Downing, Jr. (Downing), a fingerprint\nexpert and fifteen-year veteran of the crime lab.', 'Downing determined that four of the twenty images were clear enough to warrant greater\nattention. After concluding that certain fingerprints extracted from Oginga’s bedroom window\ncame from an unknown source, he searched a database known as the Automated Fingerprint\nIdentification System (AFIS) to identify a potential match. From the three and a half million\nfingerprints contained in the database, Downing’s search returned the name “Curtis M. Isom,”\nborn on January 4, 1959, as the closest potential match.2 Downing then manually compared the\nleft index fingerprint exemplar displayed on a fingerprint card attributed to “Curtis M. Isom”\nside-by-side with the photograph of the fingerprint from the window.', 'By way of expert\ntestimony, Downing opined that the exemplar and the latent fingerprint from the window\noriginated from a common source. He also concluded that another latent fingerprint—a left\nthumbprint—extracted from Bryant’s jewelry box matched another exemplar on the AFIS-\ngenerated fingerprint card ascribed to “Curtis M. Isom.”3\n2', 'In addition to listing “Curtis M. Isom” as the number-one possible match, AFIS also returned\nforty-nine other exemplars from fingerprint cards, taken from other individuals, as possible\nmatches.\n3', 'Detective Peters testified at trial that he did not record which of the four fingerprints were\nrecovered from which item. But based on his recollection, Det. Peters testified that the\nphotograph he marked as “35”—which contained an image of a fingerprint that Downing\nidentified as a likely match to defendant’s left thumbprint—came from the jewelry box. He\nfurther recalled that the image labeled “52” was a photograph of the fingerprint he found on the\nwindow, and Downing testified that that fingerprint was consistent with defendant’s left index\nfingerprint. As for the remaining two fingerprints prompting further inspection by Downing,\nDet. Peters testified at trial that they came from the door handle to Bryant’s bedroom closet and\nthe television in the living room. Downing determined that one fingerprint belonged to Imani\nand the other originated from an unknown source. Neither he nor Det. Peters indicated at trial\nwhich fingerprint came from which item.', '-3-', 'Johnston police detectives shared the results with Bryant and asked her if she knew a\n“Curtis Isom.” Indeed, she did. A man with that name—defendant—is the father of Bryant’s\nnephew, Marcus. The defendant also has the same date of birth as that listed on the fingerprint\ncard: January 4, 1959.4 Four months earlier, in December 2010, defendant and Marcus had\nvisited Bryant’s home. Although defendant had visited Bryant and her family in their previous\napartment, it was the first time he had been to this particular residence. The visit lasted no more\nthan fifteen minutes, during which defendant remained in the foyer and in the living room. To\nBryant’s knowledge, defendant had not returned since.', 'The defendant subsequently was charged with breaking and entering in violation of\nG.L. 1956 § 11-8-2. Trial was held in the Providence County Superior Court on January 13 and\n15, 2014. The state presented several witnesses, including Oginga, Bryant, Det. Peters, and\nDowning. Because Downing was the state’s key witness and because defendant argues on\nappeal that the trial justice erred by restricting the scope of his cross-examination of Downing,\nwe recount his testimony in some detail.', 'During the state’s direct examination of Downing, the fingerprint expert explained the\nmethodology he employed when comparing known and latent prints.5 Downing testified that his\npractice is to inspect the fingerprints initially for “basically similar shapes[ and] the general flow\nof [the] lines,” and then focus on “the more minute details,” such as “ending ridges, bifurcations,\nor small dots.” He explained that ending ridges are noncontinuous lines within a fingerprint that\nbreak or end abruptly. Downing further described bifurcation on cross-examination as “one\n4', 'The defendant’s birthdate was not in dispute at trial.\n5', 'A latent fingerprint is a fingerprint found at the crime scene.

Downing testified that a mark within that fingerprint “appears to be\na bifurcation or an ending ridge. You can’t always tell which is which.” The following\nexchange ensued:', '“Q', '* * * [I]s it possible that in one [fingerprint] impression, * * * what', 'appears as a bifurcation or ridge ending may actually be something', 'else in an inked print?', '“A', 'Yes, sir.', '“Q', '* * * [A]nd it’s important when you’re looking at a latent or partial', 'print to know whether you are looking at a bifurcation or ridge', 'ending, correct?', '“A', 'It would be of assistance, yes.', '“* * *', '“Q', 'But if you * * * can’t tell whether a characteristic is a ridge ending', 'or a bifurcation in the latent, there is a chance of making a mistake,', 'right?”\nThe court sustained the state’s objection to the question. Defense counsel then asked: “Is it\npossible you could make a mistake because you can’t tell whether or not something is a ridge\nending or a bifurcation?” After the court again sustained the state’s objection, defense counsel\npursued a new line of questioning. At another point during cross-examination, the defense\nsought to ask Downing about the impact of a recent high-profile investigation conducted by the', '-5-\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on the field of fingerprint analysis. Sustaining the state’s\nobjection, the trial justice disallowed the question.', 'Also on cross-examination, Downing acknowledged that his analysis was limited to\ncomparing the AFIS card attributed to “Curtis M. Isom” with the photograph of the latent\nfingerprint found in the Bryant home. He had not been provided with fingerprints obtained from\ndefendant after his arrest.', 'The state also presented former Det. Mary Ann Pimental (Det. Pimental) of the Johnston\npolice department, who testified that she had arraigned a man named Curtis Isom in the District\nCourt on July 13, 2011, for the crime on trial and that his birthdate was January 4, 1959.6\nDetective Pimental indicated that she had ordered that personnel from the Bureau of Criminal\nIdentification take defendant’s fingerprints after the arraignment, but she had no personal\nknowledge as to whether this task was completed.', 'At trial, the state did not introduce\nfingerprints taken from defendant after his arrest in July 2011, nor did any witness with personal\nknowledge testify that the fingerprints attributed to “Curtis M. Isom” belonged to defendant.7', 'After the state rested, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal, which the trial justice\ndenied. The defendant did not present a case.

This timely appeal followed.', 'Discussion', 'I. Denial of Motion for a Judgment of Acquittal', ""On appeal, defendant first claims that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a\njudgment of acquittal. Our review of the denial of a motion for a judgment of acquittal is\ngoverned by the same standard applied by the trial justice. State v. Rodriguez, 996 A.2d 145,\n148 (R.I. 2010). Accordingly, this Court “must view the evidence in the light most favorable to\nthe state, * * * giving full credibility to the state's witnesses, and draw therefrom all reasonable\ninferences consistent with guilt.” Id. (quoting State v. Ros, 973 A.2d 1148, 1159 (R.I. 2009)).\nThe defendant may prevail on a motion for a judgment of acquittal “only if the evidence, viewed\nin the light most favorable to the prosecution, is insufficient to establish the defendant’s guilt\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.” State v. Armour, 110 A.3d 1195, 1203 (R.I. 2015) (quoting State v.\nLong, 61 A.3d 439, 445 (R.I. 2013)). The case against the defendant will survive, however,\nupon the determination that “a reasonable juror could find the defendant guilty beyond a\nreasonable doubt.”"", 'Id. (quoting Long, 61 A.3d at 445).', 'As we previously have held,\n“circumstantial evidence, including fingerprint evidence, may be sufficient to support a\nconviction * * * ‘as long as the totality of the circumstantial evidence presented to the finder of\nfact constitutes proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.’” State v. Rodriguez, 798 A.2d 435,\n437 (R.I. 2002) (quoting State v. Otero, 788 A.2d 469, 473 (R.I. 2002)).', 'The gravamen of defendant’s appeal from the denial of his motion for a judgment of\nacquittal is his contention that the state failed to establish “that the AFIS-generated exemplars to', '-7-\nwhich the [latent fingerprints] were matched[] actually belonged to * * * Isom” and that the\nabsence of such evidence amounts to a “gap in proof.” In support of this claim, defendant points\nto cross-examination testimony from Downing, the fingerprint expert, that he lacked personal\nknowledge of whether the fingerprints on the fingerprint card returned from AFIS were in fact\ndefendant’s fingerprints. The defendant further cites the acknowledgment by Downing that\nneither he nor the police had obtained fingerprints from defendant during the course of the\ninvestigation.', 'These arguments do not help defendant, however, because they relate to the\nweight of the evidence and not its legal sufficiency.', 'In Sansom v. State, 562 N.E.2d 58 (Ind. Ct. App. 1990), a similar issue arose when the\ndefendant in that case argued that there was insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction of\nburglary because the police had matched latent fingerprints recovered from the crime scene only\nto a fingerprint card on file that was attributed to a man with the same name and birthdate as the\ndefendant. Id. at 59, 60. The prosecution did not present direct evidence that the fingerprints on\nthe card had belonged to the defendant. Id. at 59. Other information contained on the card,\nincluding hair and eye color, height, place of birth, and distinctive marks, also closely matched\nthe defendant. Id. The court concluded that, based on the similarities, the jury could reasonably\ninfer that the exemplars on the fingerprint card belonged to the defendant. Id. at 60.', 'In this case, there was evidence that latent fingerprints found both on the window—the\nsuspected point of entry—and the jewelry box from which items were missing matched an\nexemplar attributed to one “Curtis M. Isom” with a birthdate of January 4, 1959. The defendant\nin this case was named Curtis Isom, and the state introduced evidence that he had the same date\nof birth. Further, unlike in Sansom, there was testimony that defendant was known to Bryant\nand her family and that he previously had been in the home, but not in the area where the latent', '-8-\nfingerprints were found.', 'From the facts that defendant, Curtis Isom, was known to the\ncomplainant in this case, had been in the home on a previous occasion, and had the same date of\nbirth as the “Curtis M. Isom” whose fingerprints matched those recovered at the scene, a\nreasonable jury could conclude that defendant was the perpetrator of the crime on trial.', 'Although the investigation by the Johnston police department could have been more\ncomprehensive—including the establishment of a link between defendant’s fingerprints and the\nlatent fingerprints—we cannot conclude that the evidence was legally insufficient to give rise to\na judgment of acquittal. Viewing the evidence—the identical date of birth and defendant’s\nconnection to the home—in the light most favorable to the state, we are satisfied that there was\nsufficient evidence to connect the exemplars from the fingerprint card to defendant.', 'II. Cross-Examination of Fingerprint Expert', 'The defendant also argues on appeal that the court deprived him of his right to a full and\nfair cross-examination of Downing. The right of a criminal defendant to be confronted by\nwitnesses against him is ingrained both within the Sixth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution8 and the Declaration of Rights, article 1, section 10 of the Rhode Island\nConstitution.', '“Embodied in this guarantee is a defendant’s right to cross-examine the\nprosecution’s witnesses * * *.” State v.

However, “the right to cross-examination is not\nunlimited and does not include an absolute right to ask any and every question that the defendant\nmay desire.” State v. Werner, 831 A.2d 183, 209 (R.I. 2003). “Once there has been ‘sufficient\ncross-examination to satisfy a defendant’s constitutional confrontation rights,’” State v.\nManning, 973 A.2d 524, 531 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. Brown, 709 A.2d 465, 473 (R.I.\n8', 'See Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400, 403 (1965) (incorporating the Sixth Amendment to the\nstates through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment).', '-9-\n1998)), the trial justice may, in the exercise of sound discretion, “limit cross-examination on the\nbasis of concerns of witness harassment, jury prejudice, confusion of the issues, the witness’s\nsafety, or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.” State v. Wiley, 676 A.2d\n321, 324 (R.I. 1996); see also Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 679 (1986). This Court\nwill not “disturb such a limitation absent a clear abuse of discretion ‘and then only when such\nabuse constitutes prejudicial error.’” Brown, 709 A.2d at 473 (quoting State v. Anthony, 422\nA.2d 921, 924 (R.I. 1980)).', 'The defendant attacks the restriction of his cross-examination of Downing on two fronts.\nFirst, he argues that the trial justice erroneously prevented him from asking the fingerprint expert\nabout possible inaccuracies that could arise from misidentifying ridge endings and bifurcations.\nSpecifically, the court did not permit him to ask about the “chance of making a mistake” or\nwhether it is possible “you could make a mistake.” The trial justice sustained the state’s question\nbecause it called for speculation, and it was within his sound discretion to do so. See, e.g., State\nv. Rivera, 987 A.2d 887, 906 (R.I. 2010) (finding no abuse of discretion when trial court limited\nquestion that called for speculation).', 'The defendant wages a second line of attack on the refusal of the trial justice to allow a\nquestion about the impact of a recent high-profile FBI investigation on procedures employed in\nthe fingerprint-analysis field. Defense counsel had asked Downing, “Are you familiar with what\nis known as the Mayfield case?,” and the fingerprint expert answered affirmatively. The trial\njustice sustained the state’s objection to the next question: “And evaluating and guarding against', '- 10 -\nthe errors that the FBI made in the Mayfield case * * * [h]as been a driving force in the\nfingerprint community for years, right?”9', 'According to defendant, because of Mayfield, there have been major reforms in the field\nof fingerprint analysis, to the extent that he should have been entitled to inquire whether\nDowning followed post-Mayfield procedures.', 'However, the impact of a particular FBI\ninvestigation on the entire field of fingerprint analysis was irrelevant to the prosecution in this\ncase. Neither the errors made by the FBI nor the historical evolution of the fingerprint-analysis\nfield had bearing on the methodology followed in this particular case or on Downing’s\nconclusion that the latent and known fingerprints originated from the same source. See, e.g.,\nWerner, 831 A.2d at 209, 210 (affirming trial justice’s decision to preclude, on the grounds of\nrelevance, the defendant’s questions on cross-examination regarding procedures employed by the\npolice department when booking another individual).', 'We further reject defendant’s assertion that the preclusion of this line of questioning\ninterfered with his attempts to impeach the state’s star witness. To the contrary, defendant was\nafforded substantial leeway to question Downing about the overall reliability of fingerprint\nevidence and the procedures he followed. The defendant elicited testimony from Downing on\ncross-examination that fingerprint analysis is not foolproof and that “[e]rrors have occurred in\n9', 'The “Mayfield case” arose in 2004 when Spanish investigators recovered latent fingerprints\nfrom a bag containing explosive detonators, which was found near the site of a bombing in\nMadrid, Spain.

A search of the\nFBI’s fingerprint database returned the fingerprints of Brandon Mayfield, an American Muslim\nattorney, and nineteen other individuals as possible matches. Id. Multiple fingerprint specialists\nconcluded that a latent fingerprint matched an exemplar originating from Mayfield, which led\nFBI agents to assert in an affidavit that they had made a “100% positive identification.” Id. at\n966, 967.

Denial of Motion for a New Trial', 'The defendant’s final assignment of error is the denial of his motion for a new trial.10 In\nsupport of his argument on appeal, defendant points to the lack of direct evidence tying the\nexemplars found on the fingerprint card to him, purportedly inconsistent testimony between\nBryant and Oginga, and the likelihood that a man of his age could climb through the basement\nwindow in the manner the perpetrator purportedly had. The defendant also attacks the quality of\nthe latent fingerprints, the failure of the police to document the items from which they were\nobtained, and the overall reliability of fingerprint evidence.', 'When passing on a motion for a new trial based on the weight of the evidence, the trial\njustice “sits as the legendary thirteenth juror[,] and, in light of the charge to the jury, must\nexercise his or her independent judgment in weighing the evidence and assessing the credibility\nof the witnesses.” State v. Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 569 (R.I. 2009). The motion must be denied\n“[i]f the trial justice agrees with the jury’s verdict or finds that the evidence is such that\nreasonable minds could differ as to the outcome * * *.” Id. This Court will give “great weight”\n10', 'We note that defense counsel twice unequivocally stated at the hearing on the motion for a\nnew trial that he based the motion on a sufficiency-of-the-evidence argument. On appeal,\ndefendant contends that his attorney was mistaken and should have stated that he was moving for\na new trial based both on the weight of the evidence and its sufficiency. The defendant asserts\nthat, notwithstanding his attorney’s error, he argued both legal sufficiency and weight in the\ncourt below, and that the trial justice addressed both in his decision. Because the trial justice\nindeed did discuss the weight of the evidence among his findings in denying the motion for a\nnew trial and because the state had adequate opportunity to respond to the weight-of-the-\nevidence argument at the time it was presented below, we are satisfied that this issue was\npreserved for our review. Cf. State v. Burke, 522 A.2d 725, 731 (R.I. 1987) (noting that the\nreason for deeming issues unpreserved is to “serve judicial economy by encouraging resolution\nof issues at the trial level * * * [and to] promote[] fairer and more efficient trial proceedings by\nproviding opposing counsel with an opportunity to respond appropriately to claims raised”).', '- 12 -\nto the ruling as long as the trial justice sufficiently explained his or her rationale for denying the\nmotion. Id.', 'In ruling on the motion, the trial justice set forth his reasons for denying the new trial. He\ncredited the testimony of Bryant, Oginga, Downing, and Det. Peters, and, unlike the defendant,\nfound Bryant’s and Oginga’s testimony to be mutually corroborative.', 'After painstakingly\nrecounting the evidence adduced at trial, the trial justice stated that the open window and\nposition of the bed in Oginga’s bedroom led to the “inescapable conclusion” that the perpetrator\nhad gained entry through that ground-floor window. The trial justice indicated that he was\n“satisfied” that the latent fingerprints on the jewelry box belonged to the defendant, and he\nconcluded that the existence of such fingerprints “establish beyond a reasonable doubt that it was\nthe defendant who was the individual who broke into her apartment on March 28, 2011.” We are\nof the opinion that the trial justice performed the requisite analysis and provided an adequate\nrationale for denying the defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'We discern no grounds for\ndisturbing that decision.', 'Conclusion', 'Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of conviction of the Superior Court and return the\npapers to the Superior Court.', '- 13 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S', 'OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet\nTITLE OF CASE:', 'State v.

Before this Court is an appeal from a judgment of\nconviction adjudicating the defendant Alfred Bishop guilty of (1) first-degree murder, pursuant\nto G.L. 1956 § 11-23-1; (2) burglary, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 11-8-1; (3) three counts of using a\nfirearm while committing a crime of violence, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 11-47-3.2; and (4) two\ncounts of assault with a dangerous weapon, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2. In May 2009, he\nwas sentenced to life without parole on the murder conviction, and he was sentenced to\nsignificant further incarceration on the other counts. Bishop filed a motion for new trial, but the\nmotion was denied by the trial justice. Bishop now appeals from the judgment of conviction,\narguing that the trial justice erred in refusing to admit evidence about the alleged intoxication\nand drug possession of certain witnesses for the state and in allowing what he contends was\nextremely prejudicial information about Bishop’s parole status into evidence. For the reasons set\nforth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'A', 'Background', '1', 'Underlying Home Invasion', 'The dramatic and ultimately fatal series of events giving rise to the charges against\nBishop began to unfold on June 27, 2007. Ceasar and Claire Medeiros, husband and wife, lived\nin Warwick with Ceasar’s brother, Gabriel, and a pet dog. 1 On the night of June 27, 2007, at\naround midnight, Ceasar and Claire were awakened by the sound of their dog barking. Ceasar\nsaid he got out of bed to investigate, while Claire remained in bed. He went out to the darkened\nhallway and saw a masked figure holding a shiny object in his hand. Ceasar pleaded with the\nintruder to not hurt his family and told the intruder that there was money and jewelry in the\nbedroom. Ceasar returned to the bedroom, and, when he noticed that the intruder had not\nfollowed him, he grabbed a golf club and went back to the hallway, where he proceeded to\nclobber the intruder with a blow to the head—a blow so strong that the head of the golf club\nseparated from the shaft. Ceasar continued to strike the intruder with the shaft of the golf club,\nand he also began to kick him. During the ensuring fierce struggle, a firearm discharged.', 'Claire testified that she came out of the bedroom and turned on the hallway light for a\nfew seconds so that she could see what was going on. By this time, and as a result of the\nconfrontation with Ceasar, the intruder’s ski mask had become partially dislodged. Both Claire\nand Ceasar later testified that they were able to view the intruder’s face. Claire turned off the\n1', 'Throughout this decision, we refer to some individuals by their first name. This is for the\npurpose of clarity only, and we intend no disrespect.', '-2-\nhallway light, ran to a spare bedroom to get a phone, went back to her bedroom, and called the 9-\n1-1 emergency system for help.', 'According to Ceasar, the intruder then retreated into the kitchen, which, by this time, had\nbeen illuminated by Gabriel, who had arrived from his basement bedroom to investigate the\ndisturbance. Ceasar followed the intruder and observed Gabriel and the intruder engage in a\ndeadly struggle. There was a shot, after which Gabriel and the intruder both fell to the kitchen\nfloor, and then there was another shot. Ceasar began to use the end of the golf club shaft to stab\nthe intruder but fell down during the scuffle. The intruder was able to break away, escaping\nthrough a sliding glass door in the dining area and disappearing into the night. Before the\nintruder fled, Ceasar was able to look at the intruder’s face once again, because, by this time, the\nski mask had been completely removed. Ceasar next remembered his wife coming into the\nkitchen and emergency personnel arriving on the scene.', 'Ceasar, Claire, and Gabriel were rushed to the emergency room at Rhode Island Hospital.\nClaire had incurred a minor gunshot wound in her upper leg, and Ceasar had suffered one\ngunshot wound to his arm and another to his leg. Gabriel, however, was pronounced dead as a\nresult of a gunshot wound to the torso shortly after he was brought to Rhode Island Hospital.', 'When Claire and Ceasar arrived at the emergency room, they were met by police officers\nwho attempted to obtain descriptions of the intruder from them. Claire described the intruder as\na white male with slicked-back, gray hair, who looked over the age of forty. She also described\nhim as four inches taller than her husband, who was about five-feet and seven-inches tall. She\nbelieved that the man was wearing a black hooded sweatshirt.', 'Ceasar’s description was\nsimilar—he said that the intruder was a man with “wrinkles,” “beady eyes,” a receding hairline,\nand “slicked back hair” that was either red in color or possibly gray in color with blood matted', '-3-\ninto it. A laboratory report from the hospital, which was later admitted into evidence, indicated\nthat Ceasar’s blood alcohol content was 0.134 shortly after he was first seen at the emergency\nroom.', 'Shortly thereafter, a retired Warwick Police Captain Linda I. Eastman, who was a sketch\nartist, created a composite sketch based on Claire’s description of the intruder. The sketch was\nthen shown to Ceasar, who suggested that the intruder had more of a receding hairline than was\ndepicted in the first sketch; Claire agreed. The composite sketch was then distributed within the\nRhode Island law-enforcement community, resulting in a tentative identification of Bishop as the\nintruder.', 'Warwick Police Det. Sgt. Robert Bentsen, who was the lead investigator in the case, was\nadvised that the sketch resembled Bishop. On July 1, 2007, Det. Sgt. Bentsen attempted to visit\nBishop at his last known address, and when nobody answered the door, Det. Sgt. Bentsen visited\nanother location where he believed Bishop might be visiting—the home of Bishop’s sister and\nher husband—to no avail. However, Bishop’s brother-in-law called another location where he\nbelieved Bishop was living and left a message for Bishop to call Det. Sgt. Bentsen. Later that\nafternoon, Bishop returned Det. Sgt. Bentsen’s telephone call. In that conversation, Bishop\nindicated that he wanted to talk about the June 27, 2007 incident, but said that he could not\nbecause he had sustained some minor injuries over his left eye—explaining that he had hurt\nhimself at his place of employment. The telephone call ended before any arrangement could be\nmade for the detective to interview Bishop. On July 2, 2007, Det. Sgt. Bentsen then contacted\nBishop’s parole officer, Matthew Degnan, who informed him that Bishop had failed to report to\nhim that day, as required by the conditions of his parole. Degnan indicated that he obtained a\nparole-detention warrant for Bishop because he had failed to attend the scheduled meeting—a', '-4-\nviolation of his parole—and also because he had tested positive for alcohol at an earlier\nmeeting—yet another parole violation.', 'In addition, Warwick Police Det. Barbara Frazier, who worked in the Bureau of Criminal\nIdentification, obtained a warrant authorizing the search of the home of Reine Bishop, Bishop’s\nex-wife. Parole logs, in which Bishop was required to memorialize everywhere he went and the\npersons with whom he was with, were seized from a dresser located in Reine’s bedroom. One of\nthose logs, dated June 27, 2007, reflected the notation: “stayed overnight at Reine’s mothers.”\nHowever, another parole log for the same day indicated that Bishop had left Reine’s home\nshortly before midnight. No satisfactory explanation for that discrepancy ever was offered.', 'Eventually, by tracing a telephone call, Det. Sgt. Bentsen was able to locate Bishop. On\nJuly 3, 2007, Bishop was taken into custody without incident. At police headquarters, Bishop’s\nphotograph was taken, and hair samples and DNA samples were obtained.', 'That same afternoon, Ceasar and Claire were asked to report to police headquarters for\nadditional questioning; they were not told specifically what the questions would involve. In fact,\nDet. Frazier had compiled a photo array. The photo array was shown to Claire and Ceasar,\nindependently of each other, and both identified Bishop as the intruder. 2', '2', 'Forensic Evidence Development', 'After the crime scene was secured, detectives began to develop forensic evidence.\nPhysical evidence—including the ski mask, several bullet casings, a seat cover of a chair from\nthe deck, and the shaft and head of the golf club—was retrieved from the scene, and numerous\nphotographs were taken. Blood samples were also collected from some of the physical evidence,\n2', 'Before trial, the trial justice determined that the method employed by the police for this\nidentification procedure was proper. Bishop does not challenge that ruling on appeal.', '-5-\nas well as from a number of areas within and around the home, including the hallway, kitchen,\ndining area, and the sliding glass door. The samples were submitted to the Rhode Island\nDepartment of Health for DNA analysis, where it was determined that certain samples that were\ntested—the ski mask, the kitchen and dining room, the seat cover, a portion of one of the\nvenetian blinds, and the golf club head—matched Bishop’s DNA.', 'Further, a forensic\nexamination was conducted on hair that was found inside the ski mask. This also matched a hair\nsample retrieved from Bishop when he was taken into custody.', 'In addition, although there was no evidence of a forced entry at the Medeiroses’ home,\nthe photographs from the kitchen portrayed a violent struggle, as emphasized by large quantities\nof blood on the floor, the walls, and the venetian blinds. There was also a trail of blood leading\nfrom the sliding glass door that was near the dining area, which allowed the detectives to track\nthe route of the intruder’s escape. Indeed, the blood trail indicated that the intruder exited the\nhouse onto the deck, cut through the backyard, passed some foliage and a fence on the side of the\nhouse, and then traveled across the street into a parking lot of a school administration building.\nThat parking lot was near Reine’s home.', 'B', 'Pretrial Motions', 'On February 6, 2008, an indictment was returned against Bishop.', 'Before the trial\ncommenced, the state had filed various motions in limine, three of which underlie the issues now\nbefore us on appeal. One of the motions filed by the state was “to prohibit evidence of the\npresence of alcohol or controlled substances in the blood of [Ceasar, Claire, and Gabriel],” and', '-6-\nanother was “to prohibit evidence of the fact that marijuana and Inositol[3] were found in the\nbedroom of Gabriel.” The trial justice did not formally rule on these motions after they were\nargued. However, evidence of Ceasar’s alcohol consumption was later admitted at trial, but\nevidence of Ceasar, Claire, or Gabriel’s alleged use or possession of controlled substances was\nexcluded. Indeed, during the trial, when defense counsel attempted to cross-examine Ceasar and\nClaire about their alleged drug use on the evening in question, the trial justice sustained the\nstate’s objection, ruling that defense counsel had failed to proffer any evidence that the use of\ndrugs had affected the memory or conduct of the witnesses. Similarly, when defense counsel\nsought to cross-examine Warwick Police Det. Daniel Gillis of the Bureau of Criminal\nIdentification about the marijuana and cutting agent found in Gabriel’s bedroom, the trial justice\nsustained the state’s objection to the admission of such evidence because defense counsel had not\nestablished its probative value.', 'The other relevant motion was the state’s motion to allow the introduction of the\nfollowing evidence:', '“1. That [d]efendant was incarcerated at the [Adult Correctional', 'Institutions (ACI)] before August, 2006;', '“2. That [d]efendant had been on parole since August, 2006 and', 'remained on parole until July 3, 2007;', '“3. That [d]efendant had a parole officer from August, 2006', 'through July 3, 2007 * * * whom he reported to;', '“4. That [d]efendant failed to appear for a required meeting with', 'his parole officer on July 2, 2007;', '“5. That [d]efendant, as a condition of parole, maintained a log of', 'his daily travels;', '“6. That a [w]arrant for a [v]iolation of his parole was issued on', 'July 2, 2007 and executed on July 3, 2007.”\n3', 'Inositol is a common “cutting agent,” which is a substance used to increase the volume of a\nquantity of a controlled substance.', '-7-\nConversely, defense counsel filed a motion in limine to prohibit direct or indirect references by\nthe state and its witnesses to various evidence, including, as relevant to this appeal, “[a]ny\ntestimony of the prior record of the defendant,” “[a]ny testimony or reference to defendant’s\nparole status,” and “[a]ny testimony or reference to defendant’s parole ‘log,’ or introduction of\nsaid log.” When he ruled on these motions, the trial justice excluded any reference to Bishop’s\nincarceration, but he did allow limited evidence concerning Bishop’s parole status at the time of\nthe incident in question. The trial justice based his decision on a finding that “under the\ncircumstances * * * the parole status of [Bishop] d[id] not substantially outweigh its probative\nvalue due to the fact that it is something that’s intertwined through the testimony of a number of\nwitnesses and * * * [Bishop]’s statement [to the police] on July 3.”', 'After the hearing on the motions in limine, a trial before a jury commenced, beginning on\nFebruary 23, 2009 and ending on March 4, 2009. During the trial, testimony was presented from\ntwenty-one witnesses for the state, including Ceasar and Claire, who testified about the home\ninvasion that occurred on June 27, 2007, and many of the police detectives involved in the\ninvestigation and development of the evidence against Bishop. In addition, Kenneth Turchetta,\nan acquaintance of Bishop’s, testified that he received telephone calls from Reine early on the\nmorning of June 28, 2007. He said that he recognized Bishop’s voice in the background, and he\nremembered Reine saying that they needed a doctor.', 'Similarly, Daniel Antonelli, who had\nemployed Bishop as a woodworker for about six months starting in August 2006, recalled that\nBishop stopped by on June 28, 2007 and asked Antonelli to provide him with a false alibi—that\nBishop had been injured while working at Antonelli’s shop and that the injury was caused by\nsome pipe staging. Antonelli initially agreed to go along with the alibi suggestion, but within a\nday or two, he changed his mind and informed Bishop that he would not lie on Bishop’s behalf.', '-8-', 'Finally, Bishop took the stand and offered a version of the facts that was strikingly\ndifferent from the description that had been provided by Ceasar and Claire. Bishop did not deny\nthat he was inside the home of Ceasar and Claire on the night in question. However, he\nexplained that he had been at Reine’s house, and, at some point during the night, he saw a\nshadow pass by the bedroom window. He said he went outside to investigate, but he did not\ndiscover any intruder. He claimed that he sat on the front stairs, at which point he heard\nsomeone call out his name. He realized that the person who was calling his name was in front of\nCeasar and Claire’s driveway. Bishop walked towards the person, who said, “my brother wants\nto talk to you,” and led Bishop inside the home. Bishop testified that he entered the house, and\nthe door was immediately shut behind him. According to his testimony, he immediately found\nhimself surrounded by three men. One of the men put a gun to Bishop’s ear, while another\nplaced a ski mask over his head and remarked, “he’s looking like a burglar now.” The third man\nretrieved a golf club and began to strike Bishop with it. Bishop said a gun went off before the\nfirst blow from the golf club, but that he was not wounded. The men moved Bishop to the\nkitchen, where more shots were fired, and Bishop found himself on the floor, struggling with the\nman who possessed the gun.', 'Bishop explained that he attempted to escape through a sliding glass door, but on an\nadjacent deck, he saw the man with the gun. The man attempted to shoot him, but the gun\nmerely clicked and the man ran off across the yard. Bishop tried to follow him, but he heard\npolice sirens and retreated, first across the street next to Reine’s house and then to a friend’s\nhouse. He claimed that he bandaged his head and called Reine to pick him up.', '-9-', 'The jury found Bishop guilty as to all counts submitted to it.4 Bishop filed a motion for a\nnew trial, which was denied on April 28, 2009.', 'He was subsequently sentenced to life\nimprisonment without the possibility of parole, two additional life sentences—one to run\nconsecutive to the first and the other to run concurrent—and four consecutive twenty-year\nsentences. Bishop filed a timely notice of appeal on May 22, 2009, challenging the trial justice’s\ndecision to exclude any evidence of drug use by Ceasar or Claire, to exclude any evidence of\ndrug possession by Gabriel, and to admit evidence of Bishop’s parole status.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'We have long held, and in this jurisdiction it is beyond peradventure, that “decisions\nconcerning the admissibility of evidence are ‘within the sound discretion of the trial justice, and\nthis Court will not interfere with the trial justice’s decision unless a clear abuse of that discretion\nis apparent.’” State v. Gaspar, 982 A.2d 140, 147 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. Mohapatra, 880\nA.2d 802, 805 (R.I. 2005)). Likewise, this Court reviews a trial justice’s decision to limit the\nscope of cross-examination for an abuse of discretion. State v. Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 583 (R.I.\n2009).', 'Similarly, “[t]he admission or exclusion of evidence ‘under Rule 403 [of the Rhode\nIsland Rules of Evidence] is within the sound discretion of the trial justice.’” State v. Shelton,\n990 A.2d 191, 202 (R.I. 2010) (quoting Blue Coast, Inc. v. Suarez Corp. Industries, 870 A.2d\n997, 1007 (R.I. 2005)). However, “the discretion to exclude evidence under Rule 403 must be\nexercised sparingly.” Id. (quoting State v. Hak, 963 A.2d 921, 928 (R.I. 2009)). “Under Rule\n4', 'The indictment in this case charged Bishop with first-degree murder, burglary, three counts of\ndischarging a firearm during the commission of a violent crime, two counts of assault with a\ndangerous weapon, and two counts of felony assault. However, the state dismissed the two\ncounts of assault with a dangerous weapon.', '- 10 -\n403, relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the\ndanger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.” Id.

Tempest, 651 A.2d 1198, 1216 (R.I. 1995)).', 'III', 'Analysis', 'A', 'Consumption of Intoxicants', 'Bishop argues that the trial justice abused his discretion when he disallowed evidence\nthat Ceasar, Claire, and Gabriel had either taken or possessed drugs on the evening of the\nincident and, thus, violated his constitutional right to cross-examination. Bishop maintains that\nthere was evidence of “heavy alcohol and drug use by those living in the home” and that that\nsupports a finding of intoxication.', 'It is well recognized that proof that a witness consumed intoxicating substances at or\naround the time of the event that he or she is testifying about is relevant to impeach a witness’s\nability to perceive an event, to remember the facts, and to accurately relate those facts at trial.\nSee Avarista v. Aloisio, 672 A.2d 887, 891 (R.I. 1996) (explaining that evidence of intoxication\nis permissible “to test the witnesses’ accuracy, memory, veracity, or credibility” citing State v.\nCrowhurst, 470 A.2d 1138, 1143 (R.I. 1984)); O’Brien v. Waterman, 91 R.I. 374, 381, 163 A.2d\n31, 35 (1960). This alone, however, is not enough. Contrary to Bishop’s argument—that\nevidence of the influence of drugs is never excludable on relevance grounds because credibility\nis always relevant—the admissibility of evidence regarding consumption of intoxicating\nsubstances is not completely unfettered: “neither party may question a witness merely to show', '- 11 -\nthat he or she may have consumed some potentially intoxicating substance before an event at\nissue in the case has occurred” in an attempt to affect credibility. State v. Rice, 755 A.2d 137,\n148-49 (R.I. 2000) (citing State v. Amaral, 109 R.I. 379, 386, 285 A.2d 783, 787 (1972)).', 'Bishop improperly conflates the holding that evidence of intoxication is “never\nexcludable on relevance grounds” with the proposition that such evidence is always admissible.\nState v. Squillante, 622 A.2d 474, 481 (R.I. 1993). This is an incorrect reading of the rules of\nevidence and does not comport with our longstanding interpretation thereof. Indeed, under Rule\n403, relevant evidence can be excluded if its “probative value is substantially outweighed by the\ndanger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations\nof undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.” It is because of\nthe undue potential to cause confusion and unfair prejudice in admitting evidence of intoxication\nthat we established a “gatekeeping procedure” in Handy v. Geary, 105 R.I. 419, 431, 252 A.2d\n435, 441 (1969), to determine whether evidence of this kind is admissible for the purpose of\nattacking the credibility of a witness. Clark, 974 A.2d at 582-83 (citing Handy, 105 R.I. at 431,\n252 A.2d at 441-42); Avarista, 672 A.2d at 891.', 'Indeed, “[o]nly when [evidence of the\nconsumption of intoxicants] is offered for the purpose of proving ‘intoxication,’ as that term is\ndefined in Handy,[5] is such evidence admissible.” Rice, 755 A.2d at 149.', 'Specifically, under the Handy procedure, before evidence of the consumption of\nintoxicants may be introduced into evidence, “the trial justice shall conduct a preliminary\n5', 'In Handy v. Geary, 105 R.I. 419, 431, 252 A.2d 435, 441 (1969), this Court defined\n“intoxication” as', '“a situation where, by reason of drinking intoxicants an individual', 'does not have the normal use of his physical or mental faculties,', 'thus rendering him incapable of acting in a manner in which an', 'ordinarily prudent and cautious man, in full possession of his', 'faculties, using reasonable care, would act under like conditions.”', '- 12 -\nevidentiary hearing on th[e] issue in the absence of the jury” to resolve whether evidence of\nconsumption rises to such a level that it should be admitted at trial. Handy, 105 R.I. at 431, 252\nA.2d at 441-42; see Clark, 974 A.2d at 583. Only if the trial justice finds “that the evidence is\nsuch that different minds can naturally and fairly come to different conclusions on the question\nof intoxication, * * * then and only then, may evidence of [consumption of intoxicants] be\nadmitted under proper instruction” given to the jury. Handy, 105 R.I. at 431, 252 A.2d at 442.\nAccordingly, as a predicate to the admission of evidence of intoxication, the trial justice must be\nsatisfied that the evidence is sufficient to allow a reasonable juror to conclude that the witness\nwas, in fact, intoxicated.', 'In Amaral, 109 R.I. at 387, 285 A.2d at 787-88, we extended the application of the Handy\nprocedure to criminal cases. See also State v. McRae, 31 A.3d 785, 790 (R.I. 2011); State v.\nMattatall, 114 R.I. 568, 572, 337 A.2d 229, 232 (1975). We have also applied this test equally to\nadmitting evidence of drug use and other intoxicants. See State v. Ahmadjian, 438 A.2d 1070,\n1088 (R.I. 1981) (applying Handy to marijuana); Mattatall, 114 R.I. at 572, 337 A.2d at 232\n(applying Handy to narcotics, as well as alcohol). 6', 'With regard to Ceasar, Bishop argues that there was ample evidence of Ceasar’s drug use,\nwhich, he argues, was critical to the jury’s assessment of whether Ceasar had accurately\nperceived and could accurately recount the events of June 27, 2007.

However, based on our review of the\nrecord, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not err in limiting the cross-examination about\nCeasar’s alleged drug use.', 'Indeed, before limiting the evidence of Ceasar’s drug use, the trial justice carefully\nreviewed the challenged evidence. See Clark, 974 A.2d at 564 (emphasizing that a trial justice\nshould “cautiously exercise his or her discretion, ever mindful of the potential for prejudicial\nerror,” when the state seeks to limit or exclude evidence in a criminal case). When he considered\nthe evidence of Ceasar’s drug use, the trial justice determined that defense counsel had not come\nforward with any evidence about whether the trace amount of cocaine or any other illicit\nsubstance that was found in Ceasar’s blood would have affected his memory, conduct, or ability\nto perceive the events that were occurring on the night in question. Id. 582-83 (Handy standard\nnot met when an individual had been drinking but no proof was presented as to a lack of physical\nand mental faculties).', 'Although defense counsel emphasizes the laboratory report, which\nindicated trace amounts of cocaine, opiates, and cannabinoids in Ceasar’s system, 7 the trial\njustice concluded that there was nothing of evidentiary value that would quantify the amount of\n7', 'The report indicated “POS NC*,” or “positive not confirmed,” as to the presence of opiates,\ncocaine, and cannabinoids.

Indeed,\nthe trial justice noted that defense counsel', '“advised the [c]ourt * * * that he d[id] not have an expert to testify', 'whether or not the amount of cocaine [wa]s significant, whether it', 'would affect Ceasar Medeiros’s memory or his conduct on the', 'evening in question, nor [wa]s there a proffer as to what the expert', 'would testify to concerning the issue of how long cocaine and its', 'various forms might stay in the human body * * *.”\nBased on this lack of proof, the trial justice held that the evidence contained in the laboratory\nreport did not rise to the level where different minds could come to different conclusions as to\nwhether Ceasar was intoxicated, and, therefore, he excluded the evidence of Ceasar’s drug use.\nSee Handy, 105 R.I. at 431, 252 A.2d at 441-42. “This Court will not disturb a trial justice’s\ndecision to limit the scope of cross-examination absent an abuse of discretion,” and we perceive\nthe existence of no such abuse here. Clark, 974 A.2d at 583. Accordingly, we hold that there\nwas no error in the trial justice’s decision to exclude evidence of Ceasar’s use of drugs.', 'Even less evidence was presented by Bishop with regard to Claire and Gabriel’s alleged\nintoxication. The evidence Bishop’s trial counsel was prepared to offer about Claire was a\nstatement made by Ceasar to Det. DiGregorio that “everyone drank and smoked marijuana” on\nthe night of the incident. Defense counsel argued to the trial justice that smoking marijuana was\nrelevant to “set[] the tone of what was going on in the house before the defendant supposedly\nentered, and * * * [to explain] what state of mind [Ceasar, Claire, and Gabriel] were in before the\ndefendant came in.” However, the trial justice quite correctly found that this offer of proof was\ninsufficient under Handy, Amaral, and Rice, because defense counsel had not come forward with', '- 15 -\nany evidence “that either the ingestion of illicit drugs, marijuana, or alcohol arose to the level of\nintoxication.”', 'In a similar vein, defense counsel argued that the existence of marijuana and a cutting\nagent found in Gabriel’s bedroom should be presented as “part of the climate of what was going\non in th[e] house.” The trial justice sustained the state’s objection to this line of inquiry because\ndefense counsel failed to establish the probative value of this evidence. We agree with the trial\njustice and, accordingly, hold that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in limiting the\ncross-examination of Ceasar, Claire, and Gabriel’s alleged drug use and possession.', 'We pause to note that, in our opinion, the trial justice was more than fair when he\nallowed testimony about Ceasar’s alcohol intake. The jury was well aware of Ceasar’s potential\ncredibility issues with regard to his capacity to recount the events at issue, which had been\nsignificantly called into question by his own testimony that he had consumed “a couple of\ncocktails” when he went out to lunch with his sister-in-law on June 27, 2007. Further, when\npressed on cross-examination, he stated that he actually imbibed somewhere around four\ncocktails at lunch and drank still more when friends stopped by the house earlier that evening. In\naddition, before it retired to deliberate, the jury was provided with a copy of the hospital\nlaboratory report. Although the references to any illegal substances had been redacted, the report\nnonetheless indicated that Ceasar’s blood alcohol content was 0.134. Accordingly, because the\ntrial justice did not abuse his discretion when he found that the evidence of drug use and\npossession was inadmissible under Handy and its progeny, and given the fact that defense\ncounsel was provided with a reasonable opportunity to impeach Ceasar about his alcohol usage,', '- 16 -\nwe hold that the trial justice did not violate Bishop’s confrontation rights by limiting defense\ncounsel’s cross-examination with respect to the use of or possession of any drugs. 8', 'Bishop claims, however, that the trial justice erred by requiring expert testimony to prove\nthat consumption reached a level of intoxication. This, he argues, was an error of law because\nthere is no obligation, as a condition precedent to admitting intoxication evidence, for the\nproduction of an expert to prove the effect of the substance.', 'We disagree with Bishop’s\ncharacterization that the trial justice obligated them to produce expert testimony. 9', 'A close look at the record reveals that the trial justice did not limit the cross-examination\nbecause he believed that, as a matter of law, Bishop needed an expert to testify to the\nintoxicating effects of ingesting cocaine and other illicit substances. Even though he noted that\nthere was an absence of expert testimony, the trial justice was simply considering the evidence\nbefore him in deciding whether Bishop had produced the quantum of evidence sufficient to allow\nevidence of intoxication to come before the jury—a fact-intensive analysis. Indeed, the veteran\ntrial justice concluded that the inference suggested by Bishop—that, based on the presence of\ncocaine in Ceasar’s bloodstream, the jury could infer that Ceasar was intoxicated—was far too\nconjectural and speculative to meet the Handy standard.', 'See Ahmadjian, 438 A.2d at 1088\n(cross-examination properly limited when the defendant failed to offer an evidentiary basis for\n8', 'Similarly, Bishop argues that evidence of Ceasar’s drug use would have been relevant to\nsupport the defense’s theory that Bishop had been coaxed into the house by several men,\nincluding Ceasar, because evidence of drug use would have made it more likely that Ceasar was\ndisinhibited and in a state to engage in aggressive behavior. However, in accordance with our\ndiscussion above, the trial justice properly excluded evidence of Ceasar’s use of drugs because\ndefense counsel failed to offer evidence of intoxication.\n9', 'We note that both parties have cited a number of cases from other jurisdictions to advocate for\ntheir respective positions as to whether expert testimony should be required before allowing\nevidence of the consumption of intoxicating substances. However, we decline to adopt a per se\nrule in this area, as this is a decision left to the sound discretion of the trial justices. State v.\nGaspar, 982 A.2d 140, 147 (R.I. 2009).', '- 17 -\nhis allegation that a witness was intoxicated). The trial justice explained that he had “reviewed\nthe drug treatment of at least hundreds, if not thousands of defendants over the years” and was\n“aware that some illicit drugs * * * may remain in the human body and its bloodstream for days,\neven weeks after consumption.” Without an evidentiary link between the presence of illicit\nsubstances in Ceasar’s blood and the effect of such substances on his cognitive abilities, the\nlaboratory report had little value and fell far short of meeting the standard of intoxication set\nforth in Handy. See Mattatall, 114 R.I. at 573, 337 A.2d at 233 (attempting to infer that an\nindividual was intoxicated based on the presence of alcohol and narcotics in his system was “far\ntoo tenuous” to meet the Handy standard and, therefore, was properly excluded).', 'Finally, Bishop contends that the trial justice erred as a matter of law because he did not\nfollow the procedure outlined in Handy. We find this argument to be somewhat disingenuous;\nBishop—the party who was attempting to introduce evidence of intoxication—never requested a\nHandy hearing in the first place. Nevertheless, we note that, even if the trial justice did not\nprecisely follow the voir dire procedures outlined in Handy, the conferences that the trial justice\ndid conduct on the record indicate that he “act[ed] within the spirit” of Handy and its progeny.\nState v. Carvalho, 892 A.2d 140, 147-48 (R.I. 2006) (A hearing on defendant’s motion in limine\nregarding possible intoxication “indicate[d] that the trial justice * * * act[ed] within the spirit of\nour decisions in the Handy line of cases.”). Specifically, the trial justice conducted a hearing on\nthe state’s motions in limine and held sidebar conferences when the state objected to defense\ncounsel’s cross-examination on drug use and possession. During the conferences conducted on\nthe record, the trial justice considered the arguments articulated for and against the admissibility\nof the evidence of the witnesses’ possible intoxication, carefully weighed the proffered evidence,', '- 18 -\nand ultimately ruled that the evidence was inadmissible because it did not rise “to the level of\nintoxication.” We hold this to be sufficient. See id. 147-48. 10', 'B', 'Admission of Parole Status', 'Bishop also argues that the trial justice abused his discretion by allowing testimony about\nBishop’s parole status. Bishop maintains that this evidence should have been excluded pursuant\nto Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, because any probative value it may have had\nwas substantially outweighed by its prejudicial wallop. Specifically, Bishop challenges: (1) Det.\nSgt. Bentsen’s testimonial references that Degnan was Bishop’s parole officer and that Bishop\nwas arrested on a parole-detention warrant; (2) Degnan’s testimony that Bishop tested positive\nfor alcohol at his last meeting, in violation of the conditions of his parole, and that Bishop failed\nto report to Degnan on the Monday following the murder; (3) testimony that Bishop was required\nto catalog his every location and associates; and (4) references to the fact that Bishop’s DNA was\ntaken at the ACI. Bishop maintains that those references to his parole status were immaterial,\nredactable, superfluous, and unduly prejudicial. We disagree.', 'Before admitting otherwise probative evidence, a trial justice must carefully consider the\nrelevance of the evidence relative to its potential prejudicial effect, pursuant to Rule 403. Rule\n403 provides that, “[a]lthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is\nsubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading\n10', 'Bishop also argues that the trial justice erred by excluding this evidence on relevancy grounds.\nAlthough the trial justice did say that he was excluding the evidence on relevancy grounds, after\na review of the record, we are convinced that the trial justice came to the conclusion that the\nHandy standard was not satisfied, even if he did not precisely articulate it. Accordingly, we are\nnot confronted with a case in which the trial justice has excluded intoxication evidence on\nrelevancy grounds alone. See Carrera, 528 A.2d at 334 (“[I]t would be error for the trial justice\nto prohibit this line of questioning [regarding a witness’s drug use at the time of an incident at\nissue] on relevance grounds alone.”).', '- 19 -\nthe jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of\ncumulative evidence.” This Court has said that “a trial justice’s discretion to exclude evidence\nunder Rule 403 must be used sparingly”; only when such evidence demonstrate mere marginal\nrelevance and enormous unfair prejudice should the trial justice exclude it. State v. DeJesus, 947\nA.2d 873, 883 (R.I. 2008).', 'After a carefully measured and thoughtful analysis, we are of the firm opinion that the\ntrial justice did not abuse his discretion in permitting the references to Bishop’s parole status. In\nconsidering the motions in limine, the trial justice explained that evidence of Bishop’s parole\nstatus was “highly relevant” and “needed by the state to prove its case.” Specifically, he\nexplained that the evidence regarding Bishop’s parole status was relevant to explain Bishop’s\n“opportunity,” including “his whereabouts at the time of the crimes,” as well as “his knowledge,\nidentity, and intent” regarding June 27, 2007. Indeed, the evidence regarding Bishop’s parole\nstatus was relevant to explain how the police detectives identified him as a suspect.', 'For\nexample, the discrepancies in Bishop’s travel logs for the night of the home invasion were\nprobative, not only of his whereabouts at the time, but also of his opportunity to commit the\ncrimes and his attempts to cover his tracks in the aftermath of his criminal activity. Also,\nBishop’s uncharacteristic failure to report to his parole officer as scheduled, approximately five\ndays after the murder, was certainly probative of his consciousness of guilt. Thus, the trial\njustice did not abuse his discretion in concluding that evidence of Bishop’s parole status was\nhighly relevant and probative to show Bishop’s opportunity, knowledge, identity, and intent\nregarding the June 27, 2007, incident. See State v. Mlyniec, 15 A.3d 983, 997 (R.I. 2011) (“It is\nwithin the sound discretion of the trial justice whether to admit or exclude evidence under Rule\n403.” quoting State v. John, 881 A.2d 920, 927 (R.I. 2005)).', '- 20 -', 'Further, the trial justice was careful to mitigate any prejudicial impact that evidence of\nBishop’s status as a parolee might have had. The trial justice ordered that Bishop’s “parole\nstatus w[ould] only be admitted for limited purposes, such as proving opportunity, knowledge,\nidentity, and intent regarding the June 27-28, 2007 incident,” and he instructed the jury as to that.\nAdditionally, in assessing potential prejudice, the trial justice determined that Bishop’s parole\nstatus was factually connected to the crimes charged, and was so intertwined with the facts that it\nbecame part and parcel of the entire case, such that the probative value substantially outweighed\nthe danger of prejudicial harm.', 'See State v. Woodson, 551 A.2d 1187, 1191 (R.I. 1988)\n(probative value substantially outweighed undue prejudice when the use of drugs at issue was\nfactually connected to the crimes charged and “so intertwined with the facts that it became part\nand parcel of the entire case”). Specifically, the trial justice considered the state’s proffer—\nbased on “the discovery materials including the grand jury presentation”—that (1) Bishop “was\narrested on a parole warrant”; (2) Bishop “gave a statement to the police on” the day he was\narrested, in which he made “several references to his parole status and the parole logs”; (3)\nBishop’s parole logs, which were seized at Reine’s house pursuant to a warrant, reflected that\nBishop left Reine’s house less than two hours before the incident in question; (4) Bishop did not\nreport to his parole officer on the Monday after the incident, and there was “substantial evidence\nthat the reason [he] failed to report [wa]s because he suffered a serious injury to his head”; (5)\nTurchetta was to testify that Reine called him on the morning after the murder to ask him for a\ndoctor, explaining that Bishop “c[ould not] go to [just any doctor] because of his probation\n[sic]”; and (6) Antonelli, who hired Bishop as a condition of his parole, was to testify that\n“shortly after the murder, [Bishop] asked him to falsely confirm that Bishop had been injured', '- 21 -\nwhile at work.” 11 See DeJesus, 947 A.2d at 883 (explaining that evidence is not to be excluded\nunder Rule 403 unless it “is marginally relevant and enormously prejudicial”). Based on this, the\ntrial justice concluded that the evidence of Bishop’s parole status was relevant, and the probative\nvalue was not substantially outweighed by its potential undue prejudice.', 'Moreover—and although we conclude that the prejudicial effect of this evidence was\nminimal—we recognize that in addition to carefully weighing the risk of unfair prejudice, the\ntrial justice, in a pretrial order, provided “adequate safety measures * * * to protect defendant”\nfrom undue prejudice. See Woodson, 551 A.2d at 1193. For one, he barred the introduction of\nthe circumstances of Bishop’s previous incarceration. Indeed, although the trial justice allowed\ntestimony that Bishop had been previously convicted of a felony, he limited testimony regarding\nthe character of the crime, which was first-degree murder. Further, the trial justice “ordered that\nthe state instruct all of its witnesses that they will not testify to [Bishop]’s incarceration,\ndetention, residence in prison or jail, nor the offenses for which he ha[d] served prison time.”\nThe trial justice was also careful to restrict any reference that it was individuals at the ACI who\nrecognized the composite sketch to be Bishop.', 'The trial justice further safeguarded against the risk of unfair prejudice by issuing an\nappropriate cautionary instruction to the jury about the very limited purpose for which the\nevidence concerning Bishop’s parole was offered. Specifically, the trial justice instructed that\nthe evidence could not be used to support a conclusion that Bishop was of bad character and,\nthus, may have committed the offenses for which he was on trial; the evidence could be used\n11', 'Ultimately, Bishop’s police statement was never admitted into evidence, and while both\nAntonelli and Turchetta testified at Bishop’s trial, Antonelli never testified that he hired Bishop\nas a condition of his parole and Turchetta never testified that Reine told him that Bishop “c[ould\nnot] go to [just any doctor] because of his probation [sic],” although he did testify that Reine\ncalled him to seek medical assistance for Bishop.', '- 22 -\nonly for limited purposes, such as proving opportunity—for example, his whereabouts at the\ntime of the crimes at issue to which the parole logs speak—or to explain his opportunity, plan, or\nidentity regarding the incident in question. 12 See State v.

Garcia, 743 A.2d 1038, 1052 (R.I. 2000)).\n12', 'The trial justice’s cautionary instructions provided that:', '“I again instruct you that if there is evidence that the defendant was', 'on parole at the time of the incident in question, you may not use', 'such evidence to conclude that he may be responsible for any of', 'the offenses for which he is now on trial.

If the', 'defendant was detained as of July 6, 2007, that is of no concern to', 'you and it has no evidentiary value.

Moreover, Bishop testified on direct examination that he failed to seek medical\naid because he did not wish to call attention to himself for fear that he would have to explain the\nincident to his parole officer, and defense counsel referred to Bishop’s parole in his opening\nstatement—that Bishop was “afraid about violating his parole”—and in his closing argument\nwhen he attempted to explain away Bishop’s reluctance to report the incident or to seek medical\nassistance.

It is\nwell settled that, when a party refreshes a witness’s recollection, the witness’s present memory of\nthe event, rather than the memorandum used to revive the memory, stands as the evidence.\nRicci, 639 A.2d at 67. Thus, the fact that the transcript did not refresh Doreen’s recollection\nduring the preparation for her in-court testimony does not lead to the conclusion that the\ntranscript would not refresh her recollection when she testified at trial.

Bell was represented by defense attorneys Kevin Dwyer\n(counsel) and Rebecca Clarke. 1 A bench trial commenced on March 23, 2009 in the Superior\nCourt. At that time, Dwyer discovered that the state intended to call two witnesses whose\nidentities had not been disclosed to him. Attorney Dwyer sought and received a continuance in\norder to prepare for these new witnesses. The trial justice also ordered that the state obtain\nwritten witness statements from the two new witnesses, and continued the trial for nearly two\nmonths.', 'On May 18, 2009, trial resumed and, upon cross-examining one of the new witnesses,\nDwyer learned for the first time that the witness had been arrested for vandalizing Bell’s truck on\nthe night of the incident. Attorney Dwyer then moved for a mistrial on the basis of this newly\ndiscovered evidence. The trial justice ruled that the juvenile records of the witnesses were\ndiscoverable, and allowed a further continuance. Trial resumed on June 15, 2009, at which time\ncounsel withdrew his motion for a mistrial.\n1', 'Although Attorney Clarke was co-counsel at applicant’s criminal trial, she was not mentioned\nduring applicant’s postconviction-relief hearing, and there has been no allegation that she gave\nineffective assistance to Bell.', '-2-', 'Attorney Dwyer presented two affirmative defenses on Bell’s behalf: self-defense and\ndefense of others.

Further, the state contends that the trial justice would\nnot have accepted a less than jail disposition because the sentencing benchmarks would assign\nsome jail time.', 'An applicant bringing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel can prevail only if he\nor she can meet both prongs of the test articulated in Strickland. See Rice v. State, 38 A.3d 9, 14\nn.7 (R.I. 2012). Accordingly, we will address each prong separately.', 'A', 'Objective Standard of Reasonableness', 'Under the first prong of Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687, “the [applicant] must show that\ncounsel’s performance was deficient.

See, e.g., Missouri v. Frye, 132 S. Ct.\n1399, 1404 (2012); Commonwealth v. Napper, 385 A.2d 521, 524 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1978). On the\ncontrary, counsel testified that he did not actively pursue a plea disposition “because [he] was\ntold in no uncertain terms [that they were] going to trial, so [he] remember[ed] being in\nchambers * * * and [he] remember[ed] saying something to the effect that, ‘Let’s not even talk\nabout a plea deal because he’s not taking a deal.

Cooper, 132 S.

Therefore, Bell asserts that his decision to\ngo to trial was not an informed one.', 'Bell testified that he had met with counsel in person approximately twelve times, in\naddition to having contact with him by telephone and email.', 'Bell admitted during his\npostconviction-relief hearing that counsel had explained to him the affirmative defenses of self-\ndefense and defense of others, but he denied that counsel had ever advised him that, if he were to\nbe found guilty, it was possible he could receive a jail sentence. However, Bell did admit that,\nwhen he went to trial, he knew that he could go to jail. Attorney Dwyer testified that, while he\ndid not have a specific recollection of a particular conversation with Bell, it was his regular\npractice to “tell [clients] the upside [and] the downside[:] * * * the downside is there’s always a\npossibility of going to jail to the maximum * * *.”', 'The applicant testified that, prior to trial, he would not have accepted a plea to a felony,\neven if it did not involve a jail term, explaining that, because he “really wanted to go in the\nArmy, [he] didn’t want to take a felony charge.” Not only was there never such an offer, but the\nhearing justice recalled that, “[i]n the pre-trial chambers conference, it was clear that a plea to a\nnon-jail disposition would not be offered and that the [c]ourt would not accept one, in any event,\nbecause Benchmark 10 assigns a four to five year sentence to the offense of felony assault.”', '“[A] choice between trial tactics, which appears unwise only in hindsight, does not\nconstitute constitutionally-deficient representation under the reasonably competent assistance\nstandard.” State v. D’Alo, 477 A.2d 89, 92 (R.I. 1984) (quoting United States v. Bosch, 584 F.2d\n1113, 1121 (1st Cir. 1978)). “To state and prove a claim under this standard, [an applicant] must\nallege and demonstrate that his counsel’s error clearly ‘resulted from neglect or ignorance rather', '-7-\nthan from informed, professional deliberation.’” Id. (quoting Bosch, 584 F.2d at 1121). Here,\nBell admitted that he thought counsel “did a good job” before he was convicted. It was only\nafter trial that Bell’s opinion of counsel changed, at which point he decided “[counsel] didn’t do\na good job at the end.” When asked at his postconviction hearing whether “this whole thing is\nabout the fact that you don’t like the outcome of [the trial],” Bell responded “[y]eah, I guess.”', 'It may well be true that, had Bell known that he would be convicted and sentenced to a\nfifteen-year term with four years to serve, he may have put aside his hopes for a military career\nin favor of pursuing a shorter prison term. However, effective assistance of counsel does not\ninvolve the ability to accurately predict the future. It is sufficient that counsel informed Bell of\nhis options and then abided by his client’s choice to go to trial. Although he now concedes that\nthe use of deadly force was unjustified, according to counsel, at the time of trial, Bell believed he\nhad been defending others and himself. Counsel pursued the affirmative defenses based on what\nthe trial justice characterized as “a sincere and reasonable belief * * * that Bell had a viable\nself/third party defense * * *.” We can discern no error in the trial justice’s determination that\nDwyer provided “capable, competent and intelligent advocacy” to applicant.', 'B', 'Prejudice', '“Prejudice exists if there is a reasonable probability that, absent counsel’s deficient\nperformance, the result of the proceeding would have been different.” Larngar v. Wall, 918 A.2d\n850, 856 (R.I. 2007) (quoting State v. Figueroa, 639 A.2d 495, 500 (R.I. 1994)). Although we\nhave found that the first prong of Strickland has not been met, we note that, in any case, the\napplicant cannot meet this second prong of Strickland because he cannot show that any plea offer\nwas forthcoming, much less that he would have accepted it, given his stated desire to avoid a', '-8-\nfelony conviction in order to join the military. To prove prejudice, the applicant would need to\npile supposition upon supposition: (1) that, had counsel sought to open plea negotiations, the\nstate would make a favorable offer; (2) that the applicant would have accepted an offer that, of\nnecessity, would have required him to plead guilty to a felony, thus presumably preventing him\nfrom joining the military; (3) that the offer would have been approved by the court; and (4) that\nthe offer would have resulted in a shorter prison term than the four years the applicant is\npresently serving. Postconviction relief cannot rest on such a tenuous basis. In short, the\napplicant could not prove that he was prejudiced in any way by counsel’s performance.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.\nThe record of this case shall be remanded to the Superior Court.', '-9-', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet\nTITLE OF CASE:', 'Michael Bell v.

Allison said that, when she returned to get\nher friend, Brianna was standing in line, looking frightened and holding on to an acquaintance.', '-2-', 'Brianna also testified; she said that she saw Kolsoi sitting at a table, pointing his phone at\nthe girls. She also concluded that he was videotaping or taking pictures of them. She said that\nshe held on to a friend in line because she was afraid that Kolsoi would grab her. When they\nreturned to Allison’s car, they noticed that Kolsoi was already in his vehicle, relaxing with his\nhands behind his head, staring at them. This time, according to Allison, Kolsoi followed them all\nthe way to school and “drove very slowly past [them] and was smiling and staring at [them] as\n[they] were standing in front of [her] car.” Brianna also said that, as he drove by the school\nparking lot, Kolsoi was looking at them and smiling, which caused her to feel “[c]reeped out.”\nUpset by what had just occurred, for a second time, Allison memorized his license plate number\nand reported both incidents to the school’s assistant principal.', 'On October 5, 2011, the girls were in the Dunkin’ Donuts when they looked outside and\nnoticed Kolsoi in his car, parked near Allison’s black Volvo. Fearing for their safety, the girls\ncalled the police and waited for a police car to arrive before they returned to their car. Although\nKolsoi chose not to follow them that day, a security video showed Kolsoi’s car leaving the\nparking lot behind the police car, shortly after the girls left.', 'On October 6, 2011, the girls again arrived at Dunkin’ Donuts before school. However,\nthis time the Lincoln Police Department had informed them that plainclothes police officers\nwould be inside the building to observe Kolsoi. The students purchased their items while Kolsoi\nsat in his car in the parking lot. After they backed out of their parking space and left the\npremises, Kolsoi again began to trail them. Allison said that, although he was two car lengths\nbehind the girls when they left the lot, Kolsoi soon caught up to them and pulled up beside them\non the road so that he could look inside their car. This last incident led to Kolsoi’s arrest on\nOctober 12, 2011.', '-3-', 'In an information dated January 19, 2012, the state charged defendant with five counts of\nfelony stalking. The case came to trial in the Superior Court later that year. At the close of the\nstate’s evidence, Kolsoi moved to dismiss the charges against him, pursuant to Rule 29(a) of the\nSuperior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. The trial justice reserved her decision on the\nmotion until the close of all the evidence. Kolsoi then testified in his own defense, making an\neffort to explain his actions for each encounter with the young complainants. Kolsoi maintained\nthat each situation was coincidental and he denied that he was aware of the girls for more than an\ninstant when their paths crossed. He said that he was at Dunkin’ Donuts on those occasions for\ninnocuous reasons, in particular, to connect with someone for part-time work. He testified that\nhe drove closely behind the girls and flashed his lights because he was frustrated and rushing to\nget to work. With respect to the complainants’ contention that he appeared to be photographing\nthem with his cell phone, he said that he was holding his phone in a way to avoid sun glare as he\nlooked for a message.', 'The defendant said he went to Dunkin’ Donuts on September 23, 2011, but realized\nwhen he looked at the menu board that he did not have enough money to purchase anything and\nleft, rushing to get to a job in Framingham, Massachusetts. He said that he recalled seeing the\ngirls, but asserted that they did not stand out in his mind and he emphatically denied that he had\nstopped at their car to stare at them. He did admit to following their car very closely and to\nflashing his lights, but explained that he did that to more than one vehicle as he hurried to get to\nhis job.', 'Kolsoi offered that on September 30, 2011, he went to Dunkin’ Donuts expecting to meet\nsomeone about a job. As he viewed the security footage from that day, which had been admitted\nas a full exhibit, he explained that he was looking at his phone and looking up periodically to see', '-4-\nif the person he was expecting had arrived and that he was sitting in a particular chair to avoid\nsun glare. He denied that he had recognized the girls. He did concede that he left the Dunkin’\nDonuts right after the girls, but said he was not aware of them. In justifying his presence near\nthe high school, Kolsoi said he was driving to a rental apartment that he owned to fix the toilet\nand that his route coincidentally brought him by the high school. 2 He said he did not see the\ngirls in the parking lot, but that he did notice the black Volvo. He maintained, however, that he\ndid not pay much attention to it. When asked to explain why he drove so slowly by the school,\nKolsoi testified that he slowed down because he did not want to get a speeding ticket.', 'With respect to the incident that occurred on October 5, 2011, defendant said that he went\nto Dunkin’ Donuts, waited in his car for a phone call about a job, and checked his phone for\nmessages. He said that when he did not receive a call, he left for home. He denied that he had\nseen the girls that day, saying, “I might have, but I wasn’t paying attention to them.” When he\nleft the parking lot, there was a police car ahead of him; he said that he “might” have seen the\nblack Volvo, explaining, “I think I was already then conscious of the black Volvo because of the\n23rd when they blocked me, so I knew about the black Volvo and a bunch of kids.”', 'Finally, he said he went to Dunkin’ Donuts on October 6, 2011, after working a night\nshift because he thought someone might be contacting him about employment, so he waited for a\nphone call. He said that he did not recall having seen the girls on that day but, after viewing the\nsecurity footage, he said, “I might have seen them but not conscious [sic] that these are the girls\nor any girls.” He denied that he followed the girls out of the parking lot that day but said, “I\n2', 'Kolsoi’s tenant, Jacob Langley, said that Kolsoi’s toolbox had been left by the front door to his', 'apartment on September 30, 2011. He also said that Kolsoi would, on occasion, leave the', 'toolbox there to let him know that he had stopped by the rental apartment to make requested', 'repairs.', '-5-\nmight have seen [a black Volvo], but it’s like I was conscious of the black Volvo but I wasn’t\npaying attention, I was minding my business.” Kolsoi went on to say that he was completely\nshocked and confused when he was arrested on October 12, 2011.', 'At the close of all the evidence, Kolsoi renewed his oral motion to dismiss, and the trial\njustice again reserved judgment. Then, on December 6, 2012, without having ruled on the\nmotion to dismiss, the trial justice delivered her decision from the bench finding Kolsoi guilty of\nfive counts of stalking. In support of the oral motions that he made during trial, Kolsoi also filed\na motion to dismiss on January 8, 2013. On March 22, 2013, the trial justice heard Kolsoi on the\nmotion to dismiss. Although a transcript of that hearing has not been provided to this Court, the\ntrial justice summarized defendant’s arguments when she delivered her decision from the bench\non April 26, 2013. It is apparent that defendant argued that the state had not proven beyond a\nreasonable doubt that his actions were willful or malicious, that there was no evidence that he\nwas formally notified that his activities were unwelcome, and that there was insufficient\nevidence on counts 3, 4, and 5 because there was no testimony from the complainants named in\nthose counts. That motion was denied and defendant timely appealed.', 'On appeal before this Court, Kolsoi argues that: (1) the trial justice erred when she denied\nhis motion to dismiss because he was “without knowledge that his actions were disturbing;” (2)\nthe trial justice erred when she denied his motion to dismiss counts three through five because\nthe state failed to call three of the five complainants to testify; (3) the trial justice erred when she\ndenied his motion to dismiss because the state failed to prove that the complainants were in\n“reasonable fear of bodily injury;” (4) § 11-59-2 is unconstitutionally vague; and (5) that the\nfailure to call three of the complainants violated his rights under the Sixth Amendment’s\nConfrontation Clause and article 1, section 10 of the Rhode Island Constitution.', '-6-', 'Analysis', 'We begin by noting that defendant waived his right to a jury trial and chose to be tried by\na justice sitting without a jury. Therefore, to challenge the legal sufficiency of the evidence, the\ndefendant must file a motion to dismiss under the provisions of Rule 29(a). See State v. Silvia,\n798 A.2d 419, 424 (R.I. 2002). When ruling on a motion to dismiss in a jury-waived criminal\ntrial, the trial justice acts as an independent factfinder. See State v. Albanese, 970 A.2d 1215,\n1220 (R.I. 2009). Sitting in that role, the trial justice should:', '“weigh and evaluate the trial evidence, pass upon the credibility of the trial', 'witnesses, and engage in the inferential process, impartially, not being required to', 'view the inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, and against the moving', 'party. After so doing, if the trial justice in a criminal case setting concludes that', 'the trial evidence is sufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, he or', 'she denies the defendant’s motion to dismiss and, if both sides have rested, enters', 'decision and judgment of conviction thereon. If the evidence is not so sufficient,', 'he or she grants the motion and dismisses the case.” State v. McKone, 673 A.2d', '1068, 1072–73 (R.I. 1996).\nIt is also significant that “[i]n a jury-waived criminal proceeding, this Court gives deference to a\ntrial justice’s finding[s] of facts.” State v. Adewumi, 966 A.2d 1217, 1221–22 (R.I. 2009)\n(quoting State v. Forand, 958 A.2d 134, 138 (R.I. 2008)). Moreover, when we review these\n“determinations of credibility and findings of fact by a trial justice sitting without a jury, this\nCourt will not disturb the trial justice’s findings unless they are clearly wrong or the trial justice\nmisconceived or overlooked material evidence on a controlling issue.” Id. at 1222 (quoting State\nv. LaCroix, 911 A.2d 674, 679 (R.I. 2006)).', '1', 'Prior Knowledge', 'First, defendant argues that his motion to dismiss should have been granted because he\nwas “without knowledge that his actions were disturbing.” He argues that, in the absence of', '-7-\nevidence that he approached the complainants, contacted them directly, or knew that his actions\nwere disturbing or unwanted, his case should have been dismissed under the provisions of Rule\n29. To buttress his argument, defendant cites to our previous stalking cases, including State v.\nStierhoff, 879 A.2d 425 (R.I. 2005); State v. Breen, 767 A.2d 50 (R.I. 2001); and State v.\nGrayhurst, 852 A.2d 491 (R.I. 2004). In Stierhoff, 879 A.2d at 428, not only the complainant,\nbut others as well, put the defendant on notice that his attentions were unwanted and unwelcome\nbefore any criminal charges were brought against him. Likewise, in Breen, 767 A.2d at 52-53,\nthe defendant had been previously convicted of stalking the complainant and had been sentenced\nto one year of probation and subjected to a no-contact order. But shortly after his probation\nended, he began to harass the complainant again. Id. at 53. Finally, in Grayhurst, 852 A.2d at\n499-500, the complainant had sought and had been granted two restraining orders against the\ndefendant before the defendant was later charged with stalking.', 'It is our opinion that these cases are not helpful to defendant. In our view, defendant\nmisconstrues not only the holdings of these cases but also the language of § 11-59-2. Although it\nis true that each of the cited cases involved defendants who previously had been notified, at least\ninformally, that their contacts with the complainants were unwelcome, there is utterly no\nfoundation to support an argument that we created a hard-and-fast rule that notice must be given\nto a defendant before criminal stalking charges are justified. Indeed, we foreclosed that precise\nargument in Stierhoff, 879 A.2d at 436, where we said that “there is nothing in the language of §\n11-59-2 to suggest that a criminal defendant must be first served with any such type of official\nwarning before his alarming, annoying, or bothersome conduct falls within the ambit of the\nstatute.”', 'It is significant that the statute prohibits “willfully, maliciously, and repeatedly\nfollow[ing] another person with the intent to place that person in reasonable fear of bodily injury', '-8-\n* * *.” Section 11-59-2(a)(2) (emphasis added). Although the word “following” is not defined\nin the text of the statute, it has been judicially defined elsewhere. For instance, Connecticut\nconstrues the term “following” to require', '“that any following be willful * * * the following must have a predatory thrust to', 'it. [It] does not encompass following that is aimless, unintentional, accidental or', 'undertaken for a lawful purpose. Of course, following implies proximity in space', 'as well as time. Whether someone has deliberately maintained sufficient visual or', 'physical proximity with another person, uninterrupted, over a substantial enough', 'period of time to constitute following will depend upon a variety of differing', 'factors in each case. These are appropriate issues for the trier of fact to decide[.] ”', 'State v. Russell, 922 A.2d 191, 203 (Conn. App. Ct. 2007).', 'Based on the evidence presented at trial, the trial justice found that defendant’s\n“following” did menace and frighten the complainants, and that his testimony was merely\n“fabrication and justification” for the threatening behavior towards the girls. The defendant’s\nrepeated actions over the course of four different days cannot be cast as mere coincidence. On\neach day, he placed himself at Dunkin’ Donuts so that he could see the girls, he arrived at the\nsame time, he clearly knew the car in which they traveled, he was observed peering in the\nwindows of the vehicle, he never purchased anything at the coffee shop, and he used his cell\nphone camera to intimidate the girls by indicating, or at least leading them to believe, that he was\nphotographing them. Because § 11-59-2 neither imputes a requirement that the defendant be\nnotified his actions are disturbing nor requires direct contact with a complainant, we discern no\nerror.', '2', 'Failure to Call Three of the Five Complainants to Testify', 'Second, defendant contends that the state failed to prove that three of the girls were in\nreasonable fear because the state did not call them to testify. We do not agree.', '-9-', 'The trial justice rejected defendant’s argument that testimony by Chloe, Danielle, and\nEmily was necessary to establish that those complainants were in “reasonable fear of bodily\ninjury.” Rather, she found that his intent regarding all five complainants was evident because the\ncomplainants were traveling in the same group. Based on the state’s assertion that the other\nthree complainants would testify to the same facts as Allison and Brianna, the trial justice found\nthat their testimony would have been cumulative and, therefore, unnecessary. “Cumulative\nevidence” is evidence that “tend[s] to prove the same point to which other evidence has been\noffered.” State v. Lynch, 854 A.2d 1022, 1032 (R.I. 2004) (quoting State v. Coleman, 478\nN.W.2d 349, 358 (Neb. 1992)). “[T]o qualify as ‘cumulative,’ the evidence in question need not\nbe introduced only after other evidence tending to prove the same point already has been\nadmitted. Rather, the test is a retrospective one, administered at the close of all the evidence * *\n*.” Id. After reviewing the record, we agree that the testimony of the remaining girls would\nhave been cumulative in light of Allison’s and Brianna’s testimony and would have added very\nlittle to the information the trial justice received in the course of trial.', 'Indeed, it is our opinion that the testimony of the remaining complainants was not\nnecessary. We do not agree with defendant’s argument that § 11-59-2 creates a subjective\nstandard that requires that a victim actually be in reasonable fear of bodily injury. Section 11-\n59-2(a) defines the essential element of the crime in objective terms—whether the fear of bodily\ninjury is “reasonable”—and the testimony of the three complainants was not necessary to\nestablish it. Simply put, the complainant’s subjective fear is irrelevant: the statute requires only\nthat the defendant intend to place another person “in reasonable fear of bodily injury” by\n“harass[ing]” or “willfully, maliciously, and repeatedly follow[ing]” that person. Id. (emphasis\nadded).', '- 10 -', 'It has not been disputed that the same girls traveled together and that defendant’s actions\nwere directed toward the entire group. The girls arrived at Dunkin’ Donuts in one car and\nentered and left together as a group. The testimony of Allison and Brianna, together with the\nsurveillance footage, was sufficient evidence for the trial justice to find that defendant directed\nhis actions towards all five complainants with the same intent to place all of them in a reasonable\nfear of bodily injury. The trial justice found that the surveillance video was “worth a thousand\nwords” in establishing that defendant repeatedly correlated his movements with those of the\ngroup on at least four occasions over a span of two weeks. She found that defendant “trailed\nthem in his car,” flashed his lights, and drove in a “frantic and menacing manner around” them.\nShe found that he “placed himself” at Dunkin’ Donuts at the same time and smiled at all of them\nin a “creepy” manner, frightening them. She also found that defendant “made unwelcome\ngestures towards the girls in public,” including aiming his camera at them, and then following\nthem, smiling, “in the midst of a clearly unwelcome pursuit.” We agree with the trial justice that\nall this evidence is sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant undertook these\nactions for the purpose of putting all five girls in reasonable fear of bodily injury.', '3', 'The Remaining Arguments on Appeal', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice erred when she denied his motion to dismiss\nbecause the state failed to prove that the two complainants who did testify were in “reasonable\nfear of bodily injury.” Specifically, defendant points to Allison’s and Brianna’s testimony in\nwhich they said, somewhat defiantly, that they would continue to go to Dunkin’ Donuts despite\ndefendant’s behavior. However, nowhere in the record is it revealed that defendant raised this\nargument before the trial justice.', '- 11 -', 'Likewise, to the extent that the defendant challenges § 11-59-2 as unconstitutionally\nvague and contends that his constitutional right to confrontation has been violated, those issues\nare also not properly before us. A review of the record clearly demonstrates that the defendant\ndid not raise those arguments at any time before the trial justice, including at the post-trial\nhearings on his motions to dismiss. At oral argument, the defendant’s appellate counsel candidly\nconceded this point. By failing to raise those arguments, the defendant denied the trial justice the\nopportunity to rule on these issues, and, for that reason, he cannot assert them now. See\nThornley v.

This Court issued a writ of certiorari to\nreview a Superior Court order denying the state’s request to adjudge Anthony Parrillo a\nprobation violator. The hearing justice’s decision to deny the state’s request was based\nupon his finding that Parrillo was no longer on probation at the time that he allegedly\ncommitted the offense of felony assault. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we\nvacate the order of the Superior Court and remand the case for further proceedings.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'The pertinent facts in this case are not in dispute. In March 1982, Parrillo was\ncharged with two separate counts of murder.

Section 12-19-8(a) provides, in relevant part, that the sentencing\ncourt “may impose a sentence and suspend the execution of the sentence, in whole or in\npart, or place the defendant on probation without the imposition of a suspended\nsentence[,]” and that such “suspension shall place the defendant on probation for the time', '-7-\nand on any terms and conditions that the court may fix.” We have interpreted § 12-19-8\nas granting a sentencing justice a wide range of discretion when imposing a sentence so\nlong as that sentence does not conflict with any other statutory provision. See Rose, 92\nA.3d at 909. Next at play are §§ 42-56-24 and 12-19-2(a). Section 42-56-24 authorizes\nthe DOC to mitigate a defendant’s sentence by rewarding a prisoner’s good behavior and\nindustriousness with credits towards his or her sentence (herein, good-time credits);\nmeanwhile, § 12-19-2(a) requires that “if the punishment to be imposed [at sentencing] is\nimprisonment, the sentence or sentences imposed shall be reduced by the number of days\nspent in confinement while awaiting trial and while awaiting sentencing” (herein, time-\nserved credit). This Court’s recent decision in Rose, 92 A.3d at 907-13, dealt with the\ninterplay of these statutory provisions in light of a mandatory-minimum sentence.', 'In Rose, 92 A.3d at 907, this Court was tasked with deciding “[w]hat effect, if\nany, [did the defendant’s] credits for (1) good time and (2) time served have on the total\nlength of his sentence[.]” Alexander Rose (Rose) had pled nolo contendere to one count\nof first-degree child molestation and was sentenced to twenty years—the mandatory\nminimum at that time pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 11-37-8.2.9 Rose, 92 A.3d at 905. At the\nsentencing hearing, the Superior Court justice stated that: “the defendant [was] sentenced\nto 20 years at the ACI, eight years to serve, credit retroactive to December 23, 1992, the\nbalance, 12 years, suspended, and upon release the defendant is placed on 12 years\nprobation.” Id. Rose was subsequently released from the ACI on parole on December 17,\n1997, as a result of receiving time-served and good-behavior credits. Id. at 905-06. In\nJuly 1999, Rose completed his parole without incident and, in 2010, he filed a petition for\n9', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-37-8.2 has since then been amended to a twenty-five-year\nmandatory minimum sentence. See P.L. 2006, ch. 206, § 3.', '-8-\na writ of habeas corpus and an application for post-conviction relief—specifically\nrequesting to be discharged from probation. Id. at 906.', 'Rose asserted that his\nprobationary period ended in July 2011—twelve years after his successful completion of\nparole.10 Rose relied on the sentencing justice’s assertion at sentencing that his twelve-\nyear probationary term would commence “upon release” from the ACI. Id. at 908.', 'In our opinion affirming the dismissal of Rose’s petition, this Court analyzed the\nlanguage of § 42-56-24’s good-time credits. Rose, 92 A.3d at 907-11. We held that the\nplain language of the good-time-credit statute suggested that the “only form of mitigation\ncontemplated in that provision [was] a reduction of the amount of time that a defendant\nmust spend incarcerated.” Id. at 908. Thus, any mitigation of Rose’s sentence under §\n42-56-24 did not change or reduce his twenty-year sentence, but instead reduced the time\nthat he would be confined at the ACI. See Rose, 92 A.3d at 908. In response to Rose’s\nargument that he relied on the statements made by the sentencing justice that he would be\non probation for twelve years “upon release from the ACI,” we acknowledged that:', '“Although we have previously interpreted § 12-19-8 as', 'affording a trial justice the discretion to determine when a', 'prisoner’s term of probation will commence, * * * we have', 'also held that a sentencing justice’s pronouncement about', 'the commencement of probation will not be given effect to', 'the extent that it conflicts with another statutory provision.', '“* * * [W]e conclude[d] that there [was] no authority', 'which would allow the sentencing justice’s words to', 'effectively reduce the total length of Rose’s sentence below', 'the mandatory minimum.” Rose, 92 A.3d at 908, 909.', 'In analyzing time-served credits pursuant to § 12-19-2(a), we held that although\nRose “intellectualized [his] situation differently than the defendant” in State v.\n10', 'In his filings, Rose had also argued that his probation ended on December 17, 2009—\ntwelve years after the date of his release from the ACI on parole.

Id. at 907.', '-9-\nBergevine, 883 A.2d 1158 (R.I. 2005) (mem.), in essence Rose sought the same outcome\nthat this Court rejected in Bergevine, i.e.,—that Rose’s probation start and end date be\ndated back due to the fifteen-month credit that he received for time served. Rose, 92 A.3d\nat 912. In Bergevine, we decisively rejected the defendant’s argument that he was not on\nprobation at the time of an alleged probation violation because the approximate nine-\nmonth time-served credit made his ten-year sentence, including his probation, retroactive.\nBergevine, 883 A.2d at 1158-59. Accordingly, we concluded in Rose, as had the hearing\njustice, that “neither Rose’s credits for good time nor his credits for time served entitled\nhim to an acceleration of the end date of his probationary term.” Rose, 92 A.3d at 912.', 'In the case under review, the state argues that this Court should apply Rose and,\nin view of its holding, reverse the hearing justice’s decision and his finding that Parrillo\nwas not on probation at the time of the 2011 incident. The state also argues that any\nattempt to distinguish Rose from this case lacks merit.', 'In response, and in support of\nParrillo’s assertion that he was not on probation at the time of the 2011 incident, Parrillo\nraises three key arguments. First, he argues that Rose is inapplicable to his case, as Rose\nrelied heavily on State v. Jacques, 554 A.2d 193 (R.I. 1989),11 and State v. Dantzler, 690\nA.2d 338 (R.I. 1997),12 two cases that were decided after Parrillo’s 1986 sentencing.\nSecond, Parrillo argues that even if Rose is applicable, it is distinguishable from his case,\nas Rose dealt with a mandatory minimum sentence and whether the words of a sentencing\njustice, together with both the defendant’s good-time and time-served credits, could in\n11', 'In State v. Jacques, 554 A.2d 193, 196 (R.I. 1989), we first announced that a\nprobationary period began at imposition of a sentence, even if that meant at the\ncommencement of incarceration.\n12', 'In State v. Dantzler, 690 A.2d 338, 341-42 (R.I. 1997), we held that the trial court\ncould revoke a probationary term on the basis of criminal acts committed after imposition\nof sentence but before the actual probationary portion of sentence commenced.', '- 10 -\neffect lower the defendant’s sentence to less than the statutory minimum. However, here,\nParrillo argues that, unlike Rose, “there was no possibility that the combined length of\n[the] time [he] will spend incarcerated and on probation will fall below [the minimum\nmandatory term] if the sentencing justice’s words ‘upon release’ are allowed to control.”\nLastly, Parrillo argues that principles of estoppel apply as a matter of due process, barring\nthe state from seeking to adjudge him a probation violator.', 'Rose is central to our analysis of the state’s petition and to our application of\ngood-time credits, time-served credits, and § 12-19-8 to this case. Here, Parrillo, like\nRose, claims that the sentencing justice’s pronouncement that his probationary term was\nto begin “upon [his] release from the ACI” is binding pursuant to the authority granted to\na sentencing justice, implying that the clock on his probationary term should have started\nticking when he either was released on parole or had successfully completed parole. We\nreject, however, Parrillo’s contention that Rose does not apply because it was predicated\non two decisions decided after he was sentenced. It is well established that a judicial\ninterpretation of a statute “relates back” to the date the statute was enacted and, unlike\nlegislative action, does not implicate ex post facto considerations. State v. Barber, 767\nA.2d 78, 79-80 (R.I. 2001) (rejecting the defendant’s contention that Dantzler and\nJacques were inapplicable to his case because they were decided after he was sentenced).', 'Moreover, this Court appreciates that here, unlike in Rose, if Parrillo’s probation\nwere to “commence upon [his] release from the ACI,” it would not reduce his sentence\nbelow the mandatory minimum. See Rose, 92 A.3d at 909. The reduced sentence, which\nwould range between seventeen and twenty-three years, depending on the operative', '- 11 -\ndate,13 would be well above the ten-year mandatory-minimum for second-degree murder,\npursuant to G.L. 1956 § 11-23-2. It is our opinion, however, that this distinction does not\nrequire us to stray away from our clearly articulated interpretation of the good-time and\ntime-served credit statutes enunciated in Rose, and the effect that these credits have on\nthe length of a defendant’s overall sentence, nor does this distinction warrant a different\noutcome. Rose, 92 A.3d at 912, was clear—neither Parrillo’s “credits for good time nor\nhis credits for time served entitle[] him to an acceleration of the end date of his\nprobationary term[,]” because the DOC does not have the “power to modify the overall\nlength of a judicially imposed sentence * * *.” Id. at 911.14 The power to reduce a\nsentence, either directly or indirectly, is reserved to the judiciary.15 Id.', 'Here, the\nsentencing justice sentenced Parrillo to thirty years. Although § 12-19-8 permitted the\nsentencing justice to suspend a portion of the sentence, as he chose to do, any suspended\nor probationary period did not reduce the sentence from what he specifically articulated\nwas thirty years.\n13', 'If his probation were to begin upon his physical release from the ACI in 1993, his\nsentence would end in 2003, seventeen years after it was imposed in 1986. If his\nprobation were to begin upon his release from parole in 1999, his sentence would end in\n2009, twenty-three years after it was imposed.\n14', 'We are of the opinion that the dissent’s conclusion that the General Assembly has, by\nstatute, modified Parrillo’s sentence is incorrect and not supported by our well-settled\nconstitutional jurisprudence. The sentence imposed in this case is a final judgment of\nconviction by the Superior Court. A final judgment may be reopened or amended only\naccording to law and in the exercise of judicial power. See Taylor v. Place, 4 R.I. 324,\n363 (1856) (“the exercise of judicial power [is] prohibited to the general assembly”\npursuant to the Constitution of Rhode Island).\n15', 'A recent amendment to Rule 35 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure\nnow provides a vehicle to amend a sentence. Rule 35(c) provides that: “At any time after\na defendant has served at least three (3) years of a term of probation in the community,\nthe probation unit of the department of corrections, either at a defendant’s request or\nadministratively, may review the defendant’s case history and recommend amending the\ndefendant’s sentence to terminate the defendant’s probation.”', '- 12 -', 'Accordingly, because Parrillo was sentenced on January 21, 1986, to a thirty-year\nterm, and because the effect of his good-time or time-served credits reduced his period of\nincarceration, but did not reduce the overall length of his sentence, his sentence officially\nended on January 21, 2016—thirty years later.', 'Consequently, the hearing justice\ncommitted an error of law in finding that Parrillo was not on probation at the time of the\n2011 incident. Because we hold that Parrillo was on probation and subject to being\nadjudged a violator at the time of the 2011 incident, we must now address whether the\nhearing justice committed an error of law when he held that the doctrine of equitable\nestoppel did not bar the state from seeking to adjudge Parrillo a probation violator.', 'B', 'Equitable Estoppel', 'Parrillo argues that the state should be estopped from seeking to adjudge him a\nprobation violator by invoking the doctrine of equitable estoppel because he relied, to his\ndetriment, on the representation made by the DOC in the form of the 2009 letter\ninforming him that he had completed his probationary term. Parrillo attested that he\n“conducted [himself] at all times as though [he] was not on probation” in reliance to the\nrepresentation made. In response, the state insists that Parrillo has failed to meet the\nnecessary elements of the equitable estoppel doctrine.', 'Necessary “to the successful invocation of the doctrine of equitable estoppel is the\nestablishment of: ‘[F]irst, an affirmative representation or equivalent conduct on the part\nof the person against whom the estoppel is claimed which is directed to another for the\npurpose of inducing the other to act or fail to act in reliance thereon; and secondly, that\nsuch representation or conduct in fact did induce the other to act or fail to act to his', '- 13 -\ninjury.’” Faella v.

As we have previously noted, this authority is limited to the judiciary. See\nRose 92 A.3d at 910-11. Accordingly, neither the administrative agent nor any member\nof the DOC had the power to determine when Parrillo had completed his probationary\nperiod.', 'Moreover, in Romano v. Retirement Board of the Employees Retirement System\nof Rhode Island, 767 A.2d 35, 37-38 (R.I. 2001), a retiree sought to invoke the equitable\nestoppel principle against the state which, through a retirement system counselor, had\nprovided wrong information regarding the retiree’s retirement benefits. The retiree’s\nclaims failed because neither the counselor nor the board’s executive director possessed\nany authority to “vary or contradict” state law.

See\nFaella, 111 A.3d at 357. Our law is clear that no element of the equitable estoppel claim\ncan be left to speculation, and, in any event, we agree with the hearing justice that to even\nattempt to apply the doctrine of equitable estoppel to these facts is “absurd.” See id. It\nwould be preposterous for Parrillo to claim that a letter informing him that his\nprobationary period had ended in 2009 induced him to commit the alleged felony assault\nin 2011, let alone for him to claim that the DOC employee actually intended to induce\nhim to commit such act as the doctrine of equitable estoppel requires.17', 'Accordingly, it is our opinion that the hearing justice’s denial of Parrillo’s\nequitable estoppel claim was not an error of law.', 'C', 'Due Process', 'Parrillo’s equitable estoppel argument is firmly predicated upon principles of due\nprocess.

Like § 42-54-24, § 12-19-2 speaks of reducing the “sentence,” as\nopposed to the period of incarceration.', 'Now, the majority extends the holding in Rose to all probationers, finding that\ngood-time and time-served credits do not reduce the length of a defendant’s overall\nsentence, irrespective of whether such a reduction would bring that sentence below a\nmandatory minimum. I disagree because the statutes clearly say that good-time credits\nshould “be deducted from the term or terms of sentence of that prisoner * * *” and time-\nserved credits should be “reduced” from the sentence.', 'Both statutes are clear and\nunambiguous. Notably, neither statute limits deductions or reductions to only the time of\nincarceration.', 'The gravamen of my dissent lies in the distinction between “sentence” and\n“imprisonment.” In addition to incorporating my dissent in Rose, I also observe that\n“sentence” is defined as “[t]he judgment that a court formally pronounces after finding a\ncriminal defendant guilty; the punishment imposed on a criminal wrongdoer.” Black’s\nLaw Dictionary 1569 (10th ed. 2014). Meanwhile, “imprisonment” is “[t]he act of\nconfining a person, [especially] in a prison.” Id. at 875. Accordingly, it is my opinion\nthat the only conclusion that can be drawn is that, when the General Assembly enacted', '- 19 -\nthe legislation in question and used the term “sentence,” it was referring to the entirety of\nthe judgment imposed against the defendant—i.e., both the period of incarceration and\nthe probationary period. And, when the General Assembly referred to “imprisonment,” it\nspoke of only the period in which a defendant is incarcerated. Thus, when the General\nAssembly mandated that good-time credits be “deducted” from a defendant’s “sentence”\nand that a defendant’s “sentence * * * shall be reduced” by the amount of time served\nwhile awaiting trial and sentencing, I am led to what I consider to be the obvious\nconclusion that the General Assembly intended good-time and time-served credits to act\nto reduce the entirety of a defendant’s sentence, and not just that defendant’s period of\nincarceration.19', 'Despite my dissent in Rose, I accept, as I must, that the holding in that case is\nnow the law in this state. Nevertheless, I do not believe that the holding in Rose is\napplicable here because the issue before us is simply not the same; the reductions that\nParrillo received to his sentence did not bring that sentence below a mandatory minimum.\nThe majority’s opinion in Rose was, in substantial part, driven by the conflict between\nG.L. 1956 § 11-37-8.2, which imposed a mandatory minimum sentence, and §§ 42-56-24\nand 12-19-2, the good-time and time-served statutes. Here, no such conflict exists.\nAccordingly, it is my opinion that the statutory interpretation that I endorsed in Rose\nshould control; under that interpretation, Parrillo’s probation would have ended by the\ntime of his December 2011 arrest. As a result, it is my opinion that the order of the\nSuperior Court should be affirmed.\n19', 'The majority says that the Department of Corrections has no authority to reduce a\nsentence, but it is the General Assembly that set the sentence by statute. Through the\nenactment of G.L. 1956 § 42-56-24 and G.L. 1956 § 12-19-2, the General Assembly has\nmodified the sentence, also by statute.', '- 20 -\nSTATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND', 'PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS', 'SUPREME COURT – CLERK’S OFFICE', 'OPINION COVER SHEET\nTitle of Case', 'State v.

81,"State : v. : Jeffrey Alston, a/k/a Kam Ausar. : ORDER The defendant, Jeffrey Alston 1 (defendant or Alston), appeals from the Superior Court’s
denial of his motion for a sentence reduction. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral
argument on December 4, 2013, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show
cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering
the parties’ arguments and memoranda, we are of the opinion that this appeal may be decided at
this time without further argument or briefing. For the reasons set forth in this order, we vacate
the judgment of the Superior Court and remand for further proceedings. The travel of this case has spanned over a decade. See State v. Alston, 900 A.2d 1212
(R.I. 2006) (Alston I) and State v. Alston, 47 A.3d 234 (R.I. 2012) (Alston II). The following
brief history contains only those facts relevant to the instant appeal.
1 The defendant legally changed his name to “Kam Ausar.” He agreed, however, to the use of his
birth name, Jeffrey Alston, at trial. In addition, the indictment and two prior opinions of this
Court use defendant’s birth name. Accordingly, we refer to him here as Jeffrey Alston. -1- On July 9, 2003, a Kent County Superior Court jury convicted defendant of breaking and
entering, conspiring to break and enter, and assault with a dangerous weapon. 2 The trial justice
sentenced defendant to a total of seventeen years to serve. After defendant appealed to this
Court, we vacated his convictions and remanded the case for a new trial. See Alston I, 900 A.2d
at 1221. A second jury convicted defendant on April 7, 2008 of the same three counts. A
different Superior Court justice presided over defendant’s second trial. The second trial justice
sentenced defendant on August 22, 2008 to a total of forty years to serve. Alston, through
counsel, appealed from his second conviction. Shortly after defendant filed the notice of appeal from his second conviction but before
that appeal was docketed, he sent a handwritten letter dated August 27, 2008 to the second trial
justice. With the letter, defendant enclosed a pro se motion in which he sought “to preserve his
rights pursuant to Rule []35 of the Rhode Island Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.”
The following handwritten notation appears on the bottom of defendant’s letter: “Relief is denied. This Court imposed the maximum sentence authorized by law. This was a case which warranted a habitual offender enhancement which was not pursued by the state. No hearing. See Rule 43.”
The second trial justice’s signature and stamp appears below the note. This handwritten denial is
the subject of the instant appeal. On June 22, 2012, this Court affirmed defendant’s second conviction. See Alston II, 47
A.3d at 251. In that opinion, we ordered that the instant appeal be docketed separately from
Alston’s appeal of his conviction. See id. at 241 n.13. Thereafter, on October 3, 2012, while the
2 The defendant was also convicted of a fourth count, assault and battery with serious injury
resulting. Sometime before sentencing, however, the trial justice dismissed this count on the
grounds that it was duplicative of the third count, assault with a dangerous weapon. On remand,
defendant was tried on only the first three counts. -2-
instant appeal was still pending, defendant filed another motion to reduce his sentence under
Rule 35 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. On February 28, 2013, a third
Superior Court justice denied defendant’s second Rule 35 motion. The defendant’s sole contention in this appeal is that the second trial justice deprived him
of his right to a hearing on his motion for a sentence reduction. Rule 35 is silent on a movant’s
right to a hearing. Nonetheless, we have stressed the “importance of the right to a hearing in
most situations where significant liberty * * * interests are involved.” State v. Brown, 865 A.2d
334, 334 n.2 (R.I. 2005) (mem.). We have therefore instructed on more than one occasion that,
“although Rule 35 does not explicitly afford the movant a right to a hearing, ‘a hearing should be
held with respect to such motions absent truly exceptional considerations.’” State v. Chase, 958
A.2d 147, 148 (R.I. 2008) (mem.) (quoting Brown, 865 A.2d at 334 n.2). Nothing in the second
trial justice’s handwritten note suggests that there were truly exceptional considerations
justifying his decision to forgo a hearing on defendant’s motion. Thus, the second trial justice
erred when he denied defendant’s Rule 35 motion without affording defendant a hearing. The state argues, however, that the issue of defendant’s right to a hearing is moot because
defendant received a hearing on his second Rule 35 motion. Indeed, defendant acknowledged at
oral argument that he received a full and fair hearing on his second motion. In light of this
acknowledgement, we would ordinarily agree with the state’s assertion that this issue is moot.
The travel of this case, however, has been anything but ordinary; and, for procedural reasons, we
must disagree with the state. Even though the third trial justice rightfully afforded the defendant the hearing to which
he was entitled, we are constrained to conclude that the third justice lacked jurisdiction to
entertain the defendant’s motion at that time. Due to our express direction in Alston II that the -3-
instant appeal be docketed separately, the papers and jurisdiction remained with this Court
following our affirmation of Alston’s second conviction. Consequently, jurisdiction never
returned to the Superior Court. Since the Superior Court was not vested with jurisdiction at the
time that the third trial justice heard Alston’s second Rule 35 motion, that hearing cannot
properly be said to have rendered the instant appeal moot. Accordingly, the second trial justice’s failure to afford the defendant a hearing requires
us to vacate the judgment denying the defendant’s first Rule 35 motion. This matter is remanded
to the Superior Court with the instruction to hold a hearing on the defendant’s motion to reduce
his sentence. Entered as an Order of this Court, this 9th day of January, 2014. By Order, ___________/s/_________________ Clerk -4- RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet
