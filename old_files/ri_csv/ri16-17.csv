0,Stephen L. Key et al. : v. : Brown University et al. :,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The plaintiffs, Stephen L. Key, as Trustee of the Stephen L. Key Trust – 2008 (the trust), and individually (Key), and Melanie D. Mitchell (collectively, plaintiffs), appeal from a judgment entered in Superior Court in favor of the defendants, Brown University (Brown or Brown University) and the City of Providence (the city). The first count of the plaintiffs’ verified second-amended complaint, which is the sole issue on appeal, sought a declaration that Brown University’s construction of an artificial-turf field hockey field with attendant bleachers, press box, electronic scoreboard, and public-address system was an unlawful use under the Providence zoning ordinances. Ruling that the plaintiffs lacked standing to seek such a declaration, a Superior Court justice granted the defendants’ motions for summary judgment as to count 1 and entered judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. For the reasons explained herein, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Although the issue before us is narrow (viz., whether plaintiffs have standing to pursue a claim for declaratory relief), we find it useful to set forth the nature of the controversy in some detail. This case arises from Brown University’s project to undertake various renovations to the Wendell R. Erickson Athletic Complex (the complex) in Providence. The complex is located at the corner of Hope Street and Lloyd Avenue in the city’s East Side.', 'Brown University purchased the complex in 1957 and has utilized it for the purpose of athletics for more than fifty years. The plaintiffs Key and Mitchell are husband and wife and reside in a 19th century Victorian house owned by the trust (the property). The property is located in the Stimson Avenue Historic District and abuts the field hockey field. At the time Key moved into the property in 1995, the complex had been in use for athletics and entertainment purposes for several decades.', 'In 2010, Brown University was in the preliminary phase of planning several renovations to the complex, including the replacement of a practice soccer field with a new field hockey field. The following spring, Brown University organized several community forums to discuss the proposed project with residents from the surrounding neighborhood. These forums provided an opportunity for the community to raise “questions and concerns” regarding the proposed renovations before the plans were submitted to the city for approval. Key was aware of a forum but chose not to attend. In or about May 2011, Brown University submitted an amendment to its Institutional Master Plan (IMP) to the Providence City Plan Commission (CPC), seeking approval for the various renovations to the complex. According to plaintiffs, the IMP included a sketch depicting the field hockey field in a different location from where it was subsequently', '-2- constructed, and it failed to indicate that the field would include a grandstand, press box, electronic scoreboard, and a public-address system. The IMP did state that the project would include:', '“1) the replacement of the existing natural-turf practice soccer field', 'just south of Stevenson Field with a new Astro[T]urf field for field', 'hockey;', '“2) the replacement of the existing natural-turf on Stevenson Field', 'with Field-turf to allow soccer and lacrosse teams to practice on', 'the field as well as play games;', '“3) the replacement of the existing lights on Stevenson Field with', 'more efficient and lower glare fixtures;', '“4) the replacement of the existing bleachers (1500 seats) on', 'Stevenson Field with a new 2000 seat stadium with restrooms,', 'concessions, and ticketing;', '“5) the construction of a new 300-350 space parking garage', 'immediately adjacent and hidden behind the stadium;', '“6) the installation of ‘neck-downs’ and a flasher on Lloyd Avenue', 'to ensure safe pedestrian crossings near Moses Brown;', '“7) the replacement of an existing damaged storm sewer line', 'running beneath the fields; and', '“8) repair of the traffic light at the intersection of Hope', 'Street/Lloyd Avenue/Brook Street to increase efficiency of the', 'intersection.”', 'Later that summer, on July 19, 2011, the CPC, pursuant to Article IX, § 903.4 of the City of Providence Zoning Ordinances of 1994, as amended, held a public hearing to discuss Brown University’s IMP.1 According to the city, the CPC had previously provided all notice required 1', 'Section 903.4 of Article IX of the City of Providence Zoning Ordinances provides:', '“Meetings and hearings. Meetings of the board shall be held at', 'the call of the chair and at such other times as the board may', 'determine. The chair may administer oaths and compel the', 'attendance of witnesses. Applications for appeals, variances and', 'for special use permits, as authorized in this ordinance may be', 'addressed to the board. Prior to decision on such petitions and', 'appeals, the board shall hold a public hearing on any application', 'for appeal, variance or special use permit in an expeditious', 'manner, after receipt, in proper form, of an application, and shall', 'give public notice thereof at least fourteen (14) days prior to the', '-3- by law—i.e., the Providence zoning ordinances and the Rhode Island Zoning Enabling Act (the act).2 Nevertheless, Key did not attend the meeting nor did he provide the CPC with any written objections.3 At the meeting, the IMP was discussed by city officials and interested parties. As noted above, however, the IMP did not include certain features that form the core of plaintiffs’ current controversy with Brown—specifically, the scoreboard, bleachers, press box, public- address system, and the correct location of the field. The IMP was approved by the CPC on July 22, 2011. Once approved, there was a twenty-day statutory period for an appeal to be filed to the board. The plaintiffs, however, did not appeal this decision.', 'The following spring, on April 11, 2012, before construction commenced, Brown University held an additional community forum to discuss the project with neighbors directly abutting the complex. On this occasion, Brown University hand-delivered letters, dated April 4, 2012, to its closest neighbors to be affected by the construction in the complex. In the letter, Brown University indicated that the forum was to “present[ ] details about the Stevenson Field improvement project, planned for May – September 2012.” In particular, the letter stated that Brown would “be discussing the scope, timeline, details, and mitigation measures involved in the', 'date of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the', 'city.” 2', 'The Rhode Island Zoning Enabling Act (the act) authorizes each city and town council “to adopt, amend, or repeal, and to provide for the administration, interpretation, and enforcement of, a zoning ordinance.” General Laws 1956 § 45-24-50(a). In pertinent part, the act provides:', '“No zoning ordinance shall be adopted, repealed, or amended', 'until after a public hearing has been held upon the question before', 'the city or town council. The city or town council shall first give', 'notice of the public hearing by publication of notice in a', 'newspaper of general circulation within the city or town at least', 'once each week for three (3) successive weeks prior to the date of', 'the hearing * * *.” Section 45-24-53(a). 3', 'At his deposition, Key admitted that, although he “probably” saw the CPC’s advertisements in The Providence Journal, he neither attended the community meetings or forums in the spring of 2011, nor any CPC meetings in 2011.', '-4- project, which [would] include installing a regulation field hockey field (AstroTurf) on the field just east of Meister Kavan, [and] resurfacing Stevenson Field with Field-Turf” among other things. Key acknowledges that he received the hand-delivered letter putting him on notice of the forum; but, nonetheless, he did not attend.4 According to Brown University, construction on the complex began in May 2012.', 'On June 7, 2012, Brown University applied for a building permit for construction of athletic field bleachers at the complex. The permit issued described that Brown was permitted to build a field hockey stadium, a foundation for sport bleachers, and all related site works to construct open bleachers seating with a capacity of 505 occupants and “a combustible press box” on top of the structure at the athletic field. The permit was approved on June 14, 2012.', 'A month later, on July 10, 2012, Brown University personnel met with Key at a conference room in the complex to discuss the project. The following day, Key sent an email to Brown University requesting another meeting with its representatives, this time at the property. On July 12, 2012, Key again met with Brown officials. According to Key, in that meeting, he learned “for the first time” that Brown was installing a public-address system and scoreboard on the field. As a result, Key sent another email to Brown University communicating his concerns about what he believed were misrepresentations made at the July 10 meeting. 4', 'When Key was asked why he did not attend the forum, after receiving the hand-delivered letter, he answered:', '“Because the letter stated that the regulation [field] hockey field', 'was to be put on to Stevenson [F]ield, which did not abut my house', 'and was far away. It did not mention there would be bleachers 60', 'feet from my house. It did not mention that [Brown] would put', 'new lights up there. It did not mention a [public-address] system,', 'and it did not mention the use of heavy equipment without', 'precautionary measures to protect the historic homes. Had it done', 'so, I would have attended, and I would have objected strenuously,', 'but it didn’t, so I didn’t go.”', '-5-', 'Key then sent a letter written to the CPC, addressed to Christopher J. Ise and Jason Martin, principal planners for the Historic District Commission, dated August 2, 2012. In the letter, Key expressed his concern over Brown’s project and also averred that he was “frankly astonished that there was not a more thorough questioning of the Brown University [IMP],” which had been “submitted to the [CPC] for approval.”', 'The following day, August 3, 2012, plaintiffs, through counsel, sent Brown University a cease-and-desist letter, enunciating that the “renovation and new construction * * * ha[d] departed significantly from the IMP approved by the CPC and from representations [that had been] made directly to area residents by representatives of Brown University.” In addition, the letter claimed that “Brown ha[d] failed to inform area residents of the scope and invasive nature of the work that it would employ to accomplish this unapproved construction.”', 'Several weeks later, plaintiffs filed a verified complaint in Superior Court.', 'The complaint named Brown University as defendant and alleged a violation of the applicable law, as it applied to the approved IMP, nuisance, and negligence, and asked the court for injunctive relief and property damages.', 'Thereafter, on September 18, 2012, plaintiffs, again through counsel, sent the city solicitor a letter requesting that the city file suit against Brown University pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 45-24-62 “to enjoin [Brown’s] unlawful use [of the complex] and order the removal of the [field] hockey field * * *.”5 Approximately eight months later, on May 15, 2013, plaintiffs sent a letter to the Department of Inspections and Standards (the DIS), demanding enforcement of Brown University’s IMP. In the letter, plaintiffs summarized the sequence of events for which 5', 'Section 45-24-62 indicates, in pertinent part, that the “[S]upreme [C]ourt and the [S]uperior [C]ourt * * * shall, upon due proceedings in the name of the city or town, instituted by its city or town solicitor, have power to issue any extraordinary writ or to proceed according to the course of law or equity or both[.]”', '-6- they believed that relief should be granted, and enumerated the “[d]eficiencies” in Brown University’s IMP. In closing, plaintiffs stated that “[a] cease and desist order addressed to Brown should issue from the [DIS] forthwith ordering Brown to immediately cease and desist using the [field] hockey field constructed in violation of applicable law and ordering Brown to remove the [field] hockey field and amenities.”', 'The city took no action in response to plaintiffs’ demands, causing plaintiffs to “appeal” from the “decision” of the DIS to the Building Board of Review. In a document dated June 14, 2013, plaintiffs based the appeal on DIS’s failure to respond within the time required by § 801 of Article VIII of the City of Providence Zoning Ordinances.6 According to the city, it did not process plaintiffs’ June 14, 2013, submission because “[t]here is no legal vehicle for ‘appealing’ the [DIS’s] failure to respond to a demand * * *.”', 'Subsequently, on June 20, 2013, Brown University filed a motion for summary judgment as to count 1 of the complaint. In response, plaintiffs filed a motion to amend its complaint on July 24, 2013. Thereafter, on September 11, 2013, plaintiffs filed a verified second-amended complaint (the amended complaint), also naming the city as a defendant in the matter.', 'On October 1, 2013, plaintiffs sent a second demand letter to DIS. In responding to this demand, the city solicitor wrote a letter on October 4, 2013, indicating that plaintiffs’ letter “appear[ed] to be identical to that sent to the [c]ity on May 15, 2013, with the exception of adding [five additional] legal conclusions * * *.” Moreover, the city solicitor averred that the “[c]ity [did] not consider [the letter] to be a request for administrative action that require[d] a 6', 'In pertinent part, § 801 of Article VIII of the City of Providence Zoning Ordinances provides that the “director shall issue a zoning certificate or provide information to the requesting party within fifteen (15) days of the written request. In the event that no written response is provided within that time, the requesting party shall have the right to appeal to the [zoning] board * * *.” See also §1000.26 of Article X of the City of Providence Zoning Ordinances (defining “[b]oard” as “[t]he zoning board of review of the City of Providence”).', '-7- response from the [c]ity.” Furthermore, the letter indicated that the city would “object to any position [plaintiffs] may take that the [c]ity (or the DIS) ha[d] ‘denied’ [plaintiffs’] request, or that its failure to respond [was] evidence that [plaintiffs] lack[ed] redress through the administrative process, or [was] indicative of ‘futility of seeking exhaustion of administrative remedies.’” Subsequent to the city’s response, on October 21, 2013, plaintiffs filed another appeal with the Building Board of Review.', 'In Superior Court, defendants filed answers to the amended complaint.', 'Thereafter, plaintiffs swiftly filed a “cross-motion” for summary judgment against Brown University and the city.', 'On December 2, 2013, Brown University objected to plaintiffs’ “cross-motion” for summary judgment. Shortly thereafter, on December 6, 2013, the city filed its own cross-motion for summary judgment as to count 1 of plaintiffs’ amended complaint. A hearing was held on January 6, 2014, on which occasion the hearing justice denied plaintiffs’ “cross-motion” for summary judgment and granted defendants’ cross-motions for summary judgment. In granting summary judgment, the hearing justice found that plaintiffs lacked standing to seek a declaratory judgment regarding Brown University’s alleged zoning violations and unlawful use of the field.', 'The plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal. In their appeal, plaintiffs contend that the hearing justice erred in: finding that they lacked standing to seek a declaratory judgment against defendants; refusing to exercise his jurisdiction under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (G.L. 1956 chapter 30 of title 9); finding that plaintiffs failed to pursue other avenues of administrative redress; and not considering the exceptions to the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies.', '-8-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“In reviewing the Superior Court’s judgment on the parties’ motions for summary judgment, we examine the matter de novo and apply the same standards as those used by the trial court.” Delta Airlines, Inc. v. Neary, 785 A.2d 1123, 1126 (R.I. 2001). “Summary judgment is appropriate when, viewing the facts and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, the court determines that there are no issues of material fact in dispute, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Id.', 'III', 'Discussion', 'The Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (UDJA) “vests the Superior Court with the ‘power to declare rights, status, and other legal relations whether or not further relief is or could be claimed.’” N & M Properties, LLC v. Town of West Warwick, 964 A.2d 1141, 1144 (R.I. 2009) (quoting § 9-30-1). At the outset, when confronted with a UDJA claim, the inquiry is whether the Superior Court has been presented with “an actual case or controversy.” Id. Without making this determination, the Court will not have jurisdiction to entertain the claim. Id. at 1144- 45.', 'A', 'Standing', 'The plaintiffs argue that the hearing justice erred in holding that they had no standing to seek a declaratory judgment against Brown University for zoning violations and unlawful use of the field hockey field because they “have a personal stake in the outcome of [the] controversy” and suffered and continue to suffer personalized injuries as a direct result of Brown’s violation of', '-9- the Providence zoning ordinances. The city and Brown University each contend that plaintiffs lack standing to compel discretionary action by the city because only the city solicitor can initiate actions with respect to zoning violations. The defendants also argue that plaintiffs lack standing because they did not exhaust their statutory administrative remedies under the act and the ordinance.', 'Justiciability requires that two components be present. N & M Properties, LLC, 964 A.2d at 1145. First, a plaintiff needs the requisite standing to bring suit. Id. Second, the plaintiff also must have “some legal hypothesis which will entitle the plaintiff to real and articulable relief.” Id. (quoting Bowen v. Mollis, 945 A.2d 314, 317 (R.I. 2008)). “The question is whether the person whose standing is challenged has alleged an injury in fact resulting from the challenged statute.” Id. (quoting Rhode Island Ophthalmological Society v. Cannon, 113 R.I. 16, 26, 317 A.2d 124, 129 (1974)). “If he [or she] has, he [or she] satisfies the requirement of standing.” Id. (quoting Cannon, 113 R.I. at 26, 317 A.2d at 129).', 'For questions on standing, “the court must focus ‘on the party who is advancing the claim rather than on the issue the party seeks to have adjudicated.’” N & M Properties, LLC, 964 A.2d at 1145 (quoting Bowen, 945 A.2d at 317). In Cannon, we concluded that standing is satisfied when a plaintiff alleges “that the challenged action has caused him [or her] injury in fact, economic or otherwise[.]” Cannon, 113 R.I. at 22, 317 A.2d at 128 (quoting Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 152 (1970)). Moreover, “[w]e have defined injury in fact as ‘an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized * * * and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.’” N & M Properties, LLC, 964 A.2d at 1145 (quoting Pontbriand v. Sundlun, 699 A.2d 856, 862 (R.I. 1997)). It is also recognized that the personal nature of a plaintiff’s injury must “demonstrate a', '- 10 - personalized injury distinct from that of the community as a whole.” Id. (quoting Meyer v. City of Newport, 844 A.2d 148, 151 (R.I. 2004)).', 'In other words, “when standing is at issue, the focal point shifts to the claimant, not the claim, and a court must determine if the plaintiff ‘whose standing is challenged is a proper party to request an adjudication of a particular issue and not whether the issue itself is justiciable’ or, indeed, whether or not it should be litigated.” Watson v. Fox, 44 A.3d 130, 135 (R.I. 2012) (quoting McKenna v. Williams, 874 A.2d 217, 226 (R.I. 2005)).', 'The second component of justiciability requires that “the facts postulated yield to some conceivable legal hypothesis which will entitle the plaintiff to some relief against the defendant.” N & M Properties, LLC, 964 A.2d at 1145 (quoting Goodyear Loan Co. v. Little, 107 R.I. 629, 631, 269 A.2d 542, 543 (1970)). As we have articulated before, “[w]here a concrete issue is present and there is a definite assertion of legal rights coupled with a claim of a positive legal duty with respect thereto which shall be denied by [an] adverse party, then there is a justiciable controversy calling for the invocation of the declaratory judgment action.” Id. (quoting 1 Anderson, Actions for Declaratory Judgments § 14 at 62 (2d ed. 1951)).', 'Consistent with the legislative intent to exclude individual landowners from instituting “unnecessary and unwarranted litigation” that would “serve only to unduly burden the courts and * * * harass the affected landowners,” Town of Coventry v. Hickory Ridge Campground, Inc., 111 R.I. 716, 724, 306 A.2d 824, 829 (1973) (quoting Town of Lincoln v. Cournoyer, 95 R.I. 280, 286, 186 A.2d 728, 731 (1962)), § 45-24-60(b) bestows upon city and town solicitors the power to initiate suit “in the [S]upreme or [S]uperior [C]ourt, or any [M]unicipal [C]ourt,” to enforce local zoning ordinances “to restrain the violation of, or to compel compliance with, the provisions of its zoning ordinance.” See Zeilstra v. Barrington Zoning Board of Review, 417', '- 11 - A.2d 303, 309 (R.I. 1980) (“[O]nly the municipality, through its town solicitor, may initiate proceedings to enforce local zoning ordinances.”). Under chapter 24 of title 45, the Supreme and Superior Courts may issue extraordinary writs, both in law and equity, “upon due proceedings in the name of the city or town, instituted by its city or town solicitor” to, among other things, compel compliance with any zoning ordinance and issue fines and other penalties. Section 45- 24-62.', 'In the instant controversy, plaintiffs take issue with the hearing justice’s ruling that they lacked standing to seek a declaration that Brown University’s IMP was deficient under applicable laws and that the field’s use is unlawful. Upon careful review of the record, we conclude that, in viewing the facts and all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, plaintiffs have standing because they have suffered an articulable injury in fact. See N & M Properties, LLC, 964 A.2d at 1145 (noting that standing inquiry satisfied when the plaintiff suffered some injury in fact).', 'Historically, issues of standing have often been vexing to tribunals across the nation. Indeed, Chief Justice Earl Warren of the United States Supreme Court noted that standing is one of “the most amorphous [concepts] in the entire domain of public law” and is “surrounded by the same complexities and vagaries that inhere in justiciability.” Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 98-99 (1968). This case is no different. Here, plaintiffs, in their amended complaint, asked the Superior Court to declare the IMP deficient under applicable law and the field’s use unlawful under the act. We must, however, focus on the parties who are advancing the claim and not on the issues to be adjudicated. See N & M Properties, LLC, 964 A.2d at 1145.', 'The plaintiffs assert that they have standing to bring suit because they have suffered particularized injury as a result of the field’s construction and subsequent use—including', '- 12 - physical damage to their home, a decrease in their home’s value, and a diminished use and enjoyment of their property. Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, we conclude that plaintiffs have indeed alleged an injury in fact related to their home—plaintiffs’ allegations as to their home provide measurable economic injuries that they have suffered as a result of Brown’s project. See Town of Coventry, 111 R.I. at 723, 306 A.2d at 828 (“It is such owners of land abutting the proposed campground who are threatened with the special injury of economic loss through property devaluation if the alleged violation of the * * * zoning ordinance continues unabated.”).', 'Accordingly, we must also determine if plaintiffs are the “proper part[ies] to request an adjudication of [the] particular issue * * *.” Watson, 44 A.3d at 135 (quoting McKenna, 874 A.2d at 226). In P.J.C. Realty, Inc. v. Barry, 811 A.2d 1202, 1207 (R.I. 2002), we concluded that the Superior Court has the power to declare the city’s duty to comply with zoning ordinances. In that case, the plaintiffs had brought a UDJA action seeking declaratory judgment against the City of Pawtucket after the city council unanimously denied a request to amend the zoning classification of a particular property. Id. at 1203, 1204. In finding that the issuance of a writ of mandamus was beyond the authority of the Superior Court, this Court held that the Superior Court was, however, within its purview when it declared that: “[t]he City of Pawtucket * * * ha[d] a duty to conform its zoning ordinances and amendments to the City’s Comprehensive Plan * * *.” Id. at 1207.', 'Here, plaintiffs properly asserted relief under the UDJA because of the particular injury they suffered as abutters to Brown. Indeed, plaintiffs’ alleged economic damages stemming from Brown’s construction are an injury in fact for standing purposes under the UDJA. See Canon, 113 R.I. at 22, 317 A.2d at 128. Similar to P.J.C. Realty, Inc., 811 A.2d at 1207, where', '- 13 - the plaintiffs had standing to seek a declaration that the city conform its zoning ordinances and amendments to Pawtucket’s Comprehensive Plan in accordance with Rhode Island General Laws, plaintiffs here asked the Superior Court to make a declaration that the field’s use is unlawful and that Brown’s IMP is deficient under applicable laws.', 'Moreover, plaintiffs emphasize that they are not seeking to compel the city to enforce the zoning ordinance under the UDJA. Rather, they assert, they are “merely seeking a declaration that the zoning violations exist and that Brown and the [c]ity have certain duties and obligations under the [a]ct and the [o]rdinance, which they failed to meet.”', '“Such a declaration is necessary,” they further contend, “to support the[ ] remaining claims” of nuisance and negligence.', 'Section 9-30-1 provides that the Superior Court “shall have power to declare rights, status, and other legal relations whether or not further relief is or could be claimed.” As P.J.C. Realty, Inc., 811 A.2d at 1207, instructs, even though the declaratory-judgment power may not be utilized to compel the city to enforce the zoning regulations, “[t]he Superior Court has the power to construe a statute and to declare the rights and obligations of the parties.”', 'For similar reasons, plaintiffs’ failure to pursue whatever administrative remedies that may have been available to them does not preclude them from seeking declaratory relief under the UDJA. Their ability to challenge the decision of the zoning board has long since passed and, as previously noted, they are not seeking to compel the city to enforce the zoning ordinance. In count 1 of their amended complaint, they pray for a declaration that the IMP submitted by Brown is deficient and that the field hockey field “is an unlawful use under the * * * [z]oning [o]rdinance * * *.” In support thereof, they allege that Brown failed to disclose in its IMP the correct location of the field hockey field and its “intent to construct a five hundred (500) seat', '- 14 - spectator assembly structure, press box, scoreboard and [public-address] system * * *.” On appeal, plaintiffs argue that, if successful, such a declaration would serve as evidence supporting their claims of nuisance and negligence in their amended complaint.', 'As we declared in Taylor v. Marshall, 119 R.I. 171, 180, 376 A.2d 712, 716-17 (1977):', '“[E]ven if it were possible for [the] plaintiffs to obtain relief by', 'administrative methods, the [UDJA] (§ 9-30-1) grants the Superior', 'Court ‘power to declare rights, status, and other legal relations', 'whether or not further relief is or could be claimed.’ * * * [And] §', '9-30-12 states that the [UDJA] is to be ‘liberally construed and', 'administered.’” Moreover, Rule 57 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure provides, in pertinent part, “[t]he existence of another adequate remedy does not preclude a judgment for declaratory relief in cases where it is appropriate.”', 'In the case at bar, the plaintiffs allege that Brown omitted material elements of its construction project from its IMP, thereby depriving the CPC of an opportunity to review “the true project.” As a consequence, the plaintiffs further contend, “[n]o public forums were held with respect to the [field] hockey field location, design and amenities prior to the submission or approval of the [IMP], as required.” As abutting property owners, the plaintiffs have clearly established an injury in fact. Accordingly, we conclude that the hearing justice erred in finding that the plaintiffs have no standing with respect to count 1 of the amended complaint.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court and remand for further proceedings.

The defendant was convicted on three counts of assault with a dangerous weapon and one count of carrying a pistol without a license.

For the reasons set forth herein, we vacate the judgments of conviction.', 'Facts and Travel', 'This case turns on whether a warrantless entry into defendant’s home, after he was placed in the custody of the Providence police, followed by a search and warrantless seizure of a firearm and a can of pepper spray, pass constitutional scrutiny. In considering whether the search exceeded the bounds of reasonableness, we confine our analysis to the evidence presented at the pretrial suppression hearing in Superior Court, upon which the Superior Court justice based his decision denying the motion to suppress.', '-1-', 'In the late evening hours of July 31, 2007—nearly ten years ago—the Providence police received a 9-1-1 call indicating that gunshots had been fired in the Pumgansett Street area of the city.1', 'Patrolman Scott Zambarano (Patrolman Zambarano) responded to the call and was dispatched to the parking lot of a Walgreens located approximately one-half mile from Pumgansett Street. Upon his arrival, Patrolman Zambarano was approached by a man who identified himself as Vito.2 Vito informed Patrolman Zambarano that defendant, who “lived on Pumgansett Street,” had “shot his back window out and beat up his girlfriend.” Patrolman Zambarano, accompanied by his supervisor, Sgt. Roger Aspinall (Sgt. Aspinall), and numerous police officers, in several marked cruisers, responded to defendant’s home—a single-family dwelling located at 19 Pumgansett Street. According to the officers, when they arrived at the scene, the smell of gunpowder was still in the air and the officers noticed shards of broken glass scattered around the street. The officers mistakenly went to the house next door. Patrolman Zambarano subsequently knocked on the front door of 19 Pumgansett and was met by defendant, who exited the house to speak to the officers. He appeared to the officers to be “highly intoxicated.” The defendant stated that there had been a “rift” in front of the house caused by “Spanish kids from the project[s].”', 'The patrolman stated that, at some point during the conversation, defendant became “uncooperative” and “belligerent.” The defendant was seated in a police cruiser until he was identified by Vito as the person with the firearm; he was then placed in handcuffs and returned to the cruiser. 1', 'The delay in this case is attributable to a remand by this Court for the purpose of a hearing on a motion for a new trial. After four years in Superior Court, the motion for a new trial was withdrawn, and the case was returned to this Court for recommencement of this appeal. 2', 'This person subsequently was identified as Vito A. Cocci, the complainant in count 1 of the criminal information that is the subject of this appeal.', '-2-', 'Patrolman Zambarano testified that Stephanie Kruwell (Stephanie), who identified herself as defendant’s fiancée, and her daughter, Samantha Kruwell (Samantha),3 emerged from the house. Samantha informed Patrolman Zambarano that she had been in a fight with her boyfriend and that someone had been pepper-sprayed during the altercation.', 'Patrolman Zambarano testified that he asked the women whether there were any guns inside the house, and Stephanie initially responded in the negative; but she then volunteered that “there were guns in the house” and that the officers could go inside and search. Patrolman Zambarano did not inquire of defendant or Stephanie as to who lived in the house. The officer testified that he assumed that Stephanie and Samantha lived in the house and did not ask her for permission to enter the home, nor did he ask Samantha where she lived.', 'Significantly, when the Superior Court justice pointedly asked Patrolman Zambarano to state the factors that led him to conclude that Stephanie lived in the house, before he entered, he responded, “Just assumption, I guess, your Honor.”', 'Patrolman Zambarano testified that the officers “responded inside the house, and Stephanie pointed out where the gun was in the house.” He stated that Stephanie “pointed out a bureau,” with clothes “stacked on top of the bureau and [she said that] the gun would be under the clothes on the bureau.” Patrolman Zambarano testified that he proceeded to look where she pointed and “found a gun placed in a holster on top of the bureau underneath the clothing.” The witness also testified that the officers searched the area where the gun was found and discovered .38-caliber bullets “on a bureau or in a bureau next to the gun” in defendant’s bedroom. However, the police did not seize the firearm at this time. Rather, the Bureau of Criminal Identification (BCI) was summoned to 19 Pumgansett Street to photograph the evidence; 3', 'In order to differentiate between Stephanie Kruwell and Samantha Kruwell, we shall refer to each witness by her first name only. In doing so, we intend no disrespect.', '-3- additional detectives entered the home and took photographs of both the firearm in defendant’s bedroom and a can of pepper spray that had been discovered in the trash bin.', 'Sergeant Aspinall also testified at the suppression hearing; he said that he was the officer in charge that evening and participated in the search.', 'This witness testified that his first encounter with Stephanie was at the house after defendant had been handcuffed and placed in the cruiser. He testified that, as he approached the house, he encountered a white male subject, later identified as Nathan Spardello, in the front doorway. Because Sgt. Aspinall “didn’t like the way [Nathan] was standing above” him on the step, he had Nathan come down the stairs and “passed him on to a patrol officer,” who was nearby, to be patted down. According to Sgt. Aspinall, Stephanie then “responded to the doorway.” She stood inside the doorway, while he was “talking to her from the outside.” Although the witness recalled that there may have been some pit bulls in the home, this was not “an issue since I was outside of the house.” He testified that he “asked [Stephanie] specifically what had gone on this evening in front of her house.” Stephanie told the sergeant that white girls were in a fight in front of her house, at which point, the sergeant returned to the cruiser where defendant was situated, to try to clarify what had transpired. At that point, he learned from a radio call that pepper spray may have been used in the incident. According to the sergeant’s testimony, he wanted to talk to Stephanie again, so he returned to the doorway and “[o]pen[ed] the screen door to get her attention.” According to the sergeant, Stephanie invited him in. The sergeant admitted that he did not ask Stephanie if she lived in the house, but he “assumed” that she lived there.', 'He testified that, during their conversation, Stephanie was taking care of a young child who was “running around the house, and she was trying to take care of that while talking to me.” Although he did not have much', '-4- contact with Samantha, he recalled that she was also watching the child, who was “going in and out of the house.”', 'Sergeant Aspinall indicated that, when he asked Stephanie if there was pepper spray in the house, her response was no, but that “we could look around.” According to the sergeant, at that point in the investigation, they were looking for pepper spray. Sergeant Aspinall testified that he immediately went to the trash bin, opened the lid, and discovered the can of pepper spray on top of the trash. He then confronted Stephanie, stating, “I know there’s a firearm in this house. Could you tell me where the gun is?” According to the witness, Stephanie responded, “Yes. I’ll go get it for you.” Sergeant Aspinall stopped her and told her that “she could point it out to [Patrolman Zambarano] so that he could grab it.” Patrolman Zambarano accompanied Stephanie into the bedroom and notified Sgt. Aspinall that there was a firearm in defendant’s bedroom. Sergeant Aspinall called in BCI detectives to take photographs.', 'After the BCI detectives entered the home and took photographs of the weapon, it was seized. There was no warrant. Throughout this period of time, defendant—who was the owner of the house and in whose bedroom the gun had been found—was in the back seat of a police cruiser; at no point did the officers ask defendant for consent to enter his home and to search the dwelling; nor did the officers consider utilizing a consent to search form. When Sgt. Aspinall was asked whether he sought permission to search the house or whether Stephanie offered, Sgt. Aspinall responded, “I believe she offered.”', 'Stephanie testified at the suppression hearing and disputed this sequence of events. She testified that she does not live at 19 Pumgansett Street, but rather is a resident of North Providence. However, on July 31, 2007, at approximately 9 p.m., she was with defendant at his home when suddenly she heard a “ruckus going on in front of the house” and noticed a large', '-5- light being shined into the windows of the home. The defendant went outside to investigate and, after he did not return for a period of time, Stephanie went outside and found him handcuffed in the back seat of a police cruiser. Stephanie testified that the officers never asked her what happened, nor did they ask her whether there were any firearms in the house, or whether they could enter the home; rather, the officers “tried to walk right in the house.” Stephanie testified that she informed the officers that they could not go into the home because there were dogs on the premises and “[t]he dogs bite,” and one of the officers responded, “[p]ut the dogs away before I shoot them.” The officers entered the home and began to look around. According to Stephanie, one of the officers looked through the kitchen area, including the trash bin, and found the pepper spray; he then walked toward what she described as the spare bedroom. The officer pointed to the closed door of the spare bedroom and asked what was behind the door. The officer then opened the door, went inside, and looked around. The officer then pointed toward the next closed door, asking what was behind it. Stephanie replied that it “was [defendant’s] bedroom.” The officer entered defendant’s bedroom and “went through a few drawers, laundry basket, [and] moved clothing that was on top of an armoire.” Stephanie denied ever leading the policemen into defendant’s bedroom and pointing out the location of a firearm. Samantha also recounted a similar series of events—that the officers entered the home without permission and “were searching through [defendant’s] room.”', 'At the close of the hearing, the Superior Court justice concluded that the officers “did not ask for consent” to enter into the home, but that “[t]his is not really a consent-to-search case.” Nor was the Superior Court justice of the opinion that he was confronted with an individual clothed with the apparent authority to consent to the entry and search of defendant’s home, such that the seminal case of Illinois v. Rodriguez, 497 U.S. 177 (1990) applied to these facts. The', '-6- Superior Court justice found that “in the first instance[,]” the police were responding to an emergency situation and, therefore, “were lawfully at the premises.” He rejected, as not credible, Stephanie’s testimony that “the police barged into the house uninvited.” Rather, he concluded that the police believed that Stephanie lived in the house, and “the credible evidence is that she invited them in, beckoned them to come in.” The Superior Court justice also declared that the police “had not yet recovered a firearm and knew the firearm had to have been in the house.” And, after Sgt. Aspinall found the pepper spray, it was clear that Stephanie had lied to the police, and it was therefore “proper and appropriate” for Sgt. Aspinall to ask “[w]here’s the gun?,” “particularly when you have a three-year-old running around the house.” The Superior Court justice determined that it was Stephanie who pointed to the area where the gun was found and that “the police would have been foolish and derelict in their duty not to be doing what they were [doing].” Citing this Court’s opinion in State v. Portes, 840 A.2d 1131 (R.I. 2004), the Superior Court justice concluded as follows:', '“[T]here were circumstances present in the case before me that', 'certainly were exigent to the point where the cops had to find that', 'gun, and knew there was a firearm. And, you have a youngster', 'running around in the house. Shots had recently been fired, the', 'gun was not accounted for and there had been a melee recently just', 'before the cops arrived.”', 'The Superior Court justice denied defendant’s motion to suppress; and, after a jury trial, defendant was convicted on three counts of assault with a dangerous weapon and one count of carrying a pistol without a license.4 The defendant timely appealed his conviction to this Court. 4', 'The defendant was sentenced to eight years, with one year to serve, and seven years suspended with probation on each of the four charges, to be served concurrently.', '-7-', 'Standard of Review', '“When confronted with a decision denying a motion to suppress evidence, the Supreme Court accords deference to a trial justice’s findings of historical fact.” State v.

Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 227 (1973)).', 'Analysis', 'Before this Court, defendant argues that the Superior Court justice erred in denying his motion to suppress the incriminating evidence obtained during a warrantless entry and subsequent search of his dwelling.', 'The defendant disputes the existence of exigent circumstances and contends that the warrantless entry and search violated the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, section 6 of the Rhode Island Constitution.', '-8-', 'Although acknowledging that the Superior Court justice rejected the theory that consent based upon apparent authority justified the search, the state nonetheless argues that we affirm the denial of the motion to suppress on the basis of apparent authority. The state contends that Stephanie had the apparent authority to invite the officers into the residence, and that therefore, this search was in compliance with the Fourth Amendment. In addition, the state argues that the Superior Court justice properly concluded that there were exigent circumstances—an emergency—which justified the warrantless search of defendant’s home and seizure of the firearm from his bedroom.', 'It has long been recognized that a warrantless entry by members of law enforcement into a person’s home, whether for an arrest or a search, is prohibited by the Fourth Amendment, in the absence of one of the specific and carefully delineated exceptions to the warrant requirement. See Portes, 840 A.2d at 1136. The starting point for analyzing whether the evidence seized during the warrantless search of defendant’s home is admissible under the Fourth Amendment must begin with a determination of whether the entry by the responding officers was justified as falling within an exception to the warrant requirement. Id.', 'It is well-established that the analysis that is undertaken when law enforcement relies on the apparent authority of a consenting party “is not that they always be correct, but that they always be reasonable.” Rodriguez, 497 U.S. at 185. We undertake this examination in the face of the undisputable facts that neither Stephanie nor Samantha lived in the home; they were not authorized to consent to a search of the premises; and, after defendant was placed in custody, the officers did not ask of anyone if they lived in the home.', '-9-', 'Warrantless Entry', 'The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution clearly provides for “[t]he right of the people to be secure in their * * * houses * * * against unreasonable searches and seizures.” From this amendment derives one of the most fundamental principles of constitutional jurisprudence—that entries and “searches conducted outside the judicial process, without prior approval by [a] judge or magistrate, are per se unreasonable * * * subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.” Duquette v. Godbout, 471 A.2d 1359, 1362 (R.I. 1984) (quoting Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 357 (1967)). It is equally understood that “the Fourth Amendment has drawn a firm line at the entrance to the house. Absent exigent circumstance, that threshold may not reasonably be crossed without a warrant.” Gonzalez, 136 A.3d at 1146 (quoting Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 590 (1980)).', 'The warrant requirement serves to guard the privacy and sanctity of the home from “zealous” police officers “thrust[ing] themselves into a home” while ardently “engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime.” Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S. 10, 13, 14 (1948). However, “because the ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is ‘reasonableness,’ the warrant requirement is subject to certain exceptions.” Brigham City, Utah v. Stuart, 547 U.S. 398, 403 (2006) (citing Flippo v. West Virginia, 528 U.S. 11, 13 (1999); Katz, 389 U.S. at 357).

See Casas, 900 A.2d at 1134.', 'Apparent Authority', 'Our careful examination of the record before us leads us to reject the state’s contention that Stephanie’s purported consent justified the warrantless entry and subsequent search of defendant’s home. “A third party’s consent to [an entry or] search is valid if that person has either the ‘actual authority’ or the ‘apparent authority’ to consent to [entry and] a search of that property.” Linde, 876 A.2d at 1125 (quoting United States v. Kimoana, 383 F.3d 1215, 1221 (10th Cir. 2004)). In order for apparent authority to consent to serve as a justification for a warrantless entry and search, the state bears the burden of proving that the officer reasonably believed that the person who invited the officer into the dwelling, or permitted a search, was authorized to do so, and it is discovered later that the consenting party lacked the authority to consent.', 'See Barkmeyer, 949 A.2d at 999-1000 (“[T]he linchpin of apparent authority is evidence that the police officer entered and/or searched the premises under the reasonable, but mistaken, belief that the person consenting to such entry and/or search had the actual authority to do so.” (citing Rodriguez, 497 U.S. at 186)). In order to establish apparent authority to consent to a warrantless entry and search, the state must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence the factors that were actually relied upon by the police.', 'Crucial to an examination of apparent authority, “‘is whether, based on the information in the officers’ possession, they reasonably believed’ that the consenting individual had the authority to consent to a[n] [entry or] search.” Barkmeyer, 949 A.2d at 1000 (emphasis added', '- 11 - and emphasis omitted) (quoting United States v. Meada, 408 F.3d 14, 22 (1st Cir. 2005)). We look to the totality of the circumstances.', 'The record before this Court fails to establish any factors upon which the officers could reasonably conclude that Stephanie lived in the home. Stephanie was described at various times as defendant’s girlfriend or fiancée. The officers testified that they simply assumed that she lived in the dwelling and they made no inquiry to satisfy themselves that she actually lived there. After defendant was placed in custody, there were several adults and a young child remaining in the house. The officers failed to ask who, if anyone, lived in the house, and they did not ask anyone for identification. Sergeant Aspinall and Patrolman Zambarano testified that they had no real interaction with the other adults.', 'When the Superior Court justice asked Patrolman Zambarano, “[w]hat led you to believe that [Stephanie] lived there?,” the patrolman responded, “Just assumption, I guess.”', 'Similarly, Sgt. Aspinall also testified that, because Stephanie referred to the residence as “her house” when she came outside to speak to the officer, he “assumed it was [Stephanie’s] house.”', 'Although the state points out that Stephanie was defendant’s fiancée and that she was familiar with defendant’s dogs as factors that support the officers’ conclusions, there was no evidence produced to suggest that the officers relied on these factors.', 'This Court recognizes that, in the context of apparent authority, “room must be allowed for some mistakes on [the officer’s] part.” Rodriguez, 497 U.S. at 186 (quoting Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160, 176 (1949)). However, “the mistakes must be those of reasonable men, acting on facts leading sensibly to their conclusions of probability.” Id.

Thus, we agree with the Superior Court justice that this search cannot be justified on the basis of apparent authority to consent. The record is devoid of any facts upon which the officers could formulate a reasonable belief that Stephanie was clothed with apparent authority sufficient to invoke the consent exception to the warrant requirement.', 'Exigent Circumstances', 'We also reject the Superior Court justice’s conclusion that exigent circumstances were present in this case because there was “a youngster running around in the house[,] [s]hots had recently been fired, [and] the gun was not accounted for * * *.” “For this Court to conclude there was an exigency, the ‘ultimate test is whether there is such a compelling necessity for immediate action as will not brook the delay of obtaining a warrant.’” Gonzalez, 136 A.3d at 1151 (quoting United States v. Adams, 621 F.2d 41, 44 (1st Cir. 1980)). In demonstrating a compelling and urgent necessity sufficient to circumvent the constitutional mandate of a warrant, the police “bear a heavy burden[.]” Id. (quoting Welsh v. Wisconsin, 466 U.S. 740, 749 (1984)); see also id. (“[B]efore agents of the government may invade the sanctity of the home, the burden is on the government to demonstrate exigent circumstances that overcome the presumption of unreasonableness that attaches to all warrantless home entries.” (emphasis added) (quoting Welsh, 466 U.S. at 750)).', 'Of course, facts that were not known to the officer at the time of the warrantless entry can never support a finding of exigent circumstances. In passing on the question, we limit our focus to the facts known to the police at the time they enter the dwelling. See Gonzalez, 136 A.3d at 1151-52. “[T]he police [must] have an objective, reasonable belief that a crisis can only be avoided by swift and immediate action.” Id. at 1151 (quoting State v.

Jennings, 461 A.2d 361, 366 (R.I. 1983).', 'In Gonzalez, 136 A.3d at 1152, we were faced with the constitutionality of a warrantless search of the defendant’s residence and subsequent seizure of a firearm, after the police received a report that the defendant had shot and killed somebody. The police testified that they knew the defendant was inside the residence, was armed, and that “there were concerns about destruction of evidence, and that there was a possibility of harm to the public or to [the defendant] himself.” Id. None of those factors carried the day. Although this case is distinguishable from Gonzalez in regard to the amount of time that elapsed between the 9-1-1 call and the warrantless entry, the record before us is wholly devoid of any testimony whatsoever suggesting an urgent need to', '- 14 - search the dwelling or any real and serious consequence that could result from a delay in order to secure the premises and obtain a warrant.', 'It is well-established that, in considering the reasonableness of a warrantless search, “[t]he proper line of inquiry is whether the police reasonably believed, relying upon facts known by them at the time * * * that the warrantless intrusion was necessary to preserve life or avoid serious injury.” Gonsalves, 553 A.2d at 1075-76. The testimony of the intruding officer provides the court with insight into the officer’s motivation for the entry and, therefore, provides the basis for the court’s conclusion that exigent circumstances support the intrusion. See, e.g., State v. Morin, 68 A.3d 61, 67 n.11 (R.I. 2013) (“In most cases, the testimony of the arresting officer should provide the basis for the conclusion that he or she reasonably believed that exigent circumstances existed.”).5', 'The record before this Court demonstrates that neither officer testified that he was concerned about the unsecured firearm or that he was faced with an emergency.

Neither officer testified that time was of the essence or that their unfolding investigation was potentially volatile. Had either officer testified to any of these concerns, or pointed to any reason 5', 'The full footnote reads as follows:', '“In most cases, the testimony of the arresting officer should', 'provide the basis for the conclusion that he or she reasonably', 'believed that exigent circumstances existed.

The record clearly establishes that, at the time of the warrantless entry, defendant—the lone suspect—was in custody in the back seat of a police cruiser. No suspect was attempting to flee the scene; there was no threat of an imminent destruction of evidence; there was no need to provide emergency assistance to anyone in the home; and there were no other suspects, intruders, or victims on the premises.

Indeed, the police did not even notice the child until after they were in the home, and they paid scant attention to the child in any event. A passing observation that there may have been a child “running around the house” will not support a warrantless search based on an emergency.', '- 16 -', 'Similarly there is no evidence supporting the Superior Court justice’s conclusion that the officers felt immediate action was necessary to recover the firearm. Nor are we persuaded that the presence of a firearm gives rise to an exigent circumstance sufficient to circumvent the warrant requirement.

Accordingly, the evidence in this case must be suppressed.', 'Harmless Error', 'Finally, we disagree with the state that the Superior Court justice’s admission of the firearm amounted to harmless error because the firearm served only as “cumulative evidence,” corroborating the testimony of the state’s three witnesses.', 'Harmless error is recognized to be an error that “in the setting of a particular case [is] so unimportant and insignificant that [it] may, consistent with the Federal Constitution, be deemed harmless, not requiring the automatic reversal of the conviction.” State v. Lopez, 943 A.2d 1035, 1043 (R.I. 2008) (quoting Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 22 (1967)). This Court has', '- 18 - acknowledged that “whether or not an error is harmless turns on whether it is reasonably possible that the error contributed to the conviction.” Id. (citing State v. Lachapelle, 112 R.I. 105, 112- 13, 308 A.2d 467, 471 (1973)).', 'In order to effectively conduct a harmless error analysis, the particular evidence must be “quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine [the effect it had on the trial].” State v. Humphrey, 715 A.2d 1265, 1276 (R.I. 1998) (quoting Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 629 (1993)). In cases in which there is “overwhelming additional evidence indicative of [a] defendant’s guilt,” this Court has determined that erroneously admitted evidence constituted harmless error. State v. Perez, 882 A.2d 574, 590 (R.I. 2005).', 'However, judicial error “in admitting plainly relevant evidence which possibly influenced the jury adversely to a litigant cannot * * * be conceived of as harmless.” Lachapelle, 112 R.I. at 113, 308 A.2d at 471 (quoting Chapman, 386 U.S. at 23-24). The burden rests with the state “to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.” Gonzalez, 136 A.3d at 1156 (emphasis omitted) (quoting Chapman, 386 U.S. at 24).', 'This is a case in which the accused was convicted of three counts of assault with a dangerous weapon, to wit, a firearm, and one count of carrying that firearm without a license— charges that require the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had control over a firearm.', 'We are satisfied that the firearm was a critical piece of evidence in the case. The state’s three key witnesses each testified that they observed the defendant with the gun. However, one witness explained that she did not actually observe the defendant firing the weapon.', 'An eyewitness neighbor testified that he witnessed the altercation on Pumgansett Street and that the defendant had nothing in his hands. He testified that the gunshot came from the direction of', '- 19 - Douglas Avenue.', 'In the face of this conflicting testimony, we cannot conclude that the admission of the unlawfully seized evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth herein, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court. The record shall be remanded to the Superior Court for a new trial.', 'Justice Indeglia, with whom Justice Robinson joins, dissenting. Although we agree with the majority’s conclusion that, in view of the ambiguous nature of the facts known to the police, the consent exception to the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, section 6 of the Rhode Island Constitution did not justify a warrantless search, especially into the defendant’s bedroom, we vigorously disagree with its holding that the officers’ actions could not be upheld under the exigent-circumstances exception to the warrant requirement. In our view, the circumstances that confronted the officers on July 31, 2007, called for emergency action; and, for that reason, we voice our respectful but unequivocal dissent.', 'In discerning whether an exigency existed, “[t]he police [must] have [had] an objective, reasonable belief that a crisis can only be avoided by swift and immediate action.” State v. Gonsalves, 553 A.2d 1073, 1075 (R.I. 1989) (quoting Duquette v. Godbout, 471 A.2d 1359, 1363 (R.I. 1984)). Such is the case before us.', 'While the majority has outlined the facts of this case in detail, we highlight those facts that are reflective of the exigency that the officers faced. Around 9:30 p.m. on July 31, 2007, officers responded to a radio dispatch concerning shots fired on Pumgansett Street in Providence. When one patrol arrived at the scene, the gunfire was so recent that the officers testified that the smell of gunpowder still permeated the air. An officer also saw broken glass in the street. At the', '- 20 - same time, another patrol was dispatched to a nearby Walgreens pharmacy, where a person claiming to be a victim said that defendant had shot out the back window of his car and had beaten up his girlfriend. It was also learned that one of the victims had been pepper-sprayed. Locating defendant’s house with the victim’s assistance, officers knocked on the door at 19 Pumgansett Street and defendant answered.', 'Seemingly intoxicated and noticeably uncooperative, he acknowledged that there had been a fight outside, but he was of little help beyond that. One of the officers, Sgt. Aspinall, conducted a show-up of defendant, with the witness identifying defendant as the person who had discharged the firearm. Although the officers had identified defendant as the suspect who allegedly fired the gun, the weapon and the pepper spray involved in the altercation had not yet been found or accounted for.', 'Following defendant’s detention, the officers’ investigative efforts determined that a domestic dispute was at the heart of the incident. Samantha Kruwell, who was present at defendant’s house, told the officers that there had been a fight between her and her ex-boyfriend immediately outside the Pumgansett Street house.1 Officers observed that Stephanie Kruwell, defendant’s fiancée and Samantha’s mother, had a bloody cut on her hand from her attempt to break up the fight.', 'Stephanie and Samantha were not entirely forthright in their responses to the officers. Apart from her recounting of that night’s events that conflicted with defendant’s, Stephanie initially told the officers that there were no guns in the house. She then reversed course and admitted that there was a gun, and, as the trial justice found, she allowed the officers to enter the home to determine its whereabouts. It was at this point that the officers saw “a young child running around the house,” as Stephanie and Samantha tried to attend to him. After being 1', 'The ex-boyfriend was later identified as Nathan Spardello.', '- 21 - directed by Stephanie to defendant’s room, the officers conducted a brief, limited search, which turned up a gun under a pile of clothing along with several loose bullets. The Bureau of Criminal Identification unit was called to retrieve the gun.', 'We agree that “[a]t the core of the privacy protected by the Fourth Amendment is the right to be let alone in one’s home.” Sutterfield v. City of Milwaukee, 751 F.3d 542, 550 (7th Cir. 2014).', 'Nevertheless, we afford protection to an officer’s “[o]n the spot reasonable judgments * * * about risks and dangers * * * .” Fletcher v. Town of Clinton, 196 F.3d 41, 50 (1st Cir. 1999). “Deference to those judgments may be particularly warranted in domestic disputes” where “violence may be lurking and explode with little warning.” Id. An officer is not required to wait until the anticipated danger—whether to himself or herself or to the public— comes to fruition. See Brigham City, Utah v. Stuart, 547 U.S. 398, 406 (2006) (Brigham City) (“The role of a peace officer includes preventing violence and restoring order, not simply rendering first aid to casualties * * *.”); see also Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U.S. 385, 392 (1978) (“The need to protect or preserve life or avoid serious injury is justification for what would be otherwise illegal absent an exigency or emergency.”) (quoting Wayne v. United States, 318 F.2d 205, 212 (D.C. Cir. 1963) (opinion of Burger, J.)).', 'The instant case presents such a setting. The defendant’s arrest did very little to address the underlying domestic dispute that served as the catalyst to the fight and ultimate shooting. Indeed, his arrest may have added more fuel to the fire. Although the officers were unfamiliar with Samantha and Stephanie, they knew that they had been recent active participants in a fight in the street. They saw Stephanie’s bloodied hand from the altercation and they learned from Samantha that she had been in the fight. Leaving the scene without seeking the gun, the officers would have left Samantha and Stephanie with the means to pursue their earlier aggressors.', '- 22 - Whether they would have acted upon such a motivation is not something the officers could have ruled out based on the information known to them at that time. As the trial justice noted, “Frankly, the police would have been foolish and derelict in their duty not to be doing what they were.”', 'Moreover, “[w]arrantless entries are justified to protect not only victims and fellow police officers, but also innocent bystanders and suspects themselves.” Gonsalves, 553 A.2d at 1075; see also State v. Kendrick, 100 A.3d 821, 837 (Conn. 2014) (deeming reasonable the police entrance into the bedroom under the exigent-circumstances doctrine based on the officers’ reasonable belief “that the entry was necessary for their own protection, as well as the protection of others in the apartment”). Exigent circumstances are found when an officer anticipates that someone in the home, whether a child or an adult, will be harmed by a firearm. See, e.g., United States v. Hardy, 52 F.3d 147, 149 (7th Cir. 1995) (holding that exigent circumstances justified the warrantless entry and search of the defendant’s motel room where the police officers reasonably believed that the defendant, with a sawed-off shotgun, was a threat to the officers and the women and children in the room); State v. Christensen, 663 N.W.2d 691, 696 (S.D. 2003) (“[T]he house was unlocked and unwary children could have entered to take possession of loaded firearms.”).', 'Here, the officers could reasonably have believed that it was necessary to secure the gun before either the heated domestic dispute reignited or, perhaps worse, the young child located the unsecured firearm. See United States v. Janis, 387 F.3d 682, 688 (8th Cir. 2004) (upholding a warrantless search of a home for a gun that discharged and injured the defendant because the officer testified that he had concerns that a loaded weapon was “out in the open” and “still at the scene”); United States v. Antwine, 873 F.2d 1144, 1145-47 (8th Cir. 1989) (During a protective', '- 23 - sweep following the arrest of a robbery suspect who brandished a gun, an officer found a young boy and girl inside the home. Denying the motion for suppression, the court stated that “a warrantless seizure of a weapon may be considered ‘reasonable’ within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment when justified by an officer’s legitimate concern for someone’s safety.”).', 'The majority opinion suggests that a subjective analysis is employed when determining whether the exigent-circumstances exception vindicates a warrantless search. Specifically, it states that: “The testimony of the intruding officer provides the court with insight into the officer’s motivation for the entry and, therefore, provides the basis for the court’s conclusion that exigent circumstances support the intrusion.” (Emphasis added.) This conclusion, however, misconstrues the controlling standard for assessing whether a warrantless search is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment because the officer’s motivation is of no moment. In fact, the United States Supreme Court has explicitly rejected this approach. See Brigham City, 547 U.S. at 404 (setting forth the United States Supreme Court’s explicit view that, for purposes of the Fourth Amendment’s reasonableness analysis, “[t]he officer’s subjective motivation is irrelevant”); Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. 806, 813 (1996) (explaining the United States Supreme Court’s unwillingness “to entertain Fourth Amendment challenges based on the actual motivations of individual officers”).', 'In Brigham City, 547 U.S. at 406-07, the United States Supreme Court held that the exigent-circumstances exception justified the police officers’ warrantless entry. The defendant in that case, which involved an altercation observed at a 3 a.m. house party, argued that police entry was unreasonable based on the officers’ subjective motivations, asserting that they “were more interested in making arrests than quelling violence.” Id. at 400-02, 404. In rejecting this argument, the Supreme Court made clear that the Fourth Amendment’s reasonableness analysis', '- 24 - “has nothing to do with discerning what is in the mind of the individual officer conducting the search”; id. at 405; rather, “[a]n action is ‘reasonable’ under the Fourth Amendment, regardless of the individual officer’s state of mind, ‘as long as the circumstances, viewed objectively, justify [the] action.’” Id. at 404 (quoting Scott v. United States, 436 U.S. 128, 138 (1978)); see also Bond v. United States, 529 U.S. 334, 338 n.2 (2000) (“The parties properly agree that the subjective intent of the law enforcement officer is irrelevant in determining whether that officer’s actions violate the Fourth Amendment. * * * [T]he issue is not his state of mind, but the objective effect of his actions.”); Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 397 (1989) (“[T]he subjective motivations of the individual officers * * * ha[ve] no bearing on whether a particular seizure is ‘unreasonable’ under the Fourth Amendment.”).', 'By shifting the focus to “the officer[s’] motivation for the entry,” the majority has erroneously applied a subjective analysis to determine whether an exigency existed. When the circumstances are examined objectively, however, the officers’ entry was clearly justified under the exigent-circumstances exception. State v. Morin, 68 A.3d 61, 67 n.11 (R.I. 2013) (citing Brigham City, 547 U.S. at 404). Although the officers did not specifically state that they were “faced with an emergency” or “concerned,” they did testify about the actual circumstances that confronted them: shots had recently been fired; there had been a street fight between Samantha and her ex-boyfriend; someone had been pepper-sprayed; and the officers had been told that there was a firearm in the house where, as the majority noted, a young child “was running around.” Here, “the circumstances, viewed objectively, justify [the officers’] action[s].” Id. (quoting Brigham City, 547 U.S. at 404).', 'Finally, we do not agree with the majority that the officers should have secured the premises and somehow removed the occupants from the house while they went about seeking a', '- 25 - search warrant. Rather, this case was “defined by a time-urgent need to act that [made] resort to the warrant process impracticable.” Sutterfield, 751 F.3d at 559. It was not “early on a weekday afternoon” when “‘the amount of time necessary to obtain a warrant’ likely would have been minimal”; rather, it was “late in the evening * * * when officers might not have had ready access to a magistrate.” United States v. Menchaca-Castruita, 587 F.3d 283, 294 (5th Cir. 2009) (quoting United States v. Rico, 51 F.3d 495, 501 (5th Cir. 1995)). As this Court stated in Gonsalves, 553 A.2d at 1076, “Swift action was imperative. Any delay in obtaining a warrant at one o’clock in the morning could have ignited an already volatile situation.”', 'From our view, this case falls squarely within the applicability of the exigent- circumstances exception because the above-mentioned circumstances precisely demonstrate “such a compelling necessity for immediate action as will not brook the delay of obtaining a warrant.” State v. Gonzalez, 136 A.3d 1131, 1151 (R.I. 2016) (quoting United States v. Adams, 621 F.2d 41, 44 (1st Cir. 1980)). “[P]olice are in the emergency service business and they usually have little or no time to leisurely consider their options or engage in protracted evaluation.” Id. (quoting State v. Portes, 840 A.2d 1131, 1137 (R.I. 2004)). The United States Supreme Court has underscored that “[t]he calculus of reasonableness must embody allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments—in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving.” Kentucky v. King, 563 U.S. 452, 466 (2011) (quoting Graham, 490 U.S. at 396-97). Because, in our view, the circumstances of this case compelled such an “allowance,” we are confident that the trial justice’s finding of exigency was correct.

The matter before us arises from the August 15, 2005, sale of an approximately 360-acre tract of undeveloped land located on Dye Hill Road in Hopkinton (the property). The plaintiffs, Charles E. Fogarty and James Ottenbacher, averred that the sale of the property to an entity of which the defendants, Ralph Palumbo and Jonathan Savage, were principals, without the plaintiffs’ consent, was fraudulent; they each consequently filed an eight-count complaint in Superior Court.', 'The plaintiffs also named Pilgrim Title Insurance Company (Pilgrim), which was the title insurance and escrow agent in connection with the sale of the property, as a defendant in this case. Following discovery, all three named defendants, Palumbo, Savage, and Pilgrim (jointly, the defendants), filed motions for summary', '-1- judgment, all of which were granted by a justice of the Superior Court. For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court in part and we vacate the judgment in part.', 'I', 'Facts 1', 'The property was originally purchased by Fogarty in the 1970s. In 1994, Fogarty formed a corporation known as Stone Ridge, Inc. (Stone Ridge), with three other shareholders: Grant Schmidt, M.D.; William McComb; and co-plaintiff, Ottenbacher; each shareholder owning 25 percent of the corporation. At or about the time Stone Ridge was formed, Fogarty transferred ownership of the property to Stone Ridge. At all times pertinent to this case, the sole asset of Stone Ridge was the property and the shareholders’ objective was to develop it. 2 In or about 2003, Brushy Brook Development, LLC (Brushy Brook), was created as a holding company for Stone Ridge. Title to the property was transferred from Stone Ridge to Brushy Brook 3 and Schmidt became the managing partner for Brushy Brook. After disagreement arose among the partners of Stone Ridge concerning the development plans for the property, in late 2004 and early 2005, Brushy Brook sought to sell the property either to a separate buyer or to one or more of its shareholders. As of November 2004, Ottenbacher became the president of Stone Ridge.', 'Ottenbacher claimed that he secured Palumbo, a certified public accountant, and Savage, a corporate attorney, to assist him in either purchasing the property, or securing another buyer. 1', 'Our summary of the facts in this case is drawn from the complaints and from the evidence produced during discovery. We note that the first of seven Superior Court files is missing and is not part of the record on appeal. Nevertheless, we are satisfied that enough is before us to properly consider the issues raised. 2', 'The project to develop the property consisted of building sixty-six single-family homes, sixty- eight townhouses, and an eighteen-hole golf course. 3', 'The title transfer of the property to Brushy Brook caused Fogarty to file suit against the three other shareholders. According to Fogarty, Schmidt violated Stone Ridge’s bylaws by transferring the property without the needed 100 percent of the shareholders’ vote. Ultimately, a consent order was filed and the case was dismissed.', '-2- Palumbo and Savage “produced * * * a buy-out plan” whereby Ottenbacher and Fogarty, through financing, would buy out Schmidt and McComb. A buyout agreement was drafted by Adam Clavell, an associate at Savage’s law firm at that time, at the direction of Savage. At deposition, Fogarty stated that he met with Ottenbacher, Palumbo, and Savage and discussed receivership as an option, but that they ultimately did not want to go that route. Fogarty testified that, at this time, Savage “was [their] attorney,” and “was doing all of the paperwork,” but that he had not signed a retainer agreement with, or ever paid, Savage or Savage’s law firm. Fogarty averred that it was his understanding that “from November 17, [2004,] to probably towards the end of December” he was represented by Savage. 4 He further indicated that “Palumbo was supposed to then be [their] accountant for the new project.”', 'Palumbo and Savage were the principals of an entity named Boulder Brook Development, LLC (Boulder Brook), and plaintiffs claim this was unknown to them. On April 6, 2005, the four shareholders of Stone Ridge (plaintiffs, Schmidt, and McComb) executed an Asset Purchase Agreement (APA) for the sale of the property to Boulder Brook. By the terms of the APA, a closing date was set for thirty days thereafter. The APA closing date lapsed prior to a closing occurring. 5', 'Sometime in July 2005, Ottenbacher made an offer to Brushy Brook to purchase the property with a partner, Steven Kaufman. 6 According to Ottenbacher, Schmidt and McComb agreed on the sale of the property and a closing was set for August 15, 2005, with Attorney Mark 4', 'Fogarty also maintained that in April 2005 Savage represented both himself and Ottenbacher. 5', 'Emails exchanged between the parties evidence that Boulder Brook was seemingly seeking to do its due diligence in order to close on the property. 6', 'Steven Kaufman is not a party to this litigation.', '-3- Spangler engaged as the closing agent. 7 In anticipation of the closing, $3,654,367.38 was transferred into Spangler’s clients’ trust account. On August 16, 2005, Spangler traveled to the Hopkinton Town Hall to review the Hopkinton Land Evidence Records and discovered a deed signed by Schmidt dated August 15, 2005, transferring the property to Boulder Brook (herein, the sale to Boulder Brook). As noted, Pilgrim was the title insurance agent and escrow agent in connection with the sale to Boulder Brook. According to plaintiffs, the deed was executed without their knowledge and, because the terms of the APA had since expired without a closing, their approval was required to convey the property. 8', 'II', 'Travel', 'Approximately three years later, on August 14 and 18, 2008, Fogarty and Ottenbacher, respectively, filed two pro se complaints against Palumbo. Thereafter, in 2010, both of their 7', 'Palumbo and Savage maintain that the proposal was rejected. In an August 1, 2005 email sent from Gerald Vande Werken, Brushy Brook’s attorney, in response to two offers from Ottenbacher (one of $5 million and one of $3.6 million in cash according to the email),Vande Werken acknowledged that Boulder Brook was in default of the APA but that he had just recently learned that Boulder Brook had an entity to finance the transaction, Realty Financial Partners (RFP), and that “[a]ssuming for the moment that Savage and RFP * * * close[d] under the terms that they had previously agreed to in [the APA], their offer [was] potentially worth $500,000 more than [Ottenbacher’s] offer of $5M, assuming that both parties ([Ottenbacher group] and Savage’s) [were] equally capable of bringing this project to a successful conclusion.” After Vande Werken articulated his doubts about whether Ottenbacher could complete a project of this magnitude, and communicated that he could not react to Ottenbacher’s offer of a $3.6 million all-cash offer because he “was not certain of the details or what that proposal mean[t] to all 4 of the Stone Ridge shareholders,” Vande Werken concluded that he “would recommend to [Schmidt] that [Schmidt] pursue a closing with * * * Savage and RFP ASAP” as his “gut [told him] that they [were] the ones most likely to perform the complete project.” 8', 'On that same day, plaintiffs filed an involuntary petition against Brushy Brook in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Judicial District of Rhode Island (Case No. 1:05-bk-13009). Attorney Charles Pisaturo was appointed as a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Trustee. On or about June 20, 2006, Pisaturo petitioned Stone Ridge, Brushy Brook’s sole shareholder, into Bankruptcy and was also appointed the Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Trustee. After investigating the entities and the sale to Boulder Brook, Pisaturo filed suit against Schmidt and Vande Werken claiming breach of fiduciary duties. This case settled and no other claims were made.', '-4- complaints were amended to include Savage and Pilgrim as defendants, they obtained legal representation, and their matters were consolidated. Fogarty’s second-amended complaint filed in March 2010 and Ottenbacher’s first-amended complaint filed in April 2010 are nearly identical and allege, against both Palumbo and Savage, negligence (counts 1 and 2 9), breach of contract (counts 3), tortious interference with a contractual relationship (counts 4), interference with a prospective contractual relationship (counts 5), fraud (counts 6), and civil conspiracy (counts 8). The plaintiffs also each raise one negligence count against Pilgrim (counts 7).', 'Discovery ensued for approximately five years.', 'In addition to the production of documents and interrogatories exchanged between the parties, Fogarty, Ottenbacher, Schmidt, McComb, Palumbo, Clavell, Spangler, Gerald Vande Werken, who was Brushy Brook’s attorney, and James A. Houle, who was retained to appraise the property, were all deposed. Certain depositions and documents produced during discovery will be discussed in further detail as they become pertinent to this Court’s analysis.', 'On March 6, 2014, Pilgrim filed a motion for summary judgment on the negligence counts against it, to which plaintiffs objected. A hearing was held on April 7, 2014, and, on June 9, 2014, the hearing justice issued a written decision granting Pilgrim’s motion. The hearing justice reasoned that there was “no genuine issue of material fact that” any “potential liability” on Pilgrim’s part “was discoverable as of August 16, 2005.” Unable to satisfy the requirements of the discovery-rule exception to the three-year statute of limitations set forth in G.L. 1956 § 9- 1-14.3 10 for legal malpractice claims, plaintiffs’ 2010 claims against Pilgrim were deemed 9', 'Counts 2 were dismissed pursuant to an April 27, 2011 stipulation of the parties. 10', 'General Laws 1956 § 9-1-14.3 provides, in relevant part, that “an action for legal malpractice shall be commenced within three (3) years of the occurrence of the incident which gave rise to the action.”', '-5- untimely. Final judgment entered on August 12, 2014, and, on August 22, 2014, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal.', 'As the appellate process proceeded on Pilgrim’s summary disposition, defendants Palumbo and Savage filed a total of four motions for summary judgment; two of which were joint motions and two of which were Savage’s individual filings. 11 A hearing was held on all four motions on November 10, 2014. In a written decision filed on December 1, 2014, the hearing justice granted all four motions for summary judgment. On April 17, 2015, the Superior Court granted final judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure and plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal. 12', 'III', 'Standard of Review', '“This Court will review the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo, employing the same standards and rules used by the hearing justice.” Newstone Development, LLC v.

Co., 50 Park Row West, S 102, Providence, RI 02903.” During discovery, plaintiffs learned for the first time that counsel for Pilgrim had requested unanimous consent of the shareholders authorizing the transaction and had been informed that it appeared that there would not be unanimity, but that he nevertheless “continued forward with the closing.” A document signed by Schmidt authorizing the sale to Boulder Brook entitled “Minutes of Actions Taken in Writing and Without A Meeting by the Manager of Brushy Brook Development, LLC” was provided to Pilgrim.

The plaintiffs further highlight that Spangler testified that he did not recall seeing the municipal lien certificates depicting the name of Pilgrim, and that, in any event, “Municipal Lien Certificates bearing the name Pilgrim * * * would not place a reasonable person exercising reasonable diligence on notice of Pilgrim’s actions.” 13', 'It is our opinion that the negligence claims against Pilgrim are time-barred because, in August 2005, plaintiffs were aware of facts that placed them on notice that potential claims existed against Pilgrim. See Behroozi, 128 A.3d at 873. Notably, it is undisputed that Pilgrim’s name was on the municipal lien certificates recorded in the Land Evidence Records. Pilgrim’s participation in the closing of the sale to Boulder Brook was readily discoverable by plaintiffs as of August 16, 2005. As noted, nine pages of the pertinent recordings located at the Hopkinton Town Hall specifically stated that the certificates had been requested by Pilgrim.', 'Moreover, as plaintiffs themselves acknowledged in their filings to this Court, “[o]n August 14, 2005, Ottenbacher sent an email to * * * Schmidt, * * * Savage, and others, advising that there was no consent among the shareholders to sell the property and that the [APA] had 13', 'The plaintiffs also argue that the hearing justice failed to address G.L. 1956 § 9-1-20, which provides accrual of causes of actions when any person “liable to an action by another, shall fraudulently, by actual misrepresentation, conceal from him or her the existence of the cause of action,” and its application to this case. However, because plaintiffs did not present this argument to the hearing justice, we will not consider it on appeal. See State v. Saluter, 715 A.2d 1250, 1258 (R.I. 1998) (“It is axiomatic that ‘this [C]ourt will not consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal that was not properly presented before the trial court.’”) (quoting State v.

At that moment, or at any time prior to the expiration of the three-year statute of limitations, plaintiffs were required to inspect and inquire to determine what claims they had against the parties involved in the alleged fraudulent transaction. Instead, and despite being armed with the belief that the sale to Boulder Brook was fraudulent, plaintiffs did not seek to discover who the escrow agent was in this transaction. Both plaintiffs testified that they relied on the bankruptcy attorneys they had hired at that time. The plaintiffs cannot, however, avoid the three-year statute of limitations or seek application of the discovery-rule exception by faulting their attorneys for failing to see the potential claims they had against Pilgrim. This is particularly true given that Fogarty, as a real-estate agent, and Ottenbacher, a real-estate developer, were experienced in real-estate transactions.', 'Undoubtedly, plaintiffs wholly fail to satisfy the reasonable diligence standard of § 9-1- 14.3(2). Because plaintiffs’ claims against Pilgrim were filed outside of the three-year statutory period, and because they fail to present any evidence that raises an issue of material fact regarding their diligence in discovering these claims, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court as it relates to counts 7.', 'B', 'Defendants Ralph Palumbo and Jonathan Savage', '1. Damages (All Counts)', 'Palumbo and Savage filed a joint motion for summary judgment on all counts on the basis that plaintiffs had “failed to demonstrate any form of damages resulting from [their] alleged', '- 11 - actions” and, accordingly, had failed to “establish a prima facie case for any cause of action.” The hearing justice agreed, and granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment on all counts because plaintiffs had failed to put forth “evidence regarding lost profits to a reasonable degree of certainty.”', 'In his answers to interrogatories posed by Palumbo, Ottenbacher noted that “[b]ecause of * * * [d]efendants’ actions, [he] lost [his] intended share of the land owned by Brushy Brook * * * and the profits derived from the land, which would include profits on condominiums, sale of house lots, and revenues generated by a golf course and exercise facility and restaurant.” Additionally, he noted that he “would have received repayment of the principal of the debts owed to [him] by Brushy Brook and Stone Ridge but for the actions [and omissions] of [d]efendant Palumbo.” At deposition, Ottenbacher stated: “[he] had an opportunity taken away from [him]. [He] was damaged [in] that the money [he] invested in Stone Ridge was never returned to [him], and [he] had the opportunity of taking over the project and probably turning it into a 20 or $30 million operation.”', 'The plaintiffs also retained a real-estate appraiser, James A. Houle, to opine regarding the value of the property and the damages plaintiffs allege to have incurred due to defendants’ conduct. In a March 26, 2007 appraisal, Houle appraised value of the property at “$10,000,000” as of 2005. To reach this figure, Houle had to assume that the property’s construction approvals, which had been previously granted but had since expired, would be renewed. At deposition, Houle testified that he had “calculated out the full value, retail value, of all the properties and then deducted the expenses that [one] would normally incur to arrive at a residual number which was the value of the property.” Houle stated that he was prepared to testify at trial as to the value of the property at the time of the August 2005 conveyance, the costs to develop the property, as', '- 12 - well as the expected profits a developer might have made if the property was developed under a certain series of circumstances.', 'When asked if he could state “within a reasonable degree of certainty, based upon [his] experience as a developer[,] * * * what the lost profits [were] to * * * Fogarty as he[] [had] claimed in his complaint,” Houle replied that he had not “seen the complaint. [He did not] know what [the] purchase price would have been. [He did not] know what [Fogarty’s] financing terms were. Assuming all things [were] equal to what [he] had projected * * *, [he] could calculate easily what [he] would have projected a developer to not gain or not get if he didn’t do the project.” Houle testified that that amount would be “20 percent of * * * the retail sales of the project divided by whatever percentage of ownership.” Because the “property * * * at one time carried extensive approvals for 134 units,” he testified that “it certainly would be reasonable to expect if you were doing an appraisal that [the property] could support 90 or 100” units. Houle also noted that, about one year before he was deposed, and after having stored it for ten years, he destroyed the working file that he prepared for this case.', 'Additionally, in their attempt to establish that they had incurred damages, plaintiffs also presented a valuation of the condominium site, including construction costs, and a notice that twenty-two single-family lots had been reserved as of October 2004.', 'In granting summary judgment, the hearing justice noted that plaintiffs alleged to have suffered damages in two ways: (1) as shareholders who “would have received some return of their initial contribution” had their deal been accepted; and (2) lost profits as a result of not purchasing and developing the property. The hearing justice concluded that plaintiffs lacked standing to recover under the first claim of damages because this was “a claim that Stone Ridge', '- 13 - or its [s]hareholders ought to make,” not plaintiffs in their individual capacities. 14 Relating to plaintiffs’ claims of lost profits, the hearing justice ultimately decided that plaintiffs’ proffered expert witness, Houle, had failed to “support a finding that damages ha[d] been established with a reasonable degree of certainty.” Houle had opined that the property fully developed would be valued at over $10,000,000, but the hearing justice believed that any expert testimony regarding lost profits was speculative of whether all building permits would be in place, plaintiffs would be able to obtain necessary financing for the development, and the actual construction costs.', 'On appeal, plaintiffs argue that the hearing justice erred in determining that there was no factual issue regarding damages. The plaintiffs argue that the hearing justice “failed to view the deposition testimony in the light most favorable to [them].” The plaintiffs claim that the hearing justice instead “consistently considered disputed facts in the light most favorable to the moving party,” and failed to view the record in its entirety. The plaintiffs also highlight that all but one of the cases cited by the hearing justice in support of his contention that damages must be based on more than speculation were decided after a trial on the merits, and not at the summary- judgment stage.', 'The basic precondition for the recovery of lost profits is that such a loss be established “with reasonable certainty.” Troutbrook Farm, Inc. v. DeWitt, 611 A.2d 820, 824 (R.I. 1992). Although mathematical precision is not required, the jury should be provided with some rational 14', 'In their filings to this Court, plaintiffs do not challenge the hearing justice’s determination regarding standing; instead, they solely press the issue of damages as it relates to lost profits. Palumbo and Savage contend in their written submission that plaintiff’s failure to dispute standing is dispositive of plaintiffs’ appeal in its entirety. We disagree. The hearing justice’s decision on standing quite clearly only relates to plaintiffs’ first theory of damages—that they, as shareholders of Stone Ridge, would have received a return on their initial capital contributions— because the hearing justice ruled that these claims were derivative. The hearing justice’s decision continues and addresses the plaintiffs’ second theory of damages—lost profits.

The existence of damages, including their certainty, is a question for the factfinder to decide. The plaintiffs in this case did not “simply rest on the allegations and denials in [their] pleadings,” but instead presented an expert witness who opined that they suffered damages. Brito v. Capone, 819 A.2d 663, 666 (R.I. 2003). Here, a careful review of Houle’s testimony indicates that, although he could not quantify plaintiffs’ damages with certainty because he did not have the necessary details of the purported sale, he did supply proof of the existence of damages and a formula by which to compute those damages. In viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiffs and drawing reasonable inferences therefrom—i.e., that the building permits would have been renewed and the project would have been financed—we are of the opinion that plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence to survive summary disposition.', '- 15 -', 'The Tennessee Court of Appeals’ holding in Patel v.

Therefore, because we do not affirm summary judgment on all counts based on uncertainty of damages as it relates to lost profits, we will address the other grounds upon which defendants moved for summary judgment to determine if they are nevertheless entitled to summary disposition.', '2. Tortious Interference with a Contractual Relations (Counts 4)', 'In counts 4, plaintiffs allege that Palumbo and Savage tortiously interfered with their contract with Brushy Brook to purchase the property. The plaintiffs allege that “Palumbo and Savage knew or should have known that [plaintiffs] entered into a contractual relationship in connection with the purchase of [the property],” that Palumbo and Savage intentionally and negligently interfered with such contract, and that this interference caused them to suffer damages. Palumbo and Savage moved for summary judgment on counts 4 on the basis that no contract existed between plaintiffs and Brushy Brook—a legal prerequisite to plaintiffs’ claims. The hearing justice agreed and found that “a contract for the sale of the [p]roperty to the', '- 16 - [p]laintiffs ha[d] not been established by the evidence,” and thus count 4 of their complaints failed.', 'In order to establish a claim for tortious interference with a contractual relationship, plaintiffs must establish the following four elements: “(1) [T]he existence of a contract; (2) the alleged wrongdoer’s knowledge of the contract; (3) his [or her] intentional interference; and (4) damages resulting therefrom.” Belliveau Building Corp., 763 A.2d at 627 (quoting Smith Development Corp. v.

Moreover, in Rhode Island, the statute of frauds requires that, to enforce an agreement for the sale of real property, the agreement must be signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought. See G.L. 1956 § 9-1-4.', 'The plaintiffs rely on an email from Schmidt to establish the existence of a contract for the purchase of the property. The email is dated August 11, 2005, and reads as follows:', '“[Ottenbacher],', '“I don’t have a functional fax at home presently and [McComb]', 'just read me your letter.

Although Schmidt agreed on the purchase price “in principle,” there are terms like “the payoff of the creditors of [Brushy Brook]” that needed “to [be] taken care of in order to sign th[e] agreement.” It is evident that the parties had not yet reached an agreement on material terms. Moreover, it is clear that Schmidt did not intend to enter a contract at that precise moment, as required to constitute a valid acceptance. See Smith v.

The plaintiffs argue that instead of a “rejection,” this email requests clarification of plaintiff’s offer in order to compare it to the offer of Savage. The plaintiffs also argue that the evidence they proffered at the summary-judgment stage showed that they were in ongoing negotiations to purchase the property, and that they had an expectation of purchasing the property and entering into a business relationship with Brushy Brook. Palumbo and Savage counter that plaintiffs did not possess a business expectancy associated with developing the property as their “proposal to purchase the [p]roperty was outright rejected and marked as inferior by Brushy Brook,” and “[t]herefore, no business relationship or expectancy existed.”', '“[T]he elements of intentional interference with prospective contractual relations ‘are identical to those required to state a claim based on interference with contractual relations, except for the requirement in the latter that an actual contract exist.’” Avilla, 935 A.2d at 98 (quoting Mesolella v.

Again, as plaintiffs presented no evidence to support the existence of a contract between them and Brushy Brook for the sale of the property, they again present no evidence that there was an ongoing business relationship or expectancy when the parties were negotiating the terms of a sale. We agree with the hearing justice that the evidence established that there were competing buyers for the property; the fact that Palumbo and Savage were ultimately victorious, standing alone, does not present issues of material fact. The plaintiffs fail to present any evidence that they were in a business relationship with Brushy Brook or expected to be (or with any other third party). Accordingly, we affirm summary judgment on counts 5.', '4. Breach of Contract (Counts 3)', 'Savage moved for summary judgment on counts 3, 6, and 8 of plaintiffs’ complaints on the basis that “there [was] no evidence whatsoever that an attorney-client relationship ever existed” between plaintiffs and him, and, in a separate motion, on the basis that plaintiffs filed their complaints outside of the applicable three-year statute of limitations for legal-malpractice claims. The hearing justice agreed and granted the motions on both grounds. On appeal, plaintiffs contend that the hearing justice “improperly conflated and combined” their legal- malpractice breach-of-contract claims against Savage with their claims for fraud and civil conspiracy, as the two latter claims did not relate to Savage’s conduct as their alleged attorney. We need not delve into an analysis of the applicable statute of limitations, however, because we', '- 20 - affirm summary judgment on counts 3 on the grounds that plaintiffs have failed to put forth competent evidence of the existence of an attorney-client relationship with Savage.', 'In their breach-of-contract claims, plaintiffs allege that they “contracted with Savage, to be [their] legal advisor and to assist [them] in the purchase of, or in securing a purchaser for, the * * * property.” They claim that Savage breached their contract and that such breach resulted in damages to plaintiffs. In a breach-of-contract claim, the plaintiff must prove both the existence and breach of a contract, and that the defendant’s breach thereof caused the plaintiff’s damages. See Petrarca v. Fidelity and Casualty Insurance Co., 884 A.2d 406, 410 (R.I. 2005). The plaintiffs’ breach-of-contract claims are premised on their alleged fiduciary attorney-client relationship with Savage.', '“To prevail on a legal malpractice claim, a plaintiff must prove by a fair preponderance of the evidence: the defendant’s duty of care, a breach of that duty, and damages actually and proximately sustained by the plaintiff as a result of such breach.” Richmond Square Capital Corp. v. Mittleman, 773 A.2d 882, 886 (R.I. 2001). Here, the existence of a duty depends on whether an attorney-client relationship existed between plaintiffs and Savage.

Austin, 462 A.2d 359, 362 (R.I. 1983).', 'We agree with the hearing justice that “[p]laintiffs’ mere allegation that Savage was their attorney without other corroborating evidence does not prevent the granting of a summary judgment motion.” The plaintiffs rely on the fact that Clavell drafted the buyout agreement, whereby plaintiffs would buy out Schmidt and McComb’s interest in Stone Ridge, as evidence that an attorney-client relationship existed between plaintiffs and Savage. However, it was Fogarty’s understanding that plaintiffs would then sell the property to Savage. Additionally, in', '- 21 - his deposition, Ottenbacher testified that he first met Savage in November 2004 to obtain financing so that Ottenbacher and Fogarty could buy out their two partners, and that Savage went from “being a lender to * * * being a buyer” in December 2004 or the beginning of 2005. He also testified that he met with Savage, Fogarty, and Palumbo in March or April 2005 to discuss Savage’s purchase of the property.', 'Moreover, integral parties to the transaction testified at deposition that at all times Savage was a purchaser of the property.', 'Ottenbacher, in his deposition during the bankruptcy proceedings, indicated that he began to work with Savage as a purchaser of the property as early as November 2004. Vande Werken also testified that plaintiffs never represented to him that Savage was their attorney. Pisaturo also understood Savage to be the buyer, and that Savage had been negotiating with a member from Brushy Brook on the purchase price and terms.', 'After reviewing the record, we agree with the hearing justice that plaintiffs have failed to present evidence that Savage was acting as their attorney.

Moreover, in listing the alleged specific fraudulent behavior on the part of Palumbo and Savage, plaintiffs list the fact that Palumbo and Savage were hired to find a third-party purchaser for the property and that they ultimately purchased the property for themselves. Even if that allegation is true, when Palumbo and Savage were hired to obtain a buyer, the seller and legal owner of the property was Brushy Brook, not plaintiffs, individually. Accordingly, any wrong relating to their failure to secure a buyer and instead purchasing the property for themselves was against Brushy Brook, not plaintiffs individually.

3,Matthieu W. Yangambi : v. : Providence School Board et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. The parties in this case are before the Supreme Court on cross-appeals from a Superior Court judgment following a jury verdict in favor of the plaintiff, Matthieu W. Yangambi (plaintiff or Dr. Yangambi), on a single claim of employment discrimination based on national origin. The defendants, the Providence School Board and the City of Providence (Providence or defendants), have challenged the Superior Court justice’s jury instructions on several grounds and argue that the Superior Court justice: (1) applied an incorrect law concerning evidentiary presumptions in an employment discrimination case; (2) improperly weighed the evidence; and (3) invaded the province of the jury. The defendants also contend that the Superior Court justice erred when she vacated the jury’s finding that the plaintiff failed to mitigate his damages. The plaintiff’s cross-appeal arises from the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law on a separate count in the complaint that also alleged employment discrimination. The plaintiff contends that the defendants failed to satisfy their burden of production, they did not articulate a nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment decision, and therefore, the plaintiff was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. For the reasons', '-1- discussed herein, all appeals are denied and dismissed, and the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.', 'Facts and Travel', 'Doctor Yangambi, who is of African descent, immigrated to this country from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (the Congo) and, the evidence disclosed, speaks English with a pronounced French accent. He graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in biomedical sciences from the University of Kinshasa in the Congo. He was a full-time high school teacher in the Congo for two years and also taught high school science part-time in Gabon, a neighboring country, for three years. While in Gabon, Dr. Yangambi also worked in a supervisory capacity at a nephrology department for ten years, working with nursing students as they transitioned from academia to practice. Doctor Yangambi immigrated to the United States in February 1990.', 'In 1992, Dr. Yangambi began his teaching career with Providence as a substitute physics teacher at Hope High School.1 In 1993, he was hired as a full-time biology and physiology teacher at Mount Pleasant High School (Mount Pleasant), where he currently is employed. In 1998, Dr. Yangambi received his Master’s degree in administration from Providence College and his certification to be a middle or high school principal. In 2006, he earned a doctorate in educational leadership from Johnson & Wales University.', 'During the term of his employment, Dr. Yangambi applied for approximately forty2 positions within the Providence School Department (the Department), but he was rejected every time. In 2003, Dr. Yangambi filed a charge of discrimination with the Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights (the commission), claiming that Providence had failed to promote him based 1', 'Doctor Yangambi received his certification from Providence College to teach middle and high school biology, core sciences, and general science in January 1993. 2', 'Doctor Yangambi was permitted to present evidence on ten of these positions.', '-2- on his national origin. On October 7, 2004, the commission issued a right to sue notice; and, on November 5, 2004, Dr. Yangambi filed an employment discrimination suit, charging that Providence violated the Fair Employment Practices Act (FEPA) and the Rhode Island Civil Rights Act (Civil Rights Act) by failing to promote him to numerous administrative positions based on his national origin. In November 2007, Dr. Yangambi filed an amended complaint, averring that Providence had again failed to promote him based not only on his national origin,3 but also in retaliation for his claims of employment discrimination. The case was tried before a jury in March and April of 2014.4', 'This appeal is confined to two of the positions that were not awarded to Dr. Yangambi; each application was for an opening as assistant principal at Mount Pleasant—the first, in 2002 (2002 Position) and the second, in 2004 (2004 Position).', '2002 Position', 'In May 2002, an opening was announced for the 2002 Position; the posting required that the applicant possess three years of teaching experience and a certification by the Rhode Island Department of Education (the Department of Education) for a secondary principal. Doctor Yangambi, who met these requirements, applied for the 2002 Position; however, he was not interviewed,5 nor was he notified that he did not meet the minimum qualifications for the position.', 'According to Gail Hareld (Hareld), a human resources administrator for Providence, applicants who met the minimum qualifications generally were forwarded to the hiring 3', 'Doctor Yangambi also alleged racial discrimination in his complaint. But he stipulated before trial that he would not introduce allegations of racial discrimination at trial and would limit his allegations to national origin and retaliation discrimination. 4', 'We have been provided with no explanation for the delay in this case. 5', 'It was Dr. Yangambi’s testimony that there were no interviews for this position; it simply was awarded to John Craig.', '-3- committee, and those who were not deemed qualified were notified by Providence. It is not contested that, in 2002, Dr. Yangambi met the teaching experience and requisite certification requirements established by the Department of Education. Specifically, Dr. Yangambi had approximately fifteen years of teaching experience, ten years of supervisory experience in a hospital setting, and had obtained a secondary principal certificate. He had been at Mount Pleasant since 1993. Nonetheless, Dr. Yangambi received neither an interview nor a rejection letter from Providence. The defendant offered no explanation for this circumstance.', 'The position was awarded to John Craig (Craig). Craig testified that, at the time of the posting, he was serving as acting assistant principal at Mount Pleasant and that he previously had served as an assistant principal in Johnston for approximately one-and-a-half years. Craig had fourteen years of teaching experience; and, in 1999, he received a Master’s degree in administration from Providence College. He explained that he obtained his secondary principal certification shortly after earning his Master’s degree. Specifically regarding the 2002 Position, Craig testified that, while working in Johnston, he was encouraged to contact the principal at Mount Pleasant at the time, Nancy Mullen (Principal Mullen), about an assistant principal vacancy; however, he understood that “it would only be an acting [position], and [by] taking that position [he] would be taking a risk of not getting the [permanent] position * * *.” Although Craig testified at trial that he was interviewed for the position, this testimony conflicted with his deposition testimony in which he admitted that he was not interviewed. Nonetheless, Craig could not remember the names of anyone who conducted the interview but was confident that Principal Mullen did not participate. He recalled that the majority of members on the interview panel were from the human resources department. Craig’s testimony that Principal Mullen did not participate in the interview is in conflict with Providence’s hiring policies, as set forth by', '-4- Hareld and other witnesses, and that formed the basis of the defense in this case.', 'That policy required administrators from the particular school to be involved in the interview process.6', 'Providence failed to produce evidence about who, if anyone, including Craig, was in fact interviewed in 2002, what name or names were forwarded to the Superintendent, who were the members of the interview committee, or how the candidates were ranked. Further, despite the irrefutable evidence that Dr. Yangambi met the qualifications for the 2002 Position, there was no testimony or other evidence produced that explained why Dr. Yangambi was not granted an interview for the 2002 Position.', 'Numerous witnesses testified on behalf of Providence and offered testimony about the general hiring procedures that were in place in Providence. According to Hareld,7 the procedure required that an open position was to be posted—for a minimum of ten days—setting forth the minimum qualifications necessary for the position. Hareld testified that the names of applicants who met the minimum qualifications would be forwarded to the interview committee for an interview. The interview committee was composed of a range of individuals, depending on the type and location of the vacancy, and chaired by a chairperson, usually an administrator from the hiring school. Importantly, regardless of the position or the location, a Providence human resources representative and an equal employment opportunity (EEO) officer often served on each interview committee. Hareld explained that the members of the interview committee would pose questions, which were determined in advance, to each applicant and rate the response on a 6', 'Doctor Yangambi testified that Principal Mullen had previously expressed to him that he “speak[s] French and [has] a deep voice, [and] when [he] speak[s] English people cannot understand what [he is] talking about.” During her deposition, Principal Mullen denied making this statement. 7', 'Although Hareld did not start working for Providence until 2003, her testimony is relevant as to the general hiring practices allegedly followed by Providence.', '-5- scale of one to five. After the scores were tallied, the names of the top two or three applicants were recommended to the Superintendent, who would forward his or her recommendation to Providence. Providence would then vote on whether to award the position to the recommended applicant.', 'Joyce O’Connor (O’Connor), Providence’s EEO officer from 1986 to 2012,8 also testified and corroborated Hareld’s testimony about Providence’s hiring practices.9 Although O’Connor testified that one of her responsibilities as an EEO officer was “to see that basically the candidates were treated fairly during the interview * * *,” she too could not offer any testimony about the 2002 interview committee, who was interviewed, or who was recommended to the Superintendent. Providence failed to produce any ranking sheets or other documentary evidence and was unable to identify the other candidates, if any, who were interviewed for the position. In the fall of 2003, Dr. Yangambi filed a complaint with the commission.', '2004 Position', 'While Dr. Yangambi’s complaint was pending before the commission, he applied for the 2004 Position of Assistant Principal at Mount Pleasant. This position included a closing date of April 2, 2004, with which Providence did not comply. Doctor Yangambi was not interviewed until June, more than two months after the expiration of the interview period and, notably, after the successful candidate became qualified.', 'Providence’s internal procedures required that interviews be held within ten days of the closing date of the posting. Hareld testified that “[i]t’s not that [Providence doesn’t] follow the procedure[,]” but that it is dependent “upon the availability of the applicants as well as the people on the interview committee.” During this 8', 'O’Connor did not begin scoring applicants until the 2007-2008 school year. 9', 'Tomás Ramírez, Acting Assistant Superintendent for Human Resources and Labor Relations, also testified consistently regarding the hiring process that Providence utilized.', '-6- interregnum, the candidate, Michael Sollitto (Sollitto), who was awarded the position, who did not meet the minimum qualifications at the closing date, acquired the requisite certificates. Doctor Yangambi testified that although he met the minimum qualifications for the position—the same qualifications set forth for the 2002 Position—he was not awarded the position. Instead, Sollitto, a Mount Pleasant social studies teacher, who did not meet the minimum qualifications at the time he applied, was appointed. Sollitto testified that he first began working for Providence at Mount Pleasant in 1995 as a long-term substitute teacher. He was hired as a permanent teacher at Roger Williams Middle School in 1998 and transferred to Mount Pleasant in 1999. On April 2, 2004, when the application period closed, Sollitto had not yet obtained a Master’s degree in administration and certification as a secondary principal. Sollitto clearly benefited from the fact that the interviews were postponed for at least two months. In April 2004, Sollitto was serving an internship at Mount Pleasant as part of his Master’s degree curriculum requirements. He did not become credentialed until May 2004. Providence’s departure from the internal promotional procedures favored Sollitto.', 'Again, Providence failed to produce any ranking sheets for the 2004 Position. There was no evidence about who was interviewed, save for Dr. Yangambi and Sollitto, or the number of candidates who were recommended to the Superintendent. O’Connor, who was the EEO officer, testified that she served on the interview committee for the 2004 Position but could recall almost nothing else and had no notes or documents. She could not recall where Dr. Yangambi ranked “unless [she] had seen the sheets”—which, of course, were not produced.', 'According to O’Connor, she did not know that Dr. Yangambi was from the Congo; but she was also certain that the interview committee did not discuss Dr. Yangambi’s national origin during the interview. Save for O’Connor’s testimony, which generously can be characterized as stating', '-7- what she did not know and what the committee did not do, Providence failed to produce any evidence about what did occur; nor did Providence proffer any reason why Sollitto was selected for the 2004 Position over Dr. Yangambi.10', 'Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law', 'At the close of the evidence, plaintiff moved for judgment as a matter of law for the counts relating to the 2002 Position and the 2004 Position, in accordance with Rule 50 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. The basis for the Rule 50 motion centered on defendants’ failure to meet their burden of production and to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for not promoting Dr. Yangambi. The Superior Court justice denied the Rule 50 motion, opining that:', '“if there [was] no evidence at all upon which the jury could', 'conclude that there [was] a non-discriminatory reason for the', 'employment action, then plaintiff would be entitled to judgment', '[as a matter of law].

It didn’t entitle plaintiff to judgment as a', 'matter of law.” 10', 'Providence’s failure to present any records regarding the 2004 Position, or witnesses with knowledge of the events, in the face of a pending complaint to the commission gives rise to the suspicion of mendacity recognized by the United States Supreme Court in St. Mary’s Honor Center v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 511 (1993). See McGarry v. Pielech, 47 A.3d 271, 281-82 (R.I. 2012); Casey v. Town of Portsmouth, 861 A.2d 1032, 1038 (R.I. 2004).', '-8-', 'Recognizing that many of the cases presented by the parties arose in the context of summary judgment, the Superior Court justice held that, at trial, a plaintiff always bears the burden of persuasion in employment discrimination cases.', 'The Superior Court justice also declared that a rebuttable presumption of discrimination arises when a plaintiff proves his or her prima facie case—that is “(1) he is a member of the protected class[;] * * * (2) he applied for an open position; (3) he was not selected; and (4) the employer ‘filled the position by hiring another individual with similar qualifications.’” McGarry v. Pielech, 47 A.3d 271, 280 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Casey v. Town of Portsmouth, 861 A.2d 1032, 1037 (R.I. 2004)).', 'The plaintiff also moved for judgment as a matter of law on defendants’ affirmative defense of failure to mitigate damages, contending that this defense hinged on Dr. Yangambi’s failure to apply to comparable positions outside of the City of Providence, even though defendants did not present any evidence that comparable positions actually existed.', 'The Superior Court justice reserved on the motion, but declared that she “would be surprised if the jury came back and said [that plaintiff] failed to mitigate [damages].”', 'Jury Instructions', 'The burden-shifting paradigm set forth by the United States Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973) was the subject of great debate in this case. The defendants vigorously opposed the Superior Court justice’s conclusion, at the close of the evidence, that defendants were required to produce direct evidence of a nondiscriminatory reason for their failure to promote plaintiff to the 2002 Position and the 2004 Position. Significantly, with respect to several counts in this case, defendants did produce evidence of a nondiscriminatory reason for their adverse employment decision. The Superior Court justice', '-9- concluded that defendants failed to meet this burden only with respect to the 2002 Position and the 2004 Position.', 'The defendants objected to the Superior Court justice’s proposed jury instruction on the law of presumptions as applied to the 2002 Position and the 2004 Position—the only counts to which the Superior Court justice applied the burden-shifting paradigm—arguing that the Superior Court justice essentially took the issue away from the jury. 11 Over this objection, the Superior Court justice gave a lengthy and detailed instruction to the jury on the 2002 Position and the 2004 Position and the law of presumptions. Because we are required to review jury instructions in their entirety and do not consider a selected portion or sentence, see State v. Long, 61 A.3d 439, 445 (R.I. 2013), we set forth the instruction in its entirety:', '“Presumptions are rules of law designed to assist parties to', 'a lawsuit in proving their claims. Presumptions are not evidence.', 'They are tools for proving a specific fact or facts. A presumption', 'is an assumption of fact that the law requires the jury to make so', 'long as certain underlying facts are proved to be true. In other', 'words, if certain facts and circumstances have been proved to be', 'true, then the law requires the jury to assume that certain other', 'facts also have been proved to be true. The law uses presumptions', 'to make it easier to prove facts that experience and logic tell us are', 'most probably true but which are often difficult to demonstrate', 'with direct evidence.', '“Here’s a simple example: Pretend there’s a case in which', 'the parties dispute the date on which a letter was sent. Rhode', 'Island has a state law that requires the jury to assume that the letter', 'was deposited with the post office on the same date as appears in', 'the postmark. Once the underlying facts are proved; that is, that', 'the letter has a certain postmark and that the postmark bears, say,', 'yesterday’s date, then the jury must assume that the letter was,', 'indeed, deposited with the post office yesterday. The law requires', 'the jury to assume this fact until the party against whom the', 'presumption operates comes forward with opposing evidence to 11', 'We note with interest, however, that our review of the transcript reveals that the Superior Court justice used defendants’ proposed jury instructions as a foundation for her instructions on this issue.', '- 10 - refute or rebut that assumed fact[,] thereby overcoming or negating the presumption.', '“A presumption may be rebutted; that is, negated by contrary evidence. If the jury finds that evidence refuting the assumed fact has been produced during the trial, then the presumption has been rebutted. The presumption ceases to operate and no longer has any effect. As a result, the party who has the burden of proving the fact or facts in question must now prove those facts by the greater weight of the evidence and cannot rely on the help of the presumption. A party relying upon the benefit of a presumption can do so only until there is contrary evidence which renders the presumption inoperable.', '“With respect to the [2002 Position and the 2004 Position] and the discrimination claims, [Dr.] Yangambi enjoys the benefit of a presumption. In a failure-to-promote discrimination claim, once the employee establishes that, 1, he was qualified for a promotion; 2, he was rejected despite his qualifications; and, 3, the position remained open or was filled by someone of a different national origin with similar or lesser qualifications, or the position remained open and the employer continued to seek applications from persons of similar qualifications, the jury is required to assume that the employer’s failure to promote the employee was motivated, at least in part, by discrimination. If the employee succeeds in proving these first three elements of his claim, a rebuttable presumption of intentional discrimination arises and the burden shifts to the employer to show a legitimate, non- discriminatory reason for its employment action. Although the employer need do no more than demonstrate a reason which, taken as true, would justify a conclusion that its employment decision was based on a non-discriminatory motive, the law also expects the employer to clearly and specifically articulate its reasons. In other words, the employer is expected to clearly set forth the reasons for the employee’s rejection. Doing so frames the factual issue with sufficient clarity so that the employee will have a full opportunity to demonstrate * * * that the employer’s articulated reasons for failing to promote him [were] a mere pretext or ploy. Therefore, if an employer does not articulate a clear and specific explanation for the employment decision, the employee is afforded the benefit of a presumption and the jury is required to assume the employment decision was the result of intentional discrimination.', '“In this case, [Providence] articulated clear and specific reasons for not promoting [Dr.] Yangambi to the positions identified in Joint Exhibits 3, 4, 7, 9 and 10. For example, one', '- 11 -', 'witness testified that she participated in [Dr.] Yangambi’s', 'interview and that [Dr.] Yangambi’s scores were low.

However, on May 9, 2014, the Superior Court justice granted the motion for judgment as a matter of law on the issue of mitigation of damages, declaring that she “should not have charged the jury on the mitigation question [and] invited * * * a verdict in defendants’ favor on the mitigation defense that was not supported by the law or legally sufficient evidence.” The Superior Court justice explained that “[i]n failure-to-promote cases, the law recognizes that staying on the job, as opposed to quitting and taking a lesser or less secure job, counts as mitigation.” She noted that, because Providence intentionally did not produce any evidence of comparable positions, it was impossible for the jury to compare “promotional opportunities, compensation, job responsibilities, working conditions[,] status * * * salary, job duties, benefits, job security[,] and seniority.” Providence contended that it was not required to present evidence of comparable employment opportunities outside Providence, because Dr. Yangambi admitted that he did not consider any positions outside of Providence.

In McDonnell Douglas Corp., 411 U.S. at 802-04, the Court set forth a three-part, burden-shifting paradigm for employment discrimination cases based upon disparate treatment. This time-honored burden-shifting trial framework imposes a structured approach to the burdens of production and persuasion that are at play in a discrimination trial and serves as “a sensible, orderly way to evaluate the evidence in light of common experience as it bears on the critical question of discrimination.” Furnco Construction Corp. v. Waters, 438 U.S. 567, 577 (1978). The McDonnell Douglas Corp. burden-shifting paradigm assists in overcoming two prevalent hurdles in discrimination cases. First, it recognizes that the plaintiff is not likely to prove his or her case by direct evidence of discriminatory animus—for example, interview committees are not likely to discuss the race or national origin of an applicant—and second, it constitutes a judicial recognition that “the employer has the best access to the reasons that prompted him to fire, reject, discipline or refuse to promote the complainant.” Loeb v. Textron, Inc., 600 F.2d 1003, 1014 (1st Cir. 1979) (emphasis added).', 'Initially, it is the plaintiff who bears the burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination by showing that (i) he or she is a member of a protected class; (ii) was qualified for an open position and applied for it; (iii) was rejected; and (iv) was neglected in favor of someone with similar qualifications. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 411 U.S. at 802. Once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, a rebuttable presumption of discrimination arises and “[t]he burden of production, but not the burden of persuasion, then shifts to the defendant to offer a nondiscriminatory reason” for its decision not to hire or promote the plaintiff. McGarry, 47 A.3d at 280. It is then incumbent upon the employer “to articulate a plausible, legitimate, and', '- 16 - nondiscriminatory justification” for its adverse employment decision. Resare v. Raytheon Co., 981 F.2d 32, 42 (1st Cir. 1992). If the defendant articulates a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for not hiring or promoting the plaintiff, it has met its burden of production, and the rebuttable presumption of discrimination afforded to the plaintiff disappears. McGarry, 47 A.3d at 280.', '“The burdens of proof and persuasion [then] fall squarely upon the plaintiff to demonstrate that the defendant’s tendered explanation is only a pretext and that discrimination was the true motive underlying the hiring decision.” Id. at 280-81. “To satisfy this third prong, a plaintiff must do more than simply cast doubt upon the employer’s justification.” Resare, 981 F.2d at 42.', 'In Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253, the United States Supreme Court expounded upon the defendant’s burden of production in a discrimination case and explained that this “intermediate evidentiary burden[] serves to bring the litigants and the court expeditiously and fairly to th[e] ultimate question” before the factfinder—whether “the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff[.]” The burden rests with the defendant to produce evidence clearly setting forth “that the plaintiff was rejected, or someone else was preferred, for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason.” Id. at 254. The Court in Burdine was careful to separate the defendant’s burden of production from the burden of persuasion that remains with the plaintiff. The Court acknowledged that:', '“The defendant need not persuade the court that it was actually', 'motivated by the proffered reasons. * * * It is sufficient if the', 'defendant’s evidence raises a genuine issue of fact as to whether it', 'discriminated against the plaintiff. To accomplish this, the', 'defendant must clearly set forth, through the introduction of', 'admissible evidence, the reasons for the plaintiff’s rejection.” Id.', 'at 254-55 (emphasis added).', '- 17 - Having declared that the defendant’s burden in an employment discrimination case is to produce admissible evidence that “clearly set[s] forth” the reasons for the adverse employment decision, the Supreme Court acknowledged that the burden of production was minimal, but genuine: “the employer need only produce admissible evidence which would allow the trier of fact rationally to conclude that the employment decision had not been motivated by discriminatory animus.” Id. at 255, 257. The nondiscriminatory reasons which the employer articulates must be “clear and reasonably specific.” Id. at 258. “Placing this burden of production on the defendant * * * serves simultaneously to meet the plaintiff’s prima facie case by presenting a legitimate reason for the action and to frame the factual issue with sufficient clarity so that the plaintiff will have a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate pretext.” Id. at 255-56. Because the plaintiff in an employment discrimination case shoulders both a burden of production and the ultimate burden of persuasion, and is required “to demonstrate that the defendant’s tendered explanation is only a pretext and that discrimination was the true motive,” McGarry, 47 A.3d at 281, nonetheless, the reason for the adverse employment decision that the defendant articulates must be “clearly set forth” through introduction of admissible evidence. Burdine, 450 U.S. at 255.', 'In Hicks, 509 U.S. at 508-10, the Supreme Court examined the role of the trial justice, sitting as a factfinder, once the defendant proffers a nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment decision. The issue in Hicks was whether a plaintiff, after successfully establishing a prima facie case of discrimination, was entitled to judgment as a matter of law after the trial justice, sitting as the factfinder, found that he did not believe the employer’s nondiscriminatory reasons for demoting and discharging the plaintiff. Id. at 508. The Supreme Court disagreed and reiterated that “the * * * plaintiff at all times bears the ‘ultimate burden of persuasion,’” id. at 511, and “a reason [articulated by the employer] cannot be proved to be ‘a pretext for', '- 18 - discrimination’ unless it is shown both that the reason was false, and that discrimination was the real reason,” id. at 515. However, the factfinder’s disbelief of the reasons articulated by the defendant “(particularly if disbelief is accompanied by suspicion of mendacity) may, together with the elements of the prima facie case, suffice to show intentional discrimination.” Id. at 511; see also McGarry, 47 A.3d at 281-82. Accordingly, at the Rule 50 stage in the trial, if the trial justice concludes that the employer met its burden of production and articulated a nondiscriminatory reason for the employment decision, the presumption falls away. The Court, of course, may not weigh the evidence when passing on a motion for judgment as a matter of law. See Hicks, 509 U.S. at 509.', 'The Court in Hicks also proceeded to sharpen the McDonnell Douglas Corp. framework when the employer fails to articulate a nondiscriminatory reason:', '“If the finder of fact answers affirmatively—if it finds that the', 'prima facie case is supported by a preponderance of the', 'evidence—it must find the existence of the presumed fact of', 'unlawful discrimination and must, therefore, render a verdict for', 'the plaintiff. * * * Thus, the effect of failing to produce evidence to', 'rebut the McDonnell Douglas * * * presumption is not felt until the', 'prima facie case has been established, either as a matter of law', '(because the plaintiff’s facts are uncontested) or by the factfinder’s', 'determination that the plaintiff’s facts are supported by a', 'preponderance of the evidence. It is thus technically accurate to', 'describe the sequence as we did in Burdine: ‘First, the plaintiff has', 'the burden of proving by the preponderance of the evidence a', 'prima facie case of discrimination. Second, if the plaintiff', 'succeeds in proving the prima facie case, the burden shifts to the', 'defendant to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason', 'for the employee’s rejection.’ * * * As a practical matter,', 'however, and in the real-life sequence of a trial, the defendant feels', 'the ‘burden’ not when the plaintiff’s prima facie case is proved, but', 'as soon as evidence of it is introduced. The defendant then knows', 'that its failure to introduce evidence of a nondiscriminatory reason', 'will cause judgment to go against it unless the plaintiff’s prima', 'facie case is held to be inadequate in law or fails to convince the', 'factfinder.', 'It is this practical coercion which causes the', 'McDonnell Douglas presumption to function as a means of', '- 19 -', '‘arranging the presentation of evidence.’” Hicks, 509 U.S. at 510', 'n.3 (quoting Burdine, 450 U.S. at 252-53, and Watson v.

Therefore, unless the jury ultimately is unpersuaded by the plaintiff’s evidence, an employer’s failure to produce a nondiscriminatory reason for the employee’s rejection may be fatal to the defendant once the plaintiff proves his or her prima facie case. With this background, we consider each appeal in turn.', 'Analysis', 'The 2002 Position', 'At the close of the evidence, plaintiff moved for judgment as a matter of law on the 2002 Position, arguing that plaintiff established a prima facie case, resulting in a rebuttable presumption of discrimination, and that defendants failed to rebut this presumption by articulating a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for their failure to promote. The plaintiff argued that, because defendants failed to satisfy their burden of production, judgment as a matter of law was appropriate.', 'It does not appear to have been contested, and defendants have conceded in their papers to this Court, that plaintiff established his prima facie case in relation to both the 2002 Position and the 2004 Position.

However, the Superior Court justice also concluded that defendants did not remain completely “silent” on this issue. The Supreme Court has recognized that “[w]hether judgment as a matter of law is appropriate in any particular case will depend on a number of factors,” including “the strength of the plaintiff’s prima facie case [in this case it is undisputed], the probative value of the proof that the employer’s explanation is false, and any other evidence that supports the employer’s case and that properly may be considered on a motion for judgment as a matter of law.” Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 148-49 (2000). The Superior Court justice found that defendants failed to articulate any nondiscriminatory reason, but she erroneously held that defendants were required to do so with direct evidence.14 However, she did acknowledge that defendants presented evidence that Craig may have been more qualified for the 2002 Position than Dr. Yangambi. 14', 'Although the Superior Court justice declared that “there was at least some evidence that the candidates were ranked and that the highest ranking candidates were the ones who were recommended to the Superintendent,” she failed to point to any witness or any specific testimony on this point.

See Furnco Construction Corp., 438 U.S. at 577; Loeb, 600 F.2d at 1014. The rebuttable presumption which arises when a prima facie case has been established essentially forces the defendant to articulate a reason for its employment decision so that the plaintiff can continue on with his or her case. See Burdine, 450 U.S. at 255-56. The issue before this Court is whether, having concluded that defendants failed to meet their burden of production and did not articulate any reason for failing to appoint Dr. Yangambi in 2002, it was error to deny the motion for judgment as a matter of law and send the case to the jury. Although resolution of this issue presents the Court with a close question, we are satisfied that the Superior Court justice carefully reviewed the evidence in this case and concluded that defendants were not completely silent and that there was some evidence that Craig may have been the more qualified candidate.', 'We decline to disturb this ruling. Our de novo review persuades us that evidence that Craig was more qualified than Dr. Yangambi, viewed in the light most favorable to defendants, was sufficient to overcome the motion for judgment as a matter of law.', '2004 Position', 'The defendants appeal from the jury verdict in favor of plaintiff on the 2004 Position. The defendants assign two errors: (1) the Superior Court justice erred in instructing the jury that it was required to presume that defendants’ hiring decision was motivated, at least in part, by national origin discrimination; and (2) it was error to grant plaintiff’s Rule 50 motion as it related to the issue of mitigation of damages after the jury had already returned a verdict that plaintiff failed to mitigate his damages.', '- 22 -', 'Jury Instructions and the Burden-Shifting Paradigm', 'Specifically, defendants assign error to a selective portion set forth in a single sentence of the jury instructions on the issue of the presumption of discrimination: “the jury is required to assume [Providence’s] failure to promote [Dr.] Yangambi was motivated, at least in part, by intentional discrimination * * *.” (Emphasis added.) This Court’s function in passing on jury instructions mandates a review of the jury charge as a whole, see Long, 61 A.3d at 445; the complete sentence upon which defendants’ appeal rests reads: “the jury is required to assume [Providence’s] failure to promote [Dr.] Yangambi was motivated, at least in part, by intentional discrimination unless the jury finds there is contrary or opposing evidence that refutes this presumption.” (Emphasis added.) The Superior Court justice also reiterated this point when she instructed the jury: “Importantly, however, if the jury finds there is contrary or opposing evidence to refute this presumption of intentional discrimination, [Dr.] Yangambi loses the benefit of the presumption and the jury can no longer assume intentional discrimination.” (Emphasis added.)', 'Nonetheless, defendants contend that the Superior Court justice: (1) improperly applied the law of presumptions, (2) impermissibly weighed the evidence, and (3) invaded the province of the jury.', '(a)', 'Direct and Circumstantial Evidence', 'We begin by noting that the Superior Court justice was mistaken when she indicated that the employer is required to satisfy its burden of production with direct evidence. Although a defendant in an employment discrimination case is required to “articulate” a “clear” and “specific” nondiscriminatory reason for its employment decision, a defendant may do so by “admissible evidence,” circumstantial or direct. Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253, 255, 258; see also State v. Patel, 949 A.2d 401, 414 (R.I. 2008) (“[Courts] do not distinguish between the probative', '- 23 - value of circumstantial and direct evidence[.]”). However, proof by circumstantial evidence does not diminish the burden that must be met: the employer must articulate a nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment decision.', 'The law is unwavering that an employer’s nondiscriminatory reason—whether established by direct or circumstantial evidence—must be clear and specific, in order to frame the factual issues such that the plaintiff, who bears the ultimate burden of persuasion, can prove “the crux of * * * a discrimination case”—“that the defendant’s purported reason for not hiring the plaintiff was false, [and] that discrimination was the real reason.” McGarry, 47 A.3d at 281; see also Burdine, 450 U.S. at 258 (“[T]he defendant’s explanation of its legitimate reasons must be clear and reasonably specific.”); Chapman v. Al Transport, 229 F.3d 1012, 1034 (11th Cir. 2000) (holding that a defendant’s legitimate and nondiscriminatory reason can be subjective as long as it is “clear and reasonably specific” (quoting Burdine, 450 U.S. at 258)); E.E.O.C. v. Flasher Co., 986 F.2d 1312, 1316 (10th Cir. 1992) (“[T]he defendant does not at this stage of the proceedings need to litigate the merits of the reasoning, nor does it need to prove that the reason relied upon was bona fide, nor does it need to prove that the reasoning was applied in a nondiscriminatory fashion. * * * However, the proffered reason for the action taken against the minority employee must be reasonably specific and clear.” (citing Burdine, 450 U.S. at 254, 258)).

Thus, we are of the opinion that the Superior Court justice’s reasoning that direct evidence was necessary was flawed. However, because this error is not relevant to our analysis, we deem it harmless. The Superior Court justice did not inform the jury that defendants could meet their burden of production only by direct evidence and', '- 24 - correctly instructed the jury, before the start of the trial, on the probative value of circumstantial and direct evidence.', '(b)', 'Defendants’ Burden of Production', 'Turning to defendants’ central contention, our review of this record confirms that defendants failed to offer any evidence articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for not promoting Dr. Yangambi to the 2004 Position that remotely qualifies as “clear and reasonably specific.” Burdine, 450 U.S. at 258. The defendants merely presented testimony about their general hiring practices, which appear to be ad hoc at best and admittedly not always honored. This testimony, while suggestive of a general policy, had little bearing on the 2004 Position and begs the question as to why Dr. Yangambi was not promoted. Generic testimony regarding an employer’s customary hiring or promotional practices, standing alone, does not articulate a “clear and reasonably specific” nondiscriminatory reason why one employee was promoted over another. Id.', 'To be sure, hiring practices and policies are relevant in employment discrimination cases. But such hiring practices—and an employer’s faithful adherence to these procedures—should serve as the starting point for the employer’s nondiscriminatory reason and not the finish line. Evidence about the members of the interview committees, the names of the candidates and their respective qualifications, who among them was interviewed, how they were ranked, and evidence that, at the conclusion of this process, a different candidate was selected, is the grist of the employer’s adherence to its hiring practices. In this case, defendants failed to present a scintilla of evidence about the candidates, what they were asked, how they were ranked, or whose name or names were forwarded to the Superintendent.', 'Was it only the successful candidate’s name that was forwarded? Employers do not satisfy their burden of production with', '- 25 - a general reference to their “fair” hiring practices, particularly when, as in this case, the employer offers no evidence that these hiring practices were honored. The evidence also demonstrated that Providence’s deviation from these hiring practices benefited the successful candidate, who was not qualified for the position at the time that the application period closed.', 'The only testimony presented that was relevant to the interviews held in relation to the 2004 Position was that of O’Connor. The crux of O’Connor’s testimony was that she did not know that Dr. Yangambi came from the Congo, but she was sure the committee did not discuss his national origin, and she could not recall his ranking without reviewing the ranking sheets, which were not available. Certainly, this testimony, while marginally relevant to the issues in this case, does not qualify as a nondiscriminatory reason why Dr. Yangambi was not selected for the 2004 Position.', 'In stark contrast, we note that, with respect to eight other claims that went to the jury, defendants presented specific reasons why Dr. Yangambi was not promoted and even produced ranking sheets for three of those positions.', 'The Superior Court justice also found “that [defendants] did have people who could have articulated the reason [Dr.] Yangambi wasn’t promoted for [the 2004 Position]” and failed to do so. She found that defendants “chose to rely on other evidence from which [they] hope[] the jury will draw an inference concerning what the legitimate non-discriminatory reason must have been.” Although employers are not foreclosed from articulating a nondiscriminatory reason through circumstantial evidence, see McGarry, 47 A.3d at 281, the evidence produced must amount to more than mere generalities from which a factfinder is expected to deduce a reason by piling inference upon inference. This is not a syllogistic exercise. See Reeves, 530 U.S. at 141 (“‘[T]he question facing triers of fact in discrimination cases is both sensitive and difficult,’ and * * * ‘[t]here will seldom be', '- 26 - ‘eyewitness’ testimony as to the employer’s mental processes.’” (quoting United States Postal Service Board of Governors v. Aikens, 460 U.S. 711, 716 (1983))). An employer who overlooks the role of the trial justice in deciding whether a presumption has been overcome, does so at its peril.', 'The defendants call our attention to the fact that plaintiff vigorously challenged Providence’s hiring practices, arguing that plaintiff—and presumably the jury—could draw an inference that defendants’ nondiscriminatory reason for not promoting Dr. Yangambi was that he was “outranked” for the position. Such an inference is permissible when there is evidence about the results of the hiring practices, such as the names of the candidates, the members of the interview committee, and the rankings.', 'Significantly, this meager testimony was the only evidence that defendants produced on the 2004 Position, and plaintiff had every right to challenge it. However, our de novo review of the record in this case leads us to the same conclusion as the Superior Court justice: defendants failed to satisfy their burden to produce admissible evidence articulating a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for their employment decision.15', 'In this case, it was incumbent upon the Superior Court justice to determine whether the first and second prongs of McDonnell Douglas Corp.—that plaintiff established a prima facie case and, if so, whether defendants presented evidence that rebutted the presumption of discrimination—had been satisfied.

Because', '[Providence] articulated a clear and specific reason for its action,', '[Dr.] Yangambi is not entitled to the benefit of any presumption of', 'discrimination. On the other hand, [Providence] failed to clearly', 'and specifically articulate its reasons for not promoting [Dr.]', 'Yangambi to the [2002 and 2004 Positions].”', '- 29 - in regard to the 2002 Position, where the qualifications of the successful candidate equaled or exceeded those of Dr. Yangambi. Accordingly, we are of the opinion that the Superior Court justice did not err in instructing the jury on the law of presumptions and its application to this particular discrimination claim.', 'Mitigation of Damages', 'Finally, defendants argue that the Superior Court justice erred in granting judgment as a matter of law on the affirmative defense that plaintiff failed to mitigate damages. Specifically, defendants contend that they were not required to present evidence of equal employment opportunities outside Providence because it was plaintiff’s position at trial that he would not have considered employment outside Providence.', 'The Superior Court justice rejected that argument, explaining that in the absence of evidence of comparable positions that were substantially equivalent, in terms of salary, promotion opportunities, seniority, job duties, working conditions, and convenience to the employee’s home, a reasonable juror could not undertake the requisite analysis on mitigation of damages. We agree with this ruling and are not convinced that, in order to mitigate damages, plaintiff was required to consider employment outside Providence.', 'In order to prove that a plaintiff failed to mitigate damages, the employer must prove that “(i) though substantially equivalent jobs were available in the relevant geographic area, (ii) the claimant failed to use reasonable diligence to secure suitable employment.” Quint v. A.E. Staley Manufacturing Co., 172 F.3d 1, 16 (1st Cir. 1999); see also Trainor v. HEI Hospitality, LLC, 699 F.3d 19, 29 (1st Cir. 2012). However, an employer is “relieved * * * of the burden to prove the availability of substantially equivalent jobs in the relevant geographic area once it has been shown that the former employee made no effort to secure suitable employment.” Quint, 172', '- 30 - F.3d at 16; see also Greenway v. Buffalo Hilton Hotel, 143 F.3d 47, 54 (2d Cir. 1998); Sellers v. Delgado College, 902 F.2d 1189, 1193 (5th Cir. 1990). These principles of law only apply to alternative and equal employment in a relevant geographical area.', '“Our review of a trial justice’s decision on a motion for judgment as a matter of law is de novo.” McGarry, 47 A.3d at 279 (quoting Medeiros, 984 A.2d at 625). A review of the record indicates that Dr. Yangambi applied for approximately forty administrative positions in Providence and had a particularized interest in working within the City of Providence. Specifically, Dr. Yangambi lives in Providence and is part of the fabric of its diversity. He has an interest in continuing his career in an urban setting and learning more about Providence’s rich culture. Doctor Yangambi also recognized that seniority is important when working in a school system; and, having taught in Providence since 1992, he would have lost these valuable seniority rights if he moved elsewhere. See Jurgens v. E.E.O.C., 903 F.2d 386, 389 (5th Cir. 1990) (“[W]here an employer discriminatorily denies promotion to an employee, that employee’s duty to mitigate damages encompasses remaining on the job.”); Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Safeway Stores, Inc., 634 F.2d 1273, 1285 (10th Cir. 1980) (recognizing that the plaintiff’s decision to remain on the job was “prudent under the circumstances” given his “long- term position” with his employer). Certainly, remaining on the job and soldiering through so many disappointments was the plaintiff’s decision to make and was “prudent under the circumstances,” because there was no proof that going elsewhere would have been more remunerative. We are not satisfied that Dr. Yangambi was required to seek employment outside of Providence, with its attendant loss of seniority rights, in order to mitigate damages. We are of the opinion that the Superior Court justice properly reserved on the plaintiff’s Rule 50 motion and subsequently granted the motion after the jury returned its verdict.', '- 31 -', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons discussed herein, the judgment is affirmed. The Superior Court justice’s denial of the plaintiff’s Rule 50 motion on the 2002 Position is affirmed. Likewise, in regard to the 2004 Position, the jury verdict and grant of the plaintiff’s Rule 50 motion as it relates to the issue of mitigation of damages is affirmed. The papers in this case shall be remanded to the Superior Court.', 'Justice Robinson, dissenting. I have respect for the majority’s attempt to reconcile the jury instructions which guided the jury in this complex case with well-established principles of employment discrimination law; but I fundamentally disagree with what the majority has written in that regard, and I must record my very strong dissent. In my opinion, the jury was provided with a fundamentally erroneous instruction; and, therefore, I am convinced that the jury’s verdict for the plaintiff should be vacated.', 'I begin by noting my agreement with the principle set forth as follows in the majority opinion: “We are of the opinion that the issue of whether a party has met its burden of production is a question of law.”1 However, where I fundamentally part company with the majority is with respect to its explicit agreement with the trial justice, after a de novo review, that defendants “failed to offer any evidence articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for not promoting Dr. Yangambi to the 2004 Position that remotely qualifies as ‘clear and reasonably specific.’” (quoting Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 258 (1981)). The fatal flaw in that rather conclusory statement is revealed by the sentence that 1', 'I note that the jury verdict in this case was favorable to plaintiff with respect to his claim of national origin discrimination as to the 2004 promotion decision. Pursuant to the explicit January 5, 2011 Stipulation between the parties, the allegations of race discrimination that were contained in the second amended complaint were not litigated at trial.', '- 32 - immediately follows it in the majority opinion: “The defendants merely presented testimony about their general hiring practices, which appear to be ad hoc at best and admittedly not always honored.” In my view, it defies logic and it is inconsistent with settled principles in this domain of the law to concede that defendants “presented testimony about their general hiring practices,” but then to conclude, as the majority does, that “[g]eneric testimony regarding an employer’s customary hiring or promotional practices, standing alone, does not articulate a clear and reasonably specific nondiscriminatory reason why one employee was promoted over another.” (Emphasis added.) (Internal quotation marks omitted.)', 'In my considered judgment, that testimony about defendants’ general hiring practices fulfilled their burden of production; and I fail to see how it is not as “clear and reasonably specific” as Burdine, 450 U.S. at 258, requires that it be. See also St. Mary’s Honor Center v. Hicks, 509 U.S. 502, 507 (1993) (“[T]he defendant must clearly set forth, through the introduction of admissible evidence, reasons for its actions which, if believed by the trier of fact, would support a finding that unlawful discrimination was not the cause of the employment action.”) (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted); Smith v. F.W. Morse & Co., Inc., 76 F.3d 413, 421 (1st Cir. 1996) (stating that a defendant’s burden of production is a “modest hurdle”).', 'The defendants in the instant case sustained their burden by producing evidence; it matters not whether that evidence persuaded the trial justice. See Hicks, 509 U.S. at 509 (“By producing evidence (whether ultimately persuasive or not) of nondiscriminatory reasons, [the] petitioners sustained their burden of production, and thus placed themselves in a better position than if they had remained silent.”) (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Burdine, 450 U.S. at 254 (“The defendant need not persuade the court that it was actually motivated by the proffered reasons.”).

And I readily concede that pointing to such flaws would have been fair game (and indeed was precisely that) for plaintiff to use in seeking to prove pretext and to carry his ultimate burden of persuasion. See Hicks, 509 U.S. at 507 (“It is important to note * * * that although the McDonnell Douglas presumption shifts the burden of production to the defendant, [t]he ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiff.”) (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'In my opinion, defendants did not have to prove that they followed the “general hiring practices” with respect to the 2004 promotion decision in order to meet their burden of production; it was for plaintiff to provide contrary proof in the course of the third phase under McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04 (1973).2', 'Moreover, in my judgment, the jury instruction in this case contained a fundamental flaw (a flaw that is so grave that it certainly can be said that a jury “could have been misled by [the] erroneous charge to the resultant prejudice” of defendants; see State v. Ventre, 910 A.2d 190, 2', 'I note that, in Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 255-56 (1981), the United States Supreme Court stated, with respect to a defendant’s burden of production, that “[t]he sufficiency of the defendant’s evidence should be evaluated by the extent to which” it “present[s] a legitimate reason for the action and * * * frame[s] the factual issue with sufficient clarity so that the plaintiff will have a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate pretext.” The fact that, in the instant case, plaintiff was clearly able to identify the legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason that defendants presented and that plaintiff was, thus, able to attempt to demonstrate pretext by arguing that defendants did not follow their “general hiring practices,” is further indication that defendants did actually meet their burden of production.', '- 34 - 197 (R.I. 2006)). I refer specifically to the language in the jury instruction whereby the jury was explicitly informed as follows with respect to defendants:', '“[The defendants] failed to clearly and specifically articulate', '[their] reasons for not promoting Mr. Yangambi to the [2004', 'Position]. Therefore, with respect to [said position,] the jury is', 'required to assume the [defendants’] failure to promote Mr.', 'Yangambi was motivated, at least in part, by intentional', 'discrimination unless the jury finds there is contrary or opposing', 'evidence that refutes this presumption.” I fundamentally disagree that defendants failed to clearly and specifically articulate their reasons, and I therefore disagree that the jury was “required” to assume the fact of intentional discrimination on defendants’ part. This reasoning is inconsistent with the finely balanced allocation of the burdens of proof and production that is outlined in McDonnell Douglas Corp., 411 U.S. at 802-04, and the cases that have exegeted and refined that seminal case. See, e.g., Hicks, 509 U.S. 502; Burdine, 450 U.S. 248. As such, in my opinion, this case should be remanded for a new trial.', 'I do not lightly dissent, but I have no choice but to do so. I am convinced that the verdict for the plaintiff was reached after the jury had been instructed in a fundamentally erroneous way. I believe that the balanced procedural approach that was outlined in the seminal McDonnell Douglas Corp. case has been materially disregarded in this case and that the result reached is inconsistent with settled principles of law.3 With regret that I cannot join the majority, but nevertheless with some degree of fervor, I respectfully submit my unequivocal dissent. 3', 'Since I believe that the fundamental error in the jury instructions requires a new trial in this case, I need not and do not reach the difficult issues surrounding the question of mitigation of damages (i.e., the adequacy vel non of plaintiff’s attempts to mitigate his damages and the manner in which that issue was handled as a matter of civil procedure).', '- 35 - - 36 -STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND', 'PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS', 'SUPREME COURT – CLERK’S OFFICE', 'OPINION COVER SHEET', 'Matthieu W.

To allow Home Depot to recover the', 'amount of the Fast Track Assessment payments from Roadepot', 'would not upset the transactions made with the [t]own, and as', 'such, would not undermine the voluntary payment doctrine’s', 'policy of promoting stability and reliability in transactions.” Moreover, with respect to the payments made from 2005 to September 17, 2009, he found that Home Depot made them “under the mistaken belief that it was responsible for the payments', '-15- under the lease agreement.” As for the payments made after September 17, 2009, the trial justice', 'credited the testimony', 'of Tascione', 'and held that', '“it was reasonable for Home Depot to pay the Fast Track Assessment, speciﬁcally to avoid the imposition', 'of', 'a lien and dispossession by Roadepot, and later to pursue a restitution claim.”', 'Because the voluntary payment doctrine is an afﬁrmative defense, Roadepot bore the burden', 'of proving its applicability. “[T]he general rule is that a voluntary payment made under a mistake or in ignorance', 'of the law, but with full knowledge of all', 'the facts, and not induced by', 'any fraud or improper conduct on the part', 'of the', 'payee, cannot be recovered back.” Nelson V.', 'Swenson, 46', 'RI.', '26, 28, 124 A. 468, 468-69 (1924) (quoting 30 William Mack Cyclopedia', 'of Law and Procedure, 1313 (1908)).', 'Here, the trial justice speciﬁcally found that “Home Depot paid the Fast Track Assessment, without protest, under the mistaken belief that', 'it was responsible for the payments under the lease agreement.”', 'This ﬁnding is supported by Tascione’s testimony that, at some point after 2005, the assessment payments were made by', 'a vendor and that there was confusion', 'as to Whether the bills were for sewer usage as opposed to infrastructure.

She further testified that, between approximately 4:45 and 4:50 p.m., as “[she] was walking in the front door” of the grocery store, “Mr. Tirocchi had called [her] and told [her] that the baby had fallen off the bed and she was crying and she was most likely hurt.” Ms. Hebert stated that she “stayed on the phone with Mr. Tirocchi” and “returned home” by car within two or three minutes. On cross-examination, she acknowledged that, by the time she entered her car upon leaving the grocery store, she knew that 911 had already been called concerning Adrina.', 'Upon being questioned about what happened when she arrived back at her apartment, Ms. Hebert stated: “Mr. Tirocchi was in the bedroom with the baby, and [Adrina] was l[]ying on the bed crying hysterically.” Ms. Hebert also added the following:', '“I could tell that [Adrina] was in pain. She was crying like I had', 'never heard her cry before.

She added that she “went in the rescue and Mr. Tirocchi followed in [her] vehicle” to Hasbro Children’s Hospital.', 'According to Ms. Hebert, after arriving at Hasbro Children’s Hospital, she and Mr. Tirocchi and the doctors “went into an exam room” with Adrina, who was crying at the time. She stated that she had “never heard [Adrina] cry like that before,” so she “knew something was wrong with her.” She testified that the baby was X-rayed and was given pain medication, after which the emergency room doctor told her and Mr. Tirocchi that Adrina would be staying overnight for observation. Ms. Hebert added that she and Mr. Tirocchi stayed overnight with Adrina. She further testified that, the following morning (January 1, 2014), she spoke with Dr. Adebimpe Adewusi (see Part I.A.4, infra) about “the history of [her] * * * relationship with Mr. Tirocchi, about the baby, her normal activity and routine and what had happened the day before.” Ms. Hebert stated that she explained to Dr. Adewusi that “the baby was very active,” that she “move[d] around a lot,” and that she once “rolled over from back to [belly].”3', 'It was Ms. Hebert’s testimony that, at around 3:00 p.m. on January 1, she spoke with Megan Dunn, a Child Protective Investigator for DCYF.

She stated that she cooperated with the police because she “felt like” there was “nothing to hide.”', 'During her testimony on direct examination, Ms. Hebert was asked about Mr. Tirocchi; and she said that they had “a very good relationship” and were “really good friends.” In addition, Ms. Hebert testified that she had previously left Adrina in the sole care of Mr. Tirocchi “at least, between five and ten times,” for periods ranging from two to three hours. She indicated that she had absolutely no concerns about his care of Adrina. When asked if she felt comfortable leaving Adrina with Mr. Tirocchi on the day of the incident, Ms. Hebert responded in the affirmative because she had “seen” how he interacted with the baby for three months. She added that she “found nothing” indicating that Mr. Tirocchi was ever a “threat” to Adrina.', 'On cross-examination, Ms. Hebert acknowledged that, prior to trial, she had not previously told Dr. Adewusi or Ms. Dunn that she had gone to a liquor store on the day of the incident; however, she pointed out that she had told them that she had been “going on errands,” explaining that, “at the time [she] was called [by Mr. Tirocchi,]” she had been at the grocery store. She further testified that she had received a receipt from the liquor store that contained a timestamp indicating her presence there at around 4:45 p.m.; she added that her phone bill would reflect that she had received a call at 4:50 p.m.', '2.

I', 'checked her arm, gently -- you know, squeezing, just to see if there', 'was any pain. When I got to her leg, she started crying, you know,', 'just excruciating pain. At that time, [which was approximately', '4:50 p.m.,] I called [Ms. Hebert] on my cell phone and told her the', 'situation; to get home immediately. As [Ms. Hebert] was still on', 'the [cell] phone, I [simultaneously] called 911 from my house', 'phone and talked to the paramedics, and [she] came home. The', 'paramedics were there, and they brought the baby to Hasbro.”', 'When Mr. Tirocchi was asked where he had placed Adrina on the bed, he responded: “I placed the baby on the lower, left-hand side of the bed,” with her head “towards the middle of the bed” and her feet about six inches from the “edge” of the bed. In his testimony, he explained that he had done so because he thought that Adrina would be “fine” on the bed for approximately “10 [to] 15 seconds,” while he checked to see if her bottle was ready.', 'On cross-examination, Mr. Tirocchi was asked why he had placed Adrina on the bed and not elsewhere, such as back in the crib. He again testified that he did not think that anything would happen during the ten seconds in which he was checking to see if her bottle was ready. It 4', 'It bears noting that, on cross-examination, Mr. Tirocchi acknowledged that Ms. Hebert had called him while she was at the liquor store. He stated that the reason for her call was to “ask[] [him] what [he] wanted” from that store. However, it was Mr. Tirocchi’s further testimony that neither he nor Ms. Hebert consumed alcohol before the incident at issue.', '-6- was further his testimony that “it would have taken longer for [him] to go back to the crib and then go to the kitchen and prepare a bottle for her.” According to Mr. Tirocchi, it was his belief that Adrina was “enough on the bed” so that she would “not to be able to * * * fall[] off.”', 'In Mr. Tirocchi’s testimony on cross-examination, he acknowledged that “the whole time” during which he was on the landline with the 911 operator, he had also stayed in contact on his cell phone with Ms. Hebert, whom he said he had called first. He also acknowledged that, upon Ms. Hebert’s return to the apartment, she did not come over and touch Adrina.', 'Upon being questioned about Adrina’s development prior to the incident at issue, Mr. Tirocchi replied that she had been “a very active baby,” especially in the crib. According to him, he and Ms. Hebert had once seen her “roll over fully from her back to her stomach.”', '3. The Testimony of Megan Dunn', 'Child Protective Investigator Megan Dunn testified that, on January 1, 2014, she was assigned to investigate the allegation of physical neglect (later amended to “[p]hysical abuse with a bone fracture”) in the instant case, after having received a call from a “reporter” on the child-abuse hotline. Ms. Dunn stated that, on that same day, she went to the hospital and saw Adrina, who was “awake and smiling” and was surrounded by family members (including Ms. Hebert and Mr. Tirocchi).', 'Ms. Dunn testified that she observed “petechia on the side of [Adrina’s] face,” which she characterized as meaning “very light red dots.” She added that she was unable to see Adrina’s legs because they were “covered up” and supported by braces.', 'Ms. Dunn further testified that, at some point after observing Adrina, she spoke with Ms. Hebert alone.', 'According to her, Ms. Hebert gave the following account as to what had happened:', '“[Ms. Hebert] stated to me that[,] on December 31st * * * in the', 'afternoon[,] the baby had gone down for a nap. When the baby', '-7-', 'went down for a nap[,] her and dad were the only people home.', 'She told me she left the home at about 4:30 p.m. and left dad home', 'alone with the baby because she was going across the street to the', 'market. And mom told me about what she said was approximately', 'like seven minutes after she left the house she received a call from', 'dad stating the baby fell off the bed and was crying. Mom told me', 'she immediately returned home * * * [from] the store * * *.', '“* * *', '“[Ms. Hebert] returned home and she told me that dad had already', 'called 9-1-1. When she got home the baby was on the bed', 'crying[,] and the bed was mom and dad’s bed that they slept in.', 'She stated she didn’t move the child when she came home, but the', 'ambulance was just about getting there and had come in, the', 'paramedics, when she arrived home. She did note that the baby', 'was crying and at that time they went by rescue to the hospital.” Ms. Dunn further testified that, with respect to Adrina’s injury, Ms. Hebert could only relay what Mr. Tirocchi had told her (namely, that “the baby rolled off the bed”).', 'Ms. Dunn further testified that Ms. Hebert had stated that Adrina was “a good baby”— one who is “active” and “squirm[s] a lot.” By way of example, she explained that, in the words of Ms. Hebert, Adrina would be placed in “one position in the crib” at night, but would “turn[] around facing the opposite way” by morning. Ms. Dunn testified that Ms. Hebert also told her that Adrina “c[ould not] roll over on her own, but she [wa]s able to roll to her side [and] [t]hat she wasn’t able to roll over fully to one side, whether it’s [on] her stomach or her back.” She added that Ms. Hebert did not express any concern to her about Mr. Tirocchi caring for Adrina.', 'Ms. Dunn further testified that she spoke with Mr. Tirocchi alone, similarly inquiring about the incident at issue. In her words, the following was his version of what happened:', '“[Mr. Tirocchi] stated around 4:30 or 5:00 he noticed that the baby', 'was waking up. * * * He went in to get the child and he told me', 'that he took her out of the crib and placed her on a changing table', 'which was later learned to be at the edge, the end of mom and', 'dad’s bed. * * * And after he changed her, * * * he told me he', 'placed her on the lower left hand side of the bed. * * * [H]e knew', 'she was hungry and wanted a bottle because she had just woken up', '-8-', 'from her nap. And that he then placed her on the bed from the', 'changing table and went into the kitchen to get a bottle.', '“* * *', '“[Mr. Tirocchi] told me when he did that he heard a thump. He', 'estimated he was only in the kitchen for about 20 seconds. When', 'he heard that thump he heard the baby crying. He went back to the', 'bedroom and the baby was face up on the floor and she was crying.', 'He picked the child up. I asked him how he picked the child up[,]', 'he said under her arms and he placed her on her back on the bed', '* * *. And he told me at that point she was crying and he wanted', 'to check her body and he checked her arms and her legs and when', 'he touched her right leg she was crying like he never heard her cry', 'before. He stated to me that her leg clicked when he moved it.” Ms. Dunn stated that Mr. Tirocchi said that he then contacted 911 and also Ms. Hebert “right away.” She testified that she repeatedly asked him if he was “sure” about what had happened and whether it was possible that he had grabbed Adrina to prevent her from falling, but that Mr. Tirocchi consistently denied that anything had occurred that differed from what he had already described to her.', 'Ms. Dunn added that Mr. Tirocchi had described Adrina as being “a good baby”—one who is “active” and “likes to move around.” She testified that he told her that Adrina could not “sit up on her own,” although she could “roll to her side.”', 'Towards the end of her direct testimony, Ms. Dunn stated that she had measured the distance between the bed and the floor in order to “get an estimate of how far the baby had fallen;” and she recalled that the estimated distance was “28, 29 inches.” Ms. Dunn also testified that the comforter on the bed from which Adrina fell was “silky” and generally “smooth.”', 'On cross-examination, Ms. Dunn conceded that she did not “find by a preponderance of evidence” that Ms. Hebert had neglected or abused Adrina. She acknowledged that both Ms. Hebert and Mr. Tirocchi were “fully cooperative” with her and that background checks revealed that neither of them had a criminal record or any prior contact with DCYF. Nonetheless, it', '-9- continued to be Ms. Dunn’s view that Adrina’s injury was not accidental because she considered it to be “concerning * * * for a child to roll off of a bed and break her femur, which is a large bone in the body that is difficult to fracture.”', '4. The Testimony of Doctor Adebimpe Adewusi', 'Doctor Adebimpe Adewusi, the physician who examined Adrina at Hasbro Children’s Hospital on December 31, 2013, was a witness for DCYF; she testified as an expert witness, qualified in child abuse and neglect pediatrics. Doctor Adewusi testified that, on January 1, 2014, the day after her initial encounter with Adrina, she took a “detailed history” from Ms. Hebert and Mr. Tirocchi. Doctor Adewusi stated that, at that time, she was told that Adrina “was able to roll to her side but [was] not able to roll completely over.”', 'Doctor Adewusi further testified that, during her examination of Adrina, she observed: (1) that Adrina’s right leg “was in pain” when it was manipulated; and (2) that “petechiae” were present on both sides of Adrina’s face, which Dr. Adewusi said are “little broken blood vessels.” She also testified that, upon reviewing the X-rays of Adrina’s right leg and foot, she identified an oblique fracture5 of Adrina’s right femur. According to Dr. Adewusi, “because of [her] concern” regarding a “femur fracture in a nonmobile child” and “the history that [she] was given,” she decided to contact DCYF. She added that “th[is] type of fracture * * * cannot occur from a simple fall from the bed.” When Dr. Adewusi was asked to clarify her testimony, she replied that Adrina’s oblique fracture “need[ed] some sort of torque” or “some sort of rotation to occur.” She added that there was “no way the baby could have had that fracture from that fall.” Doctor Adewusi stated that, “with that type of fall, * * * the most likely thing to happen is nothing.” 5', 'An oblique fracture is defined as “the line of which runs obliquely to the longitudinal axis of the bone.” Stedman’s Medical Dictionary 771 (28th ed. 2006). Doctor Adewusi testified that an oblique fracture is “sometimes refer[red] to * * * as a spiral fracture.”', '-10- She further opined that “the second [likely injury]” could be “a hematoma”—“some sort of bump on the head” (explaining that, “in this age group,” the head “is the heaviest part” and is “usually * * * the first thing that makes contact with the ground”). Doctor Adewusi added that “[t]he third likely injury would * * * be something to the head; specifically, a nondisplaced skull fracture * * *.”6 She noted that she was not concerned that Adrina suffered from osteogenesis imperfecta, which she defined at trial as “a genetic disorder” that “cause[s] * * * breaks in the bones.”', 'It was Dr. Adewusi’s testimony that, on January 1, 2014, she filed a Physician’s Report of Examination, requesting that a hold be issued as to Adrina; she said that she did so because she had “not be[en] provided with the history that fit [Adrina’s] injuries.” She testified that, in her opinion, “based on [her] clinical knowledge and practice,” as well as the history that had been provided by respondents, it was “concerning” that Adrina had petechiae and a femur fracture. Doctor Adewusi stated that her concern was that Adrina’s injury was “inflicted.”', 'On cross-examination, Dr. Adewusi conceded that “no magical test” exists to conclude with certainty that a particular type of broken bone is due to an accident as opposed to abuse. However, she stated that her opinion was “based on what is most probable.” Doctor Adewusi also testified that, in her experience, “babies don’t present to the hospital just from crying with petechiae on their face.” When asked whether “it is [her] opinion, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that [Adrina’s] petechiae could not have been caused by her crying due to the 6', 'On cross-examination, Dr. Adewusi testified that, if the baby had fallen from the bed and had planted her foot on landing, she “would have a different kind of fracture,” which she described as “a buckle fracture.” She further testified: “I don’t know how it would land on its foot first * * * because their head is the heaviest, but if it landed on the foot, * * * it would probably have a buckle fracture; labia of the tibia from the planting of the foot.” It was Dr. Adewusi’s opinion that, “because of the weight of the [baby],” her head would hit the floor first. However, she did add that “anything is possible, but it’s what is probable.”', '-11- pain from the injury of her leg,” she replied: “Yes.” Doctor Adewusi further testified that the following accident-related scenario could have caused Adrina’s femur fracture: “[I]f the parents described to [her] that * * * the baby was falling, someone grabbed the leg[,] * * * and the baby then continued to twist around the leg[.]” It was essentially her testimony that “something from the outside” was thus “need[ed].”', '5. The Testimony of Doctor Thomas Puleo', 'Doctor Thomas Puleo, who was Adrina’s pediatrician, testified on behalf of respondents as an expert witness, qualified in pediatrics. He testified that Adrina had been his patient since “the first week of [her] life.” Doctor Puleo stated that Ms. Hebert and Mr. Tirocchi always brought Adrina to all of her scheduled well-visits; he added that Adrina’s vaccinations “were administered in a timely fashion.”', 'He further testified that, “at the two-month visit[,] in anticipation for the development that occurs between two months and four months,” he “normally” warns parents as follows: “Be careful what surface you put them on” because “[a] lot of babies between two and four months begin to roll or move just enough.” It was then Dr. Puleo’s testimony that, after being notified that Adrina had been admitted to the hospital, he went to see her because she is his patient. When asked about his observations of her, Dr. Puleo responded: “I did not examine Adrina close enough to make a comment.”', 'Towards the end of Dr. Puleo’s testimony on direct examination, he was asked whether a three-month-old baby with a broken femur might experience sufficient pain to cry forcefully enough to cause petechiae, to which he answered: “It’s physically possible, yes.” He testified that, in his interaction with Adrina during previous appointments, he had neither seen nor noted anything about the parents’ interaction with Adrina that caused him to be concerned. Doctor', '-12- Puleo added that, during his care of Adrina, he had never seen any evidence of neglect and abuse.', 'On cross-examination, Dr. Puleo testified that, prior to the incident at issue, his last well- visit with Adrina was on November 29, 2013. He acknowledged that, during said visit, he had not noted that Adrina was able to roll over, which is a developmental milestone. It was also Dr. Puleo’s testimony that, “depend[ing] on the child’s development,” “very often between two and four months a lot of babies move around enough to be able to * * * move or squirm * * * to get themselves in a situation to fall or roll off a surface.” He added that, if a parent puts a baby on a bed, that baby could fall off the bed, whether the parent stays in the room or leaves it.', '6. The Testimony of Doctor Jeremy Doak', 'Doctor Jeremy Doak, who was qualified as an expert in pediatric orthopedics, testified that he first saw Adrina regarding her fractured femur on January 1, 2014. It was his testimony on direct examination that, in his opinion, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, an oblique fracture could happen “accidentally.” He added that “[a]ny type of fall can cause an oblique fracture.” Doctor Doak was next asked the following question: “Hypothetically, could a three- month-old [baby] fall off a surface 28 inches high and have a resulting oblique femur fracture?” He answered in the affirmative. Doctor Doak additionally stated: “[T]he higher you fall from, the more likely you are to fracture, but people fall from standing and [they] fracture bones.”', 'It was Dr. Doak’s testimony that he could not rule out the possibility that Adrina’s injury was “accident[al]” nor that it was “nonaccidental.” He added that “any type of fall can cause any number of fractures.” According to Dr. Doak, upon his review of X-rays, he stated that “a metaphyseal corner fracture * * * tends to be associated with child abuse,” but he said that no', '-13- such signs were present with respect to Adrina. He further testified that, based on the radiologic findings alone, he could not determine how Adrina’s fracture had occurred.', 'On cross-examination, Dr. Doak acknowledged that he had written in his report (dated February 2, 2014) that “Adrina’s right femur suffered an oblique fracture, which is generally atypical for a nonambulatory patient.”7 (He defined the word “atypical” as meaning “more unlikely than likely.”) Doctor Doak further summarized as follows one of the policies of the pediatric orthopedic division of his hospital: doctors must consult with DCYF “if there’s a femur fracture in a nonambulatory child” and must do so “[]regardless of the fracture pattern.” Towards the end of Dr. Doak’s testimony on cross-examination, he testified that, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, if a child fell from a bed twenty-eight inches high, the injury to the child would not be limited to “only a buckle fracture of the femur.” In addition, he noted in his testimony on redirect examination that oblique femur fractures are not necessarily caused by abuse—stating that they “can be caused by any number of things.”', 'B', 'The Family Court Justice’s Decision', 'After having reviewed the testimony and other evidence, the trial justice issued a written decision on November 10, 2014. In that decision, she preliminarily noted that Adrina “suffered an oblique femur fracture to her right leg, which is highly unusual in a non-mobile child.” The trial justice then expressed “significant concern” relative to the “fact that [Ms. Hebert] was conveniently out of the home at the time of the in[cident], and that [Mr. Tirocchi] had taken full responsibility” for Adrina’s injury. From the trial justice’s vantage point, “There [we]re too 7', 'When asked why femur fractures are more frequent in ambulatory children than nonambulatory children, Dr. Doak replied: “Because they’re more likely to fall, trip, [and] get injured” from running and walking, which activities he noted they are able to do on their own.', '-14- many unanswered questions” and “too many answers that d[id] not fit the facts as presented, including [Adrina’s] resulting injury * * *.” Having reviewed the medical testimony at trial, she was unpersuaded by the contention that Adrina fell off the bed; instead, she was “convinced” that Adrina’s injury was “anything but accidental.” Although the trial justice remarked that she was “not certain as to how this injury occurred,” she nonetheless found that there was “no medical explanation to support the parents’ contention” (i.e., that Adrina was injured as a result of a fall from the bed). The trial justice ultimately concluded that there was “no doubt * * * that both parents know how this injury occurred but neither parent has told the truth * * *.”', 'The trial justice proceeded to cite to the cases of In re Vannarith D., 731 A.2d 685 (R.I. 1999), and In re Chester J., 754 A.2d 772 (R.I. 2000). Drawing on language contained in those two cases, the trial justice expressed her understanding that the state need not prove “which parent actually inflicted the abuse” in view of the principle that “[d]rawing inferences from established facts is an elementary tenet of judicial fact-finding.” See In re Chester J., 754 A.2d at 777-78. She further observed that “[a]llowing parents to ignore or stand by while * * * abuse and neglect occurs is tantamount to the parents inflicting the abuse themselves.” See id. at 778. The trial justice proceeded to explain as follows why she “d[id] not believe either parent:”', '“[I]t [is] very unusual and somewhat bizarre that the father', 'allegedly left the baby on the bed unattended when there were so', 'many other safe places to put this child and that father would be on', 'the cell phone with mother and on the land line with 911', 'simultaneously after the alleged injury. Adding to that is the', 'bizarre and unusual testimony and actions of the mother -being out', 'of the house at exactly the time of the injury; making a call to the', 'father from the liquor store but not disclosing that prior to the trial;', 'not stating the child’s name through her entire testimony; her', 'reaction upon her coming back to the house and seeing her', 'daughter allegedly screaming in pain on the bed yet not going over', 'to her to touch, hug, hold or console her; having never reported to', 'anyone prior to the date of the injury occurring that the child had', 'rolled over on her own.”', '-15-', 'Ultimately, “[b]ased on the medical evidence and [trial] testimony,” the trial justice concluded that there were “absolutely no facts” supporting the parents’ explanation that Adrina had fractured her femur as a result of a fall from the bed. In the judgment of the trial justice, “[t]he uncontradicted medical testimony supports the State’s allegation of abuse and neglect.”', 'The trial justice made the following findings of fact with respect to both parents, indicating that said findings had been proven by clear and convincing evidence: (1) “The parents have failed to provide said child with a minimum degree of care, supervision, or guardianship[;]” (2) Adrina “is without proper parental care and supervision[;]” (3) “[T]he parents have inflicted or allowed to be inflicted upon [Adrina], physical injury[;]” and (4) “[T]he parents have created or allowed to be created a substantial risk of physical injury to [Adrina].” The trial justice further found that Adrina was “Neglected and Abused as to mother and father;” and she proceeded to order that Adrina be committed to the care, custody, and control of DCYF. Each parent filed a timely notice of appeal.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'At the outset, we note that the pertinent standard set forth in Rule 17(b) of the Family Court Rules of Juvenile Proceedings reads as follows: The “[d]etermination that a child is abused, neglected, or dependent shall be made upon clear and convincing evidence.” Rule 17(b) further instructs “[t]he court * * * [to] clearly state the facts upon which it bases such determination and its reasons therefor.” Also, the clear and convincing standard “requires that the fact-finder form a ‘clear conviction without hesitancy of the truth of the precise facts in issue.’” In re Adner G., 925 A.2d 951, 957 (R.I. 2007) (quoting Parker v. Parker, 103 R.I. 435, 442, 238 A.2d 57, 61 (1968)).', '-16-', 'When this Court reviews an appeal from a decree of the Family Court, we must undertake an examination of “the record to determine whether legally competent evidence exists in it to support findings made by the trial justice.” In re Adner G., 925 A.2d at 957 (quoting In re Mackenzie C., 877 A.2d 674, 685 (R.I. 2005)). “These findings ‘are entitled to great weight and will not be reversed on appeal unless the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence, or was otherwise clearly wrong.’” In re Mackenzie C., 877 A.2d at 685 (quoting In re Isabella C., 852 A.2d 550, 555 (R.I. 2004)). While bearing in mind this deferential standard, it is our role to scour the record “to determine if legally competent evidence exists to support” the trial justice’s finding that there was clear and convincing evidence that Ms. Hebert abused and neglected Adrina. In re Veronica T., 700 A.2d 1366, 1368 (R.I. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'III', 'Analysis', 'On appeal before this Court, Ms. Hebert contends that the trial justice “erred as a matter of law and abused her discretion” in making the above-summarized findings because she purportedly: (1) “overlooked and misconceived the evidence;” (2) “misread[] and erroneously rel[ied]” on two cases (viz., In re Vannarith D., 731 A.2d 685 (R.I. 1999) and In re Chester J., 754 A.2d 772 (R.I. 2000)); and (3) “ignor[ed] evidence contradicting her findings, and disregard[ed] uncontroverted evidence because she did not find the parents credible.”', 'Having reviewed the record with particular care, it is our opinion that the trial justice erred in finding that Ms. Hebert abused and neglected Adrina; we have been unable to perceive in the record sufficient evidence that would satisfy the clear and convincing standard.', '-17-', 'Preliminarily, the trial justice expressly noted that “[t]here [we]re too many unanswered questions” and “too many answers that d[id] not fit the facts as presented” in the instant case, especially her “[un]certain[ty] as to how [Adrina’s] injury occurred,” thereby manifesting her “hesitancy [as to] the truth of the precise facts in issue.” In re Adner G., 925 A.2d at 957 (internal quotation marks omitted). While a “factfinder may always draw inferences from the evidence presented” when finding abuse, such “inferences must be based on some evidence, either direct, or circumstantial.” Id. at 962 (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, Ms. Hebert testified that she was not present at the time of her daughter’s injury, and no evidence to the contrary was presented.', 'Moreover, we are persuaded by Ms. Hebert’s second contention to the effect that the trial justice “erroneously rel[ied]” on In re Vannarith D., 731 A.2d 685 and In re Chester J., 754 A.2d 772, both of which cases are clearly inapposite to the case before us. The case of In re Vannarith D., 731 A.2d at 689, involved a criminal defendant who challenged “the sufficiency of evidence establishing possession of the contraband;” we ultimately held that said defendant had been in constructive possession of the narcotic, as inferred from the totality of the circumstances, “notwithstanding the fact that the contraband was not in his * * * immediate physical possession.” In the present case, while the trial justice correctly noted that she could “[d]raw[] inferences from established facts” in the course of her judicial fact-finding, she improperly cited In re Vannarith D. for the proposition that the state need not prove “which parent actually inflicted the abuse.” Try as we might, we fail to comprehend how In re Vannarith D. is applicable to the instant matter.', 'With respect to In re Chester J., 754 A.2d at 777, which involved a petition to terminate parental rights with respect to a minor child on the basis of cruel and abusive conduct, it was', '-18- readily apparent that the evidence established that said child suffered “no fewer than nine rib fractures of various ages, indicating that they [had been] incurred over a sustained period.” Notably, in that case this Court remarked that “the quantum and the obscene nature of the abuse was so overwhelming that the trial justice could not ignore the reasonable inferences to be drawn from the evidence.”8 Id. at 777-78 We held that “[a]llowing parents to ignore or to stand by while such abuse and neglect occurs is tantamount to the parents inflicting the abuse themselves * * *.” Id. at 778. As pointed out by Ms. Hebert in her appellate papers, the instant case is not reasonably comparable to the cited case. There is nothing in the record that reflects a pattern of injuries “incurred over a sustained period.” Id. at 777. Rather, the injury incurred by Adrina, although significant, was a one-time incident, one at which Ms. Hebert was not present.', 'We further find ourselves persuaded by Ms. Hebert’s remaining contention on appeal— viz., that the trial justice “overlooked” if not “ignor[ed]” material evidence “contradicting her findings, and disregard[ed] uncontroverted evidence.” In the trial justice’s written decision, she expressly concluded that there was “uncontradicted medical testimony support[ing] the State’s allegation of abuse and neglect” because, in her view, there were “absolutely no facts” to substantiate the explanation that Adrina had “fractured her femur from a fall off the bed.” However, it is noteworthy that there did exist conflicting medical evidence at trial—namely the difference between the testimony of Dr. Adewusi on the one hand and that of Dr. Puleo and Dr. Doak on the other. That medical testimony left it unclear whether Adrina’s injury was inflicted 8', 'Although the state argues in its appellate papers that, based on In re Nicole B., 703 A.2d 612 (R.I. 1997) and In re Frances, 505 A.2d 1380 (R.I. 1986), “the State is not required to prove the identity of the perpetrator,” nor should the presence of a parent at the time of the injury be a “deciding factor,” we deem those two cases to be distinguishable. Unlike the case at bar, both of the just-referenced cases affirmed abuse and/or neglect findings against respondent parents who offered no adequate explanation for their children’s multiple injuries. In re Nicole B., 703 A.2d at 617-18; In re Frances, 505 A.2d at 1384.', '-19- as a result of abuse or was merely accidental in nature. It was equally unclear whether petechiae could be caused by excessive crying alone. What was factually uncontested was Ms. Hebert’s lack of presence at the time of Adrina’s injury.', 'At the end of the day, although a trial justice’s findings of fact are generally accorded “great weight,” In re Mackenzie C., 877 A.2d at 685, the findings of the trial justice in this case are not supported by sufficient legally competent evidence and, therefore, constitute reversible error. In re Adner G., 925 A.2d at 962. In addition, to say without more extensive explanation that it was “bizarre and unusual” that Ms. Hebert was “conveniently” out of the house running errands when Adrina was injured or that Ms. Hebert did not specifically refer to her daughter by name during her testimony does not constitute an adequate predicate for the trial justice’s finding of abuse and neglect in the instant case. Nor, it should be noted, should the fact that Ms. Hebert chose not “to touch, hug, hold or console” Adrina in the brief moment she had until the emergency responders arrived have served as an indication of any such neglect or abuse.9 We conclude that, keeping in mind the pertinent standard of review, the evidence presented was insufficient to permit a reasonable inference to be drawn that Ms. Hebert abused and neglected Adrina.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the decree of the Family Court as it pertains to Briana Hebert. The record in this case may be returned to that tribunal. 9', 'It bears recalling that Ms. Hebert testified at trial that she decided not to touch Adrina at that time out of fear that doing so would “cause * * * more injury to her.”', '-20- STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND', 'PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS', 'SUPREME COURT – CLERK’S OFFICE', 'OPINION COVER SHEET Title of Case', 'In re Adrina T.', 'No. 2015-91-Appeal.

He was found guilty of Count One, the first-degree murder of Henry Vargas, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-23-1; he was also found guilty of Count Two, the discharge of a firearm while committing a crime of violence, “resulting in the death of Henry Vargas,” in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-47-3.2(b)(3). The defendant’s contention on appeal is that the trial justice erred when, in the defendant’s words, “he refused to give an eyewitness identification jury instruction approved by this Court in State v. Werner, 851 A.2d 1093, 1102 (R.I. 2004).” We disagree with the defendant’s contention in this regard; and, for the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In the early morning hours of November 6, 2009, Henry Vargas was shot outside Club Platinum, a nightclub on Broad Street in Providence; and, tragically, he died as a result. His girlfriend, Carmelina Bueno, was an eyewitness to that shooting.', '-1-', 'On January 15, 2010, a Providence County grand jury indicted defendant on two counts: Count One, the first-degree murder of Henry Vargas, in violation of § 11-23-1; and Count Two, the discharge of a firearm while committing a crime of violence, resulting in the death of Henry Vargas, in violation of § 11-47-3.2(b)(3). The defendant’s jury trial, which was held in June of 2011, involved the testimony of twenty-two witnesses (seventeen testifying on behalf of the state and five testifying on behalf of the defense). At the conclusion of the trial, the jury returned a verdict finding defendant guilty of both of the above-referenced counts. On June 8, 2012, the trial justice sentenced defendant to two consecutive life sentences. A timely notice of appeal was filed.', 'We recount below the salient aspects of defendant’s trial to the extent necessary to provide context for the single issue raised on appeal—whether or not the trial justice committed reversible error in denying defendant’s motion for a jury instruction that would include, verbatim, particular language from the jury instructions in Werner, 851 A.2d at 1102 (i.e., the Werner instruction),1 which language cautioned the jurors in that earlier case about the fallibility of eyewitness identification.2 1', 'In this opinion, we shall usually refer to the instruction that is quoted in State v. Werner, 851 A.2d 1093, 1102 (R.I. 2004), which instruction defendant asserts should have been part of the jury instructions at his trial, as “the Werner instruction.” 2', 'In “Defendant’s Motion for Jury Instruction,” which was submitted to the Superior Court, he quoted the entirety of the Werner instruction and requested that the jury be instructed in those words.', '-2-', 'The Testimony of Carmelina Bueno', 'Carmelina (“Carmen”)3 Bueno, the sole testifying eyewitness to the shooting of her boyfriend, Henry Vargas, testified that they had been “partner[s]” for five years. She stated that, on the night of November 5, 2009, she and Henry “went to a nightclub [in Providence] called Platinum,” where they arrived at approximately 11:30 or 11:45 p.m. and from which they left at 1:00 a.m. She testified that, upon leaving Club Platinum, as she and Henry were crossing Aldrich Street (a street that intersects Broad Street, where Club Platinum is located)4 to walk towards Henry’s parked car, “there were two people behind [them]”—one woman and one man; she added that she looked at the man for a “[f]ew seconds.” In addition, she stated that she saw another female, who she said was “cross[ing] the street.” Her testimony was that, once she and Henry reached his car, she walked to the passenger side, while he went to the driver’s side. Carmen testified on direct examination that the above-referenced man, who was behind them as they crossed Aldrich Street, “called Henry out to fight and said[:] ‘You fat one, didn’t you want to fight me? Come now.’” When she was further asked on direct whether or not she “notice[d] anything about the man as he said those words[,]” she replied: “I kept looking at him to see if it was true that he wanted to fight, but, when I saw him smiling, then I turned my face towards Henry. And Henry was already running towards him.” It was Carmen’s testimony that she “walked towards the back” of Henry’s car because Henry was no longer in her sight. Then, she and the prosecutor engaged in the following exchange about the shooting incident: 3', 'Because Henry Vargas and Carmelina (“Carmen”) Bueno are so frequently referred to only by their first names throughout the record, we shall do likewise. In doing so, we intend no disrespect. 4', 'When Carmen was asked about the lighting conditions at the corner of Aldrich and Broad Streets at approximately 1:00 a.m., she said: “You could see clearly.” She noted that there were street lights outside—although she did add that “[i]t was drizzling.”', '-3-', '“[PROSECUTOR]: What’s the next thing you remember?', '“[CARMEN]: The man grabbed the gun. (Witness crying) * * *.', 'And he started shooting at [Henry]. (Pause) I called Henry, and I', 'told him to come back.', '“[PROSECUTOR]: Carmen, you said the man pulled out a gun?', '“[CARMEN]: He took the gun out of the jacket.', '“[PROSECUTOR]: Did you see him fire a shot?', '“[CARMEN]: Yes. I saw him. I can’t forget that.', '“* * *', '“[PROSECUTOR]: * * * [W]hat happened next?', '“[CARMEN]: He kept shooting. Henry came to me.', '“[PROSECUTOR]: From the time that you heard the man say', '‘Hey fat boy,’ until the time that he was done shooting, how long', 'did you look at the man?', '“[CARMEN]: The whole time he was shooting.', '“[PROSECUTOR]: Do you know how -- can you estimate how', 'long that was?', '“[CARMEN]: To me, it was an eternity, but I don’t know.”', 'Carmen further testified that, while the shooting was taking place, she “didn’t do anything” and “stood there,” looking at the shooter, who faced in her direction; she added that she focused on the shooter’s face, particularly “his smile.” When Carmen was asked whether “anything that distracted [her] view of the [shooter,]” she answered in the negative. She also testified to having simultaneously heard one of the two previously mentioned women who were close to the scene of the shooting say: Danilo, “what are you doing?”5 Carmen stated that she saw the shooter run, and she said that he “kept on shooting;”6 she added that, in reaction to the shots being fired, the two above-referenced women, both of whom were standing near the shooter, started running. Carmen stated that she told Henry to “throw [him]self on the ground.” 5', 'The trial transcript records Carmen’s testimony as to her recollection of the name uttered by one of the women at the time of the shooting as being variously “Dareeo (phonetic)” and “Dario (phonetic).” However, at another point, the transcript records Carmen’s recollection of what the woman said as: “Danilo, what are you doing?” (It will be recalled that defendant’s middle name is Danilo.) 6', 'When Carmen was asked on cross-examination at trial whether she had previously testified before the grand jury that the shooter had been standing still, she responded in the affirmative.', '-4- On cross-examination, Carmen testified that, after the shooting, Henry told her that he had been hit; and she said that she “walked to him to see what had happened.” It was further Carmen’s testimony that she saw the shooter, who had been running, get into the passenger side of a dark- colored SUV parked on Aldrich Street, which vehicle then departed. She stated that, after calling 911, she saw Henry lying on the ground and she felt afraid that “[he] was going to die.” Carmen conceded on cross-examination that her attention was on Henry at that moment. She further testified that two of the three security guards from Club Platinum7 approached her and one of them asked what had happened. She stated that she told that inquiring security guard that “he knew who had done it;” she added, however, that he replied that he did not know.', 'Upon being questioned at trial as to the description of the shooter, Carmen replied: “He didn’t look too tall.” She added that the shooter was “maybe five-nine, [or] five-ten.” Carmen testified that “[h]e was 36 or 37 years old” and weighed about 170 pounds. She further described the shooter as having had “short black hair” and “a clean face” and no facial hair. Carmen added that she had seen the shooter wearing “jeans and a [black] jacket.”8 It was also her testimony on cross-examination that she had previously told the police that the shooter “looked and sounded Dominican;” however, in her testimony before the grand jury, she had said that the shooter had “light skin, like an Indian.” At trial, Carmen explained as follows the just-quoted description of 7', 'According to Carmen, she had seen three security guards working at Club Platinum on the night in question. Each of them was male; the first she described as being “[c]hubby” and “bald;” the second she described as being “[d]ark-skinned;” and the third security guard she said was “[t]he one who killed Henry.” (After a careful perusal of the record, we note that there was no evidence indicating that defendant worked as a security guard at Club Platinum.) 8', 'We also note that, later in Carmen’s testimony at trial, she responded in the affirmative to having earlier seen the shooter inside Club Platinum (on the night of November 5) wearing a “black [shirt]” with “white letters that spelled [the word] ‘security’” on the back of his shirt.', '-5- the shooter: “For us, an Indian is a person [who is] not dark nor white.” When Carmen was asked if she were referring to a Native American, she replied: “No. An Hispanic.”', 'On direct examination, Carmen stated that, at 4:30 a.m. in the morning of the November 6 shooting, she gave a statement to Detective Kenny Court of the Providence Police Department. Carmen further testified that she met with Det. Court on three occasions—viz., November 6, 7, and 10. She said that, on one of those occasions, the detective showed her a photograph of DJ Nelson, a disc jockey who had been at Club Platinum on the night in question; she stated that she responded to the detective that DJ Nelson and the person who killed Henry “look[] alike, but DJ Nelson is darker.” Although Carmen admitted that she could not “determine the [skin] color” on the basis of the black-and-white photograph shown to her by the detective, she nonetheless said that she could comment on “the face.” On cross-examination, defense counsel posed questions to her as to whether or not she had told the police that DJ Nelson shot Henry or that she was “80 percent sure that DJ Nelson shot Henry,” but Carmen repeatedly replied: “No.” (It bears noting that Carmen later acknowledged in her testimony at trial that she once told an investigator named Ralph Gemma and his paralegal that she “believed [DJ Nelson] was involved in the shooting.”)', 'Carmen further testified that, on the night of November 15, 2009 (over a week after the shooting of Henry), she was at the home of her sister, Jacinta, in a housing complex referred to in the record as “Chad Brown.” Carmen stated that Jacinta “saw [DJ Nelson] coming out of a SUV with men,” which Carmen acknowledged took place outside the Chad Brown complex. She said that, in reaction thereto, the two sisters became “nervous;” she added that, in due course, Jacinta called the police. On direct examination, Carmen acknowledged that she was “afraid” of DJ Nelson due to the fact that, on a prior occasion at Club Platinum, Henry had “said [to her] that somebody had [told him] that they wanted to kill him * * *.” Carmen continued summarizing', '-6- what transpired on that prior occasion as follows: “And then I said[,] ‘Who is it? Show me.’ And * * * Henry said, ‘No. DJ Nelson took him away.’” She added that her fear on November 15 also stemmed from the fact that the shooter had not yet been apprehended and the fact that she “didn’t know who DJ Nelson was with.” Notably, however, later in her testimony at trial, Carmen stated that she was no longer afraid of DJ Nelson.', 'It was further Carmen’s testimony that, on December 1, 2009, she met with Detective Emilio Matos, who presented her with a photo array and told her “[t]o take [her] time” looking at the photographs. However, she testified that, in “[l]ess than a minute,” she identified defendant as the person involved in the shooting of Henry, circling photograph “[N]umber 3” from the photo array. Carmen explained her selection of defendant (who appeared in photo number 3) as follows: “I selected picture number 3 * * * [b]ecause of his face, and I chose him because he said come fight. Grabbed the gun and shot [Henry].” Upon being asked whether or not she saw the shooter in the courtroom at trial, Carmen responded in the affirmative; and the record reflects that, at that juncture, Carmen proceeded to identify defendant as the individual who shot Henry. On cross-examination, defense counsel inquired of Carmen as to whether or not Det. Matos had told her: “Now that you’ve picked this person out, don’t change it this time.” Her answer to that question was: “I don’t remember that. He never said that.”', 'Carmen also testified that, earlier in the evening of the shooting, during the time when “[t]he lights were already on,” she had seen the shooter (whom she sometimes referred to in her testimony as the third security guard)9 near Henry inside Club Platinum. And she further testified that she saw the third security guard “arguing with Henry” at Club Platinum; she added that, thereafter, she heard one of those two men say: “[I]f he touched him once more, he would 9', 'See footnote 7, supra.', '-7- have a problem.” Carmen acknowledged that someone named Frank intervened and told them to stop arguing. On cross-examination, defense counsel asked Carmen if she had ever said to Det. Court or Det. Matos that she was no longer sure whether the security guard who had argued with Henry inside Club Platinum was the same man who had shot Henry, and she replied: “What I said is that I wasn’t sure if he was wearing a jacket or a T-shirt, but I never said that it wasn’t the same person.” Carmen added, “It [was] the same person that argued with Henry.”', 'In due course, the trial justice expressly noted that he had received defendant’s request for a “proposed instruction” on “eyewitness identification, citing and reflecting language contained in the Werner case.”10 The trial justice declined to grant defendant’s jury instruction request.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court reviews a trial justice’s jury instructions de novo. See State v. Imbruglia, 913 A.2d 1022, 1031 (R.I. 2007); see also State v. Ros, 973 A.2d 1148, 1166 (R.I. 2009). In conducting such a review, we must scrutinize “the instructions in their entirety to ascertain the manner in which a jury of ordinary intelligent lay people would have understood them,” and we must review the challenged portions of the instructions “in the context in which they were rendered” by the trial justice.', 'State v. Cardona, 969 A.2d 667, 674 (R.I. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Imbruglia, 913 A.2d at 1031; see also State v. Gomes, 604 A.2d 1249, 1256 (R.I. 1992); State v.

Lynch, 770 A.2d 840, 846 (R.I. 2001). A principle that is also pertinent in the instant case is that, “[w]hile a defendant may request that the trial justice include particular language in the jury instructions, the trial justice is not required to use any specific words or phrases when instructing the jury—so long as the instructions actually given adequately cover the law * * *.” State v. Adefusika, 989 A.2d 467, 477 (R.I. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Gillespie, 960 A.2d 969, 975 (R.I. 2008). And it goes without saying that “the law” which the instructions must adequately cover is the law as it exists at the time of trial.', 'Finally, even if a challenged jury instruction is deemed to have been erroneous, reversal is warranted “only if it can be shown that the jury could have been misled to the resultant prejudice of the complaining party.” State v. Sivo, 925 A.2d 901, 913 (R.I. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'III', 'Analysis', 'On appeal to this Court, defendant contends that “the trial justice erred when he refused to give an eyewitness identification jury instruction approved by this Court in State v.

Werner, 851 A.2d 1093 (R.I. 2004), it is clear that we never used the word “approved” therein with respect to the jury instruction presently at issue. While recognizing that in State v. Davis, 131 A.3d 679, 694-95 (R.I. 2016), we did use that verb with respect to the Werner instruction, we in no sense indicated that we were adopting it as a model or mandatory instruction on eyewitness identification. Indeed, in Davis, 131 A.3d at 695, we specifically noted that the Werner instruction “straddled the fine line between directing the jury’s attention to the inherent problems of eyewitness testimony and improperly commenting on issues within the framework of lay opinion.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.)', 'It should also be borne in mind that the principal issue in Werner, 851 A.2d at 1099- 1103, was whether or not the trial justice had abused his discretion in denying the defendant’s motion to present expert testimony regarding eyewitness identification, which is certainly not an', '-9- appellate papers, defendant focuses on the following alleged errors by the trial justice: “(1) under Rhode Island jurisprudence, it was error not to give the jury instruction requested * * * [;] (2) Carmen Bueno’s identification of Mr. Fuentes was especially unreliable[;] (3) [a] jury would not be able to properly weigh the credibility of Ms. Bueno’s identification in the absence of the instruction requested * * * [;] and, (4) [the trial justice’s] failure to provide the State v. Werner jury instruction gravely prejudiced the defense.”', 'For its part, the state, citing several opinions of this Court, responds that the trial justice’s decision “complied with Rhode Island law at the time [defendant’s] case was tried.” Specifically, the state asserts that, until the issuance of our opinion in State v. Davis, 131 A.3d 679, 697 (R.I. 2016) (“[T]he better practice would be for courts to provide the jury with more comprehensive instructions when eyewitness testimony is an issue * * *.”),12 “it [w]as established Rhode Island law that a specific jury instruction on [eyewitness] identification [was] not mandatory and [that a trial justice’s] failure to give such an instruction [was] not reversible error.” As a corollary to that assertion, the state argues that “Davis should not be applied retroactively to * * * case[s] tried before” the issuance of that opinion. Accordingly, the state contends that the trial justice who presided over defendant’s trial in 2011 “did not abuse his issue raised on appeal today. And our narrow holding in that case was “that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in finding that, based on the facts of th[at] case, an expert was not needed to testify on the issues defendant raised.” Werner, 851 A.2d at 1101. 12', 'Although we agree with the state that the aspirational dictum that we made in Davis has no relevance to the case at bar, we take this opportune moment to indicate that it represented our awareness of the evolving nature of our thinking on the issue of eyewitness identification testimony. See Davis, 131 A.3d at 696 n.13 (recognizing that we continue to be “cognizant of the growing concern in other jurisdictions with reliance on eyewitness identification testimony, the growing body of scientific and psychological studies regarding the questionable accuracy of the accounts of eyewitnesses, and the efforts made to prevent a miscarriage of justice”).

Moreover, an examination of the instructions given in the present case reveals that the trial justice provided the jurors with proper guidance as to the principles with which they would need to grapple in the course of their deliberations. The trial justice issued prefatory instructions about the presumption of innocence and about the state’s obligation to prove beyond a reasonable doubt: the existence of “each and every element of any offense charged” and that “defendant * * * did in fact commit” each offense charged. The trial justice summarized the specific charges against defendant and then, with admirable perspicacity, instructed the jury to consider factors relative to witness credibility—including, but not limited to, the “age,” “intelligence,” “candor,” “prejudice,” “motive,” “appearance,” “conduct,” and “demeanor” of each testifying witness. Noting that “there isn’t any magical formula by which [a juror] can weigh and assess the credibility of witnesses,” the trial justice advised the jurors that they should “bring * * * all of [their] experience from [their] everyday lives.” In addition, and notably, he instructed the jurors that they might consider “corroborating or contradictory evidence, as well as any consistencies or inconsistencies between what a witness testified to at trial and what that witness may have said * * * earlier[.]”', 'It is our opinion that the instructions given to the jury by the trial justice comported with our case law.

Payette, 557 A.2d 71, 73 (R.I. 1989) (“[I]t is established Rhode Island law that a specific jury instruction on identification is not mandatory and failure to give such an instruction is not reversible error.”). Of particular significance in view of defendant’s appellate', '- 11 - contentions, we note that the trial justice conscientiously exercised his discretion with respect to the issue of eyewitness identification—and he more than adequately covered the pertinent law in his instructions.', 'See Adefusika, 989 A.2d at 477; see also Gillespie, 960 A.2d at 975. Specifically, he conveyed to the jurors that the state must “prove beyond a reasonable doubt” that “defendant at trial did in fact commit” “each and every element of any offense charged.” See Imbruglia, 913 A.2d at 1033.', 'In view of the somewhat undulating nature of Carmen’s eyewitness testimony, we consider to have been of particular potential helpfulness to the jurors the following counsel contained in the seasoned trial justice’s instructions:', '“The jury system works because you, individually and collectively,', 'bring to the courthouse all of your experiences from your everyday', 'lives.

On July 30, 2012, three persons were brutally murdered in the Arbor Glen housing complex in Providence during an attempted robbery that took a tragic turn. Michael Martin, the primary target of the robbery, was shot nine times in the kitchen of his apartment. Damien Colon was shot once in the chest, and Shameeka Barros, who had been sleeping on a couch in the living room, was shot several times as the intruders fled the apartment.', 'Quandell Husband (defendant or Husband), then sixteen years old, was initially identified as the sole shooter. Following a waiver hearing in the Family Court, a Family Court justice waived that court’s jurisdiction over the juvenile. Subsequently, new information came to light and the state’s theory of the case indicated that Husband was not the shooter.', 'He was nevertheless indicted, tried, and convicted of three counts of first-degree murder, three counts of discharging a firearm while committing a crime of violence, and one count of conspiracy to commit robbery. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of conviction.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The state filed a petition of delinquency in Family Court against Husband, charging him with the following offenses: three counts of first-degree murder for the murders of Martin, Barros, and Colon; three counts of using a firearm during a crime of violence; and one count of conspiracy to commit robbery. The state also moved to waive the Family Court’s jurisdiction. On September 28, 2012, the Family Court hearing justice found probable cause to believe that Husband had committed the offenses charged; and, on October 19, 2012, the Family Court waived its jurisdiction over the juvenile based on the heinous and premeditated nature of the offenses. Husband was subsequently indicted by a Providence County grand jury on the same charges that were the subject of the Family Court delinquency petition.', 'A jury trial commenced on July 9, 2014. The state’s narrative was primarily established by Donovann Hall.1 Hall testified that he knew one of the victims, Martin, because Hall bought a “quarter” (seven grams) of marijuana from Martin every day. Martin lived with Barros and her two children. Hall occasionally hung out, smoked, and played video games with Martin and Colon at Martin’s apartment. While at Martin’s apartment, Hall noticed that Martin had a lot of money and marijuana, and he observed where Martin kept the money and marijuana. In July 2012, Hall formed the idea to rob Martin. Hall brought the idea to Tim DeBritto and, in the presence of Russell Burrell,2 told DeBritto that he had a “lick” in mind and, according to 1', 'Hall entered into a cooperation agreement with the state after his arrest on February 23, 2013, for his alleged involvement in the crimes at issue.

DeBritto also told Burrell to do the robbery with Hall. Burrell testified that DeBritto was his cousin and a very close friend. The three of them then went outside, Burrell leading the way, with a black, 9mm firearm in his hand. According to Burrell, DeBritto stayed behind. Hall identified the murder weapon as a black, Glock, 9mm handgun, with a red “light under the gun.”', 'According to Hall and Burrell, defendant showed up at DeBritto’s house just as they were leaving to rob Martin. Hall testified that he was surprised that Burrell invited defendant to participate because Hall had first met defendant when defendant robbed him for marijuana at gunpoint a couple of months earlier. In an earlier police interview, Burrell said that he told defendant about the robbery and that, at first, defendant did not want to participate but that he eventually “came around.” At trial, however, Burrell explained that everything he had said about defendant during the interview was not true, and he testified that defendant was “never” at Martin’s apartment.', 'Dakota Snell, Burrell’s acquaintance, also testified that she was at DeBritto’s house that evening and saw DeBritto, Burrell, and Hall wearing black hoodies, but that she did not see defendant there. According to Hall and Burrell, when they arrived at Martin’s apartment, Hall rang the doorbell or knocked on the window, and told Martin that they wanted to buy some “weed.” Martin invited them to enter. Inside, Colon was at the kitchen table; and Barros was lying down, asleep, on the living room couch. Burrell suddenly pulled out the gun and said, “You know what time it is” and asked, “where’s the shit?” According to officers told Burrell that defendant had named him as the shooter, Burrell said that defendant was the shooter and that the gun belonged to defendant. Burrell pled guilty to all charges against him on November 25, 2013, and he testified in the instant case under subpoena. 3', 'Hall testified that a “lick” means “[t]o rob somebody.”', '-3- Burrell, Martin pointed and said it was in the drawer. Hall and Burrell testified that, as Hall looked through the drawer, Burrell shot Martin.4', 'Hall also testified that, while this was happening, defendant was looking in a bedroom. Burrell then shot Colon in the chest and shot Barros several times. According to Burrell, Hall said, “Gotta kill her”, and Burrell gave Hall the gun and he shot her a final time. Hall testified, however, that he ran out of the apartment as soon as the first shot was fired. Hall testified that he stated, “it wasn’t supposed to happen like that” and that defendant responded, “Shit happens.”', 'Hall and Burrell both testified that Hall then obtained a ride to the home of Ivy Copeland.5 Hall testified that he told Copeland that the robbery he had planned “didn’t go the right way.” Copeland testified that Hall confided the details of the robbery to her, implicating himself and Burrell, and explained that DeBritto was the shooter. Copeland said that Hall never mentioned defendant’s participation. Seventeen shell casings were recovered from the crime scene, all of which were 9 millimeter.', 'Two witnesses also testified that they saw defendant going to 151 General Street, the crime scene location, and leaving that location after shots were fired. Jose Hernandez testified that he knew defendant from playing basketball and from attending programs at the Wanskuck Boys and Girls Club with him. Hernandez testified that, on the night of July 30, 2012, he heard eight or nine gunshots and saw defendant and Burrell put their hoods on and start running across General Street. He also testified that, when the police originally interviewed him, he said he was not sure if he had seen defendant because he was afraid of defendant.

See State v. Day, 911 A.2d 1042, 1045-46 (R.I. 2006). On September 14, 2012, the Family Court held a hearing pursuant to G.L. 1956 §§ 14-1-7 and 14-1-7.1 to determine whether the Family Court should relinquish its jurisdiction over defendant. The state presented two witnesses, Providence Police Det. Robert Washburn and juvenile probation officer Bridget Sarlo, and it introduced recorded', '-6- statements of defendant and various witnesses into evidence. The defendant presented character and alibi witnesses. On September 28, 2012, the Family Court found that probable cause existed to waive jurisdiction over defendant, stating:', '“[The defendant] was identified by two witnesses who placed him', 'at the scene immediately before and seen running from the scene', 'with * * * Burrell immediately after the shots were heard. * * *', 'Burrell, placed himself and [defendant] at the scene[,] stating it', 'was their plan to commit a robbery with a firearm that * * * Burrell', 'was aware [defendant] was carrying.

On January 14, 2014, the Family Court denied defendant’s petitions, stating: “Jurisdiction of', '-7- [defendant] and the offenses lie squarely in Superior Court.', 'There is no Family Court jurisdiction. There is no Family Court case pending. This [c]ourt lacks the power, authority and jurisdiction to entertain * * * [d]efendant’s request.” The Family Court further explained that the only relief from waiver is in § 14-1-7.1(c), which provides that, “[i]n the event that the child is acquitted of the offense for which the waiver has been sought, the waiver shall be vacated.” The Family Court also noted that, had it considered the new evidence presented, the same result would have been reached due to the principles relative to the vicarious liability of coconspirators. Two weeks later, the Family Court similarly denied a second petition by defendant to reopen the waiver hearing.', 'First, we address defendant’s assertion that the Family Court erred by focusing on the nature of the charges against him rather than on his conduct. Section 14-1-7.1 expresses that, before waiving jurisdiction over a juvenile, the Family Court must find probable cause to believe that a juvenile has committed the offense charged and then must examine the facts presented to determine if “the interests of society or the protection of the public necessitate the waiver” by considering either “the child’s past history of offenses, [and] history of treatment, or the heinous or premeditated nature of the offense[s.]” See Day, 911 A.2d at 1050.', 'The defendant argues that, after finding probable cause, the Family Court failed to address his conduct as required by prong two. The defendant contends that, under Day, 911 A.2d at 1053, the term “offense” as employed in § 14-1-7.1 means “the actions of the accused child.” Here, the Family Court addressed defendant’s conduct in its probable-cause analysis, finding that defendant rang the doorbell, owned the murder weapon, pulled out the gun, and shot the victims. The Family Court based its prong-two determination on the state’s theory that defendant had, in fact, committed the homicides, himself. In reaching its conclusion, the Family', '-8- Court unsurprisingly characterized triple homicide as “heinous in nature.” The defendant relies on Day in support of his argument that the Family Court must determine that his actions, rather than the crime, itself, are heinous. See Day, 911 A.2d at 1053 (explaining that the Family Court is limited to considering the actions of the juvenile and not the crimes charged and interpreting “offense” to mean “actions”).', 'In its probable-cause analysis, the Family Court credited the statement of Burrell that defendant shot Martin and Colon and then shot Barros as “[s]he woke up screaming” on the couch. Clearly, both the offenses and defendant’s actions therein, as presented in the evidence before the Family Court at the waiver hearing, were heinous in nature. Moreover, the Family Court correctly noted that the offense of conspiracy to commit robbery is by its very nature premeditated. Accordingly, we are of the opinion that the Family Court’s finding that “the interest of society or the protection of the public necessitate[d] the waiver of jurisdiction” over defendant is well supported by the evidence adduced at the waiver hearing.', 'We next address defendant’s assertion that the Family Court erred by refusing to vacate the waiver of Family Court jurisdiction. Section 14-1-7.1(c) provides, in relevant part, that “[a] waiver of jurisdiction over a child * * * shall constitute a waiver of jurisdiction over that child for the offense upon which the motion is based as well as for all pending and subsequent offenses of whatever nature”; only “[i]n the event that the child is acquitted of the offense for which the waiver has been sought” shall the waiver be vacated. In Day, 911 A.2d at 1053, we explained that “once the Family Court orders a waiver of its personal jurisdiction over a child, jurisdiction is vested completely in the adult court.” In the case at bar, the Family Court properly refused defendant’s repeated attempts to reopen the waiver hearing and correctly ruled that it had no authority to entertain his petition.', '-9-', 'Finally, we address defendant’s assertion that the Family Court erred by failing to consider his “background and potential for rehabilitation.” The defendant argues that the Family Court’s consideration of only one of the six factors relevant to a prong-two waiver determination under Rule 12(d) of the Family Court Rules of Juvenile Proceedings was insufficient. By its express language, however, Rule 12(c) sets forth two standards to provide guidance to the court in determining whether to waive jurisdiction, and Rule 12(d) delineates six relevant “[f]actors.”6 We do not read Rule 12, however, as mandating the application of these various factors in a case 6', 'Rule 12(d) of the Family Court Rules of Juvenile Proceedings articulates:', '“Factors in Determining Waiver. For purposes of applying the', 'standards set forth in subdivision (c) of this Rule the following', 'factors are relevant:', '“(1) The child’s prior delinquent and wayward acts and the', 'nature of the child’s conduct therein;', '“(2) The nature of the child’s alleged conduct in connection', 'with the current charge, to the extent that (a) such allegation of the', 'child’s conduct would form a pattern of anti-social conduct that', 'seems beyond the rehabilitative reach of facilities available to the', '[F]amily [C]ourt, or (b) such alleged conduct indicates that the', 'child is dangerous to the public (dangerous to be measured in light', 'of circumstances surrounding the alleged conduct, such as', 'aggressiveness and the nature of the reasonably foreseeable', 'consequences);', '“(3) The child’s age, to the extent that a length of time beyond', 'the limits of [F]amily [C]ourt jurisdiction is required for', 'reasonable prospects of the child’s rehabilitation;', '“(4) The child’s attitude, to the extent that it bears on the child’s', 'willingness to cooperate with [F]amily [C]ourt rehabilitative', 'efforts;', '“(5) The child’s family environment (including the degree of', 'care, supervision and support it provides the child), to the extent', 'that family support is essential to the [F]amily [C]ourt’s', 'rehabilitative program;', '“(6) The child’s prior contacts with rehabilitative facilities', 'available to the [F]amily [C]ourt, in the community and in juvenile', 'institutions, in terms of the extent and apparent rehabilitative', 'impact of such contacts.”', '- 10 - in which probable cause had been found that the child had single-handedly committed three murders. The Family Court, therefore, did not err in its analysis.', 'B', 'Miranda Rights', 'The defendant also argues that the Family Court erred by considering evidence that was gathered in violation of his Miranda rights. Specifically, defendant argues that his statements to Det. Washburn were “involuntary because Det. Washburn failed to afford [defendant’s mother] an opportunity to invoke [defendant]’s rights on his behalf, despite her presence in the station during the interrogation.”', 'The defendant did not move to suppress these statements during the Family Court waiver hearing.7 After five days of hearings at the Family Court, during closing argument, defendant’s counsel argued that the audio recordings of the interrogation violated defendant’s due-process rights because he was “never made aware of [his] rights or acknowledged it on the audio disc.” As a result, he argued, the recordings should be “weighed accordingly.” Although the Family Court justice said that she “listened to every CD recording in its entirety and took notes on what was heard,” her comprehensive bench decision does not present any indication that she relied on defendant’s statements to the police in rendering her decision. She thus gave the statements little weight, if any at all. We are of the opinion, therefore, that defendant’s argument that the Family Court violated his due-process rights by considering his statements is of no merit. 7', 'An audio recording of defendant’s interrogation was introduced into evidence.', '- 11 -', 'III', 'Evidence of Other Bad Acts or Crimes', 'The defendant also avers that the Superior Court erred in admitting a substantial amount of evidence concerning other crimes in the community, defendant’s past possession of a gun, and the suggestion that he committed past robberies. Specifically, defendant takes issue with the admission of testimony of defendant’s grandfather regarding his home confinement, “evidence regarding the shooting of Gary Ellerbe, [defendant]’s alleged possession of a gun at * * * Anderson’s house, and * * * Burrell’s description of how ‘we do a robbery.’”', 'A', 'Standard of Review', '“[I]t is well settled that we review a trial justice’s decision admitting or excluding evidence under an abuse of discretion standard.” State v.

Brown, 42 A.3d 1239, 1242 (R.I. 2012)).', 'B', 'Discussion', 'Rule 401 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence defines “relevant evidence” as “evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.” A determination of relevance “may have an important bearing on the rights of the accused because irrelevant evidence may also be prejudicial and its introduction at trial may constitute reversible error.” State v. Burke, 427 A.2d 1302, 1304 (R.I. 1981). In addition, Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence provides: “Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,', '- 12 - confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.” This Court has repeatedly warned that “the discretion to exclude evidence under Rule 403 must be exercised sparingly.” State v.

Finally, Rule 403 provides that even relevant “evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice * * *.”', '1', 'Defendant’s Alleged Possession of a Firearm', 'First, we address the evidence regarding defendant’s alleged possession of a firearm at Anderson’s house in June 2012. The defendant argues that Anderson’s testimony should not have been admitted because it is not probative of whether defendant was present at the crime scene on July 30, 2012. The defendant further argues that this testimony “suggests that he is * * * bad [and] dangerous * * *.” The defendant also argues that corroborative testimony given by Burrell should have been excluded because it implied past bad conduct by defendant.', '- 13 -', 'As previously noted, Anderson testified that approximately a month before the murders, defendant and Burrell came to his house and that defendant asked Anderson to hold a black, 9mm handgun defendant was carrying so that he could do pushups. Burrell corroborated this story at a police interview on March 31, 2014, and identified the 9mm handgun as the murder weapon. At a pretrial hearing on the state’s motion in limine, the Superior Court concluded that Anderson’s testimony was relevant because it showed that, “a month or so” before the murders, defendant was in possession of the murder weapon. The defendant did not object to Anderson’s testimony at trial; therefore, the issue has not been preserved for appellate review. See State v. Saluter, 715 A.2d 1250, 1258 (R.I. 1998) (“this [C]ourt will not consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal that was not properly presented before the trial court.” (quoting State v. Gatone, 698 A.2d 230, 242 (R.I. 1997))). Even if the issue had been properly preserved, however, we are satisfied that defendant’s argument lacks merit. As this issue may again arise if defendant is retried, we address it briefly.', 'In State v. Rios, 996 A.2d 635, 639 (R.I. 2010), similar evidence that a defendant on trial for murder frequently carried a gun was determined to be “relevant both to identify him as the murderer and to establish that he had the opportunity to commit the crime.” Here, defendant was not alleged to have carried the weapon during the crimes or to have been the actual shooter; rather, the evidence demonstrates that defendant had access to and was carrying the murder weapon approximately one month before the crimes. This evidence was relevant because it suggests a connection between defendant and the crime scene. The defendant was tried on the theory that he was vicariously liable as an aider and abettor of the robbery and murders. His possession of the very same murder weapon a little more than a month before the commission of', '- 14 - the crimes is probative of defendant’s participation in the conspiracy and murders. We are of the opinion, therefore, that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in allowing this evidence.', '2', 'The Ellerbe Shooting', 'The state also moved in limine to admit evidence concerning the shooting of Gary Ellerbe by DeBritto with the same 9mm handgun that was used to murder Martin, Colon, and Barros. The state’s argument was that the evidence would establish that the murder weapon “was a so- called ‘community gun’ * * * used variously by * * * DeBritto, * * * Burrell, * * * [and defendant].” The state sought to produce as witnesses Ellerbe, a Providence police officer who had recovered the shell casings from the scene of the Ellerbe shooting, and a ballistics expert who had compared those casings with the casings recovered at the scene of the triple homicide.', 'The defendant objected, arguing that such evidence was highly prejudicial with “very” limited probative value and that it would be “somewhat confusing to members of the jury.” The trial justice ruled that he would permit the evidence, but that he did not intend to retry the Ellerbe shooting.', 'He indicated that the evidence “corroborates the fact that this was a so-called community gun * * * [and] [i]t shows a close connection between Burrell and DeBritto in the months and days leading up to the armed robbery with the same weapon.”', 'At trial, defendant renewed his objection to evidence regarding the Ellerbe shooting, to no avail. Ellerbe testified that, on May 20, 2012, while driving in the vicinity of the Arbor Glen housing complex, he signaled another automobile to stop. That automobile was occupied by DeBritto, Burrell, and two other individuals.', 'Ellerbe said that he got out of his car and approached DeBritto, who was sitting in the front passenger seat, because he “wanted to figure out what was going on between [DeBritto] and his girlfriend and [Ellerbe’s] girlfriend, because', '- 15 - they w[ere] fighting.” Ellerbe further testified that, as he attempted to do so, DeBritto shot him in the back, told him to run, and kept shooting. He said that he was shot a total of nine times in his back, arm, leg, and down his side. A photograph of Ellerbe, depicting the bullet holes down his side, was introduced as a full exhibit without objection.', 'Providence Police Det. Douglas Allin testified that, on May 20, 2012, he responded to 85 General Street in the area of Arbor Glen. At that location, he discovered a red Volvo (later determined to have been driven by Ellerbe) with apparent gunshot damage. He also recovered six 9mm shell casings from the street.', 'Finally, Neil Clapperton of the Rhode Island Crime Laboratory was qualified as an expert in firearms and ballistics examination. He testified that the six shell casings recovered from 85 General Street were all discharged from the same firearm. He also compared these shell casings with the seventeen shell casings recovered from 151 General Street and determined that they all were fired from the same weapon, which he concluded was the firearm sent to the crime lab by the Providence Police in 2013—“[a] Glock model 17, caliber [9mm].”', 'Although the evidence concerning the shooting of Ellerbe was styled by the state as Rule 404(b) evidence, there was absolutely no testimony linking defendant to the incident in any way. Clearly, he was not the shooter; Ellerbe adamantly identified DeBritto as the person who shot him in the back. Nor was there any evidence suggesting that defendant was present at the scene or even aware of the shooting. At the pretrial hearing, the trial justice stated that the evidence:', '“certainly shows that DeBritto knew and trusted Burrell, to the', 'point that he had no qualms about using that firearm to shoot', 'someone in Burrell’s presence; that Burrell was not simply some', 'strange third party, but someone who seemingly enjoyed, or at', 'least easily tolerated DeBritto’s use of the firearm.', '“It shows a close connection between Burrell and DeBritto in', 'the months and days leading up to the armed robbery with the', 'same weapon.”', '- 16 - Such evidence, however, does not link defendant to this criminal cabal.', 'We think it significant to note that, when the state filed its motion in limine on February 17, 2014, defendant and DeBritto were co-defendants, the latter subsequently entering a plea. At the time, the state was seeking to admit the evidence of the Ellerbe shooting only with respect to DeBritto.', 'Based upon our review of the record, we are convinced that the testimony concerning the Ellerbe shooting had slight probative value, if any at all, with respect to defendant. To the extent that it may have shown a relationship between defendant and DeBritto and Burrell, through their shared possession of the 9mm Glock handgun, it was cumulative. See State v. Lynch, 854 A.2d 1022, 1032 (R.I. 2004) (“‘[c]umulative evidence’ means [evidence] ‘tending to prove the same point to which other evidence has been offered.’” (quoting State v. Coleman, 478 N.W.2d 349, 358 (Neb. 1992))).', 'Moreover, at trial, defendant’s relationship with the other coconspirators was not disputed. Burrell testified that he and defendant had been friends for several years; that they saw each other “[a] few times” a week; that Burrell has two children with defendant’s sister; that he lived with defendant’s mother for a time; that he and defendant went to school together and rode the bus together; and that they were “good friends.” Additionally, Burrell testified that he, defendant, and DeBritto shared possession of the handgun. Further, there is no dispute that Burrell was with defendant when Anderson saw defendant carrying the 9mm Glock handgun.', 'On the other hand, this testimony is highly likely to have had an unduly prejudicial impact on the jury. Ellerbe’s testimony is certainly the type that would be likely to rouse the emotions of a jury. He testified that he is a father of six and that he was shot in the back nine times. A photograph showing his injuries was introduced as a full exhibit. Moreover, the', '- 17 - evidence may well have been confusing to the jury. The fact that evidence was elicited at trial that defendant was seen in possession of the same firearm may have led the jurors to believe that he was somehow implicated in the Ellerbe shooting. We also observe that the evidence of a seemingly senseless shooting in the same neighborhood in which the murders would soon take place could not help but cast a pall in the eyes of the jury with respect to the frequency of violence in the community.', 'We are of the opinion, therefore, that the trial justice abused his discretion by not excluding the evidence of the Ellerbe shooting under a Rule 403 analysis. This is indeed a situation where the evidence was marginally relevant and enormously prejudicial. We are also unable to conclude that the admission of the evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.8', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court and remand this case for a new trial. 8', 'Because we vacate defendant’s judgment of conviction, we need not address the remaining issues raised by defendant on appeal.', '- 18 - STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND', 'PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS', 'SUPREME COURT – CLERK’S OFFICE', 'OPINION COVER SHEET Title of Case', 'State v.

[H]e was saying he wanted overtime and causing a commotion with other employees.”', 'Neither of these forms referenced any Facebook post as the cause of discharge.', 'On April 22, 2013, the director of DLT denied Beagan’s application because it found that Beagan had been discharged due to “unprofessional behavior in the workplace” and was disqualified from receiving benefits because his “actions were not in [the] employer’s best interest[]” pursuant to § 28-44-18.', 'Beagan timely appealed this determination to the appeal tribunal (referee) pursuant to § 28-44-43.9 On May 29, 2013, a hearing was held before the referee. At the hearing, both Beagan and Morancey testified. In addition to recounting the incidents of March 6 and 7 (as summarized herein), Morancey testified that “the Facebook posting was the reason [Beagan] was let go, ultimately.” He also noted that the reason he terminated Beagan’s employment, “aside from the fact that [Beagan] wrote what he did on Facebook, [was] that [there was] also a policy that [Beagan] [was] not supposed to use his cell phone for texting or Internet use while he[] [was] driving a company vehicle.

A District Court judge, thereafter, conducted a de novo review of the record and memoranda of counsel, and adopted the “Findings [and] Recommendations” as her own and issued an order affirming the decision of the board. 13', 'We note that several findings made by the referee, and later adopted by the board, are clearly erroneous and not supported by the evidence presented at the hearing. First, the referee found that Beagan violated a “company policy” concerning “insubordination,” but no such policy was introduced into the record, nor did the employer identify any. Furthermore, the referee found that Beagan “named his supervisor” in his Facebook posts; however, a review of all of the Facebook posts read into the record by Morancey reveals no instance where Morancey or Kemperle, Inc. are identified by name.', 'While it does not affect our ultimate conclusion in this case, we also pause to note that the District Court, in admirably endeavoring to “reconstruct” the decision of the referee due to the factual errors contained in that decision, overstepped its role. The Administrative Procedures Act provides that the reviewing court “shall not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.” G.L. 1956 § 42-35-15(g). Moreover, § 28- 44-54, the statute specifically dealing with the “[s]cope of judicial review” of a decision of the DLT board, states as follows: “The jurisdiction of the reviewing court shall be confined to questions of law, and, in the absence of fraud, the findings of fact by the board * * *, if supported by substantial evidence regardless of statutory or common law rules, shall be conclusive.” See Baker v. Department of Employment and Training Board of Review, 637 A.2d 360, 362 n.3 (R.I. 1994) (stating that “the standard of review defined in § 42-35-15(g) is consistent with the standard enunciated in the antedated § 28-44-54”). Rather than “reconstruct[ing]” the referee’s decision in order to alter the numerous factual errors which pervade that decision, the District Court should have remanded the case back to the referee to make accurate factual findings based', '-7-', 'The District Court opined that the posting of the offensive Facebook entry constituted misconduct or insubordination and was connected to Beagan’s work (albeit “barely so”). In addition, the District Court indicated that the allegations were proven because Beagan did not deny making the Facebook post. Because no company policy had been submitted, the District Court looked to several dictionary definitions of insubordination that defined it as an “unwilling[ness] to submit to authority,” or “a willful disregard of an employer’s instructions.” While acknowledging that there was no allegation that Beagan was insubordinate in “the usual sense,” the District Court concluded that “[t]he administrative fact-finders could well conclude that the posting of such materials was utterly corrosive of the supervisor-employee relationship * * * and that his continued employment by Kemperle[,] [Inc.] was impossible.” The District Court was reluctant to conclude that Beagan’s Facebook post was connected to his work, specifically noting that to so find “would be inviting management to monitor their employees’ social media accounts, which [the District Court] believe[d] would be a mistake.” However, the District Court ultimately determined that the facts established (1) that Beagan “baited” Morancey into searching his Facebook page and (2) despite this being a “slender reed upon which to base a finding that the postings were ‘connected’ to his work,” the connection was sufficiently established.', 'The District Court concluded “that the decision of the [b]oard * * * [was] supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence of record and [was] not clearly erroneous * * *.”14 on the record or have reversed the decision of the board if it concluded that the decision was not supported by substantial evidence. It was beyond the District Court’s prescribed role to make its own factual findings. 14', 'The District Court, “in order to avoid an unnecessary remand,” also considered the second reason presented by Morancey at the hearing as the basis of Beagan’s termination—that Beagan made the Facebook post while operating a company vehicle in violation of company policy.

In light of the fact that this second proffered reason for firing Beagan was not considered by the director, referee, or full board, and that the employer wholly failed to present any evidence that Beagan made the posting while operating the vehicle, we decline to address this issue and we affirm the District Court in this regard.', '-9-', 'On certiorari, this Court will not weigh the evidence; “we limit the scope of our review to the record as a whole to determine whether any legally competent evidence exists therein to support the trial court’s decision or whether the trial court committed error of law in reaching its decision.” Rhode Island Temps, Inc., 749 A.2d at 1124.

In Bunch v. Board of Review, Rhode Island Department of Employment and Training, 690 A.2d 335 (R.I. 1997), this Court concluded that the fact that the police found drugs in an employee’s home was disqualifying misconduct sufficiently connected to the employment, even though the conduct occurred outside of the claimant’s workplace, because the employer had the right to expect the employee to comply with criminal laws during and outside of her work. Id. at 337-38. We highlighted that this was especially true where the employee’s position as superintendent of the Rhode Island Training School for Youth was a position of “high visibility and great responsibility” and where “[m]any of the young people committed to her care at the training school were confined for drug-related offenses.” Id. at 335, 337-338. This Court, however, has yet to consider the connection between an employee’s alleged misconduct and the workplace as it relates to social media and online activity.', 'In asserting that the Facebook post was not connected to his employment, Beagan argues that he never named the “boss” he was referring to in his post and he also did not identify Kemperle, Inc. by name. Beagan also highlights that his post was not accessible by Morancey because Began had blocked Morancey from his Facebook page and that his Facebook profile “was not accessible by other workers of [Kemperle, Inc.].” Beagan contends that the District Court erred in finding a connection between the Facebook post and the workplace, insofar as said', '- 12 - post was neither made in the workplace nor permissibly accessible to the employer, his supervisor, employees, or customers of the employer.', 'While hesitant to find “the needed ‘connection’ with the workplace,” the District Court ultimately concluded that Beagan “baited * * * Morancey into searching out his Facebook page[,]” thus providing the requisite connection. We disagree. It is our opinion that Beagan’s alleged misconduct lacks the connection to the workplace contemplated by § 28-44-18. It is uncontested that Morancey was “blocked” from Beagan’s Facebook page, and there is no evidence that the post was directly accessible by any other employee, associate, or customer of Kemperle, Inc. Further, there is no allegation that Beagan authored the post on any electronic device belonging to his employer, nor does the content of the post relate to Beagan’s job performance. Moreover, the employer does not have a social media policy that was introduced into evidence. See Kirby v. Washington State Department of Employment Security, 342 P.3d 1151, 1152-53 (Wash. Ct. App. 2014). Beagan also specifically denied making the Facebook post while he was on the road; and the employer, which bears the burden of proof when seeking to have an employee disqualified from unemployment benefits, Foster-Glocester, 854 A.2d at 1018, presented no contrary evidence. Given all of these facts, we are of the opinion that Beagan’s statement to Morancey that he did not have access to Beagan’s Facebook page alone does not support a finding that the Facebook post was connected with Beagan’s work. Even if we were to accept the finding of the District Court that Beagan “baited” Morancey to access the Facebook post—a finding that was not made by the board—the mere fact that Beagan goaded Morancey into enlisting an anonymous third party to access the Facebook page would not, in the circumstances of this case, create a nexus with the workplace.', '- 13 -', 'Significantly, the question before this Court is not whether Beagan was properly terminated from his employment. Instead, our task is to examine the record to determine if any legally competent evidence exists therein to support a finding that Beagan was ineligible for unemployment benefits. See § 28-44-18. As we undertake this review, we do so in “light of the expressed legislative policy that ‘[the Employment Security Act] * * * shall be construed liberally in aid of [its] declared purpose which declared purpose is to lighten the burden which now falls on the unemployed worker and his [or her] family.’” Harraka v.

Accordingly, we decline “to enlarge the exclusionary effect of expressed restrictions on eligibility under the guise of construing such provisions of the act.” Id. We conclude, therefore, that legally competent evidence that Beagan’s Facebook post was connected to his work in the manner contemplated by § 28-44-18 is not present in the record before us.16', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, the decision of the District Court is quashed, and the papers in the case are remanded to the District Court with directions to enter judgment reversing the board and ordering that Beagan be awarded unemployment benefits.', 'Justice Goldberg, dissenting.

Specifically, the majority drew an inference that claimant’s conduct was not workplace related because “Morancey was ‘blocked’ from [claimant’s] Facebook page,” the Facebook post was not “authored * * * on any electronic device belonging to his employer,” and “the content of the post[ing] [did not] relate to [claimant’s] job performance.” However, these inferences overlook the evidence in the record supporting the board’s findings.', 'Indeed, the record indicates that claimant was scheduled to be terminated that morning for refusing to sign the company policy, and according to Morancey, claimant had been “creating a lot of ill-will.” This is the conduct that led to the final warning which the record discloses was short-lived.', 'Within hours of the final warning, claimant proceeded to “post[] derogatory comments about his supervisor on Facebook[.]” The claimant’s conduct was found to be “not in', '- 16 - the employer’s best interest.” The District Court reviewed this same evidence and agreed with the board, further concluding that claimant “baited [his supervisor] into searching out his Facebook page” such that his supervisor “had to look, and after looking, he saw [the Facebook posts], and having seen, he had * * * no choice but to terminate [claimant].” The District Court was satisfied that “on the particular facts of the instant case,” that “these comments [were brought] into the workplace”—by claimant—thus providing the “needed ‘connection’ with the workplace.” In light of this uncontradicted and competent evidence, it is my opinion that the majority has exceeded the boundary of certiorari review and erred in failing to defer to the findings made by the board and affirmed by the District Court.', 'Furthermore, I agree with the majority that this Court has yet to consider the use of social media in the employment context, or freedom of speech and employment policies for internet postings; those issues are not before the Court in this case.

Patrolman Hardy was dispatched in connection with a report of “an oozing liquid which was coming out of the garage” that had a “bad smell.” Upon entering the garage he “was struck with the smell of decaying flesh,” and he determined that the smell was emanating “from the back left corner of the garage.” Upon walking to the back left corner and tipping a green sofa over to identify the source of the smell, Hardy found a badly decayed body of what appeared to be an African-American female (the decedent). Hardy immediately called for a supervisor and secured the scene.', 'Detective William John Palmer of the Bureau of Criminal Identification (BCI) unit2 of the Cranston Police Department was called into work to investigate this matter. Upon arriving at the property with another BCI detective, Peter Souza, Det.

Detective Palmer also photographed “contents that were at [the decedent’s] feet that appeared to be dumped there,” and he observed a tan pocketbook and a green piece of clothing—later identified as a jumper. He identified several other items found by the decedent’s feet, including a cell phone charger, lotion, earphones, a Massachusetts identification card, and a black wig. Under the black wig, he discovered a body spray, Vaseline petroleum jelly, a couple of debit cards belonging to one Mary Grier, and a pair of size medium Joe Boxer underwear.', 'Detective Sergeant Michael Hollis Gates of the Cranston Police Department, who had also responded to the property that day, was given the Massachusetts identification card, but he could not identify the decedent in the garage due to the extensive decomposition of the body. Detective Gates testified that the name on the identification card was Mary Grier. On the next day, July 21, he, along with another detective, “follow[ed] up with the address that [they] had on the identification that was recovered next to the body.”', 'That address was in Dorchester, Massachusetts, where they met with Leslie and Jeanetta Trotman (the Trotmans), Grier’s foster parents.3 They indicated to the detectives that they believed Grier had been working at Foxy Lady, an adult entertainment club in Providence, and they also provided the detectives with the address of Regina Grier, Grier’s adoptive mother.4 Detective Gates went to Foxy Lady to follow 3', 'At trial, Jeanetta Trotman testified that Grier had been her foster child from the moment Grier was one day old until she was adopted four years later. 4', 'Regina Grier informed the detectives that she had last spoken to Grier sometime shortly after the Fourth of July holiday that year.', '-3- up on the information he had received from the Trotmans, and he learned that Grier “hadn’t been working there recently.”', 'The following day, July 22, Det. Gates met with Jesse Adams, defendant’s brother. According to Jesse Adams, in June 2012, defendant lived in the garage.5 Following the meeting with Jesse Adams, Det. Gates asked that a photo array be prepared containing defendant’s image and that defendant’s parole officer be contacted to ascertain defendant’s whereabouts. That same day, after having become confident that the decedent was Grier, Det. Gates returned to Dorchester to inform both sets of parents that Grier had passed away. Detective Gates obtained Grier’s cell phone number, and a fellow detective prepared search warrants for certain cell phone records. Subsequently, Det. Gates secured an arrest warrant for defendant.', 'On July 23, 2012, Det. Gates interviewed Jessica Dyer after “[he] was given information that there may have been a second female present at * * * [the] garage * * * the night that [they] believe[d] * * * Grier was murdered.” Dyer alleged that she had been assaulted by a man in the same garage on June 30, 2012. Detective Gates conducted a photo array with six photos of males who had the same general characteristics as defendant. Dyer identified defendant as her assailant.6', 'On July 24, the detectives learned of defendant’s whereabouts and proceeded to the Charlesgate Manor apartment complex in Providence to execute an arrest warrant. Detective Jaime Cahill of the Cranston Police Department testified that he entered a building in the 5', 'Detective Gates also obtained defendant’s phone number from Jesse Adams. At trial, Jesse Adams testified that, in June 2012, he would give defendant rides and that he had picked defendant up and dropped defendant off “[a] good two dozen times” at the garage.

She explained that the decedent was identified through dental records as Mary S. Grier and that the decedent’s body was “in a state of decomposition with partial skeletonization, meaning exposure of bone,” when examined. Doctor Revercomb explained that the decedent’s body arrived nude, with a ligature wrapped around her neck, a belly button piercing, and an anklet. She noted that a jumper-type garment accompanied the decedent’s body.', 'After explaining the procedure that she followed in examining the decedent’s body, Dr. Revercomb acknowledged that “decomposition can obscure surface features of the body.” During her external examination, Dr. Revercomb discovered bruising “on the front of the right knee, on the front of the lower right leg, and over the back of the index finger on the right hand.” She also testified to “a fracture without any bleeding into it of the left clavicle” and opined that, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, based on “[b]oth the appearance of the fracture break into that bone and its relationship to the body position at the scene,” that “this [was] a postmortem fracture; that [Grier] did not have a blood pressure when it happened.” During her internal examination of the decedent, Dr. Revercomb “saw some focal bleeding in the scalp.”', 'Doctor Revercomb concluded that the cause of death was homicidal violence.', 'She explained that “[h]omicidal violence is a blanket term for findings associated with an assault by another or others.” She reached this opinion based on several factors, including “the positioning of the body in a concealed location where it was found, the presence of the ligature around the neck with an * * * irregular knot[,]” the fact that the body was nude, the fact that there were', '-6- clothing and a wig present at the scene, “indicating a struggle,” and the fact that there were bruises on the decedent’s right leg and on her right-hand index finger, which Dr. Revercomb noted as resulting “potentially from a defensive cause or a defensive-type bruise.” She also indicated that the time of death was difficult to pinpoint due to the extent of decomposition. She opined that, based on the maggot activity she observed when visiting the garage on July 24, the death could have occurred “a week or more” prior to that date.', 'Tamara Wong, a forensic scientist employed at the Rhode Island Department of Health Laboratories, testified that she conducted a DNA analysis of “[a] ligature, three cuttings from a couch,”9 swabbing from the tan pocketbook, fingernail clippings belonging to the decedent, and “a reference sample from [defendant].” Her analysis of these items was inconclusive, either because there were multiple contributors to the DNA profile or because there was no DNA profile.', 'Wong also analyzed the pair of Joe Boxer underwear found in the garage, which resulted in a mixed DNA profile. Wong testified that the mixed DNA profile consisted of a major component and a minor component.', 'Based on her analysis, she concluded that defendant’s DNA profile was a match to the profile in the major component found on the pair of Joe Boxer underwear. She noted that there was a “1 in 82 trillion chance that” the DNA profile indicated someone other than defendant.', 'Additionally, Kevin Horan, a Special Agent in the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Cellular Analysis Certificate Survey Team (CAST team), testified regarding his analysis of certain cell phone data from defendant’s and Grier’s phones.

Nhoeuth testified that, in June 2012, defendant would “hang out” in the garage, and sometimes stay overnight. Nhoeun testified that, during a time period in June and July 2012, defendant would stay in the garage, but he acknowledged that he did not know if defendant would sleep in the garage. Nhoeun also testified that he saw “a white person” that he did not know go into the garage, come out of the garage with a suitcase, and drive off with it. He claimed that the last day that he was near the garage before the police arrived was on July 14 and that defendant was also there. Nhoeuth testified that, sometime in July 2012, he started to clean the garage but did not get very far because of how unpleasant the garage smelled. He claimed to have thought that the smell was due to a dead animal.', 'Kenneth J. Larney III, defendant’s friend during the summer of 2012, also testified that he had seen defendant at the garage during that time, that he drove defendant there “[b]etween five and ten” times because defendant did not have a car, and that he knew defendant had “crashed” at the garage a few times. Larney noted that defendant “was kind of living place to place” and “didn’t really have a set living location” at that time.

When he went to retrieve the suitcase, he simply lifted the door of the garage, retrieved the suitcase, and left. He claimed that he did not smell anything at that time. He placed the suitcase in the basement of his apartment located on Burnside Street in Cranston. He further testified that defendant informed him that he would eventually pick up the suitcase, but the Cranston police came to his home and retrieved it.11', 'Vanyik Proeun testified that, in July 2012, he resided on the second-floor apartment of the property and that he had become friendly with defendant. Proeun testified that he gave defendant rides and, on one occasion, defendant informed him that he was attracted to strippers. He claimed that defendant always carried a red backpack with him.', 'Proeun also recalled speaking to a police officer on July 21, and he testified that he had smelled the odor in the garage “probably the week before that.”', 'Sarivutha Pich, who also resided in the second-floor apartment, testified that, on July 15, 2012, after returning from a friend’s wedding between 3:30 and 4:30 a.m. feeling “kind of buzzed,” she proceeded to enter the apartment building through the back when she noticed that the garage light was on. She glanced into the garage and saw defendant in the garage alone. She testified that defendant informed her that everyone had gone to sleep and that he was “going to finish up” and “head out.” She testified that she did not smell anything in the garage at that time.', 'D', 'Testimony of Dayo Oduntan', 'Dayo Oduntan, who knew defendant for “a little bit over 15 years,” testified that the two were “close friends, buddies” when they first met.

Over the course of fifteen years, Oduntan claimed, that he and defendant stayed in touch “[o]ff and on.” He testified that, in 2002 or 2003, the two shared an apartment on Federal Hill in Providence.', 'He recalled that, at that time, he observed defendant use the Backpage website and that, on occasion, defendant would “go on there, look[ing] for girls.”', 'Oduntan testified that he was incarcerated at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI) in June 2012 for failing to report to parole.12 He attested that, in July 2012, he saw defendant in prison, but that the two were not assigned to the same area in the ACI at that time. He testified that he then wrote a letter to the Special Investigations Unit “looking for a deal” with respect to his own sentence in exchange for information he had or could get from defendant. He explained that, as a result of a meeting with Cranston detectives, he was assigned to the same cellblock as defendant, but he was unable to strike a deal with the Attorney General’s Office regarding his own sentence.', 'While sharing a cell with defendant, Oduntan testified that he “asked [defendant] bluntly” about the murder and that defendant “right away start[ed] [to] mak[e] gestures and pointing around the room, pretty much insinuating that he was nervous that the room might [have been] bugged or wired.” Oduntan testified that, while he was out on the recreational yard, he again asked defendant about the female and defendant “let it be known, yes, he did it.” At that time, however, defendant “didn’t get into detail” regarding the murder.', 'Oduntan described defendant’s demeanor as “[r]eal nonchalant about it.

Oduntan also testified that defendant indicated that he was surprised a friend “K.J.” did not “rat on him,” since “K.J.” had already been questioned, and that “K.J.” was supposed to get defendant his clothing.', 'He further testified that defendant said he was sleeping in the garage prior to the murder.', 'Oduntan wrote another letter to authorities after learning all of this information; and, in the interim, he was released from custody after completing his sentence. He was again arrested and charged with armed robbery in 2013; and, while he was released on bail, he was contacted by the Cranston police regarding his willingness to testify.

A hearing was held on defendant’s motion on May 28, 2015. Agent Horan, whom the state sought to present as an expert witness on cell phone technology, testified at the hearing. Agent Horan testified that he had been a member of the FBI’s CAST team since 2010 and that he was trained to track cell phones and to know how cellular networks are built, what frequencies they use, how switches work, and how to utilize cell phone records. He stated that he was also trained on how to conduct a drive test, which includes “specialized gear that * * * scan[s] the radio frequency environment” and at the end of the drive provides a “footprint or a map of what the radio frequency looks like coming off of a cell phone tower.” He testified that he has been qualified as an expert witness in approximately fifty-two', '- 13 - other cases and that he has been involved in “maybe a thousand” cell phone investigations throughout his career.', 'As it pertains to the facts in this case, Agent Horan testified that he analyzed certain T- Mobile, MetroPCS, and AT&T call detail records (CDRs) provided by the state. He presented a PowerPoint that he had prepared based on the CDRs, which illustrated the approximate locations of the cell phones as they communicated with the towers in the early morning of July 14, 2012. The PowerPoint also showed the drive test he conducted which revealed that, in the area of the garage where Grier’s body was found, the tower section with the dominant signal was the one to which defendant’s phone connected during Grier’s final phone call. Agent Horan acknowledged that his tests and analysis could not pinpoint the exact location of the phones during the transmissions, but only their approximate locations.', 'Following Agent Horan’s testimony, defendant argued to the trial justice that the agent’s testimony should be excluded both as a discovery violation and because it did not pass the Daubert analyses.17 The trial justice found that Daubert did not have any application to the proceedings, stating that there were “scores of cases that [he had] seen on the shelves from federal and state courts. There are periodicals, secondary sources addressing the subject,” and that “[t]his [was] not new stuff.” He opined that the “analysis of cell phone records by expert testimony is certainly helpful to the trier of fact” and that Agent Horan’s inability to “pinpoint the precise location of the phone [was] not a reason to exclude his testimony.” The trial justice 17', 'The defendant was referring to the seminal Supreme Court case of Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993). Although this Court has declined to expressly adopt Daubert, we have drawn guidance from its principles. See Owens v.

There is no indication or allegation that defendant sought a continuance. At trial, Agent Horan testified consistently with his testimony at the hearing on defendant’s motion in limine.', '1. Rule 702: Expert Testimony', 'As to Rule 702, defendant asserts that the trial justice abused his discretion in admitting the testimony because Agent Horan “failed to demonstrate either that his conclusion was the product of scientifically valid theories and methodologies, or that [the] theories and methodologies have been subjected to peer review.”', 'Moreover, defendant avers that the testimony should have been excluded at trial because Agent Horan could not provide an opinion as to what he believed was the closest cell phone tower to the crime scene due to the particular terrain or edifices in the surrounding area. Thus, defendant posits, the trial justice erred in allowing the introduction of the testimony and in making “a sweeping generalization about the', '- 15 - qualifications of * * * [Agent Horan],” by finding that “[Agent Horan] must really be an expert” in the field.', '“The purpose of expert testimony is to aid in the search for the truth.” Morabit v.

Rule 702 provides that “[i]f scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of fact or opinion.” We recognize that “[a] witness qualifies as an expert as long as his or her ‘knowledge, skill, experience, training or education’ [can] deliver a helpful opinion to the jury.” Beaton v.

Dow Chemical Co., 729 A.2d 677, 685 (R.I. 1999)). The trial justice’s role as a gatekeeper is to assure that the “proposed expert testimony, presented as a scientifically valid theory, is not mere ‘junk science.’” Id. (quoting Owens v. Silvia, 838 A.2d 881, 891 (R.I 2003)). In so doing, “[t]he trial justice thereby ensures that the trier of fact considers ‘only expert testimony that is based on ostensibly reliable scientific reasoning and methodology.’” Id. at 11-12 (quoting Owens, 838 A.2d at 891).', 'In DiPetrillo, 729 A.2d at 689, we provided four nonexclusive factors to the trial courts to assist in the consideration of expert testimony involving novel or technical theories or', '- 16 - procedures.

Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 593-94 (1993). “Satisfaction of one or more of these factors may suffice to admit the proposed evidence and the trial justice need not afford each factor equal weight.” Morabit, 80 A.3d at 12. Furthermore, “when the proffered knowledge is neither novel nor highly technical, satisfaction of one or more of these factors is not a necessary condition precedent to allowing the expert to testify” and “[t]he proponent of the evidence need only show that the expert arrived at his or her conclusion in what appears to be a scientifically sound and methodologically reliable manner.” Owens, 838 A.2d at 892.', 'It is our opinion that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in allowing Agent Horan to testify regarding cell phone technology—a field in which he is an expert by all accounts. We agree with the trial justice that Agent Horan’s expert testimony regarding cell phone towers was not novel. See United States v. Jones, 918 F. Supp. 2d 1, 7 (D.D.C. 2013); People v.

Therefore, because no evidentiary hearing was necessary, the state “need[ed] only [to] show that [Agent Horan] arrived at his * * * conclusion in what appear[ed] to be a scientifically sound and methodologically reliable manner.” Owens, 838 A.2d at 892. After', '- 17 - a careful review of both the hearing and trial transcripts, we are satisfied that the state has met this burden.', 'Moreover, defendant specifically noted that he had “never suggested that the science is junk science.” Instead, his concern was that Agent Horan had not testified as to an opinion based on a reasonable degree of technological certainty. However, Agent Horan’s inability to pinpoint the exact location of the cell phones on the morning in question to a reasonable degree of certainty does not render his testimony inadmissible.', 'Instead, the jury was tasked with determining the weight of Agent Horan’s testimony in light of that fact. Moreover, defendant availed himself of the opportunity, both at the hearing on the motion in limine and at trial, to fully cross-examine Agent Horan on the limitations of cell phone tower science.', '2. Rule 16: Alleged Discovery Violation', 'Furthermore, defendant argues that the trial justice should have excluded Agent Horan’s testimony under Rule 16 because Agent Horan “did not set forth any opinion much less the bases and reasons for [his] opinion, and did not comply with either the discovery request [at trial] or [Rule 16].” The defendant contends that the trial justice clearly abused his discretion when he did “not fashion an effective remedy” after the state disclosed Agent Horan’s expert testimony one month before trial, and he alleges that the one-month period was insufficient to prepare for this testimony.', '“Rule 16 governs discovery procedures in criminal trials.” State v. Santiago, 81 A.3d 1136, 1140 (R.I. 2014). “It is well settled that ‘Rule 16 requires that discovery be made in a timely manner * * * in order that defense counsel may marshal the information contained in the discovery material in an orderly manner.’” State v. Rosado, 139 A.3d 419, 424 (R.I. 2016) (quoting State v. Huffman, 68 A.3d 558, 568-69 (R.I. 2013)). “The overarching purpose of Rule', '- 18 - 16 is ‘to ensure that criminal trials are fundamentally fair.’” Santiago, 81 A.3d at 1140 (quoting State v. Briggs, 886 A.2d 735, 754 (R.I. 2005)). “It includes a requirement that ‘[w]hen a criminal defendant requests discovery material concerning witnesses the state may call to testify at trial, Rule 16 obligates the state to produce only prior recorded statements of a witness, a summary of the witness’s expected trial testimony, and any records of prior convictions.’” Id. (quoting Briggs, 886 A.2d at 754).', '“A trial justice considering an alleged discovery violation pursuant to Rule 16 * * * should examine four factors: (1) the reason for the nondisclosure; (2) the prejudice to the other party; (3) whether or not a continuance can rectify any such prejudice; and (4) any other relevant factors.” Rosado, 139 A.3d at 424 (quoting State v. Marte, 92 A.3d 148, 151 (R.I. 2014)). “It is well established that, when this Court reviews questions regarding claimed Rule 16 discovery violations, ‘the applicable standard is narrow: [T]he trial justice must have committed clear error.’” Santiago, 81 A.3d at 1139 (quoting Briggs, 886 A.2d at 755). Therefore, because the trial justice is in the best position to determine whether any harm has resulted from alleged noncompliance with discovery motions, we will not disturb a trial justice’s ruling on claimed Rule 16 violations absent a clear abuse of discretion. See State v. Wilson, 568 A.2d 764, 767 (R.I. 1990).', 'It is our opinion that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in this case given that, at the May 28 evidentiary hearing, the trial justice specifically informed defense counsel that “if it turn[ed] out that [he] need[ed] additional time, * * * [he would] get the extension, the time that [he] need[ed].” The defendant’s decision not to request a continuance is fatal to his claim of error on appeal. See Rosado, 139 A.3d at 425. Accordingly, based on the circumstances of this case, we are of the opinion that the trial justice’s decision to allow the testimony and not sanction', '- 19 - the state, as defendant had requested, was well within his discretion, and we decline to disturb his ruling.', 'C', 'Cell Phone Records', 'The defendant also contends that the trial justice abused his discretion in admitting his MetroPCS cell phone records (MetroPCS records) through Susan Johnson, an employee of T- Mobile. In particular, defendant claims that the trial justice erred in admitting the evidence under the business-records exception to the hearsay rule because the pertinent “records were kept in the ordinary course of business of MetroPCS, not T-Mobile.” Additionally, defendant asserts that the cell phone records could not be authenticated by Johnson because she did not physically have the cell phone records when testifying at trial.', 'At trial, Johnson testified that, for eighteen years, she managed cell phone records at T- Mobile. In 2013, after T-Mobile and MetroPCS merged, Johnson also became responsible for maintaining MetroPCS records. At that time, she was trained on the procedures of MetroPCS for storing and providing records, which were the same as T-Mobile’s. Because T-Mobile and MetroPCS records did not merge, in order to obtain the pertinent records for this case (cellular data from 2012), Johnson had to contact another MetroPCS employee who was responsible for maintaining MetroPCS records.18 On cross-examination, Johnson acknowledged that she had obtained the MetroPCS records the Friday before she testified from the MetroPCS employee who first received the request in 2012 and that, from 2012 through 2015, the records were kept with MetroPCS, not T-Mobile. 18', 'When the subpoena in this case was first issued in 2012, T-Mobile did not yet own MetroPCS.', '- 20 -', 'Following Johnson’s testimony, a colloquy ensued in which defense counsel, as he had done prior to Johnson taking the stand, contended that the MetroPCS records could not be authenticated by Johnson as she had “readily acknowledged” that the MetroPCS records were not kept in T-Mobile’s ordinary course of business. Following a recess and further arguments from both sides, the trial justice noted that he was satisfied that the cell phone records met the business-record rule exception and that they satisfied Rule 901 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence.', 'The trial justice reasoned that, although “Johnson was not an employee of Metro[PCS] in 2012, she [was], however, entirely familiar with how Metro[PCS] kept its records. She ha[d] firsthand knowledge in that respect because she visited the Metro[PCS] center in Texas and personally familiarized herself with its operations to make that determination.”', 'He further noted that the T-Mobile and MetroPCS records “were kept in precisely the same way.” In quoting Rhode Island Managed Eye Care, Inc. v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island, 996 A.2d 684, 692 (R.I. 2010), the trial justice opined that the persuasive force of the records was for the jury to decide.', 'Rule 801(c) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence defines hearsay as “a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.” Hearsay testimony, unless meeting an exception to the rule, is generally inadmissible at trial. See Rule 802 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. Rule 803(6) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, colloquially characterized as the “business- records exception” to the hearsay rule, allows a business record into evidence if it was “made at or near the time * * * of a regularly conducted business activity,” which must be “shown by the testimony of the custodian or other qualified witness * * *.”', '- 21 -', 'This Court has set forth a four-part test for examining and admitting business records into evidence:', '“First, the record must be regularly maintained in the course of a', 'regularly conducted business activity.

Rule 901(a) provides that authentication is a “condition precedent to admissibility.” “The advisory committee’s note to Rule 901 informs that ‘authentication and identification are regarded as a special aspect of relevancy’; evidence is relevant only if it is in fact what the party seeking its admission claims it to be.” O’Connor v. Newport Hospital, 111 A.3d 317, 323 (R.I. 2015) (quoting Rule 901 Advisory Committee Notes). “[T]he burden of proof for authentication[,] [however,] is slight.” Id. (quoting United States v. Reilly, 33 F.3d 1396, 1404 (3d Cir. 1994)).', 'Indeed, “[a]uthentication is not a high hurdle to clear: Rule 901(a) merely requires ‘evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.’” McGovern v. Bank of America, N.A., 91 A.3d 853, 860 (R.I. 2014) (quoting Rule 901(a)). “This Court has taken a flexible and pragmatic approach to Rule 901 by allowing ‘a document’s authenticity [to] be established in any number of different ways.’” O’Connor, 111 A.3d at 323 (quoting McGovern, 91 A.3d at 860). “We have previously held that ‘document authenticity need not be established by any particular means * * * [but] may be accomplished by', '- 22 - any of the methods enumerated in Rule[s] 901 or 902.’”19 O’Connor, 111 A.3d at 323 (quoting State v. Oliveira, 774 A.2d 893, 925 (R.I. 2001)). “In making Rule 901 determinations, trial justices must decide whether there is enough support in the record to conclude that it is ‘reasonably probable’ that the evidence is what its offeror [pro]claims it to be. * * * If so, then the evidence’s suasive force is for the jury to decide.” O’Connor, 111 A.3d at 323 (quoting Oliveira, 774 A.2d at 926). “Thus, a trial justice ‘need not find that the evidence is necessarily what the proponent claims, but only that there is sufficient evidence that the jury ultimately might do so.’” Id. (quoting United States v. Safavian, 435 F. Supp. 2d 36, 38 (D.D.C. 2006)).', 'It is our opinion that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in allowing the cell phone records to be admitted into evidence through Johnson, as she had knowledge of the record-keeping of MetroPCS. Moreover, Johnson testified that she spoke to the record keeper of the MetroPCS data and that MetroPCS followed the same processes for storing data as T-Mobile. Additionally, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in finding that the cell phone records were properly authenticated. As noted, “[a]uthentication is not a high hurdle to clear,” McGovern, 91 A.3d at 860; and, after a careful review of the record, we are of the opinion that “there is enough support * * * to conclude that it is ‘reasonably probable’ that the evidence is what [Johnson] [pro]claim[ed] it to be.” O’Connor, 111 A.3d at 323 (quoting Oliveira, 774 A.2d at 926). Accordingly, we perceive no error in the trial justice’s evidentiary ruling as it relates to the cell phone records. 19', 'Rule 901(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence provides a nonexclusive list of ways to authenticate evidence; Rule 902 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence lists documents that are self-authenticating.', '- 23 -', 'III', 'Motion for a New Trial', 'Finally, defendant argues that the trial justice erroneously denied his motion for a new trial because the weight of the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions. Specifically, he contends that the jury should not have been allowed to consider the testimony of Dyer and Malave because they were not credible witnesses at trial. In addition, defendant contends that his second-degree murder charge should be vacated because there was “no evidence of any type of malice necessary to sustain a second[-]degree murder conviction.”', 'A', 'Standard of Review', 'On a motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, “the trial justice places himself or herself in the role of a ‘thirteenth juror’ and then exercises his or her independent judgment as to the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence.” State v. Grantley, 149 A.3d 124, 131 (R.I. 2016) (quoting State v. Matthews, 111 A.3d 390, 398 (R.I. 2015)). “[T]he trial justice must (1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” Id.

After discussing her fee over the phone, she noted the caller’s address and planned to go to 391 Farmington Avenue at the end of her shift at the Cheaters exotic dancing club (Cheaters). She attested that she left work at 1 a.m. and took a cab to the property, where defendant was waiting for her at the end of the driveway. The two proceeded to walk towards the garage, and Dyer believed that they were going into the basement of the', '- 25 - residence through the back.20 As they walked, the two shared a cigarette and were no more than an arm’s length away from each other. Dyer described defendant as “white,” and “tall” with “evil and empty” eyes.', 'As they continued up the driveway, defendant “kept asking [her], [a]re you alone?” After confirming a few times that she was, she testified that defendant thereafter “pulled out [a] gun and said be quiet and get in the garage.” She described the weapon as “a black handgun” that he pulled from his waistband. She testified that defendant told her: “Go in the garage. I won’t hurt you.” She then recounted that, while in the garage, “[she] got to talking to him, and [she] got to a point where [she] could turn [her] back so [she] could walk down the driveway, and that’s when [she] ran” and “[defendant] chased [her] all the way down the driveway.” Dyer explained that she “got almost to the end” of the driveway when defendant hit her hard in the back of the head and she fell in the middle of the road. She could not identify exactly what hit her head, but described it as hard and indicated that it did not feel like a fist. Dyer testified that, at that time, she yelled, “Help, rape,” and someone turned on a light and defendant ran “[b]ack towards the garage.”', 'Dyer testified that she then ran “for about five, ten minutes” until she was picked up by a stranger. While sitting in the stranger’s vehicle, she noticed an injury to her forearm and the stranger drove her to the hospital. After waiting at Rhode Island Hospital for a few hours without being attended to, Dyer took a cab to Landmark Medical Center in Woonsocket, where she was treated. She testified that she told the doctor at the hospital that she “fell” because she “didn’t want to go in and say [she] was a prostitute, and [her] date [had] just beat [her] up * * *.” She also confirmed that she did not go to the police to report the incident at that time. 20', 'She identified the garage from June 30, 2012, as being the same garage where Grier’s body was found.', '- 26 -', 'Approximately two weeks later, Dyer saw on the news “[t]hat a girl was killed in a Cranston garage in the same address [she] went to,” and she knew the girl because they had worked at Cheaters together. She testified that, after disclosing her own incident at the garage to two individuals at Cheaters, her boss called the Cranston police, and they came to her place of work and took her to the Cranston Police Department. At the police station, she spoke to Det. Gates and gave a statement. She later testified that she was shown six photographs and that she identified defendant as her assailant. She went through the photo array a total of three times before identifying defendant. During the first array, she did not identify anyone; during the second, she identified two pictures as the possible assailant; and during the third, she identified defendant.', 'Doctor George Shervanick, a physician who was employed in the emergency room at Landmark Medical Center in June 2012, testified that he treated Dyer for a laceration to her left elbow, requiring fifteen sutures, abrasions to both knees and the left side of her hip, and left rib pain. Doctor Shervanick testified that, although Dyer denied a head injury when he specifically asked her, a history taken from Dyer by a nurse indicated: “hit head (back), no [loss of consciousness].”', 'Furthermore, Det.

His investigation revealed that, on the early morning of June 30, 2012, from 12:24 a.m. to 4:36 a.m., five phone calls and several text messages were exchanged between the two phones and that defendant’s cell phone connected to towers in the area of the garage during those transmissions.', 'In defendant’s motion for a new trial following the jury’s verdict finding him guilty of two counts of felony assault upon Dyer pertaining to the June 30, 2012, incident, defendant', '- 27 - contended that Dyer was not a credible witness and that her identification of defendant as her assailant could not be relied upon. When considering the motion for a new trial and acting as the thirteenth juror, the trial justice found that Dyer was a credible witness. He highlighted that her failure to disclose a head injury at the hospital did not mean “that * * * defendant didn’t hit her in the head.” The trial justice also noted that there had not been any pretrial request to suppress either identification in this case, but he added that “any such pretrial motion based upon the evidence adduced at the trial would have been unsuccessful.”', 'He expressed that the discrepancies of the identification were brought out at trial and “were not lost on the jury or the [c]ourt.”', 'C', 'Count 10: Robbery', 'Evonna Malave testified that, on June 24, 2012, she was at a Providence nightclub where she met defendant and accepted his invitation to go to a house party on School Street in Johnston.21 According to Malave, her family friend Sixto Reyes took her to the address; she said that, upon arriving, she met with defendant, who was waving her down. The two went to the basement through the back of the house. While in the basement, Malave noticed a handgun between boxes near them.

She recalled that defendant then got inside a vehicle and left and she was eventually picked up by Reyes. Malave attested that, after informing the police what happened, they sent her to Women & Infants Hospital in Providence and that, after waiting “for hours” at the hospital and not being attended, she left.', 'On July 26, Malave was contacted by the Cranston police, who directed her to the Johnston Police Department, where she gave a statement. At the police department, she was given a photo array, from which she identified defendant; she recalled being a “hundred percent sure” that he was her assailant. During cross-examination, the defense demonstrated that a written statement given to the police, purportedly from Malave, indicated that her assailant had blond hair, tattoos on both arms, and crooked teeth—a description that did not resemble defendant; at trial, however, Malave denied making this statement.', 'The jury returned not-guilty verdicts on the sexual assault charges, but found defendant guilty of robbery relating to the June 24, 2012, incident with Malave. In his motion for a new trial, defendant highlighted that Malave had identified the perpetrator as “having blond hair and tattoos,” but that the photo array presented to Malave contained individuals who all looked like defendant. The defendant also made the court aware that Malave “could not recall what the person looked like” and therefore had Det. Gates bring a picture of defendant before she testified at trial.

He concluded that the “jury decided, after assessing the entirety of the evidence in the case, that * * * defendant had his hand on his weapon in his backpack” when he robbed Malave, that “[t]he presence of the weapon * * * raise[d] the level of the offense to first-degree robbery, and [he] concurr[ed] with that verdict.”', 'He noted the discrepancies between her description of her assailant and her subsequent identification of defendant, but indicated that “[s]he was with [her assailant] for a lengthy period of time.

Moreover, given Oduntan’s relationship with defendant, it was likely defendant would have confided in him.', 'The trial justice also cited to Oduntan’s testimony regarding statements defendant made in prison—including that Grier was just a prostitute and that he had left her body behind a sofa in the garage—in concluding that the evidence presented supported a finding of malice. Moreover, he highlighted that several witnesses, including Nhim and Larney, testified that defendant was using the garage as his homestead, that Pich saw “defendant alone in the garage late in the early hours of July 15th,” and that Dyer had also testified that defendant had tried to force her at gunpoint in that same garage “a few weeks earlier.”', 'The trial justice concluded that, “if * * * Oduntan’s testimony was accepted, [d]efendant[’s] * * * conviction on [this] charge was foreordained.” Because he, too, “found', '- 31 - [Oduntan’s] testimony in this instance and in this case credible and persuasive,” he denied defendant’s motion for a new trial on count 1.', 'After a careful review of the trial transcript in its entirety and of the decision of the trial justice denying the motion for a new trial, we are satisfied that he “articulated adequate grounds for denying the motion.” Grantley, 149 A.3d at 131 (quoting Florez, 138 A.3d at 793). Clearly, as summarized in this decision, the trial justice carefully reviewed the testimony and weighed the evidence before him.

Correia argues that knowledge and control are issues of fact and are not appropriate for disposition by summary judgment.', 'The language of § 318 of the Restatement, however, clearly expresses that a duty arises only if the landowner is present. In Volpe, 821 A.2d at 702-03, a landowner’s son shot and killed a next-door neighbor who was trimming hedges between the houses. This Court explained that the landowner had a duty because she knew or should have known that she could control her son, who had “suffered for many years from an increasingly severe and delusional mental illness,” by requiring him to remove his guns from her property. Id. at 702, 707 n.2. However, the case did not rise or fall on control alone; instead, this Court determined that the defendant landowner was present within the meaning of § 318 of the Restatement “because she was there when her son engaged in the conduct that created an unreasonable risk of harm to others; namely, using [the] defendant’s house for possessing and storing his guns and ammunition.” Volpe, 821 A.2d at 706. This Court explained that, while the defendant need not necessarily be', '-8- present at the time when the harm occurred, the defendant must be present at the time when the third party “engaged in the conduct that created an unreasonable risk of harm to others.” Id. at 707. In Volpe, such conduct was the possession and storage of guns and ammunition in the defendant’s home. Id. The Volpe Court thus adopted § 318 of the Restatement and emphasized that physical presence is an important element to establish the existence of a duty thereunder. Volpe, 821 A.2d at 707.', 'Here, Correia never alleged that Bettencourt was present on the property at any relevant time. Instead, Correia argues that Bettencourt’s knowledge of his ability to control Alexander’s use of the property and his knowledge of the necessity and opportunity to exercise his control should be the determinative factors. He asserts that Bettencourt knew that he had the “power to control who enters and who remains on the property” and that John Bettencourt knew or should have known that Alexander and his friends would be engaging in the inherently dangerous activity of shooting firearms. Correia further argues that the foreseeability of harm was great, that imposing a duty in this case would not create an unreasonable burden on Bettencourt, and that such a duty would comport with sound public policy.', 'We decline, however, in the circumstances of this case, to broaden a property owner’s duty of care any wider than that delineated in Volpe.

After the initial oral argument, on November 10, 2015, the case was remanded to the Superior Court for an evidentiary hearing on whether that issue was timely raised in Superior Court. On July 21, 2016, the Superior Court trial justice found that good cause had been shown for the delay. By order of this Court, the parties were permitted to file supplemental memoranda on the substantive issue of collateral estoppel.

When the officers began to follow Pacheco, he abruptly turned around in a parking lot, reversed direction, and sped away. Pacheco then failed to stop at a second stop sign and proceeded into the parking lot of the Portuguese Soccer Club, at which point a foot- chase ensued. Officer Sarasin was able to apprehend Pacheco after he tripped over a curb. Pacheco struggled with the officer.', 'As Officer Sarasin attempted to restrain Pacheco, he detected a strong odor of alcohol and noted that Pacheco also was exhibiting slurred speech. After Pacheco refused to comply with requests to stop resisting, he was sprayed with oleoresin capsicum spray—commonly referred to as pepper spray—by Officer Perreault. Additional officers arrived, and Pacheco, who continued to resist, was taken into custody. At the scene, Pacheco was asked to take a field sobriety test and a preliminary breath test. He refused to do so.', 'Pacheco was transported to the Warren Police Department (police department), where he was permitted to use a decontamination sink to wash his face and eyes. He was placed in a “breathalyzer room” and advised of his rights with respect to a request to undergo a chemical breath test.1 Pacheco was uncooperative; he continuously stood up and attempted to walk away. On each occasion, Pacheco had to be forcefully returned to his seat, and he was ultimately handcuffed.', 'Pacheco refused to take a chemical breath test and likewise refused to sign any 1', 'This colloquy is known as “Rights For Use at the Station.”', '-2- related paperwork. The officers later located a small bag of marijuana in a pocket of Pacheco’s pants.

He was also cited with the following infractions: refusal to submit to a preliminary breath test (preliminary refusal)2 in violation of § 31-27-2.3; failure to stop at a stop sign; and operating a motor vehicle without evidence of insurance.', 'On July 15, 2013, Pacheco’s traffic infractions were heard in the Rhode Island Traffic Tribunal; Pacheco appeared pro se, and the Town of Warren also was unrepresented by counsel. Officer Sarasin testified3 that he pulled Pacheco over for failing to stop at a stop sign.', 'He recounted that he pursued Pacheco on foot and apprehended him after a struggle. After being prompted by the magistrate, Officer Sarasin added that Pacheco also was charged with a preliminary refusal. This was the extent of the evidence presented against Pacheco in the Traffic Tribunal.', 'The magistrate dismissed the preliminary refusal infraction, concluding that the appropriate evidentiary foundation had not been established.', 'In the Superior Court, on the eve of trial, Pacheco sought to dismiss the second offense, chemical refusal charge on the basis of collateral estoppel, arguing that, “[b]ecause the 2', 'As discussed infra, a chemical refusal and preliminary refusal constitute two separate offenses charged under different statutes.

The trial justice denied the motion, finding that it was untimely filed and that it lacked merit. The case proceeded to trial,4 and Pacheco renewed his motion to dismiss at the conclusion of trial, where it was again denied. Pacheco was convicted by a jury of unlawful possession of marijuana and a chemical refusal.5 On May 29, 2014, he was sentenced to five months to serve on the second offense, chemical refusal count. Pacheco appealed.', 'On November 10, 2015, the case was remanded to the Superior Court by order of this Court. State v. Pacheco, 128 A.3d 867 (R.I. 2015).

The defendant contends that, although the charges arise out of different statutes, the state nonetheless must prove that the officer reasonably believed that the operator was operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The state, while conceding at oral argument that there was an identity of parties, contends that the question of Officer Sarasin’s reasonable belief that defendant was operating under the influence was not “actually litigated and determined” in the Traffic Tribunal because the charge was dismissed based on a lack of evidentiary foundation. The state also notes that defendant twice refused a breath test, constituting two distinct offenses, and that observations which occurred after the first preliminary refusal, while certainly relevant to the second chemical refusal charge were unrelated to the first charge heard in the Traffic Tribunal. Finally, the state directs our attention to the procedural differences between the Traffic Tribunal and the Superior Court and suggests that collateral estoppel in this context may be the wrong road to travel.', '“(3) The motion shall be made no later than thirty (30) days', 'after the plea is entered, except that if the defendant has moved', 'pursuant to Rule 9.1 to dismiss, it shall be made within thirty (30)', 'days after entry of an order disposing of that motion; but in any', 'event the Court may permit the motion to be made within a', 'reasonable time after the plea is entered * * *.” (Emphasis added.)', '-5-', 'Analysis', 'The issue before the Court involves two separate statutory enactments governing two discrete offenses allegedly committed by an operator who refuses to submit to a breath test examination.

A refusal to submit to a preliminary breath test gives rise to a traffic infraction.', 'Section 31-27-2.3(b).', 'Enacting the sections at different times, the Legislature carefully delineated that a preliminary refusal and a chemical refusal remain separate and distinct offenses.

Section 31-27-2.3(a). If the operator fails the preliminary breath test, the officer has probable cause to arrest and request a chemical breath test, but the preliminary results—whether the operator passed or failed—are inadmissible in a subsequent trial for the separate offenses of driving under the influence or a breathalyzer refusal. The state must prove all of the statutory criteria set forth for each of those offenses. Thus, a preliminary breath test, while an important tool for law enforcement’s fight against drunk driving, is of little utility for the prosecution of operating under the influence and chemical breathalyzer refusal.', 'Chemical breath test refusals are governed by § 31-27-2.1(a), the statute under which defendant was criminally charged.7 That provision permits an officer to administer a chemical breath test if he or she has “reasonable grounds to believe [that a] person [has] been driving a motor vehicle within this state under the influence of intoxicating liquor, toluene, or any controlled substance * * *.” Id.

We disagree.', 'When the Supreme Court is confronted with a motion to dismiss based on double jeopardy or collateral estoppel, we invariably “engage[] in a de novo review, ‘with respect to questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact involving constitutional issues * * *.’” State v. Rodriguez, 917 A.2d 409, 413 (R.I. 2007) (quoting State v. Snell, 892 A.2d 108, 115 (R.I. 2006)). “The doctrine of collateral estoppel provides that ‘when an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit.’” State v. Gautier, 871 A.2d 347, 358 (R.I. 2005) (quoting State v. Werner, 865 A.2d 1049, 1055 (R.I. 2005)). In order for collateral estoppel to apply there must be: “(1) an identity of issues, (2) the previous proceeding must have resulted in a final judgment on the merits, and (3) the party against whom collateral estoppel is asserted must be the same or in privity with a party in the previous proceeding.” Id. (quoting Werner, 865 A.2d at 1055). Nonetheless, “we will ‘not apply the doctrine mechanically in situations in which it would lead to inequitable results.’” Id.

Board of Review, 854 A.2d 1008, 1017 (R.I. 2004)).', 'This Court has had ample opportunity to address the application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel in a criminal prosecution in the context of probation-revocation hearings. An analysis of our case law in this analogous scenario is warranted. In State v. Chase, 588 A.2d 120 (R.I. 1991), we first considered whether a “finding of nonviolation at a probation-revocation', '-8- hearing preclude[d] the state from relitigating” the same issues at trial.8 Id. at 121-22. Although we noted that “a probation-revocation hearing is not part of a criminal prosecution and therefore does not give rise to the full panoply of rights that are due a defendant at trial,” we held that the state was collaterally estopped from litigating an issue that had been fully litigated during a probation-revocation hearing. Id. at 122, 123. Nonetheless, we limited our holding in Chase and declared that:', '“[O]nly a specific finding on a material matter of fact fully', 'litigated at the probation-revocation hearing will collaterally estop', 'the state from attempting to prove the same fact at trial.

Godette, 751 A.2d 742 (R.I. 2000) when the Court was called upon to examine the differences in the two proceedings. In Godette, the defendant was notified pursuant to Rule 32(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure that he was being presented as a probation violator, the basis of which was a charge of driving a vehicle without the consent of the owner. Godette, 751 A.2d at 744. At the probation-revocation hearing, the prosecutor indicated that he had amended the underlying offense to possession of a stolen vehicle. Id. The trial justice erroneously refused to consider the amended charge, finding that the state did not comply with Rule 32(f) in amending the notice. Godette, 751 A.2d at 744. The justice then concluded that there was insufficient evidence to declare the defendant a probation violator because the state did not prove that the defendant was driving the motor vehicle. Id. The same Superior Court justice 8', 'We note that in this case, defendant moved to dismiss the charge, which renders his claim more akin to claim preclusion in the context of res judicata than issue preclusion under principles of collateral estoppel.', '-9- refused to dismiss the criminal charges against the defendant based on collateral estoppel, declaring that the charge of possession of a stolen motor vehicle was different from the offense set forth in the Rule 32(f) notice, driving without the consent of the owner, and therefore, collateral estoppel did not apply. Godette, 751 A.2d at 745. The defendant appealed from the denial of the motion to dismiss, and this Court declared that there was not an identity of issues because “three additional factors must be considered: ‘first, the issue sought to be precluded must be identical to the issue decided in the prior proceeding; second, the issue must actually have been litigated; and third, the issue must necessarily have been decided.’” Id. at 746 (quoting State v. Hie, 688 A.2d 283, 285 (R.I. 1996)). We further recognized that the standard at a probation-violation hearing is “whether a defendant has failed to keep the peace and to remain on good behavior, which he or she must do in order to stay on probation.” Id. at 745 (quoting Hie, 688 A.2d at 284). A few months later, we reaffirmed our holding in Godette in State v. Znosko, 755 A.2d 832 (R.I. 2000). Id. at 835 (“[A] showing that the defendant has failed to keep the peace and to remain on good behavior is sufficient to establish a probation violation.” (citing Godette, 751 A.2d at 745)).', 'In Gautier, 871 A.2d at 357-60, the Chase doctrine was laid to rest. The Court carefully examined the differences between violation hearings and criminal trials, explaining that “a ‘probation revocation hearing is not part of a criminal prosecution and therefore does not give rise to the full panoply of rights that are due [to] a defendant at trial.’” Id. at 358-59 (quoting Chase, 588 A.2d at 122). Critically, we found that probation-revocation hearings are less formal than a criminal trial—hearings are held without detailed preparation and evidence rules are less stringently applied—resulting in defendants being “afford[ed] considerably less due process protection than that to which they are constitutionally entitled in a full-blown criminal trial.” Id.', '- 10 - at 359. We noted that the continued application of collateral estoppel in this context would “‘undesirably alter the criminal trial process by permitting informal revocation determinations to displace the intended factfinding function of the trial’” and “forc[e] the state to expedite discovery and present any and all of its evidence and witnesses well in advance of trial.” Id. at 360 (quoting Lucido v. Superior Court, 795 P.2d 1223, 1229 (Cal. 1990) (en banc)).', 'Identity of Issues', 'Although we acknowledge that the circumstances in the case at bar differ from the cases discussed, we are nonetheless persuaded by their rationales. In the case before us, we are confronted with two discrete offenses such that, as in Godette, there is not an identity of issues. An identity of issues requires “first, [that] the issue sought to be precluded must be identical to the issue decided in the prior proceeding; second, the issue must actually [have been] litigated; and third, the issue must necessarily have been decided.” Godette, 751 A.2d at 746 (quoting Hie, 688 A.2d at 285). The requirements set forth in §§ 31-27-2.3 and 31-27-2.1 do not meet this three-part analysis.', 'To be sure, both statutes require that the officer have a reasonable belief or reasonable grounds to believe that the operator was operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or other substances before requesting that the operator submit to a particular test. Importantly, the issue is unrelated to whether there was a lawful stop or probable cause to arrest the operator. Reasonable belief is merely the grounds upon which the officer based a request that the operator submit to each test. Reasonable belief that the operator was operating under the influence may be established up until the point when the officer requests that the operator submit to a preliminary breath test. Accordingly, the operator’s post-arrest behavior, while irrelevant to an infraction under § 31-27-2.3, is highly relevant to a charge under § 31-27-2.1. These factors,', '- 11 - coupled with the observations made by the officer from his or her initial interaction with the operator—which constitute relevant and admissible evidence—may satisfy the reasonable grounds to believe the operator was driving while under the influence. A chemical refusal can be supported by evidence that is not relevant to an operator’s refusal to submit to a preliminary test. See State v. Jenkins, 673 A.2d 1094, 1097 (R.I. 1996) (holding that a finding that the motorist was arrested without probable cause was unrelated and irrelevant to the issue of reasonable grounds to believe that the operator was driving under the influence in a prosecution for refusal, because the defendant was charged under two separate statutes with distinct elements); see also Gautier, 871 A.2d at 358, 360 (“Thus, even assuming, arguendo, that the hearing justice made additional findings of fact relieving the defendant of criminal responsibility [in the probation- revocation context] * * * it would in no way preclude the state from indicting and prosecuting [the] defendant for the alleged [crime]” “[b]ecause it is not appropriate for a hearing justice in probation-revocation proceedings to make factual determinations of guilt or innocence[.]”). As noted, the results of a preliminary breath test are not admissible in a trial for the more serious criminal offenses of driving under the influence and refusing to submit to a chemical breath test. We are hard-pressed to state that a determination on a preliminary refusal infraction could collaterally estop the state from pursuing the more serious chemical refusal charge when results from a preliminary breath test analysis would not even be admissible in such a subsequent proceeding.', 'We conduct a de novo review when confronted with a motion to dismiss on collateral estoppel grounds. See Rodriguez, 917 A.2d at 413. In the case at bar, we are confronted with a chaotic, 2 a.m. near-collision with a police cruiser, a motorist driving through two stop signs, followed by a foot chase, a pepper spray takedown, preliminary refusal, struggle, and', '- 12 - uncooperative behavior at the police department. Viewed in its entirety, this conduct provided Officer Sarasin with the requisite reasonable grounds to request a chemical breath test. We note that, at trial, Officer Sarasin testified that, before the stop, based on defendant’s driving—which he described as erratic and involved two stop-sign violations at 2 a.m.—he suspected that defendant was driving under the influence. Furthermore, after the preliminary refusal,9 Officer Sarasin found two unopened sixteen-ounce beer bottles in defendant’s vehicle, and he testified that defendant was belligerent and uncooperative at the police department. The defendant ignored the officers’ commands and repeatedly rose from his chair and attempted to walk away while being read his rights at the police department. He was physically restrained by officers each time and eventually handcuffed to the chair. Accordingly, we are of the opinion that identity of issues is lacking because there are two separate offenses and evidence which is relevant to the second offense was irrelevant to the first refusal.', 'Actually Litigated', 'Furthermore, we are not convinced that the issue to which defendant now seeks application of collateral estoppel was fully litigated in the Traffic Tribunal. The preliminary refusal was dismissed by the magistrate for lack of “evidentiary foundation.” Although the application of collateral estoppel in the probation violation context has been abrogated, it nonetheless is useful to look to Chase, because we declared that “only a specific finding on a material matter of fact fully litigated at [a] * * * hearing will collaterally estop the state from attempting to prove the same fact at trial. A general finding will not suffice * * *.” Chase, 588 A.2d at 123 (emphasis added). Here, the magistrate did not make a specific finding. He simply 9', 'Although a preliminary refusal, standing alone, may not supply the requisite reasonable belief necessary to request that a motorist submit to a chemical breath test, the fact that the operator refused the preliminary breath test, however, is certainly an observation which may help an officer formulate a reasonable belief that the motorist is intoxicated, as required by § 31-27-2.1.', '- 13 - noted that the foundational requirements necessary to prove a preliminary refusal had not been met, and he did not make “a specific finding on a material matter.” Id. Before the magistrate, the officer failed to offer any testimony about his reasonable belief that defendant was driving while intoxicated.', 'In rendering his decision, the magistrate informed Officer Sarasin that the “evidentiary foundation” that he was required to put forth is one based on contact with the motorist—“that you smelled alcohol or saw bloodshot, watery eyes or a staggered gait or motor skills * * *[.]” Critically, however, none of these observations is statutorily mandated, nor are they elements of the offense, such that collateral estoppel should operate. The magistrate also declared that Officer Sarasin should have testified that:', '“[he was] certified * * * through the academy * * * in DUI', 'investigation and that based upon all of these observations, it was', 'leading * * * [him] down the path to conclude that [defendant] was', 'operating under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs and that in', 'furtherance of this investigation, [he] asked [defendant] to submit', 'to the preliminary breath test, that [he was] certified to do the * * *', 'preliminary breath test and that [defendant] refused to do that.” The magistrate further misconstrued the statute in determining that Officer Sarasin was required to testify as to his certifications. Although this testimony is often offered in similar cases, it is in no way required by § 31-27-2.3 to sustain a preliminary refusal infraction. The magistrate did not make “a specific finding on a material matter of fact.” Chase, 588 A.2d at 123.', 'In Rhode Island, every person who operates a motor vehicle in this state is deemed to have given consent to chemical tests for the presence of alcohol or drugs in his or her system. All that is necessary is that the officer reasonably believe that a motorist who has been lawfully stopped is driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Certainly, the smell of alcohol, bloodshot eyes, or a staggering gait are among the hallmarks of drunk driving. However, these observations are not exclusive factors upon which an officer “has reason to believe that a person', '- 14 - is driving * * * or has actual physical control of any motor vehicle in this state while under the influence of alcohol.” State v. DiStefano, 764 A.2d 1156, 1160 (R.I. 2000). The doctrine of collateral estoppel “is capable of producing extraordinarily harsh and unfair results.” Foster- Glocester Regional School Committee, 854 A.2d at 1017 (quoting Casco Indemnity Co. v. O’Connor, 755 A.2d 779, 782 (R.I. 2000)), such that this Court will “not apply the doctrine ‘mechanically’ in situations in which it would lead to inequitable results.” Gautier, 871 A.2d at 358 (quoting Foster-Glocester Regional School Committee, 854 A.2d at 1017). As we did in Godette, we continue to heed the “United States Supreme Court’s observation that ‘collateral estoppel in criminal cases is not to be applied with the hypertechnical and archaic approach of a 19th century pleading book, but with realism and rationality.’” Godette, 751 A.2d at 746 (quoting Hie, 688 A.2d at 285; Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436, 444 (1970)). We therefore decline to apply a doctrine that hinges on the fact that an issue was “actually litigated” when the evidentiary threshold was not established and the magistrate made only a general finding on the issue.', 'Differences Between the Traffic Tribunal and the Superior Court', 'Finally, the state argues that collateral estoppel should not apply in Superior Court to decisions rendered in the Traffic Tribunal. In ruling on this issue, Gautier instructs us to carefully examine the procedural and substantive differences between proceedings in the Traffic Tribunal and criminal trials conducted in the Superior Court.', 'See Restatement (Second) Judgments § 28 cmt.d. (1982) (“[T]here may be compelling reasons why [issue] preclusion should not apply.

Walker, 768 P.2d 668 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1989), noted that “[c]ollateral estoppel effect is generally denied to traffic convictions and minor offenses under accepted common law principles * * * because of the relative insignificance of the charges, [the] defendants have no constitutional right to a jury trial in traffic cases, as they would in true criminal prosecution, and cannot reasonably be expected to defend with the same vigor.” Id. at 671 (citing Gilberg v.

Nonetheless, in light of our conclusion that collateral estoppel does not apply in the circumstances of this case, we deem it unnecessary to decide whether collateral estoppel is applicable to issues determined in the Traffic Tribunal when all of the elements of the doctrine are met. That is a journey we reserve for another day.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons articulated herein, we affirm the judgment of conviction of the Superior Court.

Moreover, it is our opinion that the majority’s recitation of the facts is, for the most part, accurate. We dissent, however, because we believe that the majority has misapplied the pertinent facts to the law.', 'As the majority correctly explains, the doctrine of collateral estoppel has three fundamental elements: “(1) the parties are the same or in privity with the parties of the previous', '- 17 - proceeding; (2) a final judgment on the merits has been entered in the previous proceeding; [and] (3) the issue or issues in question are identical in both proceedings.” Kenlin Properties, LLC v.

After carefully reviewing the record in this case, it is our opinion that defendant has met every element of the collateral estoppel test; and, therefore, the state should have been precluded from offering testimony that would establish reasonable suspicion of defendant’s intoxication prior to his refusal to submit to the preliminary breath test. Consequently, his conviction for failure to submit to a chemical test should be vacated.', 'I', 'Same Parties', 'The majority correctly notes that the state has conceded that the parties were identical at the hearings in the Traffic Tribunal and the Superior Court.

Godette, 751 A.2d 742, 746 (R.I. 2000).', 'A', 'Identical Issue', 'The majority correctly notes that the preliminary breath test statute and the chemical test statute each requires a law enforcement officer to have “reasonable belief or reasonable grounds” to request that a motorist submit to either a preliminary breath test or a chemical test. That is, both statutes require an officer to meet the same level of suspicion before requesting the administration of a test for intoxication. The majority states that, under the preliminary breath test statute, “[r]easonable belief that the operator was operating under the influence may be established up until the point when the officer requests that the operator submit to a preliminary breath test.” We agree completely with this statement. The majority then adds that “the operator’s post-arrest behavior, while irrelevant to an infraction under [the preliminary breath test statute], is highly relevant to a charge under [the chemical test statute].” It is this statement, particularly as applied to the facts in this case, that lies at the core of our dissent.', 'It is important to note that we do not advance the argument that the state is always estopped from pursuing a charge under the chemical test statute after a defendant has been found to be not liable under the preliminary breath test statute. Indeed, we recognize that there are significant differences between the two statutes that would frequently render a defense of collateral estoppel inapplicable. However, our focus is on the identical threshold issue contained in each statute: that a police officer must have reasonable belief that the motor vehicle operator was impaired before administering a test for intoxication. It is with respect to this threshold', '- 19 - issue that the state failed to produce evidence in the Traffic Tribunal, resulting in a dismissal of the charge of refusing to take a preliminary breath test.', 'Upon an initial reading, the two statutes appear distinct enough such that collateral estoppel could not apply because evidence from a later moment in time is permissible to create reasonable suspicion under the chemical test statute. However, it is our position that, if a defendant is found not liable on the preliminary breath test statute because the state failed to show that an officer had a reasonable suspicion to believe that defendant was operating his vehicle under the influence, and later, at a subsequent trial, the state produces no post-arrest evidence that would demonstrate that a police officer had reasonable cause to believe that defendant had been operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated, then the issue to be decided is identical.', 'Here, the magistrate at the Traffic Tribunal ruled that the state had failed to establish that the law enforcement officer had produced evidence that he had reasonable suspicion to believe that defendant was driving under the influence.1 This, of course, was necessary as well when defendant was prosecuted in the Superior Court for refusal to submit to the chemical test. Notwithstanding that shortcoming, had the state produced any credible post-arrest evidence that defendant had been operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated, we would agree with the majority that collateral estoppel does not apply.

The officer’s discovery of sealed beer bottles cannot be an indication of intoxication; indeed, it is hard to imagine a person becoming intoxicated from an unopened bottle of beer. To find otherwise would create a situation where any person driving with a sealed bottle that contains an alcoholic beverage has, by that fact alone, given an officer reasonable suspicion to believe that he is intoxicated. Likewise, the fact that defendant was belligerent at the police station and did not remain seated while being processed does not give rise to a suspicion of intoxication, and no witness testified that it did. This is especially so when we take into consideration that Officer Sarasin testified that defendant was still suffering from the effects of the pepper spray with which the officers had earlier doused him.2', 'Because there was no post-arrest evidence that would give rise to the reasonable belief that defendant was intoxicated, the reasonableness of suspicion must rest on Officer Sarasin’s testimony about pre-arrest evidence.

However, we are perplexed by the majority’s reasoning because it relies on abrogated law to support its argument. The majority opinion details how this Court abrogated State v. Chase, 588 A.2d 120, 123 (R.I. 1991), and highlights the following language from Chase as no longer good law:', '“[O]nly a specific finding on a material matter of fact fully', 'litigated at the probation-revocation hearing will collaterally estop', 'the state from attempting to prove the same fact at trial.

It was the state’s burden to show by clear and convincing evidence that the officer had reasonable suspicion. For collateral estoppel to apply at a later proceeding, all that matters is that the state had the opportunity to introduce evidence, not whether it actually did. See Restatement (Second) Judgments § 27 cmt. c. at 253 (1982) (“[I]f the party against whom preclusion is sought did in fact litigate an issue of ultimate fact and suffered an adverse determination, new evidentiary facts may not be brought forward to obtain a different determination of that ultimate fact.”);6 see also Adler v.

A fact that is found by making an inference or deduction from findings of other facts; specif., a factual conclusion derived from intermediate facts.” Black’s Law Dictionary 711 (10th ed. 2014).

It is difficult to imagine the majority not applying collateral estoppel had the second proceeding occurred in the Traffic Tribunal. The fact that the chemical test charge was brought in the Superior Court should not change the result.', 'Because we conclude that: (1) the issue that was decided in the Superior Court was identical to the one before a judicial officer in the Traffic Tribunal; (2) that the issue was actually litigated in the Traffic Tribunal; and (3) that the issue was decided, we believe that there was an identity of issues for the purpose of applying collateral estoppel.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'In our opinion, the elements of collateral estoppel were met.

12,"Amberleigh Hudson : v. : GEICO Insurance Agency, Inc., d/b/a : GEICO General Insurance Company.",non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. The plaintiff, Amberleigh Hudson (plaintiff), is before the Supreme Court on appeal from a Superior Court judgment in a jury-waived trial in favor of the defendant, GEICO Insurance Agency, Inc., d/b/a GEICO General Insurance Company (defendant or GEICO), in this underinsured motorist (UM) insurance case. This appeal first came before the Court on October 25, 2016, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we concluded that cause had been shown and assigned this case to the regular calendar for further briefing and argument. We heard oral arguments on April 5, 2017. For the reasons set forth herein, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'Facts and Travel', 'The parties in this case entered into an agreed statement of facts. In the early morning hours of February 11, 2012, plaintiff and her then-boyfriend, Gregory Hurst (Hurst), left Murphy’s Pub in Providence and headed south on Allens Avenue toward the Amazing Super Store, located on the corner of Allens Avenue and Thurbers Avenue. Hurst was driving his Saab, which was insured by defendant (the GEICO policy), and plaintiff was a passenger. Hurst pulled into the parking lot and parked the vehicle “with a plan to then exit the vehicle and go into the Amazing Super Store.” Hurst and plaintiff remained in the vehicle “for a minute or two to talk,” when they heard the sound of a crash, signifying an automobile collision, on nearby Allens Avenue. The couple exited the Saab, crossed the parking lot of the Amazing Super Store, and the two southbound lanes of Allens Avenue in order to reach the nearby accident scene. While Hurst called 9-1-1, plaintiff went to the rear of the vehicles to retrieve the license plate numbers. While looking down at a license plate, plaintiff heard somebody yell “car.” A third vehicle, traveling north on Allens Avenue, then struck the accident vehicles, adjacent to where plaintiff was standing. She was injured as a result of this impact.', 'The plaintiff settled a claim against the operator of the vehicle that hit her; however, she has alleged that this did not fully compensate her for her injuries. Consequently, plaintiff filed a claim with defendant seeking relief through Hurst’s GEICO policy that insured the Saab. The GEICO policy afforded protection to passengers “occupying” the insured vehicle at the time of the accident. The policy defined “occupying” as “in, upon entering into or alighting from [the vehicle].” The defendant denied plaintiff’s claim, on the ground that she was not “occupying” the insured vehicle at the time of her injuries. The plaintiff filed this action in Superior Court on November 30, 2012, and the case was reached for trial on June 17, 2015.', '-2-', 'Prior to trial, and based on the agreed statement of facts, the parties filed cross-motions for judgment as a matter of law, stipulating that there were no genuine issues of material fact and that the sole issue before the Superior Court was whether plaintiff was “occupying” the Saab at the time of the accident. In its motion, defendant maintained that plaintiff was precluded from recovery based upon the unambiguous language of the GEICO policy. The plaintiff responded that she was entitled to coverage in light of the broad interpretation of “occupying” set forth by this Court in General Accident Insurance Co. of America v. Olivier, 574 A.2d 1240 (R.I. 1990). 1 In a written decision issued on August 4, 2015, the trial justice rejected defendant’s argument that the plain language of the GEICO policy should be the focus of the coverage analysis and, instead, analyzed the term “occupying” in light of the four prongs of Olivier.', 'The trial justice concluded that plaintiff failed to establish a causal connection between the insured Saab and her injuries and, therefore, could not move past the first prong of Olivier. Although declaring that the failure to meet the first prong of Olivier rendered the remainder of 1', 'In General Accident Insurance Co. of America v. Olivier, 574 A.2d 1240 (R.I. 1990), this Court applied four criteria set forth by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in Utica Mutual Insurance Co. v. Contrisciane, 473 A.2d 1005 (Pa. 1984), under which a motorist using an insured vehicle would be considered to be “occupying” that vehicle within the meaning of the policy. Those factors are as follows:', '“(1) there is a causal relation or connection between the injury and', 'the use of the insured vehicle;', '“(2) the person asserting coverage must be in a reasonably close', 'geographic proximity to the insured vehicle, although the person', 'need not be actually touching it;', '“(3) the person must be vehicle oriented rather than highway or', 'sidewalk oriented at the time; and', '“(4) the person must also be engaged in a transaction essential to', 'the use of the vehicle at the time.” Olivier, 574 A.2d at 1241', '(quoting Utica Mutual Insurance Co., 473 A.2d at 1009).', '-3- the analysis moot, the trial justice noted that plaintiff also failed to satisfy the third requirement that she was “vehicle oriented” at the time of the injury. Accordingly, the trial justice held that plaintiff could not recover UM benefits under the terms of the GEICO policy because she was not “occupying” the insured vehicle at the time of the incident giving rise to her injuries. A final judgment was entered in favor of defendant on October 9, 2015, from which plaintiff has appealed to this Court. 2', 'Standard of Review', '“This case was tried upon a set of stipulated facts. Review of the trial justice’s decision in these cases is ‘narrowly defined.’” Delbonis Sand & Gravel Co. v. Town of Richmond, 909 A.2d 922, 925 (R.I. 2006) (quoting Hagenberg v. Avedisian, 879 A.2d 436, 441 (R.I. 2005)). “[T]he trial court does not play a fact-finding role, but is limited to ‘applying the law to the agreed-upon facts.’” Id. (quoting Hagenberg, 879 A.2d at 441). “[Q]uestions of law and statutory interpretation are reviewed de novo by this Court.” Hagenberg, 879 A.2d at 441 (quoting Webster v. Perrotta, 774 A.2d 68, 75 (R.I. 2001)). Likewise, “[o]ur review of a trial justice’s decision on a motion for judgment as a matter of law is de novo.” McGarry v.

Sitrin, 984 A.2d 620, 625 (R.I. 2009)).', 'Analysis', 'Before this Court, plaintiff argues that the trial justice erroneously interpreted the Olivier factors as applied to the facts of this case, and she maintains that, at the time of her injuries, she was “occupying” the insured vehicle. The plaintiff agrees with the trial justice’s finding on the second prong of Olivier—that she was in a reasonably close geographic proximity to the insured 2', 'The plaintiff prematurely filed a notice of appeal on August 20, 2015. This Court, however, will treat the premature notice of appeal as if it had been timely filed after the judgment was entered. See Russell v. Kalian, 414 A.2d 462, 464 (R.I. 1980) (citing Beauvais v. Notre Dame Hospital, 120 R.I. 271, 387 A.2d 689 (1978)).', '-4- vehicle at the time of her injuries—but she claims on appeal that the trial justice erroneously interpreted the first prong by applying too strict a standard in considering the existence of a causal connection between the insured vehicle and the accident. As to Olivier’s third prong, plaintiff urges the Court to abandon the third prong—which mandates that the injured person be “vehicle oriented” at the time of their injury—suggesting that it is “ambiguous, confusing, and indeed, useless.” In regard to the fourth prong, plaintiff submits that this Court should hold that, in light of the mandate in G.L. 1956 § 11-56-1, the rendering of reasonable assistance as a Good Samaritan, constitutes an “essential transaction” for purposes of UM coverage. Section 11-56-1 provides, in pertinent part:', '“Any person at the scene of an emergency who knows that another', 'person is exposed to, or has suffered, grave physical harm shall, to', 'the extent that he or she can do so without danger or peril to', 'himself or herself or to others, give reasonable assistance to the', 'exposed person. Any person violating the provisions of this section', 'shall be guilty of a petty misdemeanor * * *.”', 'The defendant on the other hand contends that plaintiff waived her § 11-56-1 argument by not raising it at trial and that the issue is moot because whether plaintiff was acting under compulsion of the statute when she rendered aid at the scene of the accident is a factual determination which should be reserved for the trial justice. Alternatively, defendant claims that a Good Samaritan can only be “occupying” an insured vehicle if each of the four prongs of Olivier is satisfied and that the trial justice properly found those elements to be lacking in this case.', 'This is the first occasion on which this Court is called upon to address the particular interplay between § 11-56-1, the Good Samaritan Act, and the term “occupying” a motor vehicle, as defined in an insurance contract. As a threshold issue, we pass on defendant’s contention that this seminal argument is waived or otherwise moot. We reject that argument.', '-5-', '“This Court’s ‘raise-or-waive’ rule precludes our consideration of an issue that was not raised or articulated at trial.” In re Miguel A., 990 A.2d 1216, 1223 (R.I. 2010) (citing Resendes v. Brown, 966 A.2d 1249, 1254 (R.I. 2009)); see also Hydro-Manufacturing, Inc. v. Kayser-Roth Corp., 640 A.2d 950, 959 (R.I. 1994) (“It is well settled that a party may not ‘advance new theories or raise new issues in order to secure a reversal of the lower court’s determination.’” (quoting Nedder v. Rhode Island Hospital Trust National Bank, 459 A.2d 960, 963 (R.I. 1983))). We cannot agree with defendant’s contention that the raise-or-waive rule precludes this Court from considering plaintiff’s argument that she acted as a Good Samaritan pursuant to § 11-56-1. Certainly, plaintiff advanced her Good Samaritan theory to the lower court, as the decision of the trial justice is replete with references to plaintiff’s rescue efforts as having been those of a Good Samaritan. Indeed, the trial justice recognized that this Court “has yet to address whether rendering aid as a Good Samaritan” satisfies the requirements of Olivier.', 'We also reject as meritless defendant’s contention that plaintiff’s argument is moot and that our resolution thereof would be equivalent to an advisory opinion. “[A] case is moot if it raised a justiciable controversy at the time the complaint was filed, but events occurring after the filing have deprived the litigant of an ongoing stake in the controversy.” City of Cranston v. Rhode Island Laborers’ District Council, Local 1033, 960 A.2d 529, 533 (R.I. 2008) (quoting Seibert v. Clark, 619 A.2d 1108, 1110 (R.I. 1993)). This case is not moot, as both plaintiff and defendant have a continuing stake in whether UM benefits should be afforded to plaintiff under the terms of the GEICO policy.', 'Therefore, because the issues before the Court are neither waived nor otherwise moot, we turn to the fundamental question before this Court: Whether, in light of § 11-56-1, a Good Samaritan who was injured while rendering roadside aid may be considered to be “occupying”', '-6- an insured motor vehicle for purposes of UM coverage under that vehicle’s insurance policy. We look first to the term “occupying” as defined in the GEICO policy.', 'The GEICO Policy', 'In the recent case of Jackson v. Quincy Mutual Fire Insurance Co., No. 2016-19-Appeal, 2017 WL 1843873 (R.I. May 5, 2017), this Court articulated the proper interpretation to be afforded to defined terms of an insurance policy. The approach that controls the interpretation can be classified as either inclusive or exclusive, based on whether the policy clause at issue includes a person other than the named insured within the coverage afforded or seeks to exclude the named insured from the coverage.', 'Specifically, we recognized the “general principle favoring broad coverage” as the cornerstone for the analysis. That principle reads as follows:', '“[W]here the policy provision under examination relates to the', 'inclusion of persons other than the named insured within the', 'protection afforded, a broad and liberal view is taken of the', 'coverage extended. But, if the clause in question is one of', 'exclusion or exception, designed to limit the protection, a strict', 'interpretation is applied.” Id. at *3 (quoting Peerless Insurance Co.', 'v. Luppe, 118 A.3d 500, 510 (R.I. 2015)). This declaration serves to harmonize this Court’s general rule that “when examining an insurance policy, * * * ‘[the court] shall not depart from the literal language of the policy absent a finding that the policy is ambiguous,’” Allstate Insurance Co. v. Ahlquist, 59 A.3d 95, 98 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Beacon Mutual Insurance Co. v. Spino Brothers, Inc., 11 A.3d 645, 649 (R.I. 2011)), with the salutary purpose underlying UM provisions, which is “to indemnify an insured motorist for loss when recovery from the uninsured tortfeasor is unavailable.” Ladouceur v. Hanover Insurance Co., 682 A.2d 467, 469 (R.I. 1996) (citing Amica Mutual Insurance Co. v. Streicker, 583 A.2d 550, 553 (R.I. 1990)). In this context, the coverage extended under an insurance policy rests, in large part, on the radius of the lens through which we view the policy’s', '-7- terms. See Jackson, 2017 WL 1843873 at *3 (“[T]he guidepost in determining whether to apply a broad and liberal view of the terms in an insurance policy or whether a strict interpretation of the language is more appropriate is whether the language relates to inclusion of persons within the policy or exclusion of the insured from protection.”). Accordingly, when the terms of an insurance policy operate to exclude the insured from the protections of his policy, we look no further than the plain language of the policy. Id. But if the terms of an insurance policy arguably serve to include an individual other than the named insured within the coverage afforded, we employ a broad and liberal view of the policy language. Id.', 'Before this Court, plaintiff, a passenger and person other than the named insured, seeks to be included within the protection afforded under Hurst’s GEICO policy. Accordingly, this Court is obligated to read the terms of the GEICO policy broadly to determine whether, at the time of her injuries, plaintiff was “occupying” the insured Saab. In applying a liberal interpretation to the term “occupying”—defined in the GEICO policy as “in, upon entering into or alighting from”—we are guided by the factors set forth in Olivier, 574 A.2d at 1241.', 'Occupancy', 'Although the facts in this case deviate from those in Olivier and its progeny, see Olivier, supra; see also D’Antuono v. Narragansett Bay Insurance Co., 721 A.2d 834 (R.I. 1998); General Accident Insurance Co. of America v. D’Alessandro, 671 A.2d 1233 (R.I. 1996), in that plaintiff was acting as a Good Samaritan and not a conventional passenger, Olivier remains the governing standard for according a broad interpretation to the terms of an insurance policy. Additionally, we recognize that some jurisdictions require that each of the four factors adopted in Olivier be fulfilled in their entirety in order to satisfy the occupancy requirement.', 'See Petika v. Transcontinental Insurance Co., 855 A.2d 85, 90 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2004) (declining to find', '-8- occupancy where the plaintiff failed to satisfy the “vehicle oriented” prong). However, this Court has recognized that the Olivier factors serve only as a guide to employing a broad interpretation of the term “occupying.” See D’Alessandro, 671 A.2d at 1235 (“In Olivier * * * we set forth four factors to be considered in assessing whether an insured is ‘occupying’ a vehicle when an accident occurs * * *.” (emphasis added)). In our opinion, such a strict adherence is in stark contrast to the general purpose underpinning the four factors—to extend coverage broadly. Therefore, we are of the opinion that a plaintiff may fail to satisfy a portion of the Olivier criteria, but may nonetheless be “occupying” an insured vehicle for purposes of UM coverage. This determination is intensely fact-driven.', 'The first prong of Olivier necessitates that there be “a causal relation or connection between the injury and the use of the insured vehicle.” Olivier, 574 A.2d at 1241 (quoting Utica Mutual Insurance Co., 473 A.2d at 1009). In Olivier, we interpreted this prong to require some “nexus” between the insured motor vehicle and the claimant’s injuries. Id. at 1242 (recognizing the Florida Supreme Court’s construction of the phrase as “not meaning ‘proximately caused by’ but as having a broader meaning that simply required some nexus between the motor vehicle and the injury” (citing Government Employees Insurance Co. v. Novak, 453 So. 2d 1116, 1119 (Fla. 1984))). Additionally, we recognized that, in liberally construing that prong, “it [is] unnecessary that the automobile be the instrumentality of the injury; neither would the type of conduct that causes the injury of necessity be foreseeably identifiable with the normal use of the vehicle.” Id.', 'Applying this construction to the undisputed facts of this case demonstrates a sufficient nexus between the insured motor vehicle and plaintiff’s injuries, in that plaintiff was inside the insured vehicle when she heard the collision and exited the vehicle in order to offer assistance at the nearby scene.', 'Even under a narrow construction of the policy language, she was', '-9- “occupying” the vehicle when she became aware of the collision and was compelled to render assistance to the victims of the accident—an action that precipitated her unfortunate and significant injuries. See Olivier, 574 A.2d at 1242 (“It was her status as a passenger in the insured vehicle that precipitated the whole unfortunate series of events.”). In our opinion, these facts establish a nexus between the insured motor vehicle and plaintiff’s injuries sufficient to successfully meet the first prong of Olivier. We are not confronted with a scenario in which plaintiff had already departed the vehicle and was proceeding into the Amazing Super Store when she became aware of the emergency; in that circumstance, a causal connection between her injuries and the insured vehicle might be less certain. However, those are not the facts in this case.', 'This Court need not address the second prong, requiring that a plaintiff “be in a reasonably close geographic proximity to the insured vehicle,” Olivier, 574 A.2d at 1241, because the trial justice found this element to have been satisfied, and the parties do not dispute that finding. Accordingly, we address the third prong, that plaintiff “be vehicle oriented rather than highway or sidewalk oriented at the time [of the injury].” Id.', 'Although this Court has not had occasion to consider the phrase “vehicle oriented” since Olivier, we take guidance from those courts that have done so. In Etter v. Travelers Insurance Companies, 657 N.E.2d 298 (Ohio Ct. App. 1995), the Appellate Court of Ohio explained that an individual is no longer “vehicle oriented” when the person has “severed his connection with [the vehicle]” or rather, “when [the individual] is on his own without any reference to [the vehicle].” Id. at 301 (a passenger who steps out of a taxicab to pay his fare is still “vehicle oriented” (citing Allstate Insurance Co. v. Flaumenbaum, 308 N.Y.S.2d 447, 463 (N.Y. 1970))); see also In re Estate of Anderson, 720 N.W.2d 124, 128, 129 (Wis. Ct. App. 2006) (holding that decedent, who', '- 10 - had dismounted his motorcycle and “was not demonstrating any intent to get back on the motorcycle,” had “severed his relationship with the motorcycle” and therefore, was not “vehicle- oriented”).', 'In considering whether a motorist has severed his or her connection with the vehicle, courts often look to the intent of the individual and the purpose for being outside the vehicle. See Moherek v. Tucker, 230 N.W.2d 148, 152 (Wis. 1975) (looking to claimant’s “purpose and intent” in determining whether he severed his relationship with the vehicle); see also Petika, 855 A.2d at 90 (stating that the individual’s “purpose for being outside of his vehicle when the accident occurred is what controls when assessing whether he was ‘vehicle oriented’”).', 'In Lynn v. Westport Insurance Corp., 258 F. App’x 438 (3d Cir. 2007), the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, applying Pennsylvania law, explained that a person remains “vehicle oriented” if that person had “been in the vehicle, had something occur which required them to exit the vehicle for a brief time before they could continue their journey, had full intention of returning to their vehicle, and [was] struck by another vehicle while performing the action that would allow them to continue their journey.” Id. at 442 (citing Petika, 855 A.2d at 85). The court determined that, if an individual’s purpose for being outside the vehicle was “the means to the end of getting back in the vehicle and continuing the journey,” then that individual remains vehicle oriented. Id.', 'We are persuaded by the reasoning in the aforementioned cases. It is our opinion that, where a departure from an insured vehicle is incident to a temporary interruption in an otherwise continuing excursion, and upon completion of the occasion causing the brief interruption the individual intends to continue on with his venture, he remains “vehicle oriented.” The fact that the vehicle may be parked for a minute or two does not alter this conclusion.', '- 11 -', 'This Court is satisfied that plaintiff’s departure from the insured vehicle was incident to a temporary interruption in an otherwise unfinished excursion into the Amazing Super Store and that, upon completion of the occurrence causing the interruption, plaintiff intended to resume her journey. It is undisputed that plaintiff exited the insured vehicle for the purpose of rendering aid to the victims of a motor vehicle collision in close proximity, and for no other purpose. The collision was a mere temporary interruption that compelled plaintiff to immediately exit her vehicle and provide assistance.', 'The stipulated facts in this case establish that plaintiff intended to exit the vehicle and enter the store; however, she had not yet done so at the time of the collision. Indeed, the couple could, at any time, have abandoned their plans to shop and simply continued on their way. The plaintiff was inside the vehicle at the time of the collision, the driver having parked a minute or two earlier, and exited for the purpose of rendering assistance. Accordingly, under a broad construction of the phrase “vehicle oriented,” we are satisfied that plaintiff has met this prong.', 'There is no general consensus among the courts that have addressed the status of a Good Samaritan in the insurance coverage context. In Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. v. Kemper Insurance Co., 657 F. Supp. 213, 215 (E.D. Pa. 1987), the court determined that two Good Samaritans were “highway-oriented” when they left their insured vehicle for the purpose of helping the driver of a disabled vehicle and were subsequently injured by a passing truck. Likewise, in Downing v. Harleysville Insurance Co., 602 A.2d 871 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1992), the Pennsylvania court held that the plaintiff ceased being “vehicle oriented” and became “highway oriented” when he left his insured vehicle for the purpose of rendering aid to the driver of a disabled vehicle. Id. at 874. However, such a narrow construction is not in accordance with our policy to broadly interpret the factors set forth in Olivier.', '- 12 -', 'We are aware of only one state that has abandoned the third prong—that the individual be “vehicle oriented” rather than highway or sidewalk oriented at the time of the injury— categorizing it as inconsistent with the remainder of the four-part test. See Cherry v. Truck Insurance Exchange, 892 P.2d 768, 772 (Wash. Ct. App. 1995) (finding that the “vehicle oriented” factor “create[s] an internal inconsistency in [the] * * * four-part test”); see also Butzberger v. Foster, 89 P.3d 689, 695-96 (Wash. 2004) (en banc) (abandoning the “vehicle oriented” factor because it “is contrary to the underlying purpose of the other three factors and is unhelpful” and stating, “[a]lthough Rau [v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., 585 P.2d 157 (Wash. Ct. App. 1978),] created the vehicle oriented factor, the opinion itself does not explain how a vehicle oriented factor helps illuminate the reasonable expectations of the insured or suggest a method for its application”). Although this may be the road of the future, we are not inclined to embark upon it at this time.', 'In regard to the fourth prong, that the individual be engaged in a transaction essential to the use of the vehicle at the time of his or her injuries, we are persuaded by plaintiff’s argument that, in light of § 11-56-1, a willingness to render aid at the scene of a motor vehicle collision as a Good Samaritan, is inherently part of the use of a motor vehicle in this state. In Butzberger, 89 P.3d at 697,3 the Supreme Court of Washington stated: “Rescuing a stranded driver who is injured or in peril is essential to the continued use of the vehicle, as the vehicle cannot continue to its destination until the rescue has been accomplished.” The court reasoned that “a Good 3', 'In Butzberger v. Foster, 89 P.3d 689, 698 (Wash. 2004) (en banc), the court concluded that the Good Samaritan was entitled to recover UM benefits from the policy insuring the vehicle he was driving, as well as the policy insuring the disabled vehicle that he was assisting at the time of his injuries. In the case at bar, this Court is faced with a claim for recovery only under the terms of the GEICO policy insuring Hurst’s Saab, and not the vehicles involved in the accident.

In light of § 11-56-1, not only is a Good Samaritan “unable to ignore” the call of distress at the scene of an accident, but he or she is statutorily required to render reasonable assistance. Although we have yet to address the affirmative duty imposed upon motorists under § 11-56-1, we are not called upon to do so at this time. We need only look to the time-honored observation of Justice Cardozo for support for our holding: “Danger invites rescue. The cry of distress is the summons to relief. * * * The risk of rescue, if only it be not wanton, is born of the occasion. The emergency begets the man.” Wagner v. International Railway Co., 133 N.E. 437, 437, 438 (N.Y. 1921). Moreover, “[t]he law has long recognized that seeing a person injured or in peril compels those called to follow the example of the Good Samaritan to provide assistance.” Butzberger, 89 P.3d at 698 (citing Gardner v. Loomis Armored Inc., 913 P.2d 377, 381 (Wash. 1996) (en banc)).

Accordingly, in the face of a long-standing public policy to encourage the rescue of others from perilous situations, we are satisfied that a motorist who exits his or her vehicle in order to provide reasonable assistance to victims at the scene of an accident is engaged in a transaction essential to the use of that vehicle. 5', 'We note that, at oral argument, defendant suggested that a Good Samaritan need not exit his or her vehicle in order to render aid. With the exception of making a 9-1-1 call, we can hardly envision a circumstance in which a Good Samaritan could remain in his or her vehicle while simultaneously rendering reasonable assistance. An effort to administer assistance to victims at the scene of an accident necessitates that the Good Samaritan exit his or her vehicle to attempt rescue efforts.', 'The facts before this Court unquestionably illustrate that plaintiff exited the vehicle to render aid to the victims of the collision on Allens Avenue. Therefore, by leaving the insured vehicle in order to administer rescue efforts, plaintiff was engaged in a transaction essential to 5', 'This Court acknowledges that some courts have reached opposite conclusions when considering whether a motorist rendering aid at the scene of an accident is engaged in a transaction essential to the use of a motor vehicle.

That said, in future cases, I would jettison the somewhat unwieldy and difficult to understand Olivier factors in favor of an approach that inquires “under the totality of the circumstances, was the plaintiff sufficiently connected to the motor vehicle to be considered to be occupying it?” 2', 'It is my opinion that, after agonizing over the Olivier factors and trying mightily to see which may fit in a given case, courts conclude with decisions that are based primarily on public policy considerations.', 'That said, I join in the reasoning and conclusion of the majority, confident that, by any standard, it has reached the correct result. 2', 'For instance, how many Olivier factors need a plaintiff overcome?

Essentially, it boils down to: Where do you draw the line? At what point does the causal connection between an injured plaintiff and the insured motor vehicle become too attenuated to hold that the plaintiff was “occupying” the vehicle at the time of the injuries?', 'The majority raises a compelling and noble justification for extending coverage to include the plaintiff in this case. Clearly, Ms. Hudson’s actions were commendable. It is the statutory policy of this state to encourage the rendering of reasonable assistance at the scene of an emergency. 3 Moreover, G.L. 1956 § 11-56-1 purports to punish the failure to do so as a petty misdemeanor in certain circumstances. 4 Nevertheless, the extent of uninsured motorists (UM) coverage is a matter of contract to be interpreted in accordance with the plain and ordinary meaning of the terms of the insurance policy, Henderson v. Nationwide Insurance Co., 35 A.3d 902, 906 (R.I. 2012), in light of “what the ordinary reader and purchaser * * * would have understood them to mean.” Goldstein v.

Accordingly, the Court applies the four factors set forth in General Accident Insurance Co. of America v. Olivier, 574 A.2d 1240 (R.I. 1990) when analyzing whether a non-named “insured” is “occupying” an insured motor vehicle for purposes of UM coverage.', 'The first prong of the Olivier criteria is whether “there is a causal relation or connection between the injury and the use of the insured vehicle.” Olivier, 574 A.2d at 1241. This inquiry is further refined in Olivier by this Court’s finding as persuasive an opinion of the Supreme Court of Florida which construed policy language “arising out of the use of a motor vehicle” as simply requiring “some nexus between the motor vehicle and the injury.” Government Employees Insurance Co. v. Novak, 453 So.2d 1116, 1119 (Fla. 1984). In my judgment, however, the nexus required must be a reasonable one. In fact, this Court in Olivier found there to be a “substantial nexus * * * between the decedent’s status as a passenger in the insured motor vehicle and her being attacked * * *.” Olivier, 574 A.2d at 1242. 5', 'Under the circumstances of this case, I do not believe that Ms. Hudson has established a causal relation between her injuries and the use of the insured vehicle. Rather, I am in agreement with the trial justice that “[w]hen Ms. Hudson heard the crash and was alerted to the collision, her presence inside the insured vehicle was merely incidental to the events that followed.” Ms. Hudson and her companion had arrived at the Amazing Superstores and had parked the vehicle. Presumably, the Amazing Superstores was not their final destination that evening; nevertheless, they had in fact completed that segment of their overall journey. 5', 'The Supreme Court of Florida in Novak also concluded that there was a “highly substantial connection between [the injured party’s] use of the motor vehicle and the event causing her fatal injury.” Government Employees Insurance Co. v. Novak, 453 So. 2d 1116, 1119 (Fla. 1984).', '- 19 -', 'A salient consideration in circumstances in which the injured party is a so-called Good Samaritan, I believe, ought to be whether the injured party was required to interrupt her or his travel in order to render assistance at the scene of an emergency. See Butzberger v. Foster, 89 P.3d 689, 698 (Wash. 2004) (en banc). That was not the situation in the case at bar. Ms. Hudson, rather, had reached her interim destination. She was sitting in a parked car when she heard the sound of the accident; whether that was one or two minutes or one or two hours after the car was parked matters not. As laudable as it is to provide her coverage, to do so requires, in my view, an unreasonable expansion of the policy language.', 'Accordingly, I do not believe that the plaintiff has established “a causal relation or connection between the injury and the use of the insured vehicle.” I would, therefore, affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Justice Indeglia, dissenting. Although I agree with the thrust of the Chief Justice’s dissent, I write separately to address points that I find worthy of additional discussion. Indeed, “[o]ne can imagine few more sympathetic litigants than * * * a ‘Good Samaritan’ who stopped his [or her] car * * * to help a stranded motorist. * * * It is natural to sympathize with a litigant who has suffered harm caused by someone who cannot pay the consequences. But if sympathy were a rule of contract construction, there would soon be no law of contracts left.” 1 While I understand that in deciding this particular case, the majority may have been moved by sympathy for the plaintiff, who sustained injuries while offering aid to another, I am nevertheless convinced that it has extended our jurisprudence well beyond our prior holdings and those of other jurisdictions on the meaning of “occupying”; and, thus, I feel obliged to dissent. 1', 'United States Fidelity and Guaranty Co. v. Goudeau, 272 S.W.3d 603, 605 (Tex. 2008).', '- 20 -', 'With all due respect to the majority, I cannot fathom that plaintiff in this case was occupying the insured vehicle such that she was entitled to UM coverage. Beyond the majority’s ultimate conclusion, I take particular issue with its analysis of the first and third prongs of the standard articulated in General Accident Insurance Co. of America v. Olivier, 574 A.2d 1240 (R.I. 1990), and its use of G.L. 1956 § 11-56-1 2 to conclude that the fourth prong was met.', 'As an initial matter, I diverge from the broad lens through which the majority views the Olivier factors. I have not come across a single case that corroborates the majority’s declaration that “the general purpose underpinning the four [Olivier] factors” is “to extend coverage broadly.” 3 Instead, it appears that the majority conflates the idea that we broadly interpret the term “occupying” vis-à-vis a passenger in an insured vehicle 4 with the conclusion that we sweepingly interpret each individual prong of the Olivier test. This logical leap is troubling; and, because the starting point from which the majority broadly analyzes each factor is defective, what follows is equally unsound. In my view, instead of analyzing each factor broadly, the 2', 'As an aside, I find misleading the majority’s characterization of G.L. 1956 § 11-56-1 as a “Good Samaritan” statute. The statute is entitled “Duty to assist,” and unlike “Good Samaritan” statutes that immunize persons from liability for voluntarily and gratuitously rendering aid, § 11- 56-1 imposes criminal liability for the failure to render assistance in certain circumstances. Thus, despite the majority’s repeated references to § 11-56-1 as a “Good Samaritan” statute, this is a misnomer. See Dan B. Dobbs et al., The Law of Torts § 405 n.25 (2d ed. 2016) (“While some label these ‘good Samaritan’ statutes, they are more properly called ‘bad Samaritan’ statutes. ‘Good Samaritan’ statutes immunize from negligence liability those defendants who do assist a plaintiff in distress * * * [whereas bad Samaritan statutes] place a defendant under some form of legal duty to assist and provide for criminal or civil liability for non-assistance.”). 3', 'To be certain, the one case that the majority cites for this proposition comes up short. Beyond the language cited not verifying this assertion, the case cited, General Accident Insurance Co. of America v. D’Alessandro, 671 A.2d 1233, 1235 (R.I. 1996), actually cuts against the majority’s claim because there the Court held that the defendant was not “occupying” her uninsured vehicle. Id. 4', '“[T]his Court accorded a broad and liberal interpretation to the term ‘occupying’ as it related to a passenger in an insured vehicle * * * .” Jackson v. Quincy Mutual Fire Insurance Co., No. 2016-19-Appeal, 2017 WL 1843873, at *3 (R.I. May 5, 2017) (describing this Court’s holding in General Accident Insurance Co. of America v. Olivier, 574 A.2d 1240, 1243 (R.I. 1990) (emphasis added)).', '- 21 - majority largely overrides the Olivier test altogether with an approach that seeks to simply reward a “Good Samaritan” by “extend[ing] coverage broadly.”', 'I am moreover convinced that, although well-intentioned, the majority’s attempt to clarify the law in this arena only further muddied the water for future litigants. The trial justice interpreted Olivier to require that each prong be met for plaintiff to recover; however, the majority’s opinion fails to clarify what our law requires to satisfy the Olivier test. The majority’s declaration that “a plaintiff may fail to satisfy a portion of the Olivier criteria, but may nonetheless be ‘occupying’ an insured vehicle for purposes of UM coverage” is equivocal at best and only adds confusion to an otherwise murky legal standard. Indeed, the majority’s opinion leaves litigants uncertain about whether it is necessary to satisfy each Olivier prong to fulfill its standard.', 'Additionally, I deem problematic the majority’s analysis of Olivier’s first prong. Application of the majority’s reasoning makes it difficult to envision a circumstance that could not meet the liberal “some nexus” standard for “a causal relation or connection between the injury and the use of the insured vehicle.” Therefore, based on its nearly limitless scope, I am convinced that it is time to reconsider the broad “some nexus” test that this Court adopted in Olivier, citing to Government Employees Insurance Co. v. Novak, 453 So.2d 1116 (Fla. 1984). Novak did not involve UM coverage; rather, it involved personal injury protection (PIP) insurance. Id. at 1117. Notably, when given occasion to apply the broader “some nexus” standard to cases involving UM insurance, that very same court explicitly, and in my opinion correctly, declined to do so. See Race v. Nationwide Mutual Fire Insurance Co., 542 So.2d 347, 348-49 (Fla. 1989) (“However, we are unwilling to apply the liberal PIP interpretation of nexus', '- 22 - to claims for UM benefits.”). 5 Therefore, I believe that the trial justice’s use of a “but for” standard when analyzing the first prong, although not this jurisdiction’s law, was more appropriate because this Court should have never extended the broader “some nexus” test to the UM context in the first instance. 6', 'The majority’s conclusion that the circumstances of this case satisfy the first prong, to me lowers the bar so much that it is hard to imagine a scenario where a causal connection would not be found. As such, I would have affirmed the trial justice’s finding in this respect. See, e.g., Gilbertson v. State Farm Mutual Auto Ins., 845 F.2d 245, 248 (10th Cir. 1988) (“The mere fact that the use of the vehicle preceded the accident is not sufficient to establish the causal connection. * * * There is hardly any activity in our society which is not preceded by the use of an automobile.”); Ulrich v. United Services Automobile Association, 839 P.2d 942, 949 (Wyo. 1992) (“[B]ecause the use of an automobile has ‘some nexus’ to almost any action undertaken in society, it is our persuasion that the test does not accurately reflect the intent of the parties regarding the scope of UM coverage.”).', 'I also deviate from the majority’s analysis of the third prong. It relies, in part, on Lynn v. Westport Insurance Corp., 258 F. App’x 438, 442 (3d Cir. 2007), an opinion in which the Third Circuit Court of Appeals held that a person is “vehicle oriented” if that person “had been in the vehicle, had something occur which required them to exit the vehicle for a brief time before they could continue their journey, had full intention of returning to their vehicle, and were struck by 5', 'Curiously, in adopting the “some nexus” standard from the Florida Supreme Court in Olivier, this Court did not acknowledge Race v. Nationwide Mutual Fire Insurance Co., 542 So.2d 347 (Fla. 1989) and its adverse holding, which that same court handed down just one year before this Court decided Olivier. 6', 'We find additional support for the “but for” test in Butzberger v. Foster, 89 P.3d 689, 694 (Wash. 2004) (en banc)—a case that is heavily cited by the majority with respect to the fourth prong but is notably absent from the majority’s discussion of the first prong.', '- 23 - another vehicle while performing the action that would allow them to continue their journey.” The majority then adopts this reasoning for determining whether a person is vehicle oriented.', 'To fit plaintiff within this criterion and conclude that she was vehicle oriented, the majority holds that “plaintiff’s departure from the insured vehicle was incident to a temporary interruption in an otherwise unfinished excursion into the Amazing Super Store and that, upon completion of the occurrence causing the interruption, plaintiff intended to resume her journey.” This conclusion, however, is not grounded in the facts, and it is a stretch to conclude that plaintiff interrupted her travel to assist the victim and “had full intention” to return to the vehicle. See Lynn, 258 F. App’x at 442. The plaintiff was not en route to her destination (the Amazing Super Store) when her travel was interrupted by her rescue attempt. Rather, she had already arrived at the store and was merely waiting idly in the vehicle before entering. The only remaining leg of her journey was from the parked vehicle into the Amazing Super Store, and such a journey was pedestrian, not vehicular. As a result, rather than return to her vehicle, plaintiff could access what awaited her in the Amazing Super Store by foot.', 'In analyzing the fourth prong of the Olivier test, the majority relies on § 11-56-1. Specifically, it maintains that “in light of § 11-56-1, a willingness to render aid at the scene of a motor vehicle collision as a Good Samaritan, is inherently part of the use of a motor vehicle in this state.” In this respect, the majority also states that “[a]lthough we have yet to address the affirmative duty imposed upon motorists under § 11-56-1, we are not called upon to do so at this time.” Yet, it appears that ultimately it has done just that in concluding that § 11-56-1 was a declaration of public policy to encourage the rescue of others from perilous situations. This statute, which to me is replete with vagueness, does not even mention motor vehicles. True, it', '- 24 - may apply in the automobile accident setting, but it is just as applicable to a pedestrian finding someone lying in a pool of blood at the bus stop in Kennedy Plaza.', 'Also with respect to the fourth prong, I question the majority’s reliance on Butzberger v. Foster, 89 P.3d 689, 697 (Wash. 2004) (en banc), in which the Supreme Court of Washington held that “a rescue effort to assist an occupant of another vehicle is a transaction essential to the use of that vehicle.” While the majority cites to Butzberger for that proposition, it fails to note that the Supreme Court of Washington narrowly confined this holding to “when a motorist interrupts his or her travel to rescue a victim in another vehicle * * * .” Id. at 698 (emphasis added). Hence, the conclusion in Butzberger was based on the fact that Butzberger intended to proceed in his vehicle and continue his travel after concluding his rescue effort. 7 Id. at 697-98.', 'As noted above, I am perplexed at how the majority could maintain that plaintiff interrupted her travel to assist the victim. Unlike those cases where the injured party was in a vehicle involved in an accident or came upon the accident, like Butzberger, here plaintiff and the vehicle she was in was off the road in a parking lot for one to two minutes intending to go into the Amazing Super Store when she heard the collision. The plaintiff had already arrived at her destination and was sitting in the parked vehicle before the accident. This is a critical distinction that the Butzberger court relied on to distinguish United States Fire Insurance Co. v. Parker, 463 S.E.2d 464, 466 (Va. 1995), in which the Supreme Court of Virginia held that Parker was not engaged in a transaction essential to the use of the vehicle. The Butzberger court noted that, while both Parker and Butzberger used their vehicles as a means of transportation to work, “Butzberger was struck and killed while still in the process of driving to work,” whereas “Parker 7', 'Although I agree with the majority’s averment that whether an individual is “occupying” for these purposes is “intensely fact-driven,” it appears that the majority has failed to heed its own advice.', '- 25 - on the other hand had already arrived at her jobsite, parked the insured truck, and was working when she sustained her injuries * * * .” Butzberger, 89 P.3d at 698 n.6. Accordingly, in this “intensely fact-driven” inquiry, Butzberger acknowledged the significant distinction between a person en route to his or her destination who is interrupted before arriving there and one who already arrived at the destination and parked the vehicle, like plaintiff. Because plaintiff fell into the latter category, I am further convinced that she was not engaged in a transaction essential to the use of the vehicle.', 'Consequently, this case calls to mind the sound guidance of Sir William Blackstone that “the liberty of considering all cases in an equitable light must not be indulged too far, lest thereby we destroy all law[.] * * * And law, without equity, though hard and disagreeable, is much more desirable for the public good than equity without law * * * .” 8 Although I recognize the plaintiff’s praiseworthy deed in coming to the aid of a person in distress, I am ultimately persuaded that the following language cited by the trial justice in her decision should have carried the day: this Court “is not at liberty to create bad law to cover good persons. If the Court were to do so, it would right one wrong, [the plaintiff’s] injury, while creating another: holding [the defendant] responsible even when the law said otherwise.” 9 For these reasons, I must respectfully dissent. 8', '1 William Blackstone, Commentaries *62. 9', 'Greenwich Insurance Co. v.

The plaintiff claimed that his fall resulted in a torn rotator cuff that required surgery and caused the plaintiff to be unable to work for a period of several months.

At that family gathering, plaintiff and Mr. Gilman made plans to go together to Lowe’s the following morning to purchase plywood so that plaintiff could replace the flooring in his apartment.', 'On the morning of the 26th, plaintiff went out to the parking lot adjacent to his apartment building to meet Mr. Gilman, as the two had planned. The plaintiff walked towards his truck to retrieve his wallet and keys, and, as he was doing so, he slipped and fell on a patch of black ice. The plaintiff landed with a thud on his left shoulder. The fall, according to plaintiff, resulted in a torn rotator cuff, which required surgery to repair.

At the close of plaintiff’s case, defendant moved for judgment as a matter of law, pursuant to Rule 50 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. The defendant argued that plaintiff had presented no evidence that defendant was on notice of the black ice and, therefore, as a matter of law, plaintiff’s claim must fail. The trial justice initially reserved on that motion. At the conclusion of defendant’s case, defendant renewed its motion for judgment as a matter of law.

Consequently, when temperatures climbed above freezing during the day, snow and ice would melt and water would run across the parking area. Then, when the temperature dropped overnight, the water would refreeze on the paved parking area, resulting in patches of black ice, creating a dangerous condition.', 'The defendant contends that it should prevail as a matter of law because there was no evidence presented that there were snowbanks at the time plaintiff slipped 2 and, furthermore, there was no evidence that defendant had notice of a dangerous condition. In making this argument, however, defendant overlooks Ms. Aubin’s testimony. At trial, Ms. Aubin testified that there were snowdrifts on the grassy area above the parking lot on the day that plaintiff injured himself. Furthermore, Ms. Aubin testified that plaintiff had complained to defendant on at least two occasions about ice forming in the parking lot.', 'The defendant further argues that, because plaintiff complained only generally about icy conditions occurring in the parking area, but never about the specific patch of ice that he fell on, 1', 'In its briefs, defendant devoted space to discussing the “Connecticut Rule,” which abrogates a landlord’s duty to keep surfaces clear of natural accumulations of ice and snow during a storm. See Benaski v. Weinberg, 899 A.2d 499, 502–03 (R.I. 2006). In this case, weather data that was admitted into evidence indicated that there was a substantial snowstorm that began late on the day of December 26, 2010, the day that plaintiff fell. However, at the time of plaintiff’s fall, only trace amounts of snow were recorded. Nevertheless, plaintiff alleges that he slipped on black ice that had formed the previous night, and not on freshly fallen snow. Given the posture of the case before us, we must assume that plaintiff’s allegation is true. Accordingly, for the purpose of our review, the Connecticut Rule is inapplicable. 2', 'The defendant concedes that “when snow was removed from the parking area, it was deposited onto the grassy area.” However, defendant’s argument is that no snowbanks existed at the time that plaintiff fell.', '-5- defendant did not have sufficient notice of the dangerous condition. Therefore, defendant asserts that, as a matter of law, it should prevail. We are not persuaded by this argument.', 'This Court, in Dawson v. Rhode Island Auditorium, Inc., 104 R.I. 116, 128, 242 A.2d 407, 414-15 (1968), held that the defendant building owner, even though it had never been given notice of the specific leak that caused the plaintiff’s injuries, had notice of the leak in its roof because the defendant previously had notice that its roof was generally leaky during heavy rains. Here, the situation is analogous. The defendant had notice that icy conditions were present on its property during certain types of weather, and that icy conditions would come and go as the weather changed.', 'In our opinion, it would be impractical to burden a tenant with the responsibility to call his landlord every day to give notice of new patches of ice in order to satisfy the notice requirement of a premises liability claim. Rather, this burden is sustained by providing notice of the recurring condition. And, if we credit Ms. Aubin’s testimony, as we must for the purpose of this Rule 50 motion, then the inescapable conclusion is that defendant had notice of the dangerous, icy condition that existed in the parking area.', 'Because we do not weigh the evidence when analyzing a Rule 50 motion, it is our opinion that there was enough evidence to send the case to the jury.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth herein, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court. The record shall be remanded to that tribunal.', 'Justice Robinson, dissenting. I respectfully dissent, but I do so rather vigorously. I readily concede that this is a close case. That being said, after long and intense reflection, I have concluded that the trial justice who presided over the jury trial in this case “got it right” when, at', '-6- the close of the evidence, she granted the defendant’s motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. I simply fail to perceive any basis in the record for concluding that a reasonable jury could legitimately have found the defendant liable under the facts as presented at trial.', 'I am well aware of our jurisprudence under Rule 50, whereby the trial justice, and indeed this Court, must “examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party” and “draw[] from the record all reasonable inferences that support the position of the nonmoving party.” Lemont v. Estate of Ventura, 157 A.3d 31, 36 (R.I. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted). I am likewise aware that the trial justice should enter judgment as a matter of law only when “there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue.” Rule 50(a)(1). However, I do not believe that this case surmounts even that rather low bar.', 'The courts of this jurisdiction have for many years adhered to “the Connecticut Rule” when dealing with a landlord’s duties in the context of the ongoing falling of precipitation. See Benaski v. Weinberg, 899 A.2d 499, 502-03 (R.I. 2006). The relevant aspect of that Rule has been well summarized as follows: “[A]s a general rule, any duty to clear a natural accumulation of ice and snow is not triggered before a reasonable time after the storm ends.” Berardis v. Louangxay, 969 A.2d 1288, 1292 (R.I. 2009) (citing Benaski, 899 A.2d at 503). The “Local Climatological Data” recorded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association at Theodore F. Green Airport, which was admitted as an exhibit at trial, reflected the fact that it began snowing around 5:00 a.m. on December 26, 2010 and continued into December 27,', '-7- resulting in a substantial snowfall. 1 Thus, as the trial justice recognized, under the “Connecticut Rule,” MAG Realty would have had an arguable duty with respect to the black ice at issue only if said ice was formed prior to the start of the snowfall at 5:00 a.m. on December 26. However, in my judgment, a thorough review of the record fails to reveal any meaningful evidence on which a reasonable juror could have reached such a conclusion.', 'The “Local Climatological Data” admitted at trial established the fact that there was no snowfall in the two days preceding December 26. Additionally, plaintiff himself testified that he did not “notice anything” on the parking lot when he returned home on December 25. The plaintiff’s wife, Jennifer Aubin, also testified that she did not observe any ice on the parking lot when she and defendant returned home on December 25, at approximately midnight the day before her husband’s fall. Moreover, plaintiff’s testimony with respect to the existence of snow piles, the melting of which, according to plaintiff, resulted in puddles in the parking lot, does not aid plaintiff’s case due to the fact that he also testified that the area where he slipped was “a completely different area than [the area] where the puddling would occur.”', 'I note as well that Ms. Aubin’s testimony on cross-examination with respect to the snow she observed on the grassy area on December 26 was, in my judgment, insufficient to surmount even the rather forgiving criterion established by Rule 50. She testified that, when she left the Aubins’ apartment and went outside, she “d[id]n’t remember seeing grass when [she] walked into the yard.” When she was asked if she “saw snow,” she replied as follows: “Or something, because there would have been grass.” In addition, the following was her testimony:', '“[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: * * * Do you remember there being any', 'piles of snow along * * * the area you can see the grass abuts the', 'pavement? 1', 'We note that plaintiff’s testimony reflects the fact that his fall occurred at approximately 10:00 a.m. on December 26, 2010.', '-8-', '“[MS. AUBIN]: There were probably snow drifts there.', '“[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. There were snow drifts there to', 'your recollection?', '“[MS. AUBIN]: Yes.', '“[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. Do you remember how high they', 'were?', '“[MS. AUBIN]: At that time, no.', '“***', '“[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: * * * Do you remember how long those', 'snow drifts had been there?', '“[MS. AUBIN]: No, I do not.', '“[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Do you remember when the last storm', 'would have been so that there would have been the snow drifts', 'there?', '“[MS. AUBIN]: No.” Significantly, Ms. Aubin also testified on cross-examination that she did not go outside and observe the parking area immediately after her husband “indicated” to her that he had fallen. However, she stated that she did go outside and observe the parking lot at some later point on December 26, although she was unable at trial to recall just when that was. When she was later asked during cross-examination if she observed the parking lot on “the afternoon of the 26th,” she replied: “Possibly.” It is far from clear from Ms. Aubin’s testimony at what time of day she observed snowdrifts; and she similarly could not remember the size of the snowdrifts or how long they had been there. Accordingly, it is entirely conceivable that Ms. Aubin could have observed very small snowdrifts late in the morning, in the afternoon, or in the evening of December 26, which could have been the result of the snowfall on December 26. Additionally, it is my opinion that the utterly vague statement about the existence of ice in the parking lot, which Ms. Aubin testified was relayed to the landlord on at least two previous occasions, is simply inadequate to have met plaintiff’s burden. Ms. Aubin’s testimony does not even state when such', '-9- a communication was made to the landlord—whether it was a few days earlier, earlier in the month, earlier in the year, or even in some previous year. 2', 'The evidence in this case would require a jury to speculate about exactly how the weather conditions in the days preceding December 26 could have resulted in the melting and refreezing necessary to have created the black ice at issue before the morning of December 26, on which plaintiff would later slip. See Scittarelli v. Providence Gas Co., 415 A.2d 1040, 1044 (R.I. 1980) (holding that “[t]he defendant’s negligence remain[ed] a matter of speculation and conjecture” because the plaintiff failed to meet her burden of introducing evidence of negligence and, consequently, that the trial justice should have entered a directed verdict in the defendant’s favor); see also Montuori v. Narrangansett Electric Co., 418 A.2d 5, 10-11 (R.I. 1980) (holding that the “plaintiff was unable to produce more than minimal direct evidence to establish the element of causation” and that, therefore, the trial justice should have granted the defendant’s motion for a directed verdict). As the trial justice in this case perceptively stated: “[T]he jury would have to make assumptions concerning the rate at which snow, ice, and water might melt, freeze, or evaporate during the various weather conditions shown in the meteorological data charts.” For that reason, the lack of expert testimony in support of the plaintiff’s case is striking. 2', 'The majority cites Dawson v. Rhode Island Auditorium, Inc., 104 R.I. 116, 242 A.2d 407 (1968), stating that that case held that a “defendant building owner, even though it had never been given notice of the specific leak that caused the plaintiff’s injuries, had notice of the leak in its roof because the defendant previously had notice that its roof was generally leaky during heavy rains.” While I do not quibble with the majority’s statement, a reading of Dawson leads to the ineluctable conclusion that the facts which established that the defendant building owner in Dawson was on notice of the leaky roof are distinguishable from the vague comments on which the majority relies in the case before us. In Dawson, the defendant building owner had been aware of the leaks in the building’s roof for years prior to the incident at issue in the case. Id. at 126-27, 242 A.2d at 413-14. Indeed, at one point the roof had “approximately 387 leaks.” Id. at 126, 242 A.2d at 414. Moreover, the defendant building owner had taken measures over the preceding years to attempt to “resurfac[e]” the “chronic leaking condition of [the] roof.” Id. at 127, 242 A.2d at 414. Accordingly, the factual situation in Dawson is, in my judgment, easily distinguishable from the instant case.', '- 10 - The trial justice was correct in stating that the jury would be asked to “make findings that are beyond their expertise as lay persons.” I fail to see how any reasonable juror could find in the plaintiff’s favor based on the evidence presented at trial without engaging in impermissible conjecture and speculation.', 'Accordingly, I record my respectful but vigorous dissent.', '- 11 - STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND', 'PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS', 'SUPREME COURT – CLERK’S OFFICE', 'OPINION COVER SHEET Title of Case', 'Joseph Aubin v.

The defendant subsequently agreed to give a statement.', 'His statement was typed up by the detective and was reviewed with defendant, both on the computer screen and again after it was printed.

The other detective testified that they did not read the Miranda', '-5- warnings to defendant at any point in time in the apartment because he was not under arrest at that point.

Edwards, 810 A.2d 226, 239 (R.I. 2002)).', 'A person is in custody “if, in view of all the circumstances, a reasonable person would believe that he or she was not free to leave.” Jimenez, 33 A.3d at 732 (quoting State v. Vieira, 913 A.2d 1015, 1020 (R.I. 2007)). We have previously recognized that', '“the following four factors may be considered in making this', 'determination: ‘(1) the extent to which the person’s freedom [was]', 'curtailed; (2) the degree of force employed by the police; (3) the', 'belief of a reasonable, innocent person in identical circumstances;', 'and (4) whether the person had the option of not accompanying the', 'police.’” Id. (quoting Vieira, 913 A.2d at 1020).', 'Furthermore, “the term ‘interrogation’ under Miranda refers not only to express questioning, but also to any words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an', '-9- incriminating response from the suspect.” Rhode Island v. Innis, 446 U.S. 291, 300-01 (1980); see also Jimenez, 33 A.3d at 733 n.11.', 'Assuming without deciding that defendant was in custody, we will focus our analysis on whether defendant was interrogated.', '“To make that determination we must independently examine the facts, findings[,] and the record of the lower court.” State v. Perez, 422 A.2d 913, 915 (R.I. 1980).', 'In Jimenez, 33 A.3d at 733 n.11, the state did not refute the fact that the defendant was interrogated. The officer had testified that he “kept asking” defendant questions such as “are you sure you didn’t do anything, or nothing’s going on?” and followed up with such questions as whether defendant had touched the complaining witness or not. Id. This “express questioning” was sufficient to classify the questioning of the officer as interrogation. Id. Similarly, in Harrison, 66 A.3d at 441-42, 442, it was undisputed that the officer interrogated the defendant by posing a question to him, explicitly asking him, “What happened tonight?” Such express questioning is notably absent from the record here.', 'The defendant’s first statement to the detectives, which was that he knew why they were there, was a spontaneous statement, uttered without any questions being addressed to him. In response to defendant’s statements, one of the detectives asked him, “What do you mean by that?” to which defendant responded, “[the complaining witness] was here last night, she was drunk, she kept taking her clothes off, I had to make her go in my bedroom.” This scenario bears a striking similarity to the fact pattern in State v. Grayhurst, 852 A.2d 491, 513-14 (R.I. 2004), where the detective asked, “[W]hat do you mean?” of the defendant after he blurted out a spontaneous statement. This Court in Grayhurst held that, “[t]aken in context, [the detective’s] question ‘what do you mean?’ did not constitute interrogation.” Id. This Court reasoned that', '- 10 - “[t]his question was merely an instinctive reaction, provoked by [the] defendant’s initial statement * * *.” Id. It is our opinion that the detective’s question in this case was also merely an instinctive reaction which was provoked by defendant’s uncalled-for and unexpected statement when he opened the door to greet the detectives.', 'The defendant made other statements while he was in the process of signing the consent- to-search form. The record reveals that, while the detective was attempting to read the form with him, defendant was continuously talking over him, trying to explain what happened. He kept repeating the same story that “[the complaining witness] came to [his] house drunk * * * [and] kept taking her clothes off.” Again, it is our opinion that these statements were voluntary and unsolicited by the detectives because there was no questioning of defendant.', 'And “[a]ny statement given freely and voluntarily without any compelling influences is, of course, admissible in evidence.”', 'Innis, 446 U.S. at 299-300 (quoting Miranda, 384 U.S. at 478). Significantly, there was testimony that one detective told defendant that he should not say anything.', 'After he signed the form, defendant asked the detectives what they were searching for. When one of the detectives indicated that they were going to seize the bedsheets, defendant uttered that they “were not going to like what [they] found on the sheets.” This statement also was not invited by the detectives.', 'In response to defendant’s unprompted statement, the detective said, “What do you mean?”—to which defendant answered that the complaining witness “was in the bedroom and had been playing with herself.” The detective would not have asked this question if defendant had not first provoked him with his statement. Accordingly, we are of the opinion that the detective’s question was, again, merely an instinctive reaction to', '- 11 - defendant’s voluntary statement; it was by no means an interrogation on the part of the detectives.', 'The defendant, however, argues that the detective asked him “the age-old ‘Who? What? When? Where? and Why?’ and in so doing, solicited incriminating responses from [him].” The defendant cites to Innis, to maintain that the detective’s words or actions were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from defendant. We discern no merit in this argument. The detective asked the same question on two occasions, both times in response to defendant’s voluntary statements. We cannot fathom how defendant perceives five different questions from this one remark. Moreover, it is our opinion that defendant was not subjected by the detective to words or actions that the detective should have known were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from him. As we have elucidated earlier in this opinion, the detective’s questions were merely instinctive reactions to defendant’s deliberate statements; they were not calculated or “well-timed,” as defendant claims, to elicit incriminating responses. 4', 'Because defendant was not interrogated, the exclusionary rule of Miranda was not triggered. The hearing justice’s finding that defendant’s statements were not invited by the police but were voluntary statements was appropriate, and we completely agree with it. For that reason, the hearing justice’s denial of defendant’s motion to suppress was proper.', 'Seibert Issue', 'The defendant further argues that “the Central Falls detectives violated both the Rhode Island and United States Constitutions by engaging in the two-step questioning practice held to be unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court in Missouri v. Seibert, 542 U.S. 600 (2004)[,]” because the detectives “neglect[ed] to obtain an arrest warrant when both * * * agreed 4', 'It has not escaped us that the statements made by defendant while in his apartment were exculpatory in nature.', '- 12 - they possessed probable cause, and [when they] manipulat[ed] the requirements of Miranda in order to obtain incriminating statements from [him] at the Central Falls Police station * * *.” The state, however, contends that defendant did not raise this issue below, and, therefore, waived the issue.', 'Our review of the record before us reveals no indication that defendant raised the issue in the lower court. Consequently, it is our opinion that the issue has been waived. Nevertheless, we will briefly pause to discuss the merits of defendant’s claim.', 'In Seibert, 542 U.S. at 604, the United States Supreme Court reviewed a police protocol for custodial interrogation that called for withholding Miranda warnings until interrogation had produced a confession. The interrogating officer would then impart the Miranda warnings and lead the suspect to cover the same ground a second time. Id. The Supreme Court, in a plurality decision, held that the statement repeated after Miranda warnings were given in such circumstances was inadmissible. Id. In so holding, the Court set forth a number of factors to consider when Miranda warnings delivered midstream could be effective. Id. at 615. The following factors were laid out:', '“the completeness and detail of the questions and answers in the', 'first round of interrogation, the overlapping content of the two', 'statements, the timing and setting of the first and the second, the', 'continuity of police personnel, and the degree to which the', 'interrogator’s questions treated the second round as continuous', 'with the first.” Id.', 'However, because we are of the opinion that defendant was not interrogated at his apartment, we need not delve into the factors that were set forth by the Court. Miranda warnings are triggered only when both custody and interrogation are present. See Harrison, 66 A.3d at 441 (citing Edwards, 810 A.2d at 239). Here, because we have held that the interrogation requirement is missing, Miranda warnings were not required. Miranda warnings were necessary', '- 13 - only at the police station, when defendant was in custody and interviewed by the lead detective. Accordingly, it is our opinion that the Central Falls detectives did not engage in the “question first” interrogation technique.', 'Voluntary, Knowing, and Intelligent Waiver', 'The defendant’s overarching argument is that his statements to the police should be suppressed because the state failed to meet its burden of proving that those statements were voluntary and made after a knowing and intelligent waiver. Because we have addressed the statements that defendant made at his apartment in detail and have concluded that he was not interrogated, we now focus on the statements that he made while in custody at the Central Falls police station.', 'When ruling on a motion to suppress a defendant’s statements, “the trial justice should ‘admit a confession or a statement against a defendant only if the state can first prove by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his [or her] constitutional rights expressed in Miranda v. Arizona.’” Barros, 24 A.3d at 1179 (quoting State v. Bido, 941 A.2d 822, 835 (R.I. 2008)). Therefore, “[j]udicial inquiry into the propriety of a defendant’s waiver * * * is two dimensional.” Jimenez, 33 A.3d at 734 (quoting State v. Leuthavone, 640 A.2d 515, 519 (R.I. 1994)). “First, the relinquishment of the right must have been voluntary * * *.” Id. (quoting Leuthavone, 640 A.2d at 519). “The definitive test of the voluntariness of a statement is whether, after taking into consideration the totality of the circumstances, it was the product of the defendant’s free will or was instead the result of coercion that overcame the defendant’s free will at the time that it was made.” Id. (quoting State v. Mlyniec, 15 A.3d 983, 996 (R.I. 2011)). “Second, the waiver must have been made with a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision', '- 14 - to abandon it.” Id. (quoting Leuthavone, 640 A.2d at 519). “This bipartite inquiry requires an analysis of the ‘totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation.’”', 'Id. (quoting Leuthavone, 640 A.2d at 519).', 'In denying defendant’s motion to suppress, the hearing justice found that there was no evidence of any interaction between defendant and the detectives that would evidence that he was in any way coerced or that he did not understand his rights.', 'We agree with his determination.', 'In his statement to the police, defendant said that he carried the complaining witness to his bedroom because she kept falling off the couch. He recounted that he heard her fall off the bed and when he went to his bedroom to pick her up, she had taken all her clothes off. He further detailed that she was the one who “grabbed [his] hand and put [his] right midd[le] finger in her vagina” and “forced [his] head down * * * toward her vagina” and “made [him] kiss that area.” On several occasions in his written statement, defendant admitted that he was “scared”; he apologized for what had occurred and vowed that it would never happen again.', 'After a careful review of the record, we cannot say that the trial justice’s findings are clearly erroneous. The defendant’s statements at the police station were the product of his free will. The detective began her interview of defendant only after asking him if he would speak to her, which he agreed to do. Accordingly, considering the totality of the circumstances, we concur with the hearing justice’s ruling that defendant voluntarily waived his Miranda rights.', 'Furthermore, we are satisfied that the defendant’s waiver was knowing and intelligent. The detective read his Miranda rights to him from a rights form; he initialed the form after each right was read to him. It is noteworthy, however, that the defendant checked off “no” on the rights form after the two following statements: “The police have made no threats or promises to', '- 15 - me”; and “I understand my rights.” The hearing justice found that both detectives indicated that they understood the defendant’s “no” to be in response to the statement that the police had made no threats or promises to him. The hearing justice concluded that he had confidence in the credibility of the detectives. Even after reading his rights to him, the detective asked the defendant several times whether he understood his rights and each time he indicated that he did. Additionally, the opening of the defendant’s typed statement, which he initialed and signed, indicated that the defendant did understand his rights. After considering the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that the record is devoid of evidence that would suggest that the defendant failed to comprehend the nature of his rights or the consequences of abandoning them.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

15,State : v. : Tavell D. Yon. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. The defendant, Tavell D. Yon, appeals from a May 2, 2014 judgment of conviction in Providence County Superior Court for constructive possession of a firearm after a conviction for a crime of violence,1 in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-47-5.2 On appeal, he contends that the trial justice erred in: (1) failing to suppress the defendant’s statement with respect to the gun at issue in the case; (2) failing to “submit to the [j]ury the issue of the voluntariness of [the] defendant’s alleged statement” with respect to the gun at issue; and (3) denying the defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal and motion for a new trial. This case came before the Supreme Court, sitting at Woonsocket High School, for oral argument on April 26, 2017.', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'The criminal information reflects the fact that defendant was previously convicted of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver. In a chambers conference, prior to jury selection, defendant stipulated to having been previously convicted of a crime of violence. 2', 'The defendant was also charged with fraudulently receiving stolen goods, “to wit, a .40 caliber Smith & Wesson pistol, knowing the same to be stolen,” in violation of G.L. 1956 §§ 11- 41-2 and 11-41-5. That count was dismissed prior to trial pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In this case, a tip from a confidential informant led to the search of an apartment where defendant was located and the discovery of a firearm. The defendant was subsequently arrested. At the police station, he was asked if the gun found in the apartment was stolen, and he responded: “‘[W]hat gun bought off the street isn’t stolen?’” It was that statement which defendant sought to have suppressed before trial. We relate below the relevant portions of the suppression hearing.', 'A', 'The Suppression Hearing', '1. The Testimonies of Detective John Bento and Detective Martin Hames', 'Providence Police Detective John Bento was the first witness to testify at the suppression hearing. It was his testimony that, on October 26, 2012, following an investigation that involved surveillance and the issuance of a search warrant, he and other members of the “Narcotics and Organized Crime Unit” executed the search warrant at 14-16 Monticello Street. He added that he and the other officers were searching for a firearm. Detective Bento testified that they “used force” to enter the apartment, at around 11:00 a.m., after there was no answer to a knock on the door. He stated that, upon entering the apartment, the officers detained Mr. Yon and his girlfriend, one Desiree Rodrigues. Detective Bento added that neither individual was placed in handcuffs and that they were seated at the kitchen table. It was the testimony of Det. Bento that a search of the apartment was then conducted and a firearm was eventually discovered. He stated in his testimony that, at that point, Mr. Yon and Ms. Rodrigues were placed “into custody and in cuffs.” It was further Det. Bento’s testimony that he immediately read both individuals', '-2- “their rights, their Constitutional rights” from a pre-printed card that he kept in his wallet. He added that, at the conclusion of reading from the card, he inquired whether or not Mr. Yon understood his rights and that Mr. Yon “acknowledged by saying yes, he understands.” It was Det. Bento’s testimony that, “[s]hortly after” he had read Mr. Yon and Ms. Rodrigues their rights, they were transported to the police station—“within ten, fifteen minutes.”', 'The testimony of Providence Police Detective Martin Hames corroborated Det. Bentos’s testimony. Detective Hames added that, during the investigation of defendant, he discovered that defendant had been arrested “numerous times” and had had his rights read to him in the past. It was also his testimony that he “observed Detective Bento reading the rights to both [defendant and Ms. Rodrigues];” he added that he also heard the rights being read. Detective Hames testified that, at the police station, about a half hour after he had heard Mr. Yon being read his rights, he proceeded to the interview room where Mr. Yon was handcuffed and asked Mr. Yon a single question—viz., whether “the gun was stolen.”', 'It was his testimony that Mr. Yon responded as follows to that question: “‘[W]hat gun off the street wasn’t stolen?’”', '2. The Testimonies of Tavell Yon and Desiree Rodrigues', 'At the suppression hearing, Tavell Yon testified that, on October 26, 2012, as soon as the police entered the apartment, they “thr[e]w [him] on the ground” and “cuff[ed] [him].” He stated that he and Ms. Rodrigues were then seated in the kitchen. It was further his testimony that, after the gun was located, an officer said to him: “‘[Y]ou’re federally f***ed now, you’re going down for this, you won’t see the streets for a while.’” He added that Ms. Rodrigues told the police that the gun belonged to her and that they proceeded to put her in handcuffs. It was then his testimony at the suppression hearing that “[t]hat morning nobody read [him his] rights.”', '-3-', 'With respect to what occurred after he was taken to the police station, defendant testified that after being placed, alone, in an interrogation room at the police station, he was “processed.” He further testified: “The guy who works down in the cellblock asked me was the gun stolen. I was like, I don’t know what guns on the streets ain’t stolen though.” It is important to note that, when asked at the suppression hearing, defendant did not deny making that statement. He testified that he had known the man who asked him the question “for so many years;” he added that “he’s an all right guy.” He further testified that he did not think he was being “interrogated” or “question[ed]” at that time.', 'On cross-examination, defendant acknowledged that he had seen Miranda3 rights being read on television. He was also confronted on cross-examination with a Miranda rights form that he had signed on a previous occasion. The defendant further answered questions on cross- examination with respect to his numerous previous encounters with law enforcement; and he testified that, on several other occasions, he also had not remembered being read his Miranda rights. He added: “I really don’t pay attention when I’m getting arrested. I’m so mad, I don’t pay attention to what officers are saying.” When asked by the court, during cross-examination, whether he knew his rights, he stated that he could “repeat [them],” but he added that he did not “really understand all of them.” In his testimony on cross-examination, he went on to state that he knew he had a right to an attorney and the right to remain silent.', 'Ms. Rodrigues also testified at the suppression hearing. It was her testimony that, when the officers entered the apartment on October 26, they “put [Mr. Yon] on the ground, cuffed him, put him at the table.” It was further her testimony that, after the officers located the gun, she told them the gun belonged to her. She stated that an officer then said to her: “[O]h, you want to play 3', 'See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 444-45 (1966).', '-4- games, you can come down to the station too;” she added that she was then arrested. Ms. Rodrigues stated in her testimony that she and defendant were not read their Miranda rights.', 'After the close of testimony at the suppression hearing, the trial justice issued a bench ruling denying defendant’s motion to suppress the statement which he made at the police station with respect to the gun at issue—“‘what gun off the street [is not] stolen?’” A trial then commenced which spanned four days in February of 2014. We relate below the salient aspects of what transpired at that trial.', 'B', 'The Testimony at Trial', 'After the trial justice’s bench ruling on the motion to suppress, but before any testimony was taken at trial, the following colloquy took place out of the presence of the jury:', '“THE COURT: If the case is going to take a turn into the', 'Miranda corner, I wouldn’t be surprised, [defense counsel], if [the', 'prosecutor] is going to want to get into some of the stuff [which]', 'was disclosed during the course of * * * the hearings * * * relative', 'to your client’s knowledge of Miranda. The cases are, as I’ve', 'already mentioned, pretty clear in that direction. I don’t know that', 'the state should be disadvantaged from not being able to use some', 'of that relevant information in the course of a trial where the claim', 'is the statement was made and it was not Mirandized.', '“[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Judge, in light of the Court’s', 'ruling, I’m not going to touch on that at all. I’m simply going to', 'ask Ms. Rodrigues if she was advised of her rights before she gave', 'her statement [at the police station] and we can leave it at that.', '“THE COURT: Well, is there going to be any suggestion or', 'argument or evidence that you want to proffer to this jury relative', 'to your client making a statement that he was not Mirandized and', 'that the human[e] practice rule ought to be invoked during the', 'course of the --', '“[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: The what?', '“THE COURT: Human[e] practice rule. In other words,', 'giving the jury that instruction on Miranda.', '“[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Judge, I don’t intend to argue', 'that, under the Court’s ruling, whether it was suggested or', 'implied.”', '-5- Subsequent to this exchange, the first witness was called to testify.', '1. The Trial Testimony of Detective Martin Hames', 'Detective Hames was the first witness to testify at the trial. He testified that the police started surveilling defendant on October 24, 2012; he stated that they were surveilling 14-16 Monticello Street to determine whether defendant lived there. It was further his testimony that, on the basis of, inter alia, the information that the police gleaned through surveilling the house, they applied for a search warrant; he added that a search warrant was issued. Detective Hames stated at trial that he and his fellow officers executed the search warrant on 14-16 Monticello Street at about 11:00 a.m. on October 26, 2012. It was his testimony that, during the search of the premises, he found “male clothing” inside the drawers of the “dressers” in the bedroom.4 He added that he “seize[d]” the following items from the bedroom: “a * * * wallet containing Mr. Yon’s ID. There were a couple receipts inside * * *. There was some mail in his name for that residence also on the dresser.” A “Cox Cable bill in the name of Tavell Yon for 16 Monticello, Unit 2F * * * dated October 12, 2012” and a “Vistaprint mail also in the name of Tavell Yon for 16 Monticello Street” were part of an exhibit at trial and were identified by Det. Hames as items he seized from the bedroom. He also noted in his testimony that the address listed on Mr. Yon’s driver’s license, which was also seized from the bedroom, was “583 Charles Street.”', 'In the course of his testimony at trial, Det. Hames reiterated what he had testified to at the suppression hearing with respect to his contact with defendant at the police station; he stated that, about a half hour after he had left the apartment, he asked defendant, who was in an interview room at the police station at the time, whether the gun was stolen. He stated that defendant’s 4', 'Detective Hames identified the “bedroom” as the room where defendant “was standing in the doorway and Ms. Rodrigues was on the bed” when police entered the apartment.', '-6- response was as follows: “‘[W]hat gun bought off the street isn’t stolen?’” He added, on cross- examination, that that was the only question he asked defendant.', '2. The Testimony of Detective Thomas Zincone', 'Providence Police Detective Thomas Zincone testified that he was also involved in the surveillance of defendant and the eventual search of the apartment at 14-16 Monticello Street. He stated that the police had been conducting surveillance of that apartment prior to October 26 and had observed Mr. Yon leaving the apartment.', 'He further testified that, when the police entered the apartment to execute the search warrant, Mr. Yon was standing in “his boxer shorts and * * * a T-shirt in the doorway of a bedroom” and Ms. Rodrigues was “laying in the bed.” It was further his testimony that he searched the living room, including the couch. Detective Zincone stated at trial that he found a firearm at the “end of the couch,” “between the cushion and the armrest,” by “put[ting his] hands in-between the cushions.” He identified the gun introduced as an exhibit at trial as the one he located in the couch cushions.', 'On cross-examination, Det. Zincone stated that, in the course of the investigation which preceded the execution of the search warrant, he received information from a confidential informant that Mr. Yon was “residing” at 14-16 Monticello Street. It was further his testimony on cross-examination, that “[u]pon exiting the residence” after defendant’s arrest, he saw defendant’s name on the mailbox. He added that he did not remember Ms. Rodrigues stating that the gun belonged to her immediately after the gun was located in the apartment.', 'At the conclusion of the state’s case, defendant moved for judgment of acquittal pursuant to Rule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. The trial justice denied the motion.', '-7-', '3. The Trial Testimony of Desiree Rodrigues', 'Desiree Rodrigues was the next and last witness to testify. She testified that, during the six or seven months preceding October 26, 2012, she lived at 16 Monticello Street and was “casual[ly] dating” defendant. It was her testimony that defendant lived at 583 Charles Street. She further testified that, after the gun was located in her apartment, she told the officers it was her gun. She explained during her testimony that she came to be in possession of the firearm because she had had a “bad encounter” with a customer at her place of employment and she was “scared.”', 'During cross-examination, she answered “Yes” when asked if she was being “stalked.” She stated that another customer, whom she knew only as “Mike,” had sold her the firearm; she added that she paid $500 for the gun. Ms. Rodrigues testified that one of the two places where she kept the gun was “inside the couch cushion.” It was Ms. Rodrigues’s further testimony that, at the police station after her arrest, she gave a statement to an “ATF agent”5 and told him the “same story” about acquiring the firearm as she related at trial. She added that she never told defendant that she had purchased the gun.', 'Ms. Rodrigues was asked at trial to “explain” the fact that the Cox cable bill for her apartment was in defendant’s name. She responded as follows: “I owed them money and lost my debit card. I asked him if he could put it under his name for me.” She further testified, however, that defendant’s name was not on any other utility bills, the lease, or the mailbox; she added that he did not have clothing at her apartment. It was her testimony that any male clothing found at her apartment was due to the fact that she “ha[d] two brothers and they stayed in [her] spare bedroom sometimes.” 5', 'It is clear from a reading of the entire record that, when Ms. Rodrigues made reference to an “ATF agent,” she was speaking of an agent of the federal “Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms.”', '-8-', 'On cross-examination, Ms. Rodrigues testified that, before purchasing the gun in question, she had never handled a firearm. She also stated on cross-examination that the night when she bought the gun was the “only time [she] had ever seen [Mike]” at her place of employment and that she “didn’t talk to anybody” before she purchased the gun or have anyone accompany her when she went to purchase the gun. She also answered in the negative when asked if she had ever “talked to anybody about how to operate the gun.” She acknowledged on cross-examination that she told the ATF agent who interviewed her at the police station that defendant stayed at her apartment “a majority of the time.” She further testified on cross- examination that “[s]ometimes” she would leave defendant alone in the apartment.', 'Following the close of Ms. Rodrigues’s testimony, defendant renewed his motion for judgment of acquittal, and the trial justice denied that motion.', 'Subsequently, on February 18, 2014, defendant was convicted by the jury on the one count before it. On February 24, 2014, defendant moved for a new trial, and a hearing was held on that motion on February 28, 2014. At the conclusion of that hearing, the trial justice denied the motion. The defendant was thereafter sentenced to eight years to serve. His notice of appeal was filed prematurely on April 22, 2014.6', 'II', 'Analysis', 'A', 'Motion to Suppress', 'On appeal, defendant posits that the trial justice erred in refusing to suppress his statement to the police with respect to the gun.

Standard of Review', 'Prior to “a trial justice [admitting] a confession or a statement elicited during custodial interrogation, the state must first prove by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his [or her] constitutional rights expressed in Miranda v. Arizona.” State v. Jimenez, 33 A.3d 724, 733-34 (R.I. 2011) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Armour, 110 A.3d 1195, 1200 (R.I. 2015). We have stated that “a knowing and intelligent waiver may be executed when a defendant is apprised of the Miranda warnings, comprehends such warnings, and thereafter makes a voluntary statement.” Jimenez, 33 A.3d at 735.

Jimenez, 33 A.3d at 734 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Garcia, 140 A.3d at 140.', '2. Discussion', 'The trial justice issued a bench ruling at the close of the suppression hearing. He began his ruling by explaining the law to be applied and detailing portions of the relevant testimony from the suppression hearing. He found defendant’s testimony that he never heard his rights administered in the apartment to be “suspect because he said * * * that whenever he gets arrested, and it’s pretty clear[ he has] been arrested on several occasions, he gets so angry that he pays no attention to what the police tell him.” He further “credited” the testimony of Det. Bento and the testimony of Det. Hames that defendant was in fact informed of his rights at the apartment. Consequently, he found “by clear and convincing evidence [that] the rights were administered and announced by Detective Bento at the apartment before the defendant and Ms. Rodrigues were brought to the station.” The trial justice proceeded to find “by clear and convincing evidence[] and from the totality of the circumstances that [the] defendant understood the rights.” He noted that defendant had “completed and executed a rights [form] in the past.” After citing several cases to support his decision, the trial justice concluded as follows:', '“In all, I am well persuaded by clear and convincing', 'evidence and from the totality of the circumstances that the', '- 11 -', 'defendant was fully Mirandized, that he understood all of the', 'warnings and that the statement he made that guns on the street are', 'typically stolen was made with full awareness of his rights and that', 'his decision to make that comment was a voluntary one without', 'any overreaching by an officer at the police station, be it Detective', 'Hames who heard the comment or the booking officer to whom the', 'defendant said he disclosed it * * *.” Accordingly, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion to suppress.', 'We begin our review by stating that we can perceive nothing in the trial justice’s findings of fact that could be deemed clearly erroneous. See Jimenez, 33 A.3d at 732. The trial justice found Det. Bento and Det. Hames to be credible witnesses and defendant’s testimony to be “suspect.” Consequently, the trial justice found that defendant was administered his Miranda rights at the apartment, that he understood those rights, and that his statement was voluntary. As we have previously stated, “[w]e are mindful that the trier of fact, which in this case was the trial justice, is in the best position to assess the relative credibility of witnesses.” Bido, 941 A.2d at 836. As such, keeping in mind that the trial justice found that defendant was administered his Miranda rights, we next proceed to conduct our own “independent examination of the record” to determine if the statement at issue should have been suppressed because defendant did not validly waive his Miranda rights. Gonzalez, 136 A.3d at 1145.', 'It is clear in the instant case that defendant had previous experience with the criminal justice system and had been read his rights on at least one previous occasion; he was specifically confronted, on cross-examination, with a form containing Miranda rights that he had signed after a previous arrest.', 'See State v. Ferola, 518 A.2d 1339, 1346 (R.I. 1986) (stating that the defendant’s “prior involvement in the criminal justice system is telling evidence * * * that the constitutional warnings given him by the [police] were understood”) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, defendant stated at the suppression hearing that he had seen Miranda rights', '- 12 - being read on television. See State v. Crowhurst, 470 A.2d 1138, 1142 (R.I. 1984) (stating that, in considering whether an individual understands his rights, “[o]ne may find out about the Miranda rights through * * * watching one of the many detective shows appearing on television, or by personal experience through previous contacts either with the police or with the courts”) (internal quotation marks omitted). We further note that Det. Bento testified that Mr. Yon stated that he understood his rights after they were read to him at the apartment. The defendant further admitted on cross-examination that he could “repeat” his Miranda rights. As the trial justice also noted, defendant testified that he did not “pay attention to what the officers are saying” when he finds himself under arrest because he is “so mad.” Finally, with respect to voluntariness, Det. Hames testified that, when defendant made the statement at issue, he was in an interrogation room and Det. Hames asked him a single question about whether the gun was stolen; there was no meaningful evidence that defendant was the subject of any coercion or improper inducement. Garcia, 140 A.3d at 140. Accordingly, it is clear to this Court, upon considering the totality of the circumstances, that defendant’s waiver of his Miranda rights was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. See Jimenez, 33 A.3d at 733-34; Barros, 24 A.3d at 1180.', 'To the extent that defendant suggests on appeal that the police should have read his Miranda rights to him a second time at the police station, we see no merit in that argument. This Court has never articulated such a requirement; and we note that, in the instant case, the testimony reflects that only approximately a half hour elapsed between defendant being read his rights and his making the statement at issue. See State v. Beaulieu, 116 R.I. 575, 584, 359 A.2d 689, 693-94 (1976) (upholding a trial justice’s denial of a defendant’s motion to suppress when nine hours had elapsed between the Miranda warnings being given to the defendant and the', '- 13 - interrogation during which the defendant made the statements at issue).7 It is further the case that, to the extent defendant contends that he should have been given his Miranda rights in written form, we have likewise never imposed such a requirement. See State v. Wilding, 638 A.2d 519, 521 (R.I. 1994) (“There is no requirement that Miranda warnings be given in writing as a constitutional imperative.”).', 'As such, in our judgment, the trial justice did not err in denying defendant’s motion to suppress his statement with respect to the gun, which statement he made at the police station following his arrest.8', 'B', 'Failure to Submit Voluntariness to the Jury', 'The defendant contends on appeal that the trial justice erred in not submitting to the jury the issue of the voluntariness of his statement with respect to the gun. He avers that, in failing to do so, the trial justice violated the Humane Practice Rule,9 the United States Constitution, and the Rhode Island Constitution. 7', 'State v. Beaulieu, 116 R.I. 575, 359 A.2d 689 (1976), was overruled on other grounds by State v. Lamoureux, 623 A.2d 9, 14 (R.I. 1993). 8', 'We note that defendant makes an argument that the trial justice “constrained” his cross- examination of Det. Bento during the suppression hearing in violation of his “right to compulsory process.” However, we consider this contention to be unavailing. A review of the transcript of the suppression hearing indicates that the trial justice’s purported “constrain[ing]” was actually a reaction to defense counsel’s questions having strayed beyond the narrow scope of evidence that was relevant at the suppression hearing. Cf. State v. Manning, 973 A.2d 524, 531 (R.I. 2009) (stating, in the context of cross-examination at trial, that the “right may be constrained, however, within reasonable parameters of relevance in the exercise of the trial justice’s discretion”) (internal quotation marks omitted). 9', 'We have stated that “[t]he Humane Practice Rule requires that a trial justice in this jurisdiction, before allowing the admission of a defendant’s inculpatory statement or confession into evidence, must make a preliminary determination that the statement or confession was made voluntarily. * * * In further accordance with the Humane Practice Rule, if the trial justice is', '- 14 -', 'In addressing defendant’s contention on appeal, we turn to the “well-settled raise-or- waive rule” which “precludes us from considering at the appellate level issues not properly presented before the trial court.” State v. Merida, 960 A.2d 228, 236 (R.I. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Dennis, 29 A.3d 445, 449-50 (R.I. 2011). The raise- or-waive rule “imposes upon litigants a duty to raise all their claims for relief in the trial court and properly articulate them to a judge for a ruling.” D’Alessio v. State, 101 A.3d 1270, 1278 (R.I. 2014).', 'In our judgment, the raise-or-waive rule is dispositive of defendant’s contention before this Court that the trial justice erred in not submitting to the jury the voluntariness vel non of his statement with respect to the gun. The defendant failed to request a Humane Practice Rule instruction, nor did he object to the lack of a Humane Practice Rule instruction in the trial justice’s jury instructions. See State v. Mendez, 116 A.3d 228, 243 (R.I. 2015) (“With respect to objections to jury instructions in particular, this Court has consistently been exacting about applying the raise or waive rule.”) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also King v. Huntress, Inc., 94 A.3d 467, 483 (R.I. 2014). Moreover, defendant went so far as to specifically state to the prosecutor and the trial justice, with respect to the issue of voluntariness, that he was “not going to touch on that at all.” Indeed, upon being specifically asked by the trial justice if “there was going to be any suggestion or argument or evidence that [defendant] want[ed] to proffer to th[e] jury relative to [defendant] making a statement that he was not Mirandized and that the human[e] practice rule ought to be invoked,” defense counsel replied as follows: “Judge, I don’t intend to argue that.” No doubt due to the statements of defense counsel, no evidence was persuaded by clear and convincing evidence that the statement was voluntary, he or she then must, as an additional safeguard, give a specific instruction to the jury that it may consider the statement as substantive evidence only if it first finds that the statement was made voluntarily.” State v.

Moore, 154 A.3d 472, 480 (R.I. 2017) (cert. pending) (internal', '- 16 - quotation marks omitted). In conducting his or her analysis, the trial justice engages in “a three- step analytical process * * * whereby the trial justice must (1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” Id. at 480-81 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v.

See Heredia, 10 A.3d at 446. The defendant contends that Ms. Rodrigues’s testimony was not given “meaningful consideration” by the trial justice, pointing specifically to her testimony that the gun found in the apartment belonged to her. Notably, however, the trial justice in fact discussed Ms. Rodrigues’s testimony at length. With respect to that testimony, he detailed the following: “She admitted that she had absolutely no familiarity with firearms. She never fired any guns. She certainly never shot this one. She didn’t know how to take it apart, she didn’t even know where the safety catch on the firearm was.” Indeed, the trial justice found that “Ms. Rodrigues ultimately turned out to be the State’s best witness, so damaging was her testimony to the defendant’s interests on cross-examination.” While defendant may disagree with that conclusion, the “mere fact that [the] defendant disagrees with the trial justice’s conclusions about credibility is not a sufficient basis to warrant the granting of a motion for a new trial.” State v. Rivera, 987 A.2d 887, 903 (R.I. 2010); see also Muralles, 154 A.3d at 932 (“We apply * * * a deferential standard of review [to a trial justice’s credibility determinations] because a trial justice, being present during all phases of the trial, is in an especially good position to evaluate the facts and to judge the credibility of the witnesses.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'The trial justice additionally noted, in the second step of his analysis of defendant’s motion for a new trial, that the gun was kept “between the couch cushions” and stated: “Putting things between the cushions of a couch in no way diminishes one’s possession of them.” Moreover, as for defendant’s contention on appeal that a reasonable jury could not have found', '- 19 - that he was in constructive possession of the gun because the state did not provide fingerprints or DNA from the gun, the trial justice found that the fact that “no usable fingerprints were found on the gun, or the magazine, or the shell casings, the cartridge casings, [did] not diminish the State’s proof at all.”', 'Finally, the trial justice determined whether or not he would have reached a result different from that of the jury. See Moore, 154 A.3d at 480-81. He noted the following with respect to Ms. Rodrigues’s testimony:', '“She said that she never told the defendant that the gun was', 'in the apartment. Obviously the jury disbelieved that disclaimer.', 'It’s inconceivable to me that the defendant, under all the', 'circumstances, did not know the gun was there. More to the point,', 'any rational fact-finder would easily conclude that the defendant', 'not only knew it was there, but that he also, at the very least,', 'jointly possessed it with Ms. Rodrigues.', '“To be frank, the fact-finder could easily conclude that Ms.', 'Rodrigues had nothing to do with the gun and that it was really the', 'defendant’s weapon, not hers.” The trial justice concluded his decision by stating: “In all, including the fair inferences from the evidence, both direct and circumstantial, I think the jury was well-warranted in concluding that this defendant possessed the firearm.” Accordingly, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'In our judgment, the trial justice did not commit “clear error or * * * overlook[] or misconceive[] material and relevant evidence [relating] to a critical issue in the case” in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'Muralles, 154 A.3d at 932 (internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, our review of the record demonstrates ample evidence on the basis of which a jury could reasonably have concluded that defendant was in constructive possession of the gun.

The defendant, Kevin Corleto, appeals from an order of the Superior Court denying his motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds1 a criminal information charging him with breaking and entering a dwelling, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11- 8-2. Specifically, the defendant’s motion to dismiss was predicated on alleged prosecutorial goading that resulted in the declaration of a mistrial. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on April 5, 2017, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided.

Ms. Murphy testified that she then owned and had resided in a “one-family home” in Newport for the past seventy-three years. She proceeded to testify that, on what she characterized as the “unforgettable” day of September 22, 2012, at around 2:30 in the afternoon, she was working on her computer in the den, which is located in the back portion of her house and outside of which is a deck. She stated that, at some point during that afternoon, she “heard somebody climbing over the railing on the deck.” Ms. Murphy testified that she looked out and saw dark brown hair on a person’s head— which hair color “was about the same color” as that of her grandson; she added that, for that reason, she “assumed” that the person was her grandson. Ms. Murphy stated that she went to the back door “to give him the devil” for having climbed over the railing. She further testified that, without “look[ing] out the curtain,” she then unlocked and opened the door. She added that she noticed that “the screen door had already been opened” and that she saw defendant “crouched down.” She said that he suddenly “jumped into the foyer” of her home.

The defendant was additionally charged with one count of disorderly conduct while in the dwelling of Mr. Reilly, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-45-1, as to which defendant eventually entered a plea of nolo contendere.

Specifically, Ms. Murphy conceded that, in those two prior statements, she never mentioned: “the screen door” or that defendant was “crouched down” or that he had held “his hands out in close[d] fist[s].” Ms. Murphy explained to the cross-examiner that, at the time she wrote her first statement, which occurred on the day of the above-described incident, she was “very upset.”', 'Before the presentation of closing arguments, the trial justice, outside the presence of the jury, posed the following question to both the prosecutor and defense counsel: “Based upon their assessment of the evidence, are the parties at a different place than they were at the beginning of this trial, vis-à-vis a resolution, without having a jury verdict?” After the parties responded that their respective positions remained the same, the trial justice engaged in the following dialogue with both of them:', '“[THE COURT]: If my recollection is correct then, * * * the place', 'where the defendant was was a willingness to plea to an amended', '-3-', 'charge of trespassing, with a sentence, a recommendation for --', 'hopefully a recommendation from the State of a sentence of home', 'confinement for a time frame of 364 days.', '“[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That’s correct, your Honor.', '“[THE COURT]: * * * [T]hat was what the defendant sought * * *', 'before we commenced jury empanelment; am I correct?', '“[PROSECUTOR]: That is correct, your Honor.', '“[THE COURT]: But the State is still of the opinion that the', 'evidence offered is sufficient to allow this jury to convict the', 'defendant of the charge of breaking and entering?', '“[PROSECUTOR]: Yes, your Honor.”', 'On May 15, 2014, in the course of her closing argument to the jury, the prosecutor made the following comment: “There is no testimony, no evidence before us that explains why Mr. Corleto was climbing over a back deck railing, somebody’s back yard.” Defense counsel immediately objected and moved to pass the case.3 Counsel argued that the “comment * * * seem[s] to suggest that because Mr. Corleto did not testify, did not explain or justify why he leaped over the railing,” it constituted a “substantial abridgement of Mr. Corleto’s Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.”4 In response, the prosecutor argued “that the statement during the closing at issue was * * * relatively innocuous * * * [and was] not intended to suggest that there must be evidence * * * as to why Mr. Corleto was climbing over a railing.” The prosecutor added that her intention “was merely to point out that [defendant] was climbing 3', '“In Rhode Island, the terms ‘motion to pass the case’ and ‘motion for a mistrial’ are synonymous.” O’Connor, 936 A.2d at 218 n.2; see also State v.

Sometimes it happens.” In view of that remark, we could arguably decide this case on the basis of that concession. However, after due consideration, we deem it to be fairer and more appropriate to base our decision on the objective findings made by the seasoned trial justice who presided over this case.', '-4- over the railing in furtherance of going to the back door of Mrs. Murphy’s house.” And the prosecutor suggested that the statement at issue “could be cured with a cautionary instruction.”', 'After listening to argument from the parties, the trial justice preliminarily observed that the prosecutor’s comment during closing argument “was not directed specifically to the defendant’s failure to take the stand;” he nonetheless ruled that the comment at issue “indirectly address[ed] the defendant’s failure to take the witness stand.” He noted that, in the instant case, only Ms. Murphy had testified; and he added that, notably, her “testimony [had] not [been] attacked or impeached by the [d]efendant.” As such, the trial justice reasoned that “the only person who could refute the evidence would be Mr. Corleto.” Eventually, he determined that a curative instruction could not cure the “unintentional but unfortunate reference, obliquely, to the defendant’s failure to testify.” And the trial justice then granted defendant’s motion to pass the case.', 'Over a month later, on June 20, 2014, defendant filed a motion to dismiss the information on grounds of double jeopardy. A hearing on that motion was held on July 16, 2014, at which the same trial justice reviewed the record and heard arguments from defense counsel and the prosecutor. Then, in ruling on defendant’s motion, the trial justice first recalled his earlier observation that the prosecutor’s comment was “unintentional but unfortunate.” He also opined that “[t]he misconduct * * * did not occur when the case was unraveling.” The trial justice then explained that his inquiry after trial and before closing arguments as to the parties’ “respective positions” had not been “a suggestion” or “a hint,” but rather had been “an inquiry as to whether or not the parties would be prepared or willing to resolve the matter without closing argument, without instructions and without jury deliberations.” In addition, the trial justice expressly stated his disagreement with defense counsel’s assertion that the state believed that its case had been', '-5- unraveling; he reasoned that, if that had been true, “the [s]tate would have jumped at the opportunity to amend the charge to a trespass” and “defendant would have been less likely * * * to have stated his willingness to accept an amendment” to the charge. He also found that there was no evidence demonstrating that, taking into account the extent of the experience of the prosecutor, “she knew or should have known better that she was not permitted to make” such a comment; he found “objectively” that the prosecutor’s experience had been “minimal.” Ultimately, the trial justice ruled “as a matter of fact or a matter of law that the State’s actions in making that unfortunate reference to there being no evidence was * * * not intended to goad the defendant into seeking a mistrial;” and he denied defendant’s motion to dismiss. A timely notice of appeal ensued.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'As this Court has stated on numerous occasions, “where a defendant has moved for a mistrial and asserts on appeal that double jeopardy bars his retrial because of prosecutorial goading, we defer to the trial court’s findings of fact.” State v. O’Connor, 936 A.2d 216, 220 (R.I. 2007); see State v. Hull, 754 A.2d 84, 87 (R.I. 2000); see also State v. Diaz, 521 A.2d 129, 133 (R.I. 1987); State v. Gordon, 508 A.2d 1339, 1346 (R.I. 1986). We note that “[a] trial court’s finding as to ‘whether prosecutorial misconduct was intended to provoke the defendant into seeking a mistrial is a factual question that is appropriately decided by the trial court.’” O’Connor, 936 A.2d at 220 (quoting Diaz, 521 A.2d at 133); see also Oregon v. Kennedy, 456 U.S. 667, 675 (1982). It follows that, “[o]n appeal, we will not disturb the trial [justice]’s finding on that factual issue if it is supported by competent evidence.” State v.

In particular, he avers that the state’s “egregious behavior” goaded him into requesting a mistrial, thereby “implicat[ing] the Double Jeopardy clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution[] as well as Article I § 7 of the Rhode Island Constitution.” In stark contrast, the state argues that the trial justice’s decision denying defendant’s motion to dismiss was “supported by competent evidence [in the record] and should be affirmed.”', 'Ordinarily, when a mistrial has been granted at a defendant’s behest, the prohibitions on double jeopardy contained in the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions do not preclude the retrial of that defendant’s criminal case. Rolle, 84 A.3d at 1154; State v. Casas, 792 A.2d 737, 739 (R.I. 2002). However, there is a narrow exception for those instances “[w]here a prosecutor has engaged in extreme misconduct intended to provoke the defendant into moving to pass the case.” Rolle, 84 A.3d at 1155; see Casas, 792 A.2d at 739; State v. Beltre, 764 A.2d 190, 191 (R.I. 2000) (mem.); State v. McIntyre, 671 A.2d 806, 807 (R.I. 1996). This Court has continued to “steadfastly adhere[] to the rule announced in Oregon v. Kennedy, 456 U.S. 667, 676, * * * (1982), that a second trial is not forbidden unless the prosecutor’s conduct was specifically intended to goad the defendant into moving for a mistrial.” Rolle, 84 A.3d at 1155; see McIntyre, 671 A.2d at 807.', 'It is well settled that “[t]o infer the existence or nonexistence of intentional goading,” the trial justice must scrutinize “the objective facts and circumstances surrounding the prosecutor’s misconduct.” Rolle, 84 A.3d at 1155. The pertinent factors in that context “include the timing', '-7- of the misconduct, the experience of the prosecutor, and whether there was a legitimate reason for the misconduct.” Id.; see O’Connor, 936 A.2d at 222-23 n.6.; Casas, 792 A.2d at 740; McIntyre, 671 A.2d at 807. Especially relevant to the instant case is the principle that mere error on the part of the prosecutor will not preclude retrial, even if “it may incite a mistrial.” O’Connor, 936 A.2d at 222. We remain cognizant in this context of the importance of striking “a careful balance between the right of a defendant to obtain a completion of his trial by the first tribunal assembled to pass in judgment upon him and the societal interest in apprehending and punishing those who are guilty of serious crimes.” Diaz, 521 A.2d at 133; see also Rolle, 84 A.3d at 1155.', 'In the case at bar, it is our opinion that the trial justice did not err in determining that the prosecutor did not goad defendant into moving for a mistrial. When the trial justice declared the mistrial, he tersely expressed his view that the prosecutor’s comment during closing argument was an “unintentional but unfortunate reference, obliquely, to the defendant’s failure to testify.” It is noteworthy that he repeated that same observation several weeks later at the hearing on defendant’s motion to dismiss the information on double jeopardy grounds. In denying that motion, the trial justice set forth several findings, of which the following are particularly relevant to the issue raised on appeal: the prosecutor’s “misconduct * * * did not occur when the case was unraveling;” the experience of the prosecutor was “minimal;” and, notably, there was “no evidence” in the record demonstrating that the prosecutor’s comment during closing argument was intended “to goad defendant into seeking a mistrial.” It is clear to us that the trial justice’s findings were amply supported by competent evidence. The trial justice considered all of the arguments presented by the parties and “performed a balanced and conscientious analysis of the objective facts and circumstances in” the case before him. Rolle, 84 A.3d at 1156. The record', '-8- supports the view that the prosecutor’s comment during closing argument was likely “the result of a mistake”—and it must be borne in mind that “a prosecutorial mistake does not, in and of itself, constitute goading.” O’Connor, 936 A.2d at 223. And, it should also be recalled that, with respect to the issue of intentional goading vel non, “[t]his Court gives deference to the trial court’s findings on this issue; the question of whether or not prosecutorial misconduct was intended to provoke a defendant into moving for a mistrial is a factual question for the trial court.” Id.; see also Rolle, 84 A.3d at 1154.', 'After thoroughly reviewing the entire record, we perceive no basis for concluding that the trial justice erred in determining that the prosecutor did not intentionally goad the defendant into moving for a mistrial. “Because we, like the Superior Court [in the instant case], perceive no evidence of intent on behalf of the prosecutor to goad [the defendant] into moving for a mistrial, we affirm the order denying [his] motion to dismiss.” O’Connor, 936 A.2d at 223.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, the defendant’s appeal is denied and dismissed.

This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on March 30, 2017, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After carefully considering the record and the parties’ written and oral submissions, we conclude that cause has not been shown and shall proceed to decide the appeal without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In January 2004, Gomes was indicted by a grand jury as follows: count 1, assault in a dwelling house with intent to murder while armed with a dangerous weapon; count two, assault with a dangerous weapon, to wit, a pistol; count 3, use and discharge of a firearm causing permanent incapacity while committing a crime of violence; and count 4, carrying a pistol on or', '-1- about his person without a license. In September of that year, he disposed of the charges against him by pleading nolo contendere to counts 1 and 4. In return, the state dismissed counts 2 and 3 in accordance with Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. On count 1, Gomes was sentenced to thirty years at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI), twelve years to serve and eighteen years suspended, with eighteen years’ probation.', 'On count 4, he was sentenced to ten years at the ACI, suspended, with ten years’ probation to run concurrently with count 1.', 'According to Gomes, he was released from the ACI on parole on July 1, 2009. In March 2013, while he remained on parole and after an incident with his ex-girlfriend, he was arrested and charged with domestic assault 1 and failure to relinquish a telephone.', 'Unfortunately for Gomes, that was neither his first nor his only scrape with the law during his parole; an incident that had occurred in February 2013, a few weeks before the March incident, caused an arrest warrant to be issued against him. This incident resulted in a new charge of breaking and entering. His ex-girlfriend, the mother of his son, was the complaining witness in both complaints.', 'Probation Violation Hearing', 'Based upon the two separate incidents involving his ex-girlfriend, the state filed a notice of violation against Gomes pursuant to Rule 32(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.', 'A hearing on the violation was held on May 23, 2013, in which Gomes was represented by private counsel. 2 It appears from the record that Gomes was under the impression that the complaining witness, his ex-girlfriend, would not testify against him at the violation 1', 'Gomes was represented by a public defender on the assault charge. That charge was dismissed on April 24, 2013, when the complaining witness failed to appear for trial. 2', 'Gomes now contends that this privately retained attorney was ineffective.', '-2- hearing because she had not appeared for trial on the simple assault charge. To his dismay, however, and to Gomes’s visible distress, she did appear and she was on the witness stand ready to testify. Before the state began its direct examination of the witness, as a result of Gomes’s emotional state, the state declared, “Your Honor, maybe the defendant needs a minute. I think he needs a minute. Do you think maybe he should be brought in the back?” In response, the hearing justice instructed Gomes to “control [him]self.”', 'After this brief interruption, the witness’s testimony proceeded. However, as soon as the witness began reading from her prior recorded handwritten statement describing the incident, Gomes’s attorney asked for a sidebar conference. Following the sidebar conference, the hearing justice asked the witness to step down because he was unsure whether the hearing would continue or not. Gomes’s attorney then asked if he could “have one moment with [Gomes] just to explain[.]” Shortly thereafter, Gomes’s attorney articulated that he had “informed [his] client that he ha[d] a right to a violation hearing[, and that] [a]t that hearing, the judge of this court would have to be reasonably satisfied that he did not keep the peace or be of good behavior while he was out.” Gomes’s attorney then indicated that Gomes “wishe[d] to forego that hearing and would like to admit violation.” Next, the hearing justice asked Gomes to come forward and the following colloquy ensued:', '“THE COURT: * * * Mr. Gomes, did you hear what your', 'lawyer just told me?', '“THE DEFENDANT: Yes.', '“THE COURT: And is it true, sir, that you are prepared to', 'admit to me that you violated the terms and conditions of your', 'probation --', '“THE DEFENDANT: Yes.', '“THE COURT: -- knowing, sir, that you have a right to a', 'hearing before me where the State would be required to prove to', 'my reasonable satisfaction that you did not keep the peace and be', 'of good behavior?', '“THE DEFENDANT: Yes.', '-3-', '“THE COURT: And at that hearing, Mr. Gomes, you', 'would have a right to confront and cross-examine the State’s', 'witnesses against you and to present evidence on your own behalf', 'if you chose to do so?', '“THE DEFENDANT: Yes.', '“THE COURT: And you would have a further right to', 'appeal any adverse findings to our Rhode Island Supreme Court.

In that application, he alleged, among other things, that he had been denied the effective assistance of counsel at the violation hearing and that he did not knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily admit a violation of probation. 3 A hearing on his postconviction relief application was held in August 2014.', 'Postconviction Relief Hearing', 'At the postconviction-relief hearing, Gomes testified that, after he engaged his attorney, he met with him on three occasions. 4 While they were discussing the breaking and entering charge, Gomes said that he informed his attorney that the residence on file with the parole board 3', 'The court first appointed a public defender to represent Gomes on his application for postconviction relief; however, a private attorney was subsequently appointed. This second court-appointed lawyer then filed a motion to withdraw in accordance with this Court’s holding in Shatney v. State, 755 A.2d 130 (R.I. 2000), opining that Gomes’s application for postconviction relief was without merit. The motion to withdraw was granted and a third attorney was appointed to represent Gomes. 4', 'The meetings occurred on April 30, 2013, May 7, 2013, and May 14, 2013.', '-4- as his place of abode was the same place at which the incident leading to his arrest had occurred. Gomes maintained that, if his attorney spoke to the parole board and the landlord of the property, it “would show [his] innocence, that [he] didn’t do the breaking and entering on [his] own house” because the landlord had given him permission to live there by including his name on the lease. He also relayed to his attorney that he did not believe that his ex-girlfriend would appear at the violation hearing and he asked the attorney to contact her. 5 Gomes said that, at subsequent meetings, his attorney told him that “he was playing phone tag with” his ex-girlfriend. Gomes also said that his attorney informed him that he had not spoken to any of the other witnesses that Gomes had asked him to contact.', 'When Gomes’s attorney testified at the postconviction-relief hearing, he admitted that he had not reached out to the witnesses to whom Gomes had directed him. However, he maintained that he believed that Gomes had “bigger issues” than whether or not he lived at the house where the incident took place and that “[t]hat was not going to make or break [his] case.” His attorney testified that there were other “witnesses that were going to testify, if believed, per the police report, that [Gomes] assaulted [his ex-girlfriend] not just on the B and E date but on the simple assault date. Him [sic] living in that house had no bearing, in [the attorney’s] opinion, on that case.”', 'Gomes further testified at the postconviction-relief hearing that his attorney had not communicated any offers to him that might resolve the probation violation. According to Gomes’s attorney, however, both a twelve-year offer to “wrap” 6 and the nine-year offer in return 5', 'Gomes testified at the postconviction-relief hearing that he wanted to proceed with a violation hearing because he did not think his ex-girlfriend would show up.

He first testified that he made Gomes aware of those offers on May 14, 7 but when asked later in his testimony, he acknowledged that he did not remember when he communicated the offer to Gomes. He then conceded that he communicated the offer to Gomes in the cellblock on the day of the violation hearing.', 'Gomes testified that, by the time he arrived at the cellblock on the day of his violation hearing, he did not know whether his attorney had spoken to any of the three witnesses he had asked him to contact. He also testified that, before the violation hearing began, his attorney visited him in the cellblock and informed him that his ex-girlfriend had indeed appeared for the hearing. Gomes testified that it was at that time that he asked his attorney to “try to get [him] a deal.” However, according to Gomes, his attorney told him, “We’re going to play like we’re doing the violation hearing. When [the ex-girlfriend] starts to testify, I’m going to stop the hearing.”', 'According to Gomes, he “lost it” as he entered the courtroom; he testified that he had an “emotional breakdown, a panic attack” and that he began to sob. He maintained that he was distraught because he was “under intense pressure” and he knew that his attorney had not done a proper investigation before the violation hearing. When asked if he was thinking clearly at that point, he responded that he was not, due to his “emotional state.”', 'Gomes also testified that, shortly after his ex-girlfriend commenced her testimony, his attorney stopped the hearing and asked for a sidebar conference with the hearing justice. 8 Gomes testified that, after the sidebar conference, his attorney approached him and told him to 7', 'Although he said he could not be certain, Gomes’s attorney testified that he “definitely would have told [Gomes about the offer] at the prison because [he] saw him after [the] offer was made.” 8', 'It is noteworthy that Gomes’s attorney testified that it was Gomes’s decision to stop the hearing.', '-6- take the nine year offer. This, according to Gomes, was the first time during the entire pendency of his violation hearing that any offer had been conveyed to him.', 'After hearing testimony and the arguments of the parties, the hearing justice issued a bench decision. She found that Gomes was generally credible on many points and that his attorney was “credible enough.” Notwithstanding such credibility determinations, the hearing justice, assuming the inadequacy of the attorney’s performance, remained unpersuaded that Gomes had suffered any prejudice, thereby not satisfying the second prong of the test annunciated in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). 9', 'The hearing justice concluded that she was not convinced that Gomes would have prevailed at the violation hearing or that he would have obtained a materially different outcome had he continued with the hearing, even if represented by different counsel. Rather, she found that there was ample evidence to support a finding of violation. She articulated that both Gomes’s ex-girlfriend and her neighbor were present and prepared to testify at the hearing. The hearing justice further determined that, even assuming his ex-girlfriend and the other witnesses were found to be not credible or had been successfully impeached, she easily could have been reasonably satisfied that Gomes had failed to keep the peace and be of good behavior. Significantly, Gomes did not deny that he broke down the door to the residence and he admitted to confiscating his ex-girlfriend’s cell phone during one of their arguments. The hearing justice was also not persuaded that Gomes would have done any better than the nine-year incarceration disposition that his attorney was able to negotiate on his behalf. 9', 'In order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, an applicant must prove, first, that counsel’s performance was deficient and, second, that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense so as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial.', '-7-', 'With respect to Gomes’s contentions that his attorney failed to contact the landlord and the parole board or to obtain evidence confirming his legal residence at the ex-girlfriend’s apartment, the hearing justice found it to be of no assistance to Gomes. She indicated that, even though he could not have been convicted of breaking and entering into his own home, there was, nevertheless, evidence that he had assaulted his ex-girlfriend. Furthermore, she found that it was of no assistance to Gomes that his attorney may have failed to earlier communicate the offer of nine years to him, because he ultimately agreed to and received that sentence, and, therefore, that he had not suffered any prejudice arising from any alleged failure to communicate that offer to him.', 'Additionally, the hearing justice analyzed Gomes’s claim that the violation hearing justice had violated Rule 11 10 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. 11', 'The postconviction-relief hearing justice reasoned that the violation hearing justice made appropriate inquiry as soon as he was informed by defense counsel that Gomes had made a decision to admit to the violation. The violation hearing justice brought Gomes forward so that he could observe him more closely and he asked him direct and clear questions. Gomes was able to discuss the plea with his attorney and he appeared to be calm while answering all of the violation hearing 10', 'Rule 11 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure provides, in pertinent part, that:', '“The court * * * shall not accept [a plea of guilty] or a plea of nolo', 'contendere without first addressing the defendant personally and', 'determining that the plea is made voluntarily with understanding of', 'the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea. * * *', 'The court shall not enter a judgment upon a plea of guilty or nolo', 'contendere unless it is satisfied that there is a factual basis for the', 'plea.” 11', 'The state’s Rule 12A statement indicates that the Superior Court incorrectly analyzed this claim pursuant to Rule 11. However, the state points out that Gomes, on appeal, “appears to properly recognize that his probation-violation admission is unassailable so long as it was ‘made voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently.’”', '-8- justice’s questions.', 'Finally, the postconviction-relief hearing justice concluded that “[t]he colloquy between the two g[ave] no indication that Mr. Gomes, despite a previous display of emotion, did not understand what he was doing or did not mean what he said when he responded to the Magistrate’s questions.” After the hearing justice denied his application for postconviction relief, Gomes timely appealed to this Court.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'Under Rhode Island law, postconviction relief is set forth in G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-1(a)(1).

State, 141 A.3d 644, 654 (R.I. 2016).', 'Under this framework, an applicant for postconviction relief “must demonstrate both that ‘counsel’s performance was deficient in that it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness’ and that ‘such deficient performance was so prejudicial to the defense and the errors were so serious as to amount to a deprivation of the applicant’s right to a fair trial.’” Perkins, 78 A.3d at 767 (quoting Hazard v. State, 64 A.3d 749, 756 (R.I. 2013)).', 'When addressing the performance prong, “[c]ourts evaluate counsel’s performance ‘in a highly deferential manner,’ * * * employing ‘a strong presumption that counsel’s conduct falls within the permissible range of assistance[.]’” Reyes, 141 A.3d at 654-55 (quoting Bido v. State, 56 A.3d 104, 111 (R.I. 2012)). “To satisfy the prejudice prong, ‘[t]he [applicant] must show that', '- 10 - there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.’” Id. at 655 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694).', 'Assuming without deciding that Gomes has met the performance prong of the Strickland test, we will focus our analysis, as did the hearing justice, on the prejudice prong. Gomes argues that “[t]here is no question that if [his attorney] had investigated and confirmed that * * * Gomes had a valid defense to the breaking and entering charge, [he] would not have ever been faced with that many years to serve.”', 'In his Rule 12A statement, Gomes cites to State v. Pires, 525 A.2d 1313, 1314 (R.I. 1987), for the proposition that “[w]hile judges at violation hearings are ‘guided principally by the first offense,’ this Court has ‘never held that the trial justice must completely ignore the nature of the second offense when imposing a sentence’ for a violation.”', 'Although defendant has accurately quoted Pires, it should be noted that this Court in Pires vacated the sentence and held that the trial justice had overlooked this Court’s holding in State v. Fortes, 114 R.I. 161, 174, 330 A.2d 404, 411-12 (1975), in which we said:', '“[the violation] hearing was not held for the purpose of punishing', '[the] defendant for the new offense. Although the latter is the', 'precipitating cause for the revocation hearing, it should play no', 'part in determining the extent of the penalty to be imposed on the', 'charge on which sentence had formerly been deferred. Punishment', 'for the new offense must await the disposition of the case in which', 'the new offense is charged.” Based on that reasoning, we concluded in Pires that the trial justice erred when he imposed the maximum sentence on the original charge specifically because the second offense was so serious. Pires, 525 A.2d at 1314. But here, the violation hearing justice did not impose a harsher sentence on the original charge because the new charge of breaking and entering was so serious;', '- 11 - rather, the nature of the original conviction itself was very serious in that it involved a violent act while applicant was armed with a firearm.', 'Furthermore, the standard at a probation violation hearing “is whether or not the defendant has breached a condition of his or her probation by failing to keep the peace or remain on good behavior.” State v. Beaudoin, 137 A.3d 726, 731 (R.I. 2016) (quoting State v. Prout, 116 A.3d 196, 202 (R.I. 2015)). Consequently, “the state must only show that ‘reasonably satisfactory evidence supports a finding that the defendant has violated his or her probation.’” Gilbert, 983 A.2d at 29 (quoting State v. Tetreault, 973 A.2d 489, 491-92 (R.I. 2009)). 12 “[T]he reasonably satisfied standard should not be applied to the narrow question of [the] defendant’s guilt with regard to the new charges but rather, the standard should be applied to whether [the] defendant maintained the conditions of his probation.” State v. Vashey, 823 A.2d 1151, 1156 (R.I. 2003) (quoting State v. Waite, 813 A.2d 982, 985 (R.I. 2003)).', 'The postconviction-relief hearing justice appropriately determined that any failure by Gomes’s attorney to further investigate the merits of the breaking and entering charge had no bearing on the outcome of the violation case because there was ample evidence in the record for the hearing justice to satisfy the low burden of proof at a violation hearing and find Gomes to be in violation of the terms and conditions of his probation. Gomes’s ex-girlfriend and her neighbor were present at the violation hearing and prepared to testify. Moreover, Gomes did not deny that he broke down the door to his ex-girlfriend’s residence. Gomes also admitted to taking her cell phone during one of their arguments. Because of this evidence, the postconviction-relief hearing justice determined that Gomes was unable to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that a 12', 'The state’s burden articulated in Rule 32(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure was amended to a fair preponderance of the evidence on June 21, 2016. However, applying the new standard would not change our holding in this case.', '- 12 - competent attorney would have been successful at the violation hearing and that, had Gomes been competently represented, the violation hearing justice would not have found him to be a violator. We agree with her determination.', 'Significantly, the postconviction-relief hearing justice determined that it was of no assistance to Gomes that his attorney may have failed to communicate the offer of nine years to him because he ultimately agreed to and received that shorter sentence. He was, after all, in jeopardy of having the entire eighteen years of his original sentence imposed.', 'We have previously held that “when counsel has secured a shorter sentence than what the defendant could have received had he gone to trial, the defendant has an almost insurmountable burden to establish prejudice.” Neufville v. State, 13 A.3d 607, 614 (R.I. 2011) (citing Rodrigues v. State, 985 A.2d 311, 317 (R.I. 2009)). Because he has failed to meet that burden, it is our opinion that Gomes has not shown that there is a reasonable probability that, but for any deficient performance on the part of his attorney, the result of the violation hearing would have been different.', 'Therefore, any alleged deficient performance by Gomes’s attorney was not so prejudicial as to amount to a deprivation of Gomes’s right to a fair trial.', 'Knowing and Voluntary Nature of Admission', '“Although a defendant in the probation violation context is not entitled to the full panoply of due process rights afforded to [the] defendants in criminal proceedings, he or she is nonetheless entitled to ‘minimum due process protections[,]’ [one of which is] ‘the opportunity to be heard * * *.’” State v. Brown, 140 A.3d 768, 783 (R.I. 2016) (quoting State v. Bernard, 925 A.2d 936, 938 (R.I. 2007)). Nevertheless, a defendant may waive his right to a probation violation hearing. See 2 Neil P. Cohen, The Law of Probation and Parole § 25.11 at 25-13 (West Group 2nd ed. 1999). “Because of the significance of this waiver, the hearing [justice] should', '- 13 - ensure that it is made knowingly and intelligently, without coercion.” Id. “[A] waiver will be deemed knowing, intelligent, and voluntary when the record demonstrates that the parolee’s rights concerning the hearing and the effect of his waiver were explained to him.” 2 Neil P. Cohen, § 25.11 at 125-26 (Supp. 2016); see also United States v. Correa-Torres, 326 F.3d 18, 23 (1st Cir. 2003) (“[N]otwithstanding the requirement that waivers of procedural rights with respect to revocation hearings must be knowing and voluntary, such waivers need not be accompanied either by any magic words or by a formal colloquy of the depth and intensity required under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11[.]”).', 'Our review of the record before us reveals that the postconviction-relief hearing justice found that, at the violation hearing, the Superior Court engaged in an appropriate colloquy with Gomes before the violation hearing justice determined that he had violated his probation. After allowing Gomes and his attorney to discuss the plea, the violation hearing justice asked Gomes to approach the bench so that he could observe him and he asked him several questions, the answers to which were direct and clear. Only after Gomes responded affirmatively to all the hearing justice’s questions, including whether he was admitting to violation “freely and voluntarily,” was the violation hearing justice satisfied that Gomes was waiving his right to a hearing voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently.', 'The postconviction-relief hearing justice appropriately concluded that “[t]he colloquy between the two g[ave] no indication that Mr. Gomes, despite a previous display of emotion, did not understand what he was doing or did not mean what he said when he responded to the Magistrate’s questions.” Although it is clear that Gomes was distraught at the beginning of the violation hearing, we agree with the postconviction-relief hearing justice that there is no evidence, other than Gomes’s own assertions, that he was emotional to an extent that rendered his understanding of an admission a', '- 14 - nullity. Indeed, the record clearly demonstrates that Gomes’s rights concerning the hearing and the effect of his waiver were adequately explained to him and his admission was made knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

At the outset, we note that the parties in the instant case were previously before this Court in Tri-Town Construction Company, Inc. v. Commerce Park Associates 12, LLC, 139 A.3d 467 (R.I. 2016) (Tri-Town I). In our first chapter of Tri- Town, we affirmed a judgment of the Superior Court in favor of the plaintiff, Tri-Town Construction Company, Inc. (Tri-Town or the Judgment Creditor), against the defendants, Commerce Park Associates 12, LLC and Nicholas E. Cambio (the Judgment Debtors), in the amount of $3,911,894.95 (plus post-judgment interest) on claims for breach of a promissory note and breach of a guaranty of that note.1 Id. at 473.', 'Before us today, in the second chapter of Tri-Town, solely Mr. Cambio appeals from a particular order of the Superior Court, which reads in pertinent part as follows: 1', 'It bears mentioning that we also “vacate[d] the award of attorney’s fees and remand[ed] th[e] case to the Superior Court for it to consider the testimony or affidavit of an independent attorney regarding the reasonableness and necessity of Tri-Town’s fees.” Tri-Town Construction Company v.

The remedy provided by this section shall', 'be cumulative and shall not supersede any existing remedy.”', '-2-', 'This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties’ arguments (both written and oral), we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this appeal may be decided at this time. And, relying solely on the ground that the issue raised on appeal is not properly before us due to our raise-or-waive rule, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On October 9, 2015, Tri-Town filed a “Creditor’s Equitable Action” pursuant to § 9-28-1, seeking a judgment that authorized attachment of the Judgment Debtors’ “Estate, including but not limited to all bank accounts, automobiles, fixed assets and tangible assets, real estate holdings * * *, choses in action, and all other assets of the Judgment Debtor forthwith” as well as “any other further just relief as this [c]ourt deems proper.” Then, approximately five days later, Tri-Town filed a motion entitled, “Motion to Attach the Chose in Action of the Judgment Debtors.” In that motion, Tri-Town requested the following relief:', '“1. Granting the Judgment Creditor’s Motion to Attach the Chose', 'in Action of the Judgment Debtors; 2. Authorize the Judgment', 'Creditor to reach and apply and subject to the payment as', 'satisfaction of its Judgment any choses in action of the Judgment', 'Debtors; 3.

On that same date, Commerce Park Associates 12, LLC (CPA 12) was served with the same papers, said service being made upon a person employed by the corporation—viz., the attorney of CPA 12.', 'Some two weeks later, on October 28, 2015, the Judgment Debtors jointly answered and filed an objection entitled, “Defendants Commerce Park Associates 12, LLC and Nicholas E. Cambio’s Objection to Motion to Attach Chose in Action.” In that objection, they asserted that “neither defendant ha[d] been served with a summons for th[e] new action” and that “no stipulation accepting service ha[d] been executed.” In addition, the Judgment Debtors argued that “Tri-Town’s motion violate[d] the stay issued in the receivership cases,” contending that another justice of the Superior Court had “asserted ‘in rem’ jurisdiction over the ‘chose in action’ that Tri-Town * * * s[ought] to attach.” The following day (October 29), Tri-Town filed a reply entitled “Creditor’s Reply to the Debtors’ Objection to the Creditor’s Motion to Attach the Chose in Action of the Debtors,” which included two exhibits that indicated valid proof of service. Moreover, Tri-Town contended that its “motion to attach the chose in action of the judgment debtors d[id] not violate the stay issued in the receivership cases.” It is noteworthy that Tri- Town explained in its reply papers that “[t]he instant motion ha[d] been filed solely for the purpose of allowing the Judgment Creditor to exercise its rights under Rhode Island General Law', '-4- § 9-28-1, that being the ability to step in the shoes of the Judgment Debtors within the Receivership matter and receive any payments and distributions derived therein.” (Emphasis added.)', 'The record reflects that, at a hearing on October 30, 2015, it was made clear that Tri- Town sought to “not only attach, but be able to step into the shoes of Mr. Cambio in * * * [the receivership] proceedings to protect and ensure that payments that would be due to Mr. Cambio, come to [Tri-Town] as the judgment creditor.” Upon being questioned by the hearing justice about the procedure set forth in § 9-28-1, counsel for Tri-Town initially read the text of that statute into the record verbatim; thereafter, he and the hearing justice engaged in the following dialogue about the issue now on appeal:', '“[THE COURT]: And is assignment of essentially a judgment', 'debtor’s claim in a different proceeding considered a chose in', 'action?', '“[COUNSEL]: Yes, it is, your Honor. So it’s just the same as if', 'you had a -- let’s say you had a breach of contract action for a', 'failure to pay a promissory note, that is essentially almost', 'commercial paper and you could assign that action to me and I', 'could step into your shoes and prosecute that action for my benefit.', '“[THE COURT]: So would you actually enter an appearance on', 'behalf of Tri-Town in the litigation in which Mr. Cambio is the', 'plaintiff?', '“[COUNSEL]: I would, your honor.”', 'At no point during the above-quoted dialogue did counsel for Mr. Cambio voice any objection. In fact, at a later juncture, counsel stated that it was his “understanding” that Tri- Town was “attempting * * * to step into the shoes of the claims that were filed in [the] receivership” cases. In an effort to dispel any possible ambiguity, the hearing justice sought clarification from counsel for Mr. Cambio: “Now, I’m not sure what your objection is * * * to allowing [Tri-Town] to proceed under the statute with the charging order and to pursue these claims in Cambio’s shoes.” In response, counsel for Mr. Cambio articulated two arguments: (1)', '-5- that the stay entered in the receivership cases precluded Tri-Town’s motion because another justice of the Superior Court had already “exercised in rem jurisdiction over the res that Tri- Town * * * wants to take over;” and (2) that Tri-Town’s motion was premature because, at that point in time, the judgment in Tri-Town I was pending on appeal before this Court. At the conclusion of the hearing, after having considered the record and the arguments of counsel, the hearing justice granted the relief sought by Tri-Town; and, on November 3, 2015, he entered the following order:', '“1.

In stark contrast, counsel for Mr. Cambio opted not to voice his objection at that juncture or otherwise articulate an argument on that particular issue. A careful review of the record indicates that the parties appeared to be in agreement that § 9-28-1 authorized the relief sought by Tri-Town.4 It follows that Mr. Cambio thereby waived his opportunity to challenge before us the Superior Court’s authority under § 9-28-1 to assign his choses in action to Tri-Town. In our view, this case falls within the ambit of the raise-or-waive rule; and we perceive no exceptional circumstances indicating that said rule should not apply in this instance. 4', 'Although we acknowledge that, at a hearing on December 4, 2015, counsel for Mr. Cambio eventually expressed disagreement with Tri-Town’s interpretation of § 9-28-1, that belated expression of disagreement was not sufficiently timely to render our raise-or-waive rule inapplicable.', '-7-', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'Accordingly, we affirm the order of the Superior Court because the issue raised on appeal has effectively been waived.5 The record may be returned to that tribunal.', 'Justice Indeglia did not participate. 5', 'We pause to note that we expressly refrain from passing on the legal correctness of the challenged order of the Superior Court.', '-8- STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND', 'PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS', 'SUPREME COURT – CLERK’S OFFICE', 'OPINION COVER SHEET', 'Tri-Town Construction Company, Inc. v.

The Ballards timely appealed to this Court, challenging the Superior Court’s decision granting summary judgment to SVF.', 'This matter came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on January 25, 2017.

The Carriage House was built concurrently with the Manor House and is located nearby “in a swale between the Manor House and * * * the ‘Swiss Village[.]’”', 'The partition left Hamilton, SVF’s predecessor, with the Swiss Village portion of the estate, and the Ballards with the Manor House and Carriage House section (the “Manor House Property”). Carol and A. L. Ballard each took an undivided 50 percent interest in the property they received from the partition. In addition to her undivided 50 percent interest in the Manor House Property, Carol Ballard owned, in her own name, an undeveloped tract of land known as “Lot 20” that abutted the western edge of the Swiss Village property. Carol Ballard purchased Lot No. 20 in 1995, before the Ballards had acquired any ownership interest in the Edgehill property. After the partition went into effect, there were three tracts of land relevant to this case. To the west lay Carol Ballard’s solely owned Lot No. 20. To the east was the Manor House Property, of which Carol and A. L. Ballard each owned an undivided 50 percent interest. And lying directly between Lot No. 20 and the Manor House Property, and abutting both properties, was the Swiss Village land, owned by the Dorrance H. Hamilton Trust.', 'As a result of the partition, the Ballards were left without any interior access between the Manor House Property and Lot No. 20. Accordingly, they sought an easement to connect their two properties so that they could transport mowing equipment from the Manor House Property to Lot No. 20 without having to use public roads, ostensibly for safety reasons. In his supplemental report and recommendation, the court-appointed commissioner assigned to oversee the partition', '-3- recommended that the Ballards be granted their requested easement. The Superior Court, in its order mandating the partition, awarded the Ballards “an easement providing access to Lot 20 as recommended in the Commissioner’s Supplemental Report * * *, subject to the restrictions and stipulations noted in the Supplemental Report.”', 'The “restrictions and stipulations” to which the judgment refers are:', '“[T]he Commissioner recommends granting an easement for', 'access in favor of the owners of the Carriage House and Manor', 'House. The easement should be considered personal to such', 'owners, be it the Ballards or their successors, for so long as the', 'owners of the Carriage House parcel and/or the Manor House', 'parcel also retain an ownership interest in lot #20.” After granting the easement, 5 the Superior Court commissioned Waterman Engineering Co. to file a final class 1 survey of the partitioned land.

In August 2005, a Superior Court justice ordered SVF, the owner of the servient estate, to construct “a farm-type road as described by the [c]ourt during the colloquy at [the June 27, 2005] hearing” to accomodate the Ballards’ easement. At that hearing, the Superior Court justice described the requirements of the farm road to be constructed as follows:', '“a road that on either side of a middle rise on which there is often', 'flowers and weeds, on either side there are tracks that are wide', 'enough not merely for motor vehicles but for those wide tires or', 'double tires that one sees on farm vehicles and farm wagons and', 'other equipment used in farming and cultivation. * * * [I]t would', 'be graded in such fashion that it would be safe for the operation of', 'a tractor or similar vehicle over the road, and it would be graded in', 'the middle of that farm road so that the suspension or', 'undercarriage of the farm vehicles would not touch it as they', 'passed over it.”', 'Despite the hearing justice’s fairly detailed description of the “farm road” SVF was to build, the parties were never able to agree on the exact specifications of either the road or the gates that were to be placed at either end of the easement. Nevertheless, SVF went ahead and constructed a dirt road during the spring of 2006.

Also, SVF installed gates that were ten feet wide at either end of the fifteen-foot-wide easement. Needless to say, the Ballards were dissatisfied with both the road and the gates. The Ballards insisted that, although the lawnmower that they owned at the time, which was approximately six feet wide, could travel safely on the farm road, they were planning on purchasing a new mower that would be fourteen feet three inches wide. As a result, in August 2006, two more days of hearings ensued.', 'At a January 2007 hearing, which appears to have been held in response to SVF’s motion to eliminate the easement, the hearing justice, after he took a second view of the property, attempted to put an end to the dispute over the road, saying:', '“There is no way that this [c]ourt in the person of yours truly or in', 'any other judge can constantly supervise the prolonged and', 'protracted bickering between these parties who, apparently, have', 'no limits to the resources they can spend on capable counsel to', 'prolong this contest, but the [c]ourt, really, has got to bring some', 'finality to this * * *.', '“The Ballards wanted an easement, they got an easement.', 'It may not be following the exact course that they would have liked', 'and it also would not afford them a wheel base of 13 feet, but', 'under law of easements it does provide them with the use that the', 'easement was ordained; namely, to get farm vehicles, including', 'tractors, from one section of the Ballard property to another.” After the hearing, an order entered that said, in relevant part, that SVF had “constructed a farm road providing reasonable access to the [Ballards]” that “satisfied [the Superior] Court’s previous orders.” The order added that, “[b]ased on the evidence presented at the hearing, and the [c]ourt’s views of the subject property, the [c]ourt finds that the 10 foot gates do not impinge on the Ballards’ reasonable use of the access easement * * *.”', 'Despite the January 2007 order, final judgment did not enter on any of the counts contained within SVF’s fifth amended complaint or the Ballards’ counterclaim thereto. The case', '-6- languished, more or less, until June 2014, when SVF moved for summary judgment on count 7 of the Ballards’ counterclaim, which alleged that SVF was interfering with their easement. 8 Ultimately, a different Superior Court justice granted summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure in favor of SVF, and then entered final judgment under Rule 54(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure on count 7 only. 9 The Ballards timely appealed that judgment to this Court.', 'C', 'In 2012, before final judgment entered, A.

Shortly after the order entered, the Ballards petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari. SVF, in its opposition to the issuance of that writ, argued that granting a writ of certiorari at that time was inappropriate because the Ballards were appealing from an interlocutory order. 13 It is, at the very least, contradictory, if not worthy of estoppel by judicial admission, for SVF to now contend that the January 2007 order was analogous to final judgment when it energetically argued that the same order was interlocutory in 2007.

The intrepid trial justice took up the motion—that specifically invoked the “general equitable powers” of the Superior Court—in order to give the Ballards relief from that judgment. The Ballards placed the question of the appropriate use of the easement, whether it should be relocated or modified “because * * * the location is impracticable” due to the “terrain and vegetation,” squarely before the Superior Court, and the Ballards obtained relief—a farm road, 3', 'In its brief in this Court, SVF has contended that “[i]n the summer of 2004, the Ballards trespassed onto [SVF’s] property * * * and clear cut a large swath of forested area.” This resulted in an injunction. 4', 'In their twenty-four-page memorandum in support of their motion for relief from judgment, the Ballards state: “This Court clearly has the authority under Rule 60(b) [of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure], as well as under its general equitable powers, to order this relief.” The Court did so when it ordered SVF to construct the roadway on the easement and again on January 30, 2007, when it denied any further relief and concluded the proceeding under Rule 60(b).', '- 19 - allowing for reasonable use, was constructed by SVF.', '(Emphasis added.)', 'The bickering continued nonetheless when the Ballards declared that they wanted to utilize the easement for an industrial sized tractor they had not yet acquired. It was represented to the Superior Court that the tractor that the Ballards currently owned fit through the gates.', 'The Superior Court justice patiently devoted significant energy and judicial resources in an earnest effort to accommodate the parties and to reach a truce in the neighborhood. He conducted at least six hearings in the Superior Court, including an evidentiary hearing in August 2006, which was followed by SVF’s motion to vacate the easement based on unclean hands on the part of the Ballards. 5', 'The trial justice conducted two views of the easement; the first was an inspection of the terrain and the location, as set forth in the recorded survey. On April 22, 2005, after the first view, the Superior Court justice declined to relocate the easement, concluding that it was laid out in what was determined to “be a suitable place” as the prior trial justice and commissioner balanced considerations of safety, the environment, and the concern for the animals that inhabit the property. He also saw no hazards for anyone who would be driving a farm vehicle, “such as a pickup truck or a tractor over the course that has been outlined.” He continued the case for another hearing. The Ballards never raised an objection. However, on or about May 31, 2005, in the midst of the hearings on the Rule 60(b) motion, the Ballards filed count 7 of their counterclaim seeking injunctive relief so that the Ballards could undertake improvements to their easement in order “to fulfill their rights in the easement for full, unimpeded passage, both pedestrian and vehicular.”', '(Emphasis added.)', 'Count 7 alleged that the Hamiltons have prevented or thwarted them from improving their easement, and they sought an injunction 5', 'This ruling summarily denying this motion is set forth in the January 30, 2007, order.', '- 20 - against further interference with the Ballards’ efforts to improve the easement. Meanwhile, their Rule 60(b) motion continued to be addressed by the trial justice.', 'The case took another turn, however, on June 27, 2005, when SVF volunteered to obtain the permits and install a farm road providing reasonable access to the Ballards. The Ballards agreed, and on August 11, 2005, an order entered that included the following:', '“1. SVF Foundation shall provide reasonable access to the', 'defendants as soon as practicable over the access easement,', 'described in the Waterman Class I survey commissioned by', 'Order of this Court, by clearing existing vegetation and', 'creating a farm-type road as described by the Court during the', 'colloquy at [the June 27, 2005] hearing.', '“2. SVF Foundation shall file with the Rhode Island', 'Department of Environmental Management and the City of', 'Newport Critical Area Review Committee, on or before July 5,', '2005, applications for permits and/or approvals, as required,', 'for the creation of said access. SVF Foundation should, in the', 'interest of conciliation, provide the defendants with a copy of', 'the initial applications but is not ordered to supply the Ballards', 'with all plans submitted for approval.', '“3. If, at the end of construction of said farm-type road, the', 'Ballads feel that access is not reasonable for their farm', 'vehicles, they may petition the Court to review the access that', 'has been created pursuant to this order.', '“4. The parties shall have a telephone conference with the', 'Court, on July 18, 2005 to arrange for a further status', 'conference regarding the access easement is [sic] necessary.”', 'Although a year passed before the trial justice saw the parties again, there was no armistice. SVF undertook permitting and construction of the access easement in accordance with the original metes and bounds description. A farm road was constructed with a ten-foot roadbed that was approved by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management.', 'The Ballards obtained relief under Rule 60(b)—reasonable access for the purpose for which the easement was intended. At the end of the construction in spring 2006, the farm road was ten feet', '- 21 - wide, and the gates were ten feet wide—a width that SVF contends is “virtually identical to the gates * * * used on [the Ballards’] property.” The Ballards were not satisfied, and the focus of the next dispute was the width of the gates.', 'The Ballards argued that they planned to acquire a tractor with a wheelbase of approximately thirteen-and-a-half feet that would not fit through the gates. At a hearing on July 7, 2006, an issue arose as to whether the Ballards had alerted SVF that it needed wider gates to accommodate the industrial tractor that they intended to purchase. The Ballards filed a motion to compel compliance with a subpoena seeking production of the engineering records from the firm that SVF retained for the permitting. The trial justice denied the motion to compel without prejudice, declaring that it could be submitted at a later time.', 'This motion was never resubmitted. 6 The trial justice scheduled an evidentiary hearing concerning the tractor and the gates.', 'A two-day evidentiary hearing was held on August 8 and 9, 2006; Ballard and his caretaker testified about equipment they were contemplating and their desire to cut back the vegetation along the new farm road, to a width of fifteen feet. 7 Hamilton testified that he did not want to install fifteen-foot gates for access over a ten-foot farm road, because he feared that someone would drive a larger vehicle over the farm road and intrude upon the wetlands. At the conclusion of this hearing, the trial justice questioned the Ballards’ good faith. 8 The trial justice made a second visit to the site on August 29, 2006, and he viewed the farm road, the terrain, and the gates. 6', 'In January 2007, counsel for the Ballards argued that the motion to compel production was pending before the trial justice. It was not. 7', 'Apparently this was impossible in various places because of wetlands, large trees, ledge, and a historic wall. 8', 'This appears to have been the impetus for the motion to vacate the easement based on unclean hands.', '- 22 -', 'On January 17, 2007, he conducted a final hearing, and, on January 30, 2007, he issued an order denying any further relief.', 'It is this order which the majority characterizes as “interlocutory in nature.”', 'What is clear from the record in this case is that the battle of the easement and the gates and the issue of reasonable access was fought long and hard in the Superior Court and culminated in the January 2007 order that the majority has classified as “interlocutory in nature.” It is not.', 'Significantly, on January 17, 2007, during the final hearing, the trial justice made several important findings of fact, including those related to the farm road and a demonstration utilizing a mockup of a tractor that the Ballards were contemplating purchasing.', 'Those findings specifically were incorporated into the January 2007 order and stated that passage by a tractor with a wheelbase of more than thirteen feet was impossible. The trial justice found that the existing terrain on the easement was not conducive to that equipment:', '“It was clear to me, and I so found based upon the view,', 'that a tractor that size cannot be supported by that easement. The', 'terrain is not flat in all places, and, indeed, on some places it is', 'pitched in an angle of, I would say, 30 degrees, * * * it is an angle,', 'it is not a flat surface, and rocks and shrubs and thicket and trees', 'would make it impossible for a tractor that size to get through the', 'easement. Certainly, it could not do so safely. Yet, at the same', 'time I find that Mr. Ballard can mow his fields by using the current', 'tractor that he has * * *.', '“* * *', '“[T]herefore, the 10-foot gates through which the Ballard[s’]', 'tractor can pass without difficulty, that does not inhibit the', 'reasonable and fair use of the easement by the Ballards. So, on that', 'particular point I think the record shouts out the conclusion I’ve', 'just made and there is no need for a trial on the easement issue.', '“* * *', '- 23 -', '“The easement shall stand along that road and with the existing', 'gates.” (Emphases added.)', 'When counsel for the Ballards asked the trial justice for “an articulation of exactly what the [C]ourt is ordering so we’ll both have something to look at[,]” the Superior Court justice declared with finality: “[T]he 10-foot gates do not inhibit the Ballards’ use of that easement, and, therefore, they may remain.”', '(Emphases added.)', 'SVF’s counsel inquired, “[i]t is uncontested, I gather * * * that the improved farm road that you’ve cited is a reasonable passageway, and, therefore that issue is also waived.” (Emphasis added.) The final word from the trial justice should convince everyone that the January 2007 order was not “interlocutory in nature”:', '“Yes. I didn’t realize that anybody suggested otherwise. I', 'know the Ballards would have preferred another course, but the', 'existing one is—puts [SVF] in compliance with its obligations', 'relative to earlier Court [o]rders and the maintenance of that road', 'as the easement.” (Emphasis added.)', 'The Ballards did not object. The January 2007 order incorporated these findings. The order recites that the matter came before the Superior Court four times after the farm road was constructed, “on July 7, August 8 and 9, 2006 and January 17, 2007[,]” and “after considering testimony, viewing the property and reviewing the memoranda of law,” the Superior Court ordered:', '“1. SVF Foundation has constructed a farm road providing', 'reasonable access to the defendants within the access easement', 'described in Waterman Class I Survey commissioned by the', 'Court on January 16, 2004 dated and April 23, 2004 and', 'thereby satisfied this Court’s previous orders.', '“2. Based on the evidence presented at the hearing, and the', 'Court’s views of the subject property, the Court finds that the', '10 foot gates do not impinge on the Ballards’ reasonable use of', 'the access easement and the Court incorporates by reference its', 'comments from the bench on January 17, 2007.', '- 24 -', '“3. SVF Foundation’s motion to eliminate the easement is', 'denied.[9]', '“4. The file shall be transferred back to Newport County for', 'trial on only those remaining issues and counts which are', 'unrelated to matters already raised before this Court regarding', 'the access easement.” (Emphases added.)', 'In my opinion, for this Court to characterize the January 2007 order as “interlocutory in nature” is incorrect and will lead to needless and confusing litigation in Superior Court. This Court should provide illumination and clarification with respect to just what aspect of this case such an interlocutory order attaches to. Because the Rule 60(b) motion for relief from judgment filed by the Ballards was the only matter that was before this justice for two years and sought relief from the original and only Rule 54(b) judgment, it was not an interlocutory order. It was a final order that closed the door on the access easement, along the parameters set forth in the recorded partition survey. The Ballards obtained relief—the farm road was built. The Ballards were not satisfied, but they did not appeal. A petition for writ of certiorari generally is not available to salvage an untimely appeal.', 'Furthermore, count 7 of the counterclaim was filed after the Rule 60(b) hearings commenced, before SVF was ordered to construct the access easement, and before the ten-foot iron gates were constructed. Count 7 makes no mention of the gates whatsoever. Count 7 sets 9', 'It does not appear that there was any argument or ruling concerning SVF’s motion to eliminate the easement during the January 17, 2007, hearing, save for the representation by counsel for the Ballards that the only motions that were before the Court were counsel’s motion to enforce the subpoena—that was not pending—and SVF’s motion to eliminate the easement based upon unclean hands by the Ballards. I therefore disagree with the majority’s conclusion that the January 17, 2007, hearing “appears to have been held in response to SVF’s motion to eliminate the easement.” There is no record support for this assumption.', '- 25 - forth a claim for injunctive relief and consists of four paragraphs, two of which clearly are moot. 10 Count 7 reads as follows:', '“COUNT VII (Unreasonable Interference with Easement)', '“59.

The Ballards’ improvement of the Access Easement is', 'necessary to fulfill their rights in the easement for full, unimpeded', 'passage, both pedestrian and vehicular, between their Lot 404 and', 'Lot 20.', '“61. Hamilton’s actions to prevent or thwart the Ballards from', 'improving their Access Easement, including her objection to the', 'processing of Ballards’ applications with DEM and CARC,', 'constitutes a material impairment and/or unreasonable interference', 'with the Ballards’ right to use their access easement for its', 'intended purpose.', '“62. Hamilton should be enjoined from further interference with', 'the Ballards’ improvement and use of their access easement.”', 'Significantly, during the January 17, 2007, hearing, counsel for the Ballards, in open court, notified the trial justice that it was his intention', '“to move to amend their counterclaim to include a count', 'concerning the impingement on the easement and have this case', 'brought to a conclusion in the Superior Court in Newport through', 'trial on the multiple counts * * * including the question of whether', 'the gates constitute an unlawful impingement on an easement.” This never happened. This representation amounts to a judicial admission and acknowledgment that no such claim was pending in Superior Court. This case languished in Newport Superior Court for another seven years. This circumstance points to the compelling need for this Court to speak with a clear voice to ensure that, on remand, count 7 of the counterclaim is not transmuted 10', 'Because SVF constructed the access easement and obtained the necessary permits, after this counterclaim was filed, these allegations are moot.', '- 26 - into a count that was never filed—“a count concerning the impingement on the easement” or evade the consequences of our final judgment rule. During the seven-plus years between the January 2007 order and the summary judgment in this case, no effort was made to amend count 7 to address the width of the gates; nor were any other counts added to the counterclaim. 11', 'The trial justice declared that “the record shouts out the conclusion I’ve just made and there is no need for a trial on the easement issue.” The trial justice, who was about to embark upon a well-earned retirement, ordered the return of the file to Newport County, “for trial on only those remaining issues and counts which are unrelated to matters already raised before this Court regarding the access easement.” (Emphasis added.) No appeal was taken.', 'To be sure, this Court denied the Ballards’ petition for writ of certiorari, filed several months after the Rule 60(b) order entered. In typical fashion in opposing certiorari, SVF argued, inter alia, that the order was interlocutory; the Ballards responded that count 7 did not relate to the tractor gates. 12 This Court denied certiorari. Parties to actions in our courts and our trial justices ought to be able to rely on the finality of court orders. The burden of unnecessarily relitigating this issue should not be shouldered by the next Superior Court justice to whom this case is assigned. I respectfully submit that the January 2007 order was final, the issue of the access easement was laid to rest, and count 7 is wholly irrelevant to the issues decided during the Rule 60(b) proceeding. 11', 'SVF states in its brief that the Ballards have filed yet another action in Superior Court, Ballard v. SVF Foundation, NC-2013-499 that includes yet another complaint about the ten-foot gates and the access easement. The case is part of a consolidated appeal that is currently pending in the Supreme Court. Therefore, that case has remained pending for a total of four years. 12', 'In his reply memorandum in the petition for certiorari, counsel declared that count 7 “addresses SVF’s interference with the Ballard’s [sic] efforts to improve the easement rather than its later imposition of constructing gates on the easement roadway.” (Emphasis added.)', '- 27 -', 'However, my opinion regarding the finality of the January 2007 order does not lead me to conclude that the summary judgment granted by the trial justice in this case should be affirmed. I reach this conclusion because I agree with the majority that, in the context of this case, summary judgment, based on the January 2007 order, was not appropriate, respectfully.', 'Clearly, count 7 may be moot, at least in part, because it was filed before the Rule 60(b) hearings concluded, the farm road was built, and the gates were installed. Additionally, in granting summary judgment, the hearing justice, although homing in on the fact that, during the seven-year interregnum between the 2007 order and the hearing before him, nothing had changed on Edgehill, he nonetheless failed to set forth any reasons for granting summary judgment. I agree with the majority, however, that the law of the case doctrine is quite viable on remand, and the issue of mootness also is in play. What is abundantly clear is that the issue of the location of the easement and the width of the gates, in my opinion, cannot be relitigated.

Hillary indicated that she and her sister “were the ones talking to [Courtney]” at the mall; Maya did not share any information with her mother at that moment.', 'Afterwards, Courtney took Maya to the Central Falls police station.

In particular, defendant contends that Hillary’s testimony should have been excluded “because it was too remote and not reasonably necessary * * * to prove the elements of the charged crim[es] * * *.”', 'Prior to the commencement of trial, Hillary was examined in a voir dire hearing concerning the state’s motion in limine seeking to introduce certain uncharged acts of defendant. The trial justice ruled, over defendant’s objection, that the testimony of Hillary, alleging sexual acts by defendant against her approximately eight years before trial, would be admissible, subject to a proper foundation being established.', 'In ruling that Hillary’s testimony would not be precluded, the trial justice noted that Hillary and Maya “are only * * * a couple of years apart in age”; that Hillary’s alleged abuse', '-8- “would have happened eight years [before trial] when she was 12,” while “[t]he conduct alleged in this case would have occurred about two years [before trial] when [Maya] was 14”; that they “are both biological daughters of * * * defendant”; “[t]hey were both allegedly in the situation where * * * defendant had access to them”; that, although Hillary’s allegations indicate that Courtney was also in bed with defendant, Hillary was positioned in a manner where she was next to defendant and not Courtney; that “the allegations involve[d] alleged offenses [that] occurre[d] at * * * defendant’s home”; and that “[t]he relationships [we]re identical” and “[t]he age[s] [of Maya and Hillary were] sufficiently similar.”', 'At trial, during Hillary’s direct examination, the trial justice interrupted the state’s presentation and provided a limiting instruction to the jury. As noted, the trial justice explained to the jury that the testimony they were about to hear from Hillary was not admissible to show that defendant “had a propensity to commit the acts charged in this case.” Rather, the trial justice continued, the testimony was “admissible to show [that defendant had a] motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, and sense of mistake or accident” to carry out the acts alleged by Maya.', 'In her instructions to the jury after the close of evidence, the trial justice reminded the jury that she had previously instructed them concerning the uncharged acts of sexual assault alleged by Hillary in her testimony. She then explained that, “[t]o the extent that the evidence in this case included testimony about alleged incidents that were not charged by the [s]tate * * * that testimony was admitted for a limited purpose, such as to prove motive or to prove opportunity[ ] to commit the charged offenses or as alleged proof of * * * [d]efendant’s sexual intent or disposition. [The evidence] was not admitted to prove the character of * * * [d]efendant in order to show that he acted in conformity with such uncharged alleged conduct.”', '-9-', 'Rule 404(b) provides that:', '“Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to', 'prove the character of a person in order to show that the person', 'acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for', 'other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent,', 'preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake or', 'accident, or to prove that [the] defendant feared imminent bodily', 'harm and that the fear was reasonable.”', 'We have long recognized that, “[i]n molestation or sexual assault cases, evidence of a defendant’s prior sexual misconduct cannot be admitted to prove that ‘[the] defendant is a bad man, and that he has a propensity toward sexual offenses and, therefore, probably committed the offenses with which he is charged.’” Mohapatra, 880 A.2d at 806 (quoting State v. Quattrocchi, 681 A.2d 879, 886 (R.I. 1996)). Moreover, “when a person other than the complainant testifies about prior sexual misconduct, such alleged misconduct must be ‘nonremote’ and ‘similar’ to the charged offense.” State v.

Offenses are recognized as “‘nonremote’ and ‘similar’ when they are ‘closely related in time, place, age, family relationships of the victims, and the form of the sexual acts.’” Mohapatra, 880 A.2d at 806 (quoting State v. Brigham, 638 A.2d 1043, 1045 (R.I. 1994)). “Furthermore, the evidence is admissible ‘only when that exception is relevant to proving the charge lodged against the defendant,’ and ‘only when reasonably necessary.’” Id.

Generally, a trial justice’s', '- 10 - preliminary determination on a motion in limine “need not be taken as a final determination of the admissibility of the evidence referred to in the motion.” Id. at 238 (quoting State v. Torres, 787 A.2d 1214, 1220 (R.I. 2002)).', 'In Hopkins, 698 A.2d at 184, the defendant appealed his convictions of sexual assault on his stepson, who was between nine and thirteen years old when the charged acts transpired. To prove its case, the state, over objection, introduced evidence that the defendant had allegedly sexually abused his biological son and another boy—both of whom were of similar age as the complaining witness at the time of the abuse—at a time that he had control over the victims. 6 Id. at 184, 185. In addition, the Court noted that the acts “involved similar incidents of alleged sexual touching, oral sex, and anal sex.” Id. at 185. In affirming the convictions, the Court held that the uncharged acts were admissible to show that the defendant’s charged acts were part of a common scheme or plan to molest young boys subject to his control and influence. 7 Id.', 'Furthermore, the Hopkins Court also noted that, although the uncharged acts occurred approximately ten years before the defendant began sexually assaulting the complaining witness and “fourteen to eighteen years before trial,” the trial justice “was entitled to conclude that the alleged remoteness of this * * * evidence was outweighed (1) by its potential probative value concerning the similar age and relationship of the boys * * * when they were allegedly victimized by [the defendant] and (2) by the other indicia that [the defendant]’s sexual forays involving young boys under his dominion constituted ‘a modus operandi that bore [his] 6', 'The Court in State v. Hopkins, 698 A.2d 183, 185 (R.I. 1997), noted that “[a]ll the acts of alleged molestation took place when the male victims were between * * * seven or eight and thirteen years old and when they were either living with or working for [the defendant].” 7', 'The Court indicated that, at the time of the abuse, the uncharged acts occurred either at the defendant’s place of work or his home, and that the abuse alleged “was generally similar (sexual touching, oral sex, and attempted anal sex) to that alleged by the [complaining witness].” Hopkins, 698 A.2d at 185 n.2.', '- 11 - signature.’” Hopkins, 698 A.2d at 186 (quoting State v. Lamoureux, 623 A.2d 9, 13 (R.I. 1993)). Finally, the Court provided guidance on the admission of Rule 404(b) evidence, by pronouncing that, similar to a sliding scale, “as the generality of the alleged class of victims and the breadth of the purported plan, scheme, or modus operandi increases, the probative force of this evidence to establish the non-character-related purposes for which it is offered tends to diminish while its effectiveness in showing that the defendant has acted in conformity with his deviant sexual character tends to increase.” Hopkins, 698 A.2d at 186. This defect in the probative value, the Court made clear, does not affect the admissibility of the evidence, when “such evidence is reasonably necessary for the prosecution to prove its case and is not merely cumulative”; the defect, rather, “goes to its weight and to the need for limiting instructions.” Id.', '1. Similar Sexual Acts', 'The defendant argues first that the incidents involving Hillary are not sufficiently similar to Maya’s allegations. In particular, defendant asserts that “the two witnesses described very different conduct which was carried out in two completely different ways[:]', '[Hillary] describe[d] accidental touching when she [was] in bed with [defendant]” while he was asleep. Maya, on the other hand, “describe[d] a series of touching, fellatio, and digital penetration of her vagina * * * [in] a scenario where * * * [defendant] would pressure [Maya] into not telling anyone.” In addition, defendant contends that the allegations are not similar because, in Maya’s testimony, defendant was alone with her at the time the alleged acts transpired and used his “power and ability to provide things as a way to pressure [Maya] into acquiescing.” In fact, defendant avers, the “acts were not at all similar aside from the fact that they were both touching.”', '- 12 -', 'As previously noted, the admissibility of evidence is within the trial justice’s sound discretion. See Mohapatra, 880 A.2d at 805. Moreover, “prior sexual misconduct with someone other than the complainant” is recognized as “nonremote” and “similar,” and therefore admissible under Rule 404(b) when it is “closely related in time, place, age, family relationships of the victims, and the form of the sexual acts.” Mohapatra, 880 A.2d at 806 (quoting Brigham, 638 A.2d at 1045). In addition, “the evidence is admissible ‘only when that exception [of Rule 404(b)] is relevant to proving the charge lodged against the defendant,’ and ‘only when reasonably necessary.’” Mohapatra, 880 A.2d at 806 (quoting Jalette, 119 R.I. at 627, 382 A.2d at 533).', 'Here, before admitting the evidence, the trial justice indicated how the alleged uncharged acts to which Hillary testified were similar to the incidents under indictment. In this case, the trial justice noted that Hillary and Maya were “both biological daughters of” defendant and only “a couple of years apart in age” when the alleged acts occurred—Hillary being twelve and Maya fourteen at the time—thus, the trial justice concluded, the ages were “sufficiently similar” for an appropriate comparison and analysis. In addition, the trial justice noted that Hillary’s allegations and the charged offenses all occurred in defendant’s home “where * * * defendant had access to [his daughters].” The trial justice also indicated that, although Hillary’s testimony alleged that Courtney was also in bed with defendant when the acts occurred, this fact was tempered because Hillary was positioned next to defendant, in a manner whereby defendant had direct control over her. After reviewing the record, we are satisfied that the trial justice articulated sufficient reasons to support her finding that Hillary’s allegations were sufficiently similar to the charged acts, and she appropriately exercised her discretion in this regard. Therefore, we have no cause to interfere with her decision on this basis.', '- 13 -', '2. Relevance to Charges', 'The defendant claims next that Hillary’s testimony should have been precluded at trial because the “alleged prior sexual acts had insufficient relevance to this case” since that testimony described “an accidental touching” and not the “calculated and well-planned assault” for which defendant was indicted. Thus, defendant posits, the testimony does not describe a “common scheme or plan” on defendant’s part.', 'Rule 401 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence defines “relevant evidence” as “evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.” In addition, Rule 402 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence indicates that “[a]ll relevant evidence is admissible.”', 'In the case before us, Hillary’s testimony concerning other alleged acts of sexual abuse easily clears the relevancy bar, which, to be sure, is quite low. See State v. Rodriguez, 996 A.2d 145, 151 (R.I. 2010) (“low relevancy threshold reflects the ‘evidentiary maxim, [a] brick is not a wall’”) (quoting Advisory Committee’s Note to Rule 401). As this Court said in State v. Pignolet, 465 A.2d 176, 182 (R.I. 1983), with respect to the admission of evidence concerning uncharged sexual acts admitted by the defendant against his stepdaughter: “We find that this evidence was neither irrelevant nor remote. Both later incidents, coupled with [the] defendant’s first assault attempt, are relevant, material, and highly probative of [the] defendant’s lecherous conduct toward these young girls over whom he exercised discipline, control, and supervision.”', 'Similarly, Hillary’s testimony was indicative of “defendant’s lecherous conduct toward” his adolescent biological daughters “over whom he exercised discipline, control, and supervision.” See Pignolet, 465 A.2d at 182.', '- 14 -', '3. Reasonable Necessity', 'The defendant avers that “[t]here was absolutely no necessity to introduce the * * * testimony that [defendant] * * * touched [Hillary]” because defendant’s “accidental” conduct described in Hillary’s testimony is inconsistent with the deliberate acts allegedly done to Maya. Additionally, defendant asserts that Hillary’s “testimony was not relevant to show any common scheme or plan” because the acts were so disparate in “the way [that] [they] [were] carried out.”', 'As we have said in the past, however, “[w]hen charges of sexual abuse hinge upon a credibility contest between [the] defendant and [the] child complainant, relevant evidence of prior sexual misconduct is reasonably necessary to support the complainant’s testimony.” Mohapatra, 880 A.2d at 808.', 'In this case, there was no physical evidence or third-party eyewitness testimony presented at trial. In addition, defendant attacked Maya’s credibility and argued in his motion for a new trial that the state had not proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Significantly, the defense’s theory was that the sexual assaults never occurred. In his closing statement, defendant’s counsel argued that the case was not about sexual assault; rather, it was “about a young lady, who according to her own testimony, wants stuff, who is spoiled, who is vengeful and wanted her family back together.” Accordingly, this case turned upon Maya’s credibility. Thus, Hillary’s testimony was indeed reasonably necessary for the state to prove its case. Therefore, we will not disturb the trial justice’s ruling.', '4. Limiting Instruction', 'Lastly, defendant contends that the trial justice’s limiting instruction “[w]as [f]undamentally [f]lawed” because she “[l]isted [a]ll [of] the [e]xceptions [i]n the [i]nstruction and [s]tated [that] the [e]vidence [w]as [a]dmissable to [s]how a [d]isposition.” Particularly, defendant claims that the limiting instruction did not state “with particularity the specific', '- 15 - exception to which the other crimes evidence [was] relevant.” Further, defendant also takes issue with the trial justice’s instruction to the jury to consider the evidence “to show that [defendant] had a lewd disposition * * * to commit this type of crime.”', 'During Hillary’s direct examination, the trial justice provided a limiting instruction to the jury. The trial transcript provides:', '“Ladies and Gentlemen, evidence that * * * [d]efendant allegedly', 'committed a sexual act or another act with the witness, [Hillary],', 'which alleged act is not charged in this case, is admissible for a', 'limited purpose. Under our Rules of Evidence it’s very important', 'that you understand the limited purpose for which this evidence', 'would be allowed.', '“First I’ll tell you what it’s not allowed for. It’s not admissible', 'to show that * * * [d]efendant had a propensity to commit the acts', 'charged in this case, but it is admissible to show motive,', 'opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, and sense of mistake or', 'accident. In other words, it is admissible to show a disposition,', 'perhaps, but not as evidence that he had a propensity to commit the', 'act alleged.”', 'Thereafter, at the conclusion of trial, the trial justice reiterated to the jury the limited purpose for which Hillary’s testimony was admitted:', '“Now I want to talk to you about some testimony that we heard', 'from [Hillary]. Okay. You recall that I previously instructed you', 'about the limited purpose of admitting testimony in this case of', 'uncharged alleged incidents of sexual assault against [Hillary]', '* * *. To the extent that the evidence in this case included', 'testimony about alleged incidents that were not charged by the', '[s]tate, and are not included in the [i]ndictment, that testimony was', 'admitted for a limited purpose. It was admissible for a very', 'limited purpose, such as to prove motive or to prove opportunity,', 'to commit the charged offenses or as alleged proof of * * *', '[d]efendant’s sexual intent or disposition. It was not admitted to', 'prove the character of * * * [d]efendant in order to show that he', 'acted in conformity with such uncharged alleged conduct.” In both instances, defendant did not raise an objection to the instructions provided by the trial justice.', '- 16 -', 'We have recognized that a trial justice need not provide limiting instructions contemporaneously with the relevant evidence. See State v. Mitchell, 80 A.3d 19, 29 (R.I. 2013). Furthermore, “[a]ny issue as to the adequacy of that instruction is waived [if] [the] defendant [does] not raise an objection prior to the jury’s deliberation.” Id. at 29-30. Here, defendant waived his argument relating to the adequacy of the trial justice’s limiting instructions because he failed to raise an objection either during the trial or prior to the jury’s deliberation. Indeed, under our well-settled “raise-or-waive” rule, an issue not raised before a trial justice is not preserved for appellate review. Town Houses at Bonnet Shores Condominium Association v. Langlois, 45 A.3d 577, 584 (R.I. 2012).', 'B', 'Motion for Judgment of Acquittal', 'Finally, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal on count 5 of the indictment. He maintains that counts 4 and 5 both relate to the shower incident, which he describes as “one continuous incident.” The defendant, therefore, contends that the evidence supports a finding of potential guilt on only count 4. We note that the verdict form provided to the jury described count 4 as when Maya “was in the shower, and [defendant] used his hand to effectuate touching of her vagina[,]” whereas count 5 pertains to when “she was in the shower, and he forced/coerced her into touching her own vagina with her hand[.]”', 'The state, both in its papers and at oral argument, seemingly conceded that defendant has a viable argument, albeit on an alternative theory. The state notes that there is a “salient distinction” between “sexual penetration” as contemplated in the first-degree sexual assault statute, § 11-37-2, 8 and “sexual contact” as proscribed in the second-degree sexual assault 8', 'Section 11-37-2 provides that:', '- 17 - statute, § 11-37-4, 9 viz., § 11-37-4, unlike § 11-37-2, does not encompass sexual contact by the victim on his or her own body upon the accused’s instructions. 10 The state argues, however, that the issue has been waived and must be raised through an application for postconviction relief.', 'We recognize that, by failing to renew his motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of his case, the defendant has waived his appellate argument in this regard. Nevertheless, we are of the belief that the evidence of the defendant’s conduct relating to the so-called shower incident provides the basis for a conviction on only one charge of second-degree sexual assault. In the', '“A person is guilty of first degree sexual assault if he or she', 'engages in sexual penetration with another person, and if any of', 'the following circumstances exist:', '“(1) The accused, not being the spouse, knows or has reason to', 'know that the victim is mentally incapacitated, mentally disabled,', 'or physically helpless.', '“(2) The accused uses force or coercion.', '“(3) The accused, through concealment or by the element of', 'surprise, is able to overcome the victim.', '“(4) The accused engages in the medical treatment or', 'examination of the victim for the purpose of sexual arousal,', 'gratification, or stimulation.” 9', 'Section 11-37-4 provides that:', '“A person is guilty of a second-degree sexual assault if he or', 'she engages in sexual contact with another person and if any of the', 'following circumstances exist:', '“(1) The accused knows or has reason to know that the victim', 'is mentally incapacitated, mentally disabled, or physically helpless.', '“(2) The accused uses force, element of surprise, or coercion.', '“(3) The accused engages in the medical treatment or', 'examination of the victim for the purpose of sexual arousal,', 'gratification, or stimulation.” 10', 'Section 11-37-1(8) defines sexual penetration as “sexual intercourse, cunnilingus, fellatio, and anal intercourse, or any other intrusion, however slight, by any part of a person’s body or by any object into the genital or anal openings of another person’s body, or the victim’s own body upon the accused’s instruction, but emission of semen is not required.” Alternatively, § 11-37-1(7) defines sexual contact as “the intentional touching of the victim’s or accused’s intimate parts, clothed or unclothed, if that intentional touching can be reasonably construed as intended by the accused to be for the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification, or assault.”', '- 18 - interest of justice and judicial economy, therefore, we vacate the judgment of conviction as to count 5.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, we vacate count 5 of the judgment of conviction and affirm the judgment of the Superior Court in all other respects.

A robbery on the streets of Providence led to a thief’s short-term possession of stolen goods but long-term period of incarceration.', 'The defendant, Keith J. Pittman, appeals from his conviction by a jury of second-degree robbery, for which he was given a twenty-year sentence with sixteen years to serve at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI) and four years suspended with probation. This case came before the Supreme Court, sitting at Woonsocket High School, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On January 17, 2013, after leaving work for the day, Ryan Laughlin and his roommate, Kyle Nichols-Schmolze, left their Chestnut Street office in downtown Providence and began walking home. Laughlin testified that they left in the early evening because it was “definitely', '-1- * * * starting to get dark out but not fully dark.” Laughlin explained that he and his roommate walked across the Point Street Bridge and proceeded up Wickenden Street.', 'According to Laughlin, he “was carrying a messenger bag with a laptop; and [Nichols-Schmolze] [also] had a backpack with his laptop * * * [and] other work supplies.” Laughlin testified that, while walking “somewhere near * * * Pizza Pie-er” on Wickenden Street, “two men stepped out from an alleyway” and grabbed him.', 'Laughlin continued to testify that “somebody” came from behind, “grabbed ahold of [him] and grabbed ahold of [his] bag and said, ‘Give me your bag. I’ve got a gun.’” He began “taking off [his] bag” because he was “afraid” and did not “know [what was] going to happen.” Laughlin testified that “the guy took [his] bag [from] over [his] head” when Nichols-Schmolze, standing “a couple of steps” away, said to the man, “You don’t have a gun,” to which the man repeated, “I have a gun.” Laughlin described the man who took the bag from him as “a black guy” in his mid to late thirties; 1 he did not get as good a look at the second man, however. Laughlin testified that, as the two men ran off with his bag towards the Point Street Bridge, Nichols-Schmolze gave chase closely behind them, with Laughlin about twenty to thirty feet behind Nichols-Schmolze.', 'Nichols-Schmolze’s testimony at trial essentially corroborated Laughlin’s version of the incident. He described the two suspects, however, as “a white male and a black male[,]” stating that “[t]he black male was the one threatening that he had a gun” and “basically arresting [Laughlin], trying to peel the messenger bag over his head and pull it off.”', 'Nichols-Schmolze continued to testify that, when the men started running, he realized that it appeared “very unlikely” that they had a firearm, and he started chasing after them. He 1', 'At trial, Laughlin described the man as “pretty average;” not “noticeably tall or short or fat or thin, kind of like an average guy, probably 5’10”, 6 feet, * * * and average weight.”', '-2- said that, “[a]fter [running] the first block, the white male peeled off into a driveway[.]” 2 Nichols-Schmolze continued to pursue the man with the bag, who was “turning corners around the block.” After one of the corners, the man “turned left down a driveway” and out of Nichols- Schmolze’s sight.', 'Nichols-Schmolze testified that he then “slowly walked and kept [his] distance from the corner” of the house, where he “assumed” the man with the bag was hiding. As he “rounded the corner” of the house, he saw the man in a driveway “leaning up against the house holding the bag,” near “an overhead light.” Nichols-Schmolze testified that he was ten feet from the man with the bag, and could see his face clearly, in what “could have been five seconds, [or] it could have been [fifteen].”', 'According to Nichols-Schmolze, the man then “threw the bag towards [him] and it landed at [his] feet[,]” and then the man “started jogging out [of] the driveway and back towards * * * where the original incident had happened.” Nichols-Schmolze followed the man, encountering Laughlin on the way. Nichols-Schmolze said that he handed Laughlin the bag and told him to ensure that his belongings were not missing. Nichols-Schmolze testified that, after encountering Laughlin, the black male was “trailing” him and kept threatening that he still had a gun.', 'Nichols-Schmolze said he saw the man “get out a set of keys” and get into a silver sedan. At trial, Nichols-Schmolze could not recall the license plate number, but he testified that he “screamed the license plate number out loud” and he heard Laughlin, who was on the phone with 911 at the time, relay the number to the 911 dispatcher. 3 The man then drove off.', 'Providence Police Det. Charles Matracia testified that he was assigned to investigate the robbery “shortly after the incident occurred.” Detective Matracia indicated that the license plate 2', 'Nichols-Schmolze testified that he “did not [continue] pursu[ing] [the white male] because he didn’t have the bag.” 3', 'The 911 recording was proffered at trial, in which Laughlin informs the dispatcher that the man drove off in a “silver” car, license plate number “675 063.”', '-3- number was entered into the Division of Motor Vehicles database and that the registration “came back to a Dena Magiera,” owner of a silver Nissan. 4 Magiera’s information was then entered into a police database, where it was discovered that defendant was “involved with that registration”—particularly, that Magiera and defendant were in a “domestic relationship.” Detective Matracia testified that he pulled a picture of defendant, placed it into a photo array, and showed it to the roommates. 5', 'The day after the robbery, according to Det. Matracia, he met with Nichols-Schmolze to review the photo array. Detective Matracia testified that, before he showed Nichols-Schmolze any photos, Nichols-Schmolze read a “photo lineup instruction sheet,” which he signed and dated.', 'Detective Matracia testified that, “when it came to [defendant’s picture], [Nichols- Schmolze] immediately recognized that photograph, stating that that was the person that robbed him.” 6 A few days later, Laughlin was shown the photo array, but was “unable to identify anyone.”', 'The defendant was arraigned on March 28, 2013, on charges of second-degree robbery in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-39-1(b). A two-day trial commenced in the Superior Court on July 8, 2015, after which a jury found defendant guilty as charged.', 'On September 3, 2015, 4', 'Magiera also testified at trial. She testified that she “was in a relationship with” defendant for two years. In addition, she also testified that she owned a silver 2008 Nissan Altima, license plate number 675 063, which defendant used “like every day” and to which he had access on the day of the robbery. 5', 'Detective Matracia clarified at trial that he assembled the photo array according to normal procedure; that is, taking the suspect’s information and characteristics, entering it into the police database, which would yield a number of photographs of persons matching the suspect’s characteristics.

Further, defendant notes that Nichols-Schmolze’s identification of the robber was based primarily upon his observation of the man for at most fifteen seconds on a dark night, during which brief period the man threw the bag at Nichols-Schmolze, who “immediately began checking the bag’s contents,” thereby distracting his focus.', 'In denying defendant’s motion, the trial justice found “that there was more than sufficient evidence” to support the conviction.

22,v. : Mary Macera.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. Mark Quillen (plaintiff) appeals from a Superior Court judgment in favor of Mary Macera (defendant), the beneficiary of an Amica Insurance Company (Amica) annuity policy created by Domenic Zubiago (Mr. Zubiago), the plaintiff’s great-uncle and the defendant’s brother. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'Among other assets accumulated during his twenty-five-year career with the Providence Police Department and subsequent twenty-five years as a security officer for Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Rhode Island, Mr. Zubiago owned two Amica annuity policies. At the time of his death, one account was valued at approximately $360,000 and the other at $20,000; only the larger account is the subject of this appeal. The two annuities were opened approximately a', '-1- decade apart and each named Mr. Zubiago’s sister, Emelia, as the primary beneficiary. After Emelia’s death in 2002, Mr. Zubiago executed two change-of-beneficiary forms naming defendant, his younger sister, as the beneficiary of both policies.', 'The plaintiff is Mr. Zubiago’s grandnephew. He testified at the nonjury trial that, in May 2004, he received a telephone call from Mr. Zubiago requesting plaintiff’s personal information because Mr. Zubiago “was going to put [plaintiff’s] name on an account * * *.” Approximately five or six months later, according to plaintiff, he learned that he had been named beneficiary of the two annuities.', 'Donald Zubiago, Mr. Zubiago’s nephew, also testified. 1 He stated that, in early 2008, his uncle called him and said, “I screwed up.', 'I left [plaintiff] too much money.”', 'Donald recommended that his uncle see a lawyer. He also testified that Mr. Zubiago later told him that he had taken care of it.', 'Two Amica employees testified about Mr. Zubiago’s request for beneficiary-change forms in September 2009. Maria Shurick said that she received a telephone call from defendant, whom she mistakenly identified on a call sheet as “Mary Zubiago,” requesting beneficiary forms for both policies. The request was for forms in which the name of the intended beneficiary is left blank, as opposed to forms in which the name of the new beneficiary is preprinted by Amica. Sarah Driscoll testified that several days later she received a telephone call from Mr. Zubiago in which he authorized her to speak with his sister, Mary, because he had a speech impediment.', 'The defendant testified that she did not remember any telephone conversations with Amica representatives in which she requested beneficiary-change forms for her brother’s annuity policies. She did state that she would sometimes initiate telephone calls for Mr. Zubiago because 1', 'We shall refer to Donald Zubiago by his first name to avoid confusion; no disrespect is intended.', '-2- of his speech impediment, but that she would give the telephone to him and then leave the room, never listening to his conversations. The defendant further testified that, after he received the appropriate forms, Mr. Zubiago asked her to fill in her name, address, and social security number on them. She was adamant, however, that she did not read the forms other than, perhaps, the top line, which said “Amica.” Both forms were subsequently signed by Mr. Zubiago, witnessed, and recorded with Amica.', 'On April 29, 2013, Mr. Zubiago died testate, leaving defendant as the sole beneficiary of the two Amica annuity policies. Shortly thereafter, plaintiff contacted Amica to notify it of Mr. Zubiago’s passing and was informed that he was not listed as a beneficiary of the annuities. On the day after Mr. Zubiago’s funeral, plaintiff confronted defendant; and, on November 14, 2013, he filed a complaint against her alleging forgery, fraud, manipulation, false pretenses, and misrepresentation. The plaintiff also alleged a lack of intent on the part of Mr. Zubiago.', 'A trial was held before a Superior Court justice sitting without a jury in January 2015. On the third day of trial, plaintiff filed, without objection by defendant, an amended complaint alleging that the beneficiary-change forms were executed by Mr. Zubiago through mistake or inadvertence. The trial justice filed a written decision on February 2, 2015; and, on February 4, 2015, final judgment entered in favor of defendant. Subsequently, the trial justice heard and denied plaintiff’s motion for a new trial, and plaintiff timely appealed.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“[I]t is well settled that [t]his Court will not disturb the findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury unless such findings are clearly erroneous or unless the trial justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence * * *.” Gregoire v.

(quoting Franco, 840 A.2d at 1112).', '-4-', 'III', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Application of Law', 'The plaintiff first argues that the trial justice misconstrued his theory of the case and thereby erred by applying the wrong law to the evidence. The plaintiff contends that the trial justice erroneously focused on the issue of undue influence and failed to consider that Mr. Zubiago made a mistake due to a lack of testamentary intent. The plaintiff, as did the trial justice, cites to Illinois State Trust Co. v. Conaty, 104 F. Supp. 729, 733 (D. R.I. 1952), for the proposition that the validity of a testamentary gift “is not affected by a mistake unless fraud or undue influence was perpetrated upon the testator or the mistake involves a want of testamentary intent.” The plaintiff asserts that he presented no evidence pertaining to undue influence, but that he “proffered material evidence proving [Mr. Zubiago] lacked the testamentary intent to eliminate [p]laintiff from receiving at least a portion of the [a]nnuity.” On appeal, he suggests that Mr. Zubiago “may have thought he was adding [defendant] as a second name on the [a]nnuity, not eliminating [p]laintiff as beneficiary.”', 'We first note that changing a beneficiary designation in an annuity policy is a matter of contract and does not ordinarily implicate issues relating to the construction of wills. Secondly, we observe that plaintiff’s original complaint alleged fraud “by trick or device by * * * defendant,” manipulation, forgery, misrepresentation, and false pretenses.', 'Although he did allege “mistake and or inadvertence” in an amended complaint, filed on the third day of trial, he never abandoned his original claims; rather, he incorporated them by reference.', '-5-', 'More significantly, we are satisfied that the trial justice considered, yet rejected, the possibility that Mr. Zubiago had changed the beneficiary of his annuities by mistake or inadvertence. The trial justice concluded that “[t]here was simply no evidence put forth at trial that would explain [Mr. Zubiago’s] change of heart. What is clear, however, is that Mr. Zubiago was very deliberate in planning his estate and in changing the beneficiary designations on the two annuity contracts at issue.” The trial justice referenced the evidence that Mr. Zubiago had sought out by himself the two individuals who would witness the change-of-beneficiary forms, that he personally spoke to Amica before executing the forms, that he did not involve defendant in his estate planning, and that he told his nephew, Donald, that he had “screwed up” by giving plaintiff too much money. We afford deference to the factual findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury. Pelletier v. Laureanno, 46 A.3d 28, 35 (R.I. 2012). Here, we perceive no cause to disturb the trial justice’s finding that “the evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that Mr. Zubiago was an independent, hard-working, and kind-hearted man, who acted with great deliberation in planning his estate.” We conclude therefore that plaintiff’s claim fails from a lack of proof, rather than from the trial justice’s misapplication of the law to the evidence.', 'B', 'Consideration of Material Evidence', 'The plaintiff next argues that the trial justice erred in overlooking and misconceiving material evidence pertaining to one of the beneficiary-change forms. The plaintiff asserts that the trial justice erroneously referred, in his decision, to the beneficiary-change form as a “preprinted” annuity form on which the name of the beneficiary had been printed by Amica, when in fact the name of the intended beneficiary was blank on the forms sent by Amica. The plaintiff contends that this fact is crucial as it contributes to the totality of the circumstances that prove that Mr. Zubiago lacked the testamentary intent to disinherit plaintiff. The plaintiff', '-6- explains that, had the form been preprinted with defendant’s name and information, it would be clear that Mr. Zubiago intended the annuity to go to defendant alone. However, because the form was blank, plaintiff asserts, it tends to indicate mistake on the part of Mr. Zubiago to disinherit plaintiff.', 'At a hearing on plaintiff’s motion to clarify, the trial justice conceded that he had mischaracterized the forms as preprinted but stated that it did “not materially or otherwise change [the] court’s view of the facts[.]” Thereafter, at the hearing on plaintiff’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice further explained that the question of whether the forms were preprinted or blank was not dispositive. He noted that Mr. Zubiago lived for another three years after he removed plaintiff as the beneficiary, yet he made no attempt to restore his grandnephew as a beneficiary of the annuities or otherwise provide for him in any way. Moreover, the trial justice indicated that Mr. Zubiago “continued to confide and trust his sister with his finances.” Here, the trial justice acknowledged his mistake and emphatically declared that it did not alter his ultimate conclusion. We discern no reason to vacate the judgment.', 'C', 'Judicial Notice', 'Also, plaintiff argues that the trial justice erred in failing to take judicial notice of the findings made by another Superior Court justice after a hearing on plaintiff’s request for a preliminary injunction. 2', 'Significantly, plaintiff contends that the following statement by the hearing justice remains the law of the case: 2', 'We shall refer to the justice who presided over the preliminary injunction hearing as the hearing justice.', '-7-', '“clearly a prima facie case has been established, that at least there', 'has been a mistake or there is an issue as to what prompted a', 'change of beneficiary forms where both parties to this action have', 'testified that it was the intention of Mr. Zubiago to leave monies to', '* * * [plaintiff].” Further, plaintiff argues that, because defendant “failed to produce evidence to rebut the prima facie evidence that indeed there was a mistake,” the “prima facie evidence should have prevailed.”', '“The law of the case doctrine [provides] that, ‘after a judge has decided an interlocutory matter in a pending suit, a second judge, confronted at a later stage of the suit with the same question in the identical manner, should refrain from disturbing the first ruling.’” Chavers v. Fleet Bank (RI), N.A., 844 A.2d 666, 677 (R.I. 2004) (quoting Paolella v. Radiologic Leasing Associates, 769 A.2d 596, 599 (R.I. 2001)). The purpose of the doctrine is to ensure “the stability of decisions and avoid[] unseemly contests between judges that could result in a loss of public confidence in the judiciary.” Commercial Union Insurance Co. v. Pelchat, 727 A.2d 676, 683 (R.I. 1999). We have noted, however, that it “is a flexible rule that may be disregarded when a subsequent ruling can be based on an expanded record.” Berman v. Sitrin, 101 A.3d 1251, 1262 (R.I. 2014) (quoting Lynch v. Spirit Rent-A-Car, Inc., 965 A.2d 417, 424 (R.I. 2009)).', 'In this case, we agree with the trial justice that it would have been inappropriate for him to apply the law-of-the-case doctrine to the factual findings made by the hearing justice at the hearing for a preliminary injunction. Not only did the trial justice have an expanded record before him, but the issues involved in the two proceedings were markedly different such that it cannot be said that the trial justice was presented with the same question in an identical manner. The trial justice was addressing the ultimate merits of plaintiff’s claims, whereas the hearing', '-8- justice was tasked with determining whether to issue a preliminary injunction preventing defendant from distributing funds in the annuity accounts. Significantly, the hearing justice did not purport to decide the merits, stating rather, “[w]hat transpired is an issue that needs to be left to discovery and a decision on the merits.”', 'To the extent that plaintiff predicates his argument on the Rules of Evidence concerning judicial notice, he fares no better. Rule 201(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence states: “[a] judicially noticed fact must be one not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either (1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.” Although this Court has recognized that a court may take judicial notice of court records, “we have said that judicial notice should ‘only apply to those aspects of a court record that cannot be reasonably disputed.’” Curreri v. Saint, 126 A.3d 482, 486 (R.I. 2015) (quoting In re Michael A., 552 A.2d 368, 370 (R.I. 1989)). “These would include judgments previously entered by the court that have the effect of res adjudicata * * * pleadings or answers to interrogatories by a party, which pleading or answer might constitute an admission (whether or not superseded by a later pleading or answer) * * *.” Id. (quoting In re Michael A., 552 A.2d at 370).', 'For the reasons stated above in our discussion of the law-of-the-case doctrine, we are of the opinion that the trial justice did not err in refusing to take judicial notice of the factual findings made by the hearing justice at the hearing on the preliminary injunction. As noted, the hearing justice did not make an express determination as to who would prevail, because that was not the issue before the court. Moreover, the trial justice made his findings after more discovery had been conducted and a more complete record was before the court.', '-9-', 'D', 'Burden of Proof', 'Additionally, plaintiff asserts in his supplemental statement that the burden of proof should have shifted to defendant to prove absence of mistake because defendant and Mr. Zubiago had a “confidential relationship.” 3 Although Mr. Zubiago clearly trusted and confided in defendant, there is no evidence that he relied on her advice in his financial affairs. Indeed, defendant testified that he was “very quiet about his things,” never discussed his estate planning with her, nor had he told her what accounts he had.', 'Also, the cases cited by plaintiff do not support his assertion. For instance, in Huebel, this Court determined that the grantee’s failure to testify warranted an unfavorable inference where the gift of the entire estate went to a nonrelative at the exclusion of any benefit under the will to the testatrix’s niece, who was also the testatrix’s sole heir and next of kin, and “who was dependent for her support on [the] testatrix.” Huebel v. Baldwin, 45 R.I. 40, 44, 119 A. 639, 641 (1923). This Court explained that the exclusion of the testatrix’s niece was also “inconsistent with the expressed intention of the testatrix” and determined that “the nature of the will [wa]s so unusual and * * * indicative of such a departure from what appear[ed] to be the real, complete, and present intention of the testatrix, that one instinctively seeks for an explanation * * *.” Id. at 45, 119 A. at 641. Here, however, there is no evidence of any unusual circumstance tending to indicate that defendant should bear the burden of proving why decedent named her as 3', 'To support his assertion, plaintiff cites: Passarelli v. Passarelli, 94 R.I. 157, 161-62, 179 A.2d 330, 332-33 (1962) (relationship between illiterate, aged mother and son was not fiduciary in character); McDonough v. McDonough, 88 R.I. 243, 248-49, 146 A.2d 234, 238 (1958) (parent and child relationship, alone, is insufficient to relieve complainant from burden of proving fraud, duress, or overreaching); Earle v. Chace, 12 R.I. 374, 379 (1879) (grantee has burden when holding confidential relationship to grantor); and Huebel v. Baldwin, 45 R.I. 40, 119 A. 639 (1923).', '- 10 - beneficiary. Therefore, we find no error on the part of the Superior Court in refusing to shift the burden of proof.', 'E', 'Credibility Determination', 'Finally, the plaintiff asserts in his supplemental statement that the trial justice erred in finding that the defendant was “[f]orthright and [c]redible.” The plaintiff’s citation of a quote by John Adams 4 and a list of facts and testimony by the defendant, which the plaintiff contends are conflicting, do not sway this Court to ignore the clear credibility determination of the Superior Court and replace it with our own. Our review of the record does not persuade us that the trial justice was clearly wrong or that he misconceived or overlooked material evidence. See Gregoire, 138 A.3d at 191. Accordingly, we cannot say that the trial justice erred in finding that the defendant was “[f]orthright and [c]redible.”', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court and remand the papers thereto. 4', 'The quotation cited by plaintiff is: “Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passions, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.” John Barlett, Familiar Quotations 337 (16th ed.

(Victor Properties or defendant), appeals from a final judgment in favor of the plaintiff, Plainfield Pike Development, LLC (Plainfield or plaintiff). The plaintiff had filed a declaratory- judgment action seeking adjudication regarding its use of a roadway over the defendant’s abutting property. The matter was tried before the Superior Court, and the trial justice found that the plaintiff had an easement or right-of-way over this roadway and that its use of the right-of- way was not limited to a specific use. On appeal, the defendant does not dispute the finding that the plaintiff has a right-of-way over its roadway; instead, the defendant asserts that the proposed use of said right-of-way by the plaintiff “is an unreasonable extension of the use intended by the parties when the easement was originally created in 1922.”', 'This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided.

The defendant owns abutting property located to the north and along the easterly side of plaintiff’s lot No. 90, designated as Plat No. 29, lot No. 11.1 Ingress and egress to lot No. 11 are by way of a roughly 400-foot-long roadway from Plainfield Pike, which is at times referred to as “Elks Lane.” This roadway abuts the easterly boundary of lot No. 90 and is the subject of this dispute (herein, the right-of-way or easement). After purchasing lots No. 53 and 90 and obtaining the necessary approvals, plaintiff began the construction of an automobile repair facility known as Protech Automotive Services (Protech). At some time thereafter, when construction had already commenced, defendant erected a fence preventing access to the right-of-way.', 'On September 17, 2009, plaintiff filed a two-count declaratory-judgment action against defendant in Superior Court. The plaintiff sought a declaration that it had the right to use the right-of-way on lot No. 11 (count 1) and a declaration of the extent it could use the right-of-way (count 2). In its answer to the complaint, in addition to seeking a declaration that the right-of- way did not exist over its lot, defendant raised several defenses, including that the failure of plaintiff, and its predecessors in interest, to use or maintain the right-of-way constituted an abandonment of said right-of-way. 1', 'See Appendix A.', '-2-', 'A', 'Trial Testimony', 'On October 26, 2011, the matter proceeded to a jury-waived trial.

Through Mercier, several deeds entered as exhibits, including an April 11, 1922, deed conveying lots No. 53 and 90 (then lot No. 12), 2 to Giuseppe Iannelli and Domenico Cardillo.', 'This deed expressly conveyed the right-of-way, providing, in relevant part:', '“with the right to said grantees, their heirs, executors,', 'administrators, and assigns to use the roadway with teams and', 'otherwise, running through said other land of the said Lena', 'Weeden and Esther Frances Weeden [(then owners of lot No. 11)],', 'they paying one-half of the expense of maintaining said roadway', '* * *.” A July 31, 1922, deed conveying lot No. 11 also contained language indicating that such lot was the servient property to an easement granted to the owners of lot No. 12. Specifically, the deed provided that “[t]his conveyance is made subject to the right of Giuseppe Iannelli and Domenico Cardillo [(then owners of lot No. 12)], their heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, to use the roadway running through the premises described with teams or otherwise * * *.” During cross-examination, Mercier acknowledged that some of the subsequent deeds in the chain of title to the pertinent lots did not reference the right-of-way.', 'Peter Nolan, an experienced title attorney who was also qualified as an expert, opined that the right-of-way existed over lot No. 11 for the benefit of lot No. 90. He explained that he formed his opinion after he reviewed the abstract prepared by Mercier, as well as after visiting 2', 'Lot No. 12 was later subdivided into four lots, including plaintiff’s lots No. 53 and 90. See infra n. 6.', '-3- the site. He testified that, in his opinion, the easement ran with the land for the benefit of plaintiff’s lot No. 90, the right-of-way was not limited to a particular use or scope, and it “can be used for most [sic] anything.” He further opined that the right-of-way had not been abandoned due to its non-inclusion in the chain of title and that it was “still transferred to subsequent grantees even though not specifically recited.” He also testified that there was no indication that the right-of-way was limited to farm use.', 'Eric Colburn, a professional land surveyor with roughly twenty-eight years of experience, was plaintiff’s final witness. He was retained to provide his expert opinion regarding the location and scope of the right-of-way. He opined “that the right-of-way begins * * * at Plainfield Pike and runs northerly along the narrow strip that is Lot 11, and then abuts around the backside of what used to be Lot 12 and is now Lot 90, and continues outside of the area that [he] investigated.” He formed his opinion after reviewing aerial maps dating back to 1939, several surveys, and the pertinent deeds. Colburn opined that the right-of-way appeared to be 22.75 feet wide—the distance between the lot lines on lot No. 11. He also took note of the reference to the Rhode Island Ice Company in the 1939 title to lot No. 11. He explained that this was “pertinent to the fact that there was an ice company operational on * * * Lot 11, and * * * it indicate[d] a commercial use of that land * * *.” Following Colburn’s testimony, plaintiff rested its case.', 'William Wilbur, the project developer for the Protech facility, was defendant’s first witness. He explained the process that he undertook on behalf of plaintiff to obtain the proper permits to construct the Protech facility, including petitioning the Zoning Board of the Town of Johnston (the board) for a special-use permit. He described his duties and responsibilities as the developer of Protech, which included assembling a team to build the structure; he also described the tasks each team member was responsible for and ultimately fulfilled as part of the project.', '-4- He attested that, to his knowledge, no one had asked defendant for permission or approval to use the access (over the right-of-way) depicted on the site plan.', 'He recalled that, during the construction of the Protech facility, he contacted his attorney to complain that the right-of-way was being blocked and that he needed access to it.', 'Jeffrey Campopiano, a professional civil engineer, was the next witness. After being qualified as an expert, he testified that he had previously drafted a preliminary and final plan for the development of lot No. 12 and that, at the request of defense counsel, he had performed research to determine the length and width of the right-of-way over lot No. 11. He described the process he used to make his determination, which included accessing historic photographs in the Rhode Island Geographical Information System database, as well as reviewing the site plan and relevant deeds. He concluded that, in his opinion, the right-of-way was “less than 20 feet, probably about 10 feet wide.” He explained that, historically, farm easements were used to gain access to water, and he recalled this specific right-of-way being used to access the pond for ice.', 'Ralph Cuculo, a title attorney who prepared the deed transferring lot No. 11 to Victor Properties, opined “that the easement existed or maybe still exist[s] for the benefit of Lot 12.” He explained that his opinion is based on the language of the April 11, 1922 deed. He testified that he had his “doubts” about whether the easement ran with the land.', 'Peter Vassilopoulos, who owns and operates a local marina, testified that he gave the president and sole shareholder of Victor Properties, Nicola Ricci, a mortgage to lot No. 11 in March 2009. He testified that he believed Ricci’s prior mortgage on lot No. 11 “had come due and they were forcing foreclosure.” He also attested that, around that same time, he received an', '-5- offer from Chris Bodine (a partner at BTN Development, LLC 3) to purchase the mortgage. He further stated that the current status of the mortgage at the time of trial was overdue or “due in full.”', 'Ricci testified that he could not sell lot No. 11 because he was in litigation and that, if the Court were to find that there was an easement over lot No. 11, this finding would affect his property “[i]mmensely on a daily basis.” He explained that he stores dump trucks, payloaders, excavators, and heavy equipment on his lot. He testified that the right-of-way is not wide enough for there to be a two-vehicle lane. He claimed that “[i]t would be very difficult for [them] to go in and out with [their] big trucks and big machinery, and having other cars in and out of it.” On cross-examination, Ricci acknowledged that he was aware of the board hearing relating to plaintiff’s proposed construction of lot No. 12 and that it was his own decision not to attend the hearings after he concluded that the proposed project did not pertain to him. He also testified that he had signed a purchase and sale agreement to personally purchase lots No. 53 and 90, and that he was seeking to litigate that matter. Thereafter, five witnesses were presented under subpoena, and several exhibits were authenticated. 4', 'Finally, Joseph Iannelli was the last witness to be presented. He testified that his father was Giuseppe Iannelli (a previous owner of lot No. 12) and that his father farmed the land on Plainfield Pike in Johnston for forty years until he gave the land to his sons. He testified that, 3', 'BTN Development, LLC, (BTN Development) owned lots No. 53 and 90 in 2008, and was the entity that sold these lots to plaintiff in 2009. 4', 'These witnesses included: Holli Stott, employed by the town of Johnston, who authenticated the records of the zoning and planning boards; Mark Welch, employed by the Secretary of State, who presented certified copies of business records that were later authenticated with affidavits; Edward Pimentel, employed by plaintiff to assist in the zoning applications; Anthony Muscatelli, employed by the International Mapping and Survey Corporation, who authenticated the site plan he had prepared; and Robert Clinton, a traffic and transportation engineer retained by plaintiff to perform a traffic study.', '-6- while farming the land, they took Elks Road, which was an old dirt right-of-way, from the main road down to the pond so they could water their farm. He testified that, at that time, the road “wasn’t too wide[,] * * * [a] small truck could go down through there [or] a horse and team,” but that it could not be used as a two-way road. He attested that they traveled over the road with a horse and wagon or tractor used to cultivate the farm.', 'The trial concluded, and both parties filed written submissions to the trial justice.', 'B', 'Superior Court Decision', 'Over four years later, the trial justice issued a written decision in favor of plaintiff, and her findings of fact may be summarized as follows. The trial justice began her decision by describing the property at issue and following the chain of title to lots No. 11 and 12.', 'As it relates to lot No. 11, “[t]he first relevant deed dates back to November 24, 1916[,]” and a subsequent deed was recorded on July 31, 1922, and includes language that lot No. 11 was subject to a right-of-way granted to lot No. 12. Following the 1922 deed, a deed was recorded in 1939 that states: “[s]aid tract or parcel of land [was] subject, however, to the right of [Giuseppe] Iannelli and Domenico Cardillo [(then owners of lot No. 12)], their heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, to use the roadway running through the premises above described with teams or otherwise, they paying one half of the expense of maintaining said roadway.” The trial justice found that the subsequent deeds in 1955, 1962, and 1963 all had similar or identical language relating to the right-of-way.', 'In 1970, an agreement between Cranston Print Works Company and May Volatile (then- owner of lot No. 11) described that an easement over lot No. 11:', '“shall be twenty-three feet (23) in width and shall extend in a', 'northerly direction across the land of MAY VOLATILE from the', '-7-', 'northerly line of Plainfield Turnpike, also known as Plainfield', 'Pike, to Simmons Lower Reservoir and running adjacent to the', 'easterly line of said land of MAY VOLATILE. Said easement,', 'wherever it is in a common right of way, will be reserved to the', 'use of CRANSTON PRINT WORKS COMPANY, MAY', 'VOLATILE and owners of property abutting such easement, and', 'their respective heirs, executors, administrators and assigns.”', '(Herein, “1970 Agreement.”)', 'Subsequent sales were made, and deeds were recorded in 1970 and 1972—neither of which contained a reference to the right-of-way. In 1981, 1987, and 1988, deeds were recorded indicating that the lot was subject to a right-of-way. The next deed in evidence was recorded in 2003 and referenced the sale of lot No. 11 to Victor Properties. Such deed provides that “said tract or parcel of land is subject also to the right to use the roadway running through the demised premises, with teams or otherwise, as set forth in [the] deed * * * dated July 31, 1922 * * *.”', 'With respect to lot No. 12, which, as previously noted, was later subdivided to include plaintiff’s present lots No. 53 and 90, the trial justice found that an April 11, 1922 deed “expressly conveyed the right-of-way over Lot 11” and that lot No. 12 was “used for a farming business.” Three other deeds were recorded between 1922 and 1989, two of which did not reference the right-of-way whereas one did. 5 In 2008, lots No. 53 and 90 were conveyed to BTN Development and recorded with no reference to the right-of-way. Finally, in 2009, plaintiff purchased lots No. 53 and 90 from BTN Development, and such deed also did not contain language pertaining to the right-of-way.', 'After plaintiff purchased lots No. 53 and 90, it applied for a special-use permit from the board for the construction of the Protech facility.', 'After holding a public hearing on the 5', 'In 1956, a portion of lot No. 12 was deeded with no reference to the right-of-way (today’s lot No. 53). The remaining portion of lot No. 12 was deeded in 1963 and contained “language evidencing and conveying the right-of-way.” Then, in 1989, two deeds were recorded—one deed granting a portion of lot No. 12 (now lot No. 90); the other deed dealing with the remaining portion of lot No. 12.', '-8- application, the board “unanimously approved [p]laintiff’s [s]pecial [u]se [p]ermit.” Although one of the site plans during the application process contained a notation that “approval from owner of * * * Lot 11, will be required for this access” over the right-of-way, the site plan ultimately submitted and approved did not contain this language.', 'In her written decision, the trial justice assessed plaintiff’s witnesses; she found them to be “distinguished in their fields of work” and their testimony “compelling.” Specifically, the trial justice found that Nolan “credibly and convincingly opined that the easement over Lot 11 exists and that it runs with the land, to wit, the owner of Lot 12 and its successors in title, including the present owner of Lot 90.”', 'The trial justice further found the testimony of surveyors Colburn and Muscatelli credible and persuasive, including Colburn’s calculation that the easement was 22.75 feet wide and Muscatelli’s opinion as to the location of the easement.', 'On the other hand, the trial justice found defendant’s “evidence deficient in many regards,” and noted that the testimony of Ricci was “less than persuasive and continually lacking [in] focus.” The trial justice further noted that defendant “presented no credible evidence that the * * * [b]oard, in granting the [s]pecial [u]se [p]ermit, had relied upon the particular site plan which stated that [p]laintiff’s use of Elks Lane as ingress/egress ‘required approval of owner of Lot 11,’ or that Ricci in any way relied upon any similar statements in the approval process * * *.”', 'The trial justice concluded that an easement existed “over Lot 11 for the benefit of * * * Lot 12, including [p]laintiff as the present owner of Lots 53 and 90,” and that the easement was “22.75 feet in width and extend[ed] in a northerly direction over Lot 11 from the northerly line of Plainfield Turnpike, also known as Plainfield Pike, to the Simmons Lower Reservoir, running adjacent to the boundary between Lot 11 and Lot 10 (to the east of Lot 11).” She found that', '-9- “[t]he clear and convincing evidence of record establishe[d] that the easement is appurtenant; it is not specific to any holder, and it runs with the land.” She additionally found that, “[a]s there was no evidence presented that there was an unequivocal intent to abandon the easement, * * * the easement over Lot 11 ha[d] not been abandoned.”', 'Relating to the scope of the easement, the trial justice found that “the easement exists over the ‘roadway’ that is continually and consistently referenced in the deeds, and which roadway was at one time named as ‘Elks Lane,’” and that it was not limited to a specific use, as the original 1922 deed of conveyance stated it was to be used “with teams and otherwise.” The trial justice specifically noted that there was no restriction on the use of the easement described in any of the recorded instruments introduced into evidence. Final judgment entered for plaintiff, and defendant filed a timely notice of appeal to this Court.', 'III', 'Analysis', 'A', 'Scope of the Right-of-Way', 'As noted, on appeal defendant does not challenge the existence of the right-of-way over lot No. 11 for the benefit of plaintiff’s property. Instead, defendant argues that the proposed use of the right-of-way by plaintiff is an “unreasonable extension of the use intended by the parties when the [right-of-way] was originally created in 1922” and that the trial justice “drew [an] erroneous conclusion that using the easement as a means of ingress and egress to this automotive repair business was a reasonable application of the easement[’]s intended purpose.”', 'The defendant maintains that some of the evidence cited by the trial justice in reaching her decision was clearly erroneous. Specifically, defendant challenges the conclusion that the “Rhode Island Ice Land Co. and the Elks Lodge Co., benefited from the existence of the easement when in fact', '- 10 - these businesses owned Lot 11 on which the easement was located.”', 'The defendant also challenges what it characterizes as the trial justice’s reliance on the 1970 Agreement with Cranston Print Works Company, when, in actuality, said agreement concerned a different right- of-way than the one at issue in this case.', '1. Standard of Review', '“A Superior Court decision granting or denying declaratory relief is reviewed with great deference by this Court.” Town Houses at Bonnet Shores Condominium Association v.

This Court has held that “where the easement is created by grant and is not limited in its extent or scope by the terms of the grant, it is available for the reasonable uses to which the dominant estate may be denoted.” Carpenter v. Hanslin, 900 A.2d 1136, 1148 (R.I. 2006).', '- 11 -', 'After a careful review of the evidence presented at trial, including the relevant deeds and testimony, we are of the opinion that the trial justice was not clearly wrong when she concluded that there is no restriction on the use of the right-of-way. As the trial justice noted, the April 11, 1922, deed clearly indicated that the right-of-way may be used “with teams and otherwise,” and several deeds in the chain of title to both lots contained identical or similar language. In the face of the numerous deeds that entered as trial exhibits, defendant is unable to point to a single deed containing limiting language. It is well-established that this lack of limiting language regarding its scope in the instrument creating the easement means that the right-of-way “is available for the reasonable uses to which the dominant estate may be denoted.” See Carpenter, 900 A.2d at 1148. The question of reasonableness is a question of fact to which we prescribe great deference. See Grady v. Narragansett Electric Co., 962 A.2d 34, 46 (R.I. 2009) (“Determining whether a use within an easement is reasonable or unreasonable is a question of fact to be determined by the trier of fact.”). Although defendant presented witnesses to testify regarding the historical use of the roadway as a means to access the pond for water, the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive material evidence when concluding that the easement was not limited to a specific use “such as water collection or ice hauling.”', 'Furthermore, defendant’s argument that the trial justice improperly considered Rhode Island Ice Land Company and the Elks Lodge’s nonfarming use of the right-of-way when these entities actually owned servient lot No. 11, is unavailing. After perusing the trial justice’s decision, it is clear to this Court that she made no such consideration. Instead, in the first paragraph under the subsection “Location and Scope of Deeded Right-of-Way Over Lot 11,” the trial justice summarized plaintiff’s position:', '“[The] [p]laintiff next seeks a declaration of the extent of its', 'permitted use of the easement over Lot 11. [The] [p]laintiff argues', '- 12 -', 'that the deeded right-of-way was not limited to a specific scope', 'because the phrase ‘with teams or otherwise’ demonstrates that the', 'easement could be used for any purpose. Further, [p]laintiff', 'presented evidence that the road was used by the Rhode Island Ice', 'Land Company and the Elk’s [sic] Lodge for purposes other than', 'farming, as further support that the easement must have been', 'granted for a wide variety of uses. Finally, [p]laintiff asserts that', '[d]efendant did not present any credible testimony that the', 'easement will be overburdened by [p]laintiff’s proposed use', 'because Ricci’s testimony on this point was self-serving.”', '(Emphasis added.) The trial justice continued, in the next paragraph, by summarizing defendant’s arguments; only after articulating the proper legal standard to determine the scope of the right-of-way, did the trial justice provide an analysis. Notably, nowhere in the trial justice’s analysis does she discuss Rhode Island Ice Land Company and the Elks Lodge’s use of the roadway.', 'Therefore, defendant’s argument that she erred in this regard is unpersuasive as this Court is not convinced that the trial justice considered this use in reaching her ultimate decision. Instead, it is evident from the written decision that the trial justice relied on the fact that no limitation was recorded in any instrument. 6', 'Moreover, defendant’s argument that the trial justice erred in relying on the 1970 Agreement describing a different easement granted to Cranston Print Works Company is also without merit. In her analysis, the trial justice noted that the language of the 1970 Agreement between May Volatile and Cranston Print Works Company was “clear and unambiguous” and 6', 'The trial justice’s parenthetical comment following her finding that no restrictions were recorded suggests that she may not have even considered extrinsic evidence regarding the extent of plaintiff’s permitted use of the right-of-way. The trial justice quoted Richards v. Halder, 853 A.2d 1206 (R.I. 2004), “It is true that where in a written instrument an easement of way is granted in express terms, the nature and extent of the easement thus established is to be determined primarily from the language used in the writing, and if the terms thereof are free from uncertainty and ambiguity, oral testimony is not admissible to explain the nature or extent of the easement granted.” Id. at 1210 (quoting Waterman v. Waterman, 93 R.I. 344, 349, 175 A.2d 291, 294 (1961)).', '- 13 - established that the right-of-way extends to the Simmons Lower Reservoir. At trial, Nolan’s undisputed expert opinion was that the easement granted to Cranston Print Works Company was a different easement than the right-of-way in this case. However, defendant does not request reversal of the trial justice’s determination regarding the location of the right-of-way, but instead focuses its appeal on the finding regarding its use. It is our opinion that the trial justice did not consider the 1970 Agreement in deciding whether the proposed use of the right-of-way was reasonable and we, therefore, reject defendant’s claim of error. 7', 'The trial justice’s finding that the right-of-way is not limited to a specific use was supported by the evidence adduced at trial, mainly the language of the pertinent deeds. Accordingly, we will not disturb this finding.', 'B', 'Judicial Estoppel', 'Next, defendant argues that plaintiff strategically did not mention the use of the right-of- way when it was before the board seeking relief to construct the Protech facility.', 'The defendant’s position is that plaintiff “used the Superior Court in a manner that clearly was designed to bypass the * * * [b]oard” and should have, therefore, been judicially estopped from bringing these claims in Superior Court. The defendant maintains that the trial justice was clearly wrong when she rejected his contention that the site plan relied upon by the board contained language that plaintiff needed to obtain permission from the owner of lot No. 11 for a specific access depicted over the right-of-way. The defendant claims that the trial justice erred in 7', 'To the extent the trial justice considered the terms of the 1970 Agreement to determine the location of the right-of-way and to conclude that the right-of-way “extends along the eastern boundary of Lot 11 all the way to the Simmons Lower Reservoir,” such determination was not appealed by either party and is not before us.

Machonis, in his capacity as President of Interstate Battery System of Central Mass., Inc., and Charles Trottier, in his capacity as District Manager of Interstate Battery System of Central Mass., Inc. (defendants). This breach-of- contract case stems from a dispute over an alleged commercial lease agreement (lease) between the plaintiffs, owners of property located at 492 Reservoir Avenue in Cranston, Rhode Island (the premises), and the defendants, who plaintiffs contend breached the terms of the lease. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'A', 'The Corporate Enigma', 'Before discussing the facts pertinent to this appeal, we briefly outline the confusing set of corporate entity-defendants that undergird this case.', 'The defendant Kenneth Machonis was the president of Interstate Battery System of Central Mass., Inc., located at 139 Washington Street in Auburn, Massachusetts, which Machonis described as a wholesale car-battery distributorship that routinely serviced racks of batteries and delivered them to commercial garages. Machonis organized a separate corporation, Evanna, Inc., to “distance a new program from [his] existing corporation of many years.” This “new program” was Interstate All Battery Center, a retail operation that sold a broader array of batteries than Interstate Battery System of Central Mass., Inc., including batteries for cars, cellphones, laptops, watches, etc. 1', 'In his deposition, Machonis explained that Evanna, Inc., which was incorporated under the laws of Massachusetts, was doing business as Interstate All Battery Center. In other words, as former employee Charles Trottier 2 explained, Interstate All Battery Center was a franchise and “just the name of the stores,” and it was part of Evanna, Inc. Additionally, Machonis indicated that he operated an Interstate All Battery Center, separate and distinct from the wholesale distributorship, at 139 Washington Street in Auburn, Massachusetts, the same location 1', 'It appears that Interstate All Battery Center operates nationwide as franchises that are available through yet another corporation, Interstate Battery Franchising & Development, Inc., a subsidiary of Retail Acquisition & Development, Inc., which is a subsidiary of Interstate Battery System International, Inc. 2', 'Trottier worked for Interstate Battery System of Central Mass., Inc. for approximately three to four years under the title of “district sales” or “regional sales.”', '-2- as that of Interstate Battery System of Central Mass., Inc.

Branch Trustee,” and the tenant as both “Interstate Battery Center” and “Interstate Battery,” with the latter appearing above a line for the tenant’s signature. The exhibit described the property’s “[p]ermitted [u]se” as the “[s]ale of goods, products and services of Interstate Battery’s product lines.”', 'Joseph Branch, plaintiff Albert Branch’s son, claimed that he had negotiated the lease with defendants on plaintiffs’ behalf. 5 In his deposition, Branch stated that he had dealt directly with Trottier, whom he knew as the district manager of “Interstate Battery.” He described Trottier as “the one man that was in charge, anything, I go through him as far as leases and 3', 'We note that, prior to allegedly entering into the lease with plaintiffs, defendants had already occupied the premises. On or about July 1, 2004, Evanna, Inc. entered into a sublease agreement (sublease) with JN Phillips Auto Glass for Interstate All Battery Center to operate on a portion of the premises. The final page of the sublease bears Machonis’s signature and states, under lessee “Evanna, Inc. Kenneth Machonis, President.” 4', 'It is noteworthy that the lease appears to begin with a page numbered “2.” Additionally, the opening page of the lease specifies: “THIS LEASE is hereby made as of the Execution Date referred to in the Lease Data Exhibit attached to the front of this Lease and made a part hereof, by and between the Landlord and Tenant named in said Lease Data Exhibit.” (Emphasis added.) 5', 'To avoid confusion, we shall refer to Joseph Branch by his last name; when discussing his father, Albert Branch, we shall include his full name.', '-3- whatnot.” When asked whether Trottier wore anything that distinguished him from the other Interstate All Battery Center employees when they met on the premises, Branch stated, “He had a cell phone on his side, and just looked like he was in charge, just by appearance and perception.” He also noted that Trottier had a “green Interstate Battery shirt on and black khakis” and recalled that Trottier gave him his business card listing the title, “District Manager.” Branch also noted, however, that, when he asked Trottier whether he wanted to extend the rental of the property, Trottier emphasized that he would need to confer with his boss because “he couldn’t give [him] a decision himself.” Although Branch did not know who Trottier’s boss was, he stated that Trottier made it clear that “his boss would make the decisions.”', 'Branch stated that Trottier indicated during their next conversation that his boss was interested in extending the lease; so Branch prepared a lease and met Trottier at the premises. According to Branch, Trottier indicated that he needed to take the lease to the Auburn location for a signature “by whoever took care of his end of it.” Branch noted that no one signed the lease in his presence and that he was unaware of whose signature appeared on it; however, he confirmed that his father’s signature was not on the lease. Regarding the signature on the exhibit, Branch indicated that “Albert J. Branch Trustee” appeared to be his father’s signature. He could not, however, make out whose signature appeared as “Tenant.”', 'Although Branch confirmed that he understood that the tenant on the premises was an entity and not Trottier, he could not recall the name of the president of the corporation that occupied the premises. When asked whether he was aware of the name that appeared on the sublease with JN Phillips Auto Glass (under lessee “Evanna, Inc. Kenneth Machonis, President”), he replied, “No, I always thought it was Interstate Battery, a very reputable', '-4- company.” Branch also indicated that he only learned of Machonis in the context of this litigation.', 'The defendants took the position that Evanna, Inc. had a month-to-month tenancy with plaintiffs for the Interstate All Battery Center on the premises. In his deposition, Machonis indicated that he was the president of Evanna, Inc., describing his role with the corporation as: “[t]he buck stops here.” However, he was not aware of the point at which Interstate All Battery Center ceased operations at the premises, nor did he know whether Evanna, Inc. or Interstate All Battery Center executed a lease agreement for the premises. It was his statement that he first saw the lease in the context of this litigation. He also indicated that, in exchange for occupying a portion of the premises, Interstate All Battery Center paid rent, but he could not recall the rent amount. Machonis stated that Interstate All Battery Center closed and thus vacated the premises prior to June of 2008. He confirmed that Evanna, Inc. filed a request for withdrawal of Evanna, Inc. as a business in Rhode Island in December of 2008. Machonis indicated that business records that might have reflected accounting ledgers, check registers, etc. for Evanna, Inc. from 2004 until it ceased operations in 2008 were lost “when the building [presumably in Auburn] collapsed.” In reference to the same timeframe, Machonis could not recall who was employed by Evanna, Inc. other than a person named Nathan Stawiecki.', 'Stawiecki, who worked as a store manager for Interstate All Battery Center from 2004 to 2005 and as manager of Evanna, Inc. and Interstate Battery System of Central Mass., Inc. in November of 2007, was also deposed. It was his testimony that he purchased Interstate Battery System of Central Mass., Inc. from Machonis in April of 2010. Although he noted that he had worked out of the Auburn location, he said that he had responsibilities with respect to the premises in Cranston because his job included day-to-day operation oversight of that Interstate', '-5- All Battery Center, which required handling any issues and visiting the premises when necessary. His explanation of the corporate entity-defendants largely matched the summary provided in Machonis’s deposition. 6 During his deposition, Stawiecki identified photographs of signs at the front of the premises, which notified customers that the store had moved. He recognized the handwriting on the signs as that of a former manager of Interstate Battery System of Central Mass., Inc. He also noted that the storefront signs directed customers to call the phone number for Interstate Battery System of Central Mass., Inc. for their battery needs.', 'A deposition was also taken of Charles Trottier, who worked as a district sales manager for Interstate Battery System of Central Mass., Inc. In it, he confirmed that Interstate Battery System of Central Mass., Inc. ran a store on the premises in Cranston. When asked, however, for the name of the actual “business entity running the store,” Trottier indicated that it was Evanna, Inc. Trottier noted that he received his paycheck from Interstate Battery System of Central Mass., Inc., rather than Evanna, Inc. or any other entity. Trottier recalled that he occasionally visited the premises in Cranston when he worked for Interstate Battery System of Central Mass., Inc., to make deliveries, pick up merchandise for deliveries, determine whether the store had any new leads, or check in on the store’s progress. He also stated that “[a]ny payments or things of that nature [for the Cranston premises] would have been handled by Leah in the main office.” Trottier clarified that he was referencing Leah Murray of Interstate Battery System of Central Mass., Inc.', 'Finally, when asked about the lease and whether he had any recollection of 6', 'For example, he described Interstate Battery System of Central Mass., Inc. as a distinct corporation from the entity that operated at the premises in Cranston. He described the Interstate All Battery Center as “a retail operation which had every battery * * * known to man, cellphones, laptops, watch batteries, car batteries, commercial batteries.” Alternatively, he summarized Interstate Battery System of Central Mass., Inc., as a car battery distributorship that “predominantly put[s] racks of batteries on consignment to garages, and we have trucks that go around and service them on a rout[ine] basis.”', '-6- discussing it with anyone that he understood to be a landlord, he replied, “[T]he only thing I recall is the fact that we were told that JN Philips was moving out of the building, their lease was up and the sub-lease they had with them, that there would be some other lease * * * .” Trottier added, “I told the gentlemen that had contacted us * * * that would have to be through the office, actually, it would be Leah that would be taking care of something along those lines. I can gather up the information for her, but that would be her responsibility.”', 'C', 'Travel', 'On October 8, 2009, plaintiffs brought suit against defendants, alleging (1) breach of contract, (2) breach of implied contract/implied-in-fact contract, (3) unjust enrichment, and (4) quantum meruit. The plaintiffs also sought attorney’s fees and costs. On February 26, 2010, plaintiffs moved for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. In their accompanying memorandum of law, plaintiffs argued that no genuine issues of material fact existed with respect to the allegations of breach, abandonment, or damages stemming from the alleged breach. The plaintiffs asserted that the matter could be decided as a matter of law because: (1) Trottier, as district manager, bound Interstate Battery System of Central Mass., Inc. to the lease terms under agency principles; (2) Interstate Battery System of Central Mass., Inc. breached a contractual agreement by abandoning the tenancy without notice; and (3) damages and attorney’s fees were readily assessable and should be entered for plaintiffs.', 'The plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment was heard before a justice of the Superior Court on July 20, 2010. On the issue of apparent authority, the motion justice observed: “But isn’t apparent authority really a fact question? I mean, how do we resolve that on a summary judgment motion? I mean, actual authority, I can understand if he had a certification from the', '-7- corporation stamped, whatever else. But who knew what? When?” The motion justice denied the motion for summary judgment on the grounds that resolving the apparent-authority issue necessitated a factual determination by the factfinder. Specifically, he framed the factual issue as: “Did or did not this person have the apparent authority on behalf of Interstate Battery to enter into the contract? Or I guess even further: Was this person even known to Interstate Battery?” The motion justice determined that he could not answer this question at that point as a matter of law, and he found it necessary to hold a trial on the narrow factual issue of apparent authority.', 'D', 'The Motion Justice’s Decision', 'On August 11, 2015, after further discovery, a different justice of the Superior Court heard the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment. The defendants argued that insufficient facts were provided to establish that Trottier had actual or apparent authority to enter into the lease and that, therefore, the proposition that any defendant was bound by the lease was unsupported. The defendants asserted that the motion justice could decide the authority issue as a matter of law, and they averred that any facts put forth through depositions were insufficient proof of actual or apparent authority because the record lacked any evidence that revealed that defendants authorized Trottier to act on their behalf or that Joseph Branch relied on this alleged authority.', 'In arguing that summary judgment should enter in their favor, plaintiffs reasserted many of the same arguments from their original summary-judgment motion. The plaintiffs submitted that Trottier, acting as an agent, sufficiently bound his principal, Interstate Battery System of Central Mass., Inc., to the terms of the lease and that Joseph Branch reasonably relied on Trottier’s authority in negotiating and executing the lease. Because plaintiffs asserted that there', '-8- were no genuine issues of material fact with respect to the lease’s breach and the associated damages, they submitted that the court should summarily decide the case in their favor.', 'The motion justice issued a bench decision on the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment and granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, finding no genuine issues of material fact. Although he recognized that “there clearly * * * appear to be some factual disputes, [he was] not sure they r[o]se to a genuine issue of material fact * * * .” First, the motion justice determined that summary judgment was appropriate because the lease listed the tenant as “Interstate Battery Center,” which was “not a legal entity,” as the name did not precisely match the name of any defendant-entity.', 'With respect to the lease itself, the motion justice noted that there was a question of whether the landlord signed it. He also noted that there was no evidence that the lease was delivered to the tenant. Based on the existence of “just so many deficiencies in this lease,” the motion justice reasoned that summary judgment was proper because a valid lease was not established. In particular, he outlined what he opined was needed for a valid lease: someone with authority to sign, whether actual or apparent, an existing tenant, i.e., a legal entity or person, the landlord’s signature, and delivery.', 'The motion justice granted defendants’ summary- judgment motion and accordingly deemed plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment moot.

The mere fact that the names appearing on the lease and the exhibit (“Interstate Battery Center” or “Interstate Battery”) did not precisely match any named defendant-entity was not enough to dispose of this issue as a matter of law. Instead, a review of the record reveals contradictory deposition statements concerning which entity occupied the premises in Cranston. For instance, in his deposition, Trottier expressed that his then-employer, Interstate Battery System of Central Mass., Inc. “put a store” into the premises.', 'He also indicated, however, that Evanna, Inc. “was actually the business entity running the store.” Moreover, Branch testified that he was not aware of the name Evanna, Inc., which appeared on the lease; when asked about which entity he thought had operated on the premises, he replied, “I always thought it was Interstate Battery.” Alternatively, in Machonis’s deposition, he confirmed that Evanna, Inc. did business as Interstate All Battery Center at the premises.

25,State : v. : Hakim Funches. :,criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. This case came before the Supreme Court on May 3, 2017, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. The defendant, Hakim Funches (Funches or defendant), appeals from a judgment of conviction entered in the Superior Court, following a jury trial. The defendant was convicted of one count of domestic assault by strangulation and one count of simple assault.', 'After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda submitted by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that this case should be decided without further briefing or argument. We affirm the judgment of conviction of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'Funches and the complaining witness, Jennifer Bacon (Bacon), were involved in a relationship for approximately four years and were the parents of two daughters. They also lived together for a period of time.1 On October 23, 2012, Bacon departed her home at 4:30 p.m. to 1', 'At trial, it was a contested issue whether they remained romantically involved and were living together in the fall of 2012.', '-1- begin her night shift at Domino’s Pizza in Warwick, Rhode Island. Funches was at Bacon’s apartment, watching their children. The pair argued through text messages and phone calls throughout Bacon’s shift about whether Bacon was romantically involved with another man. Funches denied sending or receiving text messages from Bacon on this particular night. Bacon testified that, because Funches was so “hostile,” she went to a friend’s house after work. The defendant continued to contact Bacon, threatening to “take [her] daughters up to Massachusetts with no car seats at three something in the morning” if she did not return home.', 'Bacon responded that she was returning home and that, as soon as she arrived, Funches could leave. She returned home at approximately 3:30 a.m. It was a violent homecoming.', 'Bacon testified that, when she entered her home, Funches “immediately came from behind the door and ripped [her] phone out of [her] hand and slammed [her] into the kitchen table.” Funches placed Bacon’s cellphone in the pocket of his pants. He then “threw [her] on the floor[,] and he got on [her,] and put his knees against [her] shoulders and * * * took [her] chin and repeatedly smacked [her] head into the tile floor.” Throughout this episode, Funches repeatedly declared that he would not tolerate any romantic involvement with another man. When Bacon stated that she was going to contact the police, Funches responded that “[i]f [he was] going to go to jail, [he was] going to make it worth it.” At that point, Funches lifted Bacon from the floor by her shirt and tried to place her on a chair, but he did so with such force that the chair “shattered” and Bacon fell to the floor. Bacon testified that Funches “dragged [her by her hair] back to the center of the room and started hitting [her] head against the floor again.” Funches then grabbed their daughter’s jump rope, wrapped it around Bacon’s neck, and “continuously choked [her] for about an hour on and off.” When it appeared that Bacon was', '-2- about to “pass out,” he would pause; but he would then start choking her again. Bacon testified that she was seeing stars and felt dizzy.', 'Funches eventually stopped choking Bacon when his daughters began to wake up in the next room; however, according to Bacon, the abuse did not end. Funches dragged her by her hair to the bedroom and threw her on the bed. When Bacon called Funches a “scumbag,” he attempted to remove her slacks, declaring, “I’ll show you a scumbag.” However, when the youngest daughter began crying, Funches went to check on the child and Bacon attempted to flee. The defendant followed her and pushed her down two flights of stairs. She eventually reached the front door and proceeded directly to the Providence police station. She returned to the apartment with three police officers. Funches subsequently was arrested.', 'Funches testified and provided a different version of events. According to defendant, when Bacon returned home, he informed her that he was ending their relationship, filing for joint custody, and requesting physical placement of their daughters. He explained that he made this decision after Bacon told him that she did not have enough money for the monthly bills. According to Funches, the argument lasted approximately forty-five minutes, at which time Bacon left the apartment. He denied that he physically assaulted Bacon.', 'Funches was convicted by a jury of one count of domestic assault by strangulation in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2.3 and one count of simple assault in violation of § 11-5-3. He was sentenced to ten years at the Adult Correctional Institution, three years to serve with seven years of probation on the strangulation count and one year, suspended, on the simple assault count, to run concurrently. The defendant also was required to complete a batterer intervention program while incarcerated.', 'He was acquitted of one count of assault with a dangerous weapon—that being the jump rope—in violation of § 11-5-2. He timely appealed.', '-3-', 'Before this Court, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion to pass the case after the prosecutor posed an allegedly prejudicial question to defendant. The defendant also contends that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal, arguing that he was twice placed in jeopardy for the same act.', 'Standard of Review', 'It is well established “that a decision to pass a case and declare a mistrial are matters left to the sound discretion of the trial justice.” State v.

The prosecutor averred that she posed the question for impeachment purposes since defendant claimed that he was still romantically involved with Bacon on the date in question.', 'The trial justice denied the motion to pass the case and gave the following cautionary instruction:', '“Counsel for the State just asked the witness a question about', 'naked photographs on his phone. * * * There’s no evidence in this', 'case about his phone, what was on it or what * * * Bacon observed', 'on it. * * * You must disregard the question.

Mateos-Sanchez, 864 F.2d 232, 240-41 (1st Cir. 1988)).', 'In Ordway, 619 A.2d at 825, the prosecutor asked the defendant, who was on trial for stabbing her husband to death, if she recalled stabbing another person with whom she previously lived. The Court recognized that “[o]nce laypeople have heard evidence, or in this case a remark, tending to show that the defendant committed a crime similar to the one he or she is being tried for, their impartiality may become tainted.” Id. at 826. The defendant in Ordway claimed that she suffered from battered woman syndrome. Id. at 827. We stated that jurors may have difficulty understanding this syndrome and that the prosecutor’s question could likewise paint the picture that the defendant “was not so helpless.” Id. The Court also acknowledged that the state made minimal efforts to substantiate this evidence such that the defendant did not move for its exclusion by way of a motion in limine. Id. at 826-27. Under the particular circumstances in Ordway, we held that “[t]he cautionary instructions and the individual examinations of the jurors by the trial justice, although commendable, did not dispel the prejudicial effect created by the question.” Id. at 828. We are of the opinion that the Ordway case is distinguishable from the facts of the case at bar.', 'We consider on an ad hoc basis “the prejudicial effect of challenged remarks in light of the context in which they were uttered.” State v. Anil, 417 A.2d 1367, 1373 (R.I. 1980). In this case, in contrast to Ordway, the alleged conduct of defendant—while not laudable—is not criminal in nature. See Ordway, 619 A.2d at 826 (expressing concern with the prosecutor’s behavior and paraphrasing Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence).', 'The alleged', '-6- possession of naked pictures on one’s cell phone also is not related to the crimes charged in this case, whereas in Ordway the defendant was charged with murdering her husband with a knife and was asked about having stabbed another person with whom she had lived. We recognized in Ordway, 619 A.2d at 826, that the correlation between the alleged conduct and the charged crime was striking and highly prejudicial.', 'The defendant argues that possession of lewd photographs has a sufficient nexus to the crimes charged in this case, contending that the incident occurred in a domestic setting and that pictures suggest that defendant “objectifies” women. This argument was not raised at trial, however; nor are we persuaded that possession of photographs of naked individuals is sufficiently related to charges of strangulation and simple assault. In State v. Kholi, 672 A.2d 429, 432 (R.I. 1996), we acknowledged that “the questions posed in Ordway * * * implicated th[e] defendant[] in [a] crime[] similar to the one[] for which [she] stood trial.” Id. at 432. Despite the fact that the defendant in Kholi was charged with sexual assault and was asked about previously breaking a glass over the same complainant’s hand, the substantial nexus required was lacking because the alleged act did not involve sexual assault. Id. We are satisfied that the alleged possession of naked, non-juvenile photographs is not criminal nor is such behavior substantially related to the crimes charged in this case: strangulation and simple assault.', 'Accordingly, the prosecutor’s question was not so inflammatory that the trial justice was unable to expiate the harm. The trial justice correctly sustained the objection and gave a cautionary instruction to the jury. She likewise asked the jurors three times whether they could disregard the question, each juror nodding in response. We, therefore, are satisfied that, in the circumstances of this case, the cautionary instruction cured the prejudice created by the prosecutor’s improper comments. A review of the record does not reveal that the jury was', '-7- unable to comply with the trial justice’s cautionary instruction, and we “must assume that the jury did disregard the witness comments as it was instructed to do.” Disla, 874 A.2d at 198 (quoting Powers, 566 A.2d at 1304). Accordingly, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not err in denying defendant’s motion to pass the case.', 'Motion for Judgment of Acquittal', 'The defendant contends that the count of assault with a dangerous weapon, of which he was acquitted, and the count of assault by strangulation, of which he was convicted, were duplicative. Accordingly, defendant avers that he was twice placed in jeopardy for the same act and that the conviction for the single count of domestic strangulation should be vacated. We disagree. Because defendant stands convicted of only one of the two counts, we need not dwell long on this issue.', 'Rule 12(b)(2) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that “[t]he defense of double jeopardy * * * may be raised only by motion before trial.” Therefore, “a defendant’s failure to raise such a motion before trial precludes that defendant from thereafter raising a double jeopardy challenge.” State v. Day, 925 A.2d 962, 977 (R.I. 2007) (citing State v. Feliciano, 901 A.2d 631, 647 (R.I. 2006)). A review of the record indicates that the defendant did not raise the defense of double jeopardy prior to trial as required by Rule 12(b)(2). We therefore consider this issue to be waived. Nonetheless, “[t]he principal evil against which the Double Jeopardy Clause protects—multiple criminal punishments for the same offense—is not implicated in this case because [the] defendant stands convicted of (and punished for) a single offense.” State v. Matthews, 88 A.3d 375, 380 (R.I. 2014). The defendant was not twice placed in jeopardy because he was convicted of only one count; he was acquitted of the other. Accordingly, “[b]ecause there was a single conviction in this case, there is no double jeopardy', '-8- violation for us to remedy.” Id. at 381.

26,"Joanne C. Miller : v. : Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. et al. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. This case came before the Supreme Court on April 6, 2017, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. The plaintiff, Joanne C. Miller (plaintiff or Miller), appeals from a Superior Court judgment, after a nonjury trial, entered in favor of the defendant, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (defendant or Wells Fargo). The plaintiff argues on appeal that: (1) the defendant breached federal guidelines regarding loan modification review and improperly foreclosed on her home while her loan modification request was pending; (2) the defendant breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and (3) the plaintiff’s reliance on the federal regulations, as well as the defendant’s failure to adhere in good faith to those regulations, should have estopped the defendant from foreclosing on the property. After careful review of the record, the memoranda submitted by the parties, and the oral arguments, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown, and thus, this appeal may be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'Facts and Travel', 'This case arises from the unfortunate foreclosure of a residential property as a result of defaulted mortgage payments and the borrower’s inability to receive a loan modification or a subsequent rescission of foreclosure. The loan at issue was secured by a residential mortgage on property located at 233 Beach Avenue in Warwick, Rhode Island.1 In August 2009, as a result of changed financial circumstances, Miller, the borrower, could not afford her upcoming monthly mortgage payment on her home, which she occupied with her four children.2 Miller timely contacted Wells Fargo, the lender, to explain her changed circumstances and to explore a new payment plan.', 'At that time, the scheduled monthly mortgage payment for August was $1,645.30. With only $900 set aside, Miller offered to allocate these funds towards the August payment and to pay the remaining balance as part of her next scheduled payment. Although Miller’s proposal was not accepted, the Wells Fargo representative suggested that Miller might be eligible for a loan modification, which was designed to prevent foreclosure for qualified borrowers.3 However, this suggested lifeline proved to be ephemeral, and Miller entered into a bureaucratic quagmire. 1', 'On March 30, 2005, Miller executed a promissory note and mortgage for $204,000. The scheduled monthly mortgage payment was $1,645.30. 2', 'Several recent events in Miller’s personal life had materially changed her financial position. For instance, Miller had recently divorced from her husband, the co-obligator of the mortgage note; a court order reduced the monthly child-support payments for her four children; and, as a real estate broker with an income based on sales commissions, Miller’s income was inherently sporadic and a recent property sale she negotiated had fallen through. 3', 'President Obama, in February 2009, signed into law the Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan to stabilize the housing market by assisting struggling homeowners in obtaining financial relief and avoiding foreclosure. In March 2009, the United States Department of Treasury issued national guidance for loan modifications throughout the mortgage industry and subsequently expanded that guidance through a series of policy announcements. This included the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), a uniform mortgage modification program, designed', '-2-', 'It began on September 3, 2009, when Miller received a packet from Wells Fargo, which contained financial forms that she needed to complete and return by September 18, 2009, in order to begin the application process.', 'In accordance with the federal Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) guidelines, Miller was required to submit current and verifiable evidence of income as proof of her eligibility for the program. 4 As such, a mere request for modification, standing alone, would not stay the foreclosure process because Wells Fargo reserved the right to declare default on the mortgage and, according to HAMP, to proceed with the foreclosure until the loan modification request was evaluated.', 'On September 14, 2009, Wells Fargo sent Miller a letter informing her that she needed to pay the loan delinquency amount in full by October 14, 2009, or else Wells Fargo would proceed with the foreclosure. However, it was not until October 29, 2009, that Miller received a letter denying her loan modification plan.', 'According to this letter, Wells Fargo denied the modification plan as a result of Miller’s alleged failure to provide the necessary information within the timeframe required by her trial modification period workout plan. Miller contends that there was no evidence that she agreed to a trial modification period workout plan or that such a plan had been prepared. On or about November 3, 2009, Miller received yet another letter from Wells Fargo—her third letter in three weeks—which indicated that certain financial information must be submitted within ten days, notwithstanding the October 29, 2009, rejection. to provide eligible borrowers the opportunity to modify their mortgage loans in order to make them more affordable. Under HAMP, a servicer will utilize the uniform loan modification process to provide a borrower with sustainable monthly payment plans. Under the servicer participation agreement, participating servicers are required to consider all eligible mortgage loans unless otherwise prohibited by the rules of the agreement and/or other investor servicing agreements. 4', 'In attempting to apply for a loan modification, Miller had submitted five “hardship letters.” However, the trial justice also found that, by October 29, 2009, Wells Fargo had received a substantial amount of information necessary to verify and evaluate Miller’s sources of income for the purposes of the loan modification request.', '-3- Although she complied, Miller nonetheless received several more letters from different regional offices throughout the country, stating that Wells Fargo had not received the requested information. Although Miller continuously sent Wells Fargo substantial information regarding her financial situation, Wells Fargo, on January 15, 2010, notified Miller of the foreclosure sale, which was held on March 10, 2010. On March 28, 2010, Miller requested rescission of the foreclosure.', 'She alleged that a Wells Fargo employee, Natura Gibbons (Gibbons), made representations that the foreclosure would be rescinded. On August 12, 2010, Miller’s request for rescission was denied.5', 'On January 14, 2011, Miller, acting pro se, brought suit against Wells Fargo in Kent County Superior Court. Miller’s original, handwritten, complaint—consisting primarily of the facts surrounding her efforts to obtain a loan modification—indirectly alleged “fraudulent representation” as the cause of action. On March 2, 2011, Miller filed an amended complaint, alleging that Wells Fargo had violated the Deceptive Trade Practices Act.', 'Miller sought injunctive relief to prevent Wells Fargo from initiating the eviction proceeding and requested that Wells Fargo return her home with clear title and provide compensation for her lost wages as well as her pain and suffering. On October 12, 2011, the Superior Court granted Miller’s motion to further amend the complaint.', 'In this amended complaint, which is the focus of this appeal, Miller asserted six causes of action: (1) violation of the Rhode Island Mortgage Foreclosure Consultant Regulation, G.L. 1956 chapter 79 of title 5; (2) violation of the Rhode Island Deceptive Trade Practices Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 13.1 of title 6; (3) violation of the “mortgage-related provisions of the Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2009”; (4) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; 5', 'It was disclosed at oral argument that Miller has resided in the home throughout these proceedings and was paying for the occupancy and use of the premises.', '-4- (5) breach of the Uniform Commercial Code, chapter 2 of title 6A; and (6) promissory estoppel based on a statement made by Wells Fargo’s alleged agent/employee, Gibbons.', 'A bench trial was held in November 2014, throughout which Miller acted pro se. On December 17, 2014, Miller filed a posttrial motion to amend her complaint to conform to the trial evidence, which was denied by the Superior Court justice.6 Wells Fargo moved for judgment as a matter of law on all six counts, which the Superior Court justice granted in a written decision. On March 30, 2015, the Superior Court justice found that, although Miller testified at trial that she had provided the necessary financial documents before September 18, 2009, she failed to submit any documentary evidence to corroborate her testimony. The Superior Court justice also found that, before the October 29, 2009, letter denying the requested loan modification, Wells Fargo had received a significant amount of information sufficient to have verified Miller’s sources of income and to have evaluated the loan modification request.', 'Nonetheless, the Superior Court justice ruled in favor of Wells Fargo on all counts. 7 The Superior Court justice held that, because Wells Fargo was under no contractual obligation to modify or consider a loan modification, there were no facts to support a finding that Wells Fargo breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing. Additionally, because Miller failed to produce 6', 'This issue is not before us on appeal. 7', 'The issues decided by the Superior Court justice and not raised on appeal, provide that: (1) Wells Fargo was excluded from the Rhode Island Mortgage Foreclosure Consultant Regulation because Wells Fargo was a business of the United States “relating to banks”; (2) Wells Fargo’s alleged violation of the Rhode Island Deceptive Trade Practices Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 13.1 of title 6 (DTPA) was invalid because a mortgage loan, which is neither a “good” nor “service”, is not subject to the DPTA, and Wells Fargo, as a federally regulated entity, was not subject to the DPTA; (3) Wells Fargo’s alleged violation of the “mortgage-related provisions of the Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2009” (OAA) was invalid because the OAA was issued as a directive, and, thus, did not create a private right of action; and (4) a mortgage loan did not constitute a “good” in accordance with the alleged unfair business practice in violation of the Uniform Commercial Code, G.L. 1956 chapter 2 of title 6A.', '-5- sufficient evidence that Gibbons was an employee of Wells Fargo, the Superior Court justice was not satisfied that any promises to rescind the foreclosure were made, upon which Miller could have relied to her detriment. Thus, he concluded that Miller failed to establish a claim under any theory of liability set forth in her complaint regarding the mortgage loan modification plan. Final judgment entered on September 1, 2015, and Miller timely appealed.', 'Before this Court, Miller argues that the Superior Court justice erred in finding for Wells Fargo because defendant: (1) violated Treasury Directive 09-01 in noticing and conducting the foreclosure sale; (2) breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and (3) was “estopped from conducting [the] foreclosure sale due to [Miller’s] submission of over one hundred pages of financial documentation in accordance with the HAMP program and communications between the parties relating thereto.”', 'Standard of Review', '“Our review of a trial justice’s decision on a motion for judgment as a matter of law is de novo.” McGarry v. Pielech, 47 A.3d 271, 279 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Medeiros v. Sitrin, 984 A.2d 620, 625 (R.I. 2009)). “This Court, like the trial justice, will examine ‘the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, without weighing the evidence or evaluating the credibility of witnesses, and draw from the record all reasonable inferences that support the position of the nonmoving party.’” Id. (quoting Oliveira v. Jacobson, 846 A.2d 822, 829 (R.I. 2004)). “Judgment as a matter of law is appropriate ‘if, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, [the trial justice] determines that the nonmoving party has not presented legally sufficient evidence to allow the trier of fact to arrive at a verdict in his favor.’” Id. at 280 (quoting Gianquitti v. Atwood Medical Associates, Ltd., 973 A.2d 580, 590 (R.I. 2009)).', '-6-', 'Analysis', 'We note at the outset that the numerous and unfortunate miscommunications and misunderstandings between the parties to this controversy have not escaped our review. As explained by the Superior Court justice, Wells Fargo is a large institution, with multiple locations, and Miller, unfortunately, was caught in the midst of the communications from the various branches. The record demonstrates that this case does not represent Wells Fargo’s finest hour.8', 'On appeal, Miller contends that the Superior Court justice erred as a matter of law in issuing his decision and entering judgment for Wells Fargo. First, Miller argues that Wells Fargo breached federal regulations during the loan modification review process and improperly foreclosed on her home while her loan modification request was pending. Miller asserts that Treasury Directive 09-01 prohibited Wells Fargo from noticing and conducting the foreclosure sale, arguing that servicers must not conduct foreclosure sales on loans that have been referred to foreclosure during the thirty-day period within which a borrower has submitted documents as verification of eligibility for a loan modification plan.9 However, absent from Miller’s original or amended complaint is any suggestion of a claim related to Treasury Directive 09-01. 8', 'The Superior Court justice found:', '“[Wells Fargo] was [not] intentionally trying to deceive the', 'borrower, but that [Wells Fargo] is an enormous corporation, and', 'the staff given the responsibility of communicating with borrowers', 'about loan modification and loan default was so decentralized that', 'no one office was aware of the status of the review process for any', 'individual borrower.” We share the concerns expressed by the Superior Court justice. 9', 'Miller highlights the Superior Court justice’s finding that, prior to October 29, 2009, Wells Fargo had received sufficient financial documentation to have evaluated her eligibility.', '-7- Accordingly, the argument that Miller now raises on appeal was not raised in the complaint nor was it addressed at trial. In accordance with this Court’s longstanding “raise-or-waive” rule, if an issue was not properly asserted, and thereby preserved, in the lower tribunals, this Court will not consider the issue on appeal. See State v. Gomez, 848 A.2d 221, 237 (R.I. 2004). We therefore deem this contention waived.', 'Next, Miller contends that Wells Fargo breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the promissory note, mortgage, and HAMP modification process. However, the Superior Court justice concluded, “[T]here were no contract terms which afford [Miller] any right or impose upon [Wells Fargo] any obligation to modify a mortgage loan or to consider such modification.” Rather, as the Superior Court justice explained, “the mortgage contain[ed] clear and unambiguous language that [Wells Fargo] may foreclose for a payment default, without first considering loan modification.”', 'When reviewing a trial justice’s decision on a motion for judgment as a matter of law, “[t]his Court, like the trial justice, will examine ‘the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, without weighing the evidence or evaluating the credibility of witnesses, and draw from the record all reasonable inferences that support the position of the nonmoving party.’” McGarry, 47 A.3d at 279 (quoting Oliveira, 846 A.2d at 829). Because we perceive no error with the Superior Court justice’s factual findings, we agree with the decision that, in the absence of a contractual obligation on behalf of the lender to either modify the mortgage loan or exercise discretion in evaluating a potential modification, this claim for breach of contract must fail. As such, it cannot be held that Wells Fargo arbitrarily or inconsistently employed its contractual obligations in violation of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. See McNulty v. Chip, 116 A.3d 173, 185 (R.I. 2015) (applying Massachusetts law and holding that “a claim', '-8- for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing does not create an independent cause of action separate and apart from a claim for breach of contract”); see also Young v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 717 F.3d 224, 238 (1st Cir. 2013) (“[T]he implied covenant cannot ‘create rights and duties not otherwise provided for in the existing contractual relationship.’” (quoting Ayash v. Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 822 N.E.2d 667, 684 (Mass. 2005))). Turning to the HAMP modification process specifically, the First Circuit in MacKenzie v. Flagstar Bank, FSB, 738 F.3d 486, 491 (1st Cir. 2013), held that “borrowers are not third-party beneficiaries of agreements between mortgage lenders and the government.” See also Cathay Cathay, Inc. v. Vindalu, LLC, 962 A.2d 740, 745-46 (R.I. 2009) (holding that, in order “[t]o prevail on a third- party beneficiary theory,” the claimant must prove that he or she is an intended beneficiary of the contract). Accordingly, we are of the opinion that the Superior Court justice did not err in determining that Wells Fargo did not breach the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.', 'Lastly, Miller contends that Wells Fargo was estopped from conducting the foreclosure sale based on the HAMP guidelines. Before the Superior Court, Miller argued that Wells Fargo was estopped from conducting the foreclosure sale because she detrimentally relied on promises that Gibbons allegedly made—that the foreclosure would be rescinded. However, the Superior Court justice concluded that Miller’s estoppel assertion was not credible because there was insufficient evidence to support this assertion. Before this Court, Miller asserts, for the first time, that Wells Fargo was estopped from conducting the foreclosure sale due to her submission of over one hundred pages of financial documentation in accordance with the HAMP program and communications between the parties relating thereto. Miller contends that she relied, to her detriment, on Wells Fargo’s good-faith review of her application and adherence to Treasury Directive 09-01 and thus failed to pursue other legal remedies. Although Miller’s frustration', '-9- with Wells Fargo’s conduct is real and understandable, her allegations regarding Treasury Directive 09-01 were not raised in the Superior Court. We therefore conclude that the Superior Court justice did not err in finding that Miller failed to meet the burden of proof on her promissory estoppel claim.', 'Conclusion', 'Accordingly, for the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

Asset-Backed Pass-Through Certificates 2004-R11 (Deutsche Bank or plaintiff). This matter came before the Supreme Court on May 2, 2017, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why this Court should not summarily decide the issues raised by this appeal. After hearing counsels’ arguments and reviewing the parties’ memoranda, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown. Accordingly, we shall decide this matter at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons outlined below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'This case originates from defendant’s ownership interest in two properties in Lincoln, Rhode Island: one on Woodland Court (Woodland Court property) and the other, of principal concern to this case, on Arnold Street (Arnold Street property). In relation to these properties, defendant executed two notes in favor of Ameriquest Mortgage Company (Ameriquest). The first note (Arnold Street note), executed on or about November 10, 2004, for $280,500, was secured by a mortgage on 26-28 Arnold Street in Lincoln (Arnold Street mortgage), which was recorded in the Town of Lincoln Land Evidence Records (registry) on November 23, 2004. The second note (Woodland Court note), also in favor of Ameriquest, was executed by defendant on November 16, 2004, in the amount of $300,900. This note was secured by a mortgage on 13-19 Woodland Court (Woodland Court mortgage), recorded with the registry.', 'Importantly, the property description within an exhibit appended to the Arnold Street mortgage referenced the Woodland Court property rather than the Arnold Street property despite the fact that the Arnold Street note specified the property address as 26-28 Arnold Street. Indeed, the Arnold Street mortgage described the encumbered property as 26-28 Arnold Street and listed the tax assessor’s plat and lot number for the Arnold Street property. Other documents associated with the Arnold Street mortgage were also linked to the Arnold Street property. Additionally, defendant’s completed uniform residential loan application listed 26-28 Arnold Street as the subject property address in connection with the Arnold Street note. On July 20, 2006, a certificate of satisfaction (certificate) that referenced the Woodland Court property and its loan number was recorded with the registry.', 'The certificate specified that Ameriquest received full payment and satisfaction of the mortgage, which discharged the mortgage. In', '-2- discharging the mortgage, however, the certificate also referenced recording information that corresponded with the Arnold Street mortgage. Upon realizing this error, plaintiff instituted efforts to correct it. First, an affidavit of scrivener’s error was recorded on or about October 2, 2008, with the registry, which provided that the Arnold Street mortgage, in its recorded form, contained an inaccuracy in the legal description. In addition to pinpointing this error, the affidavit of scrivener’s error identified the correct legal description associated with the Arnold Street property.', 'The plaintiff also asserts that, on or about August 12, 2008, Ameriquest assigned the Arnold Street mortgage to Deutsche Bank through a confirmatory assignment of mortgage (confirmatory assignment), which was recorded with the registry. This document provided that Ameriquest had granted, assigned, and transferred all of its right, title, and interest in the Arnold Street mortgage to plaintiff, Deutsche Bank. Further, the confirmatory assignment was intended “to replace the original assignment [with respect to the mortgage dated November 10, 2004] which due to inadvertence and/or mistake was lost * * * .”', 'Next, on January 27, 2009, a notice of rescission of deed of release, satisfaction of mortgage (notice of rescission) was recorded with the registry. This document provided that the obligations under the Arnold Street note had not been satisfied and an outstanding principal amount remained due. Moreover, on February 6, 2009, the servicer of the Arnold Street note informed defendant that the certificate was erroneously recorded and, as such, outstanding payments remained due on the Arnold Street note. 1 Subsequently, a revocation of certificate of satisfaction (revocation), dated March 31, 2009, was recorded with the registry to reinstate the 1', 'Although it appears that defendant, as of 2012 when plaintiff filed the complaint, still resided at the Arnold Street property, he has not made a mortgage payment with respect to it since March 25, 2008.', '-3- Arnold Street mortgage and revoke the prior certificate.', 'The revocation declared that the certificate had been executed and recorded in error, and that the Arnold Street mortgage should be restored.', 'On July 28, 2009, defendant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Rhode Island.', 'The defendant received a bankruptcy discharge on November 13, 2009; and, on January 20, 2010, his Chapter 7 case was closed. On January 21, 2010, defendant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in the same court. On May 20, 2010, defendant initiated an adversary proceeding against plaintiff in that court, wherein he sought a finding as to whether the Arnold Street mortgage was valid and asserted that he owned the Arnold Street property free of any encumbrances and that plaintiff was not the holder in due course of any documents corresponding to the Arnold Street property. A judge of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Rhode Island granted plaintiff’s motion to stay proceedings to allow issues related to the Arnold Street mortgage to be litigated in state court.', 'On October 5, 2012, plaintiff commenced this litigation by verified complaint. In count one of the complaint, plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment that (1) the Arnold Street mortgage was a valid, perfected first-priority mortgage on the Arnold Street property; (2) the Arnold Street mortgage was revived by the notice of rescission and revocation; and (3) full payment or satisfaction had not been received on the Arnold Street note. In count two, plaintiff sought a judgment that reformed the Arnold Street mortgage to remedy the incorrect legal description of the property. In count three, plaintiff cited equitable principles to request “a decree declaring a mortgage exists, fully enforceable against McDonough, on the Arnold Street Property, as reformed.” Finally, in count four, plaintiff sought “a decree declaring that it is subrogated to the', '-4- rights of the prior, senior mortgages which were satisfied with the proceeds of the Arnold Street Mortgage loan * * * .”', 'In its answer, in addition to denying plaintiff’s allegations, defendant counterclaimed that “Deutsche Bank is not a holder in due course of any documents relating to Plaintiff’s Arnold Street residence.” The defendant also submitted that plaintiff lacked standing to foreclose on the Arnold Street property and that defendant owned the Arnold Street property “free and clear of any mortgage(s).”', 'On April 28, 2014, plaintiff moved for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. In asserting that the case lacked genuine issues of material fact and that judgment should enter as a matter of law with respect to both its claims against defendant and defendant’s counterclaim, plaintiff asserted that (1) despite any technical deficiencies, the Arnold Street mortgage remained enforceable in equity and encumbered the Arnold Street property; (2) discharge of the Arnold Street mortgage was in error and corrective instruments recorded with the registry effectively reinstated the mortgage; and (3) the Arnold Street note, having not been fully paid, remained due and owing.', 'With its motion, plaintiff presented two affidavits. The first was from Peter Knapp, a loan analyst for Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC, the servicer for plaintiff with respect to defendant’s loan. In pertinent part, Knapp stated that defendant had not made a payment for the Arnold Street property since March 2008 and had paid off only $10,192.43 of the Arnold Street mortgage’s principal balance.', 'The second affidavit was from attorney Ranen Schechner, plaintiff’s counsel. Schechner stated that his law firm held the Arnold Street note at its Boston office. He further stated that this note was endorsed in blank.', '-5-', 'In opposition, defendant contended that this case was not ripe for summary judgment because genuine issues of material fact existed with respect to (1) whether the note was endorsed to plaintiff; (2) whether plaintiff owned defendant’s note or mortgage and, as a corollary, whether plaintiff was a real party in interest to bring this action; (3) whether Knapp possessed sufficient personal knowledge of the records; (4) whether “there [was] a chain of title for the mortgage from the originator to the trust, which is a different entity than” Deutsche Bank; and (5) whether the mortgage’s assignment was void.', 'In response to defendant’s request, the motion justice continued the summary-judgment hearing and allowed a deposition of plaintiff’s document custodian, later identified as Barbara Campbell, pursuant to Rule 56(f). Campbell, who was employed by Deutsche Bank in the document custody division, testified that, based on plaintiff’s records with respect to “the loan inventory and the loan file information,” she could glean that plaintiff received the original note, endorsed in blank from Ameriquest, on November 18, 2004.', 'On July 23, 2015, the motion justice granted plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment. The motion justice determined that plaintiff held the Arnold Street note, which was endorsed in blank. He deemed the Arnold Street mortgage a valid and perfected first-priority mortgage on the Arnold Street property. Additionally, he declared the Arnold Street note, which was secured by the Arnold Street mortgage, not fully satisfied and remaining due and owing to plaintiff as its current holder. Citing equitable principles, the motion justice held that the mortgage discharge should be set aside and the mortgage reinstated based on the recorded notice of rescission. Having so concluded, the motion justice found no merit in defendant’s counterclaim; and, accordingly, he granted summary judgment for plaintiff.', '-6-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“This Court reviews a [motion] justice’s decision to grant summary judgment de novo.” High Steel Structures, Inc. v.

Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986)).', '-7-', 'III', 'Discussion', 'The defendant lodges myriad arguments on appeal, many of which entirely lack factual support. 2 From these arguments, we glean two issues properly before us: whether the Arnold Street note was endorsed in blank and whether the Arnold Street mortgage was validly assigned to plaintiff.', 'First, defendant asserts that a genuine dispute of material fact exists with respect to whether the Arnold Street note was endorsed.', 'In support, he posits that two allegedly unendorsed copies of this note were produced in the context of defendant’s bankruptcy proceedings, which he suggests create a triable factual issue. The plaintiff presented the original note, which the motion justice examined in open court at the summary-judgment hearing. A review of this note revealed that it was endorsed in blank by Ameriquest. Furthermore, the motion justice referenced Campbell’s deposition, where she acknowledged the note’s authenticity and stated that plaintiff received it on November 18, 2004, endorsed in blank by the lender, Ameriquest. 2', 'In his papers before us, defendant takes a scattershot approach and suggests, without sufficient development or discussion, a multitude of errors committed by the motion justice. These include assertions that the motion justice erred in: (1) considering Knapp’s affidavit because he lacked personal knowledge of the documents that he discussed; (2) “weighing the evidence at the [s]ummary [j]udgment hearing and reviewing the note for a purported smudge mark at the hearing”; and (3) “considering [G.L. 1956 § 34-11-24] as a basis for transferring the note” because it was preempted by the Uniform Commercial Code. We deem these arguments, among others that were minimally developed on appeal, waived. See A. Salvati Masonry Inc. v. Andreozzi, 151 A.3d 745, 750 (R.I. 2017) (“Generally, we deem an issue waived ‘when a party [s]imply stat[es] an issue for appellate review, without a meaningful discussion thereof * * * .’”) (quoting In re Jake G., 126 A.3d 450, 458 (R.I. 2015)).', '-8-', 'Thus, defendant’s assertion of error in this respect must fail. Beyond appending two allegedly unendorsed copies of the note, 3 defendant has not set forth a scintilla of competent evidence to rebut plaintiff’s showing that there is no genuine issue of fact with respect to whether the note was endorsed. “In setting forth specific grounds to establish a factual dispute, the opposing party must present evidence of a substantial nature predicated on more than mere conclusory statements.” McGovern v. Bank of America, N.A., 91 A.3d 853, 858 (R.I. 2014) (quoting Riel v. Harleysville Worcester Insurance Co., 45 A.3d 561, 570 (R.I. 2012)). The defendant’s bare assertion here “is clearly inadequate to withstand summary judgment given our repeated admonition that the nonmoving party ‘cannot rest on allegations, denials in the pleadings, conclusions, or legal opinions.’” Id. (quoting Plainfield Pike Gas & Convenience, LLC v. 1889 Plainfield Pike Realty Corp., 994 A.2d 54, 57 (R.I. 2010)).', 'Without more, defendant’s reference to two copies of the note allegedly proffered in separate court proceedings simply cannot fulfill his “burden of proving by competent evidence the existence of a disputed issue of material fact * * * .” Plainfield Pike Gas & Convenience, LLC, 994 A.2d at 57 (quoting D’Allesandro v. Tarro, 842 A.2d 1063, 1065 (R.I. 2004)). Accordingly, we are confident that the motion justice faultlessly disposed of this issue as a matter of law.', 'Equally unavailing is defendant’s challenge of the Arnold Street mortgage’s assignment. In a nutshell, defendant submits that in November of 2004 Ameriquest sold the Arnold Street mortgage to Ameriquest Mortgage Securities, Inc., which in turn transferred it to plaintiff. Consequently, defendant avers that when the Arnold Street mortgage was assigned in 2008, Ameriquest no longer possessed a legal interest in the mortgage such that it had no interest to 3', 'The motion justice found that it was “quite possible” that the copies of the note produced in the context of the bankruptcy proceedings simply failed to include the page with a copy of the back of the note.', '-9- assign. Without pinpointing specific testimony, defendant broadly cites Campbell’s deposition to support his contention that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to the validity of the mortgage assignment. Specifically, in his papers before us, defendant asserts: “The deposition of Barbara Campbell, Deutsche Bank employee[,] establishes clearly that on August 12, 2008, Ameriquest owned nothing to assign as on or after November 5, 2004[,] * * * Ameriquest had sold this mortgage to an entity named Ameriquest Mortgage Securities, Inc.” A thorough reading of Campbell’s deposition, however, reveals that defendant’s claims are not “clearly” substantiated; indeed, quite the contrary—Campbell’s testimony does not even move the mark in uncovering specific facts that rebut the mortgage assignment’s validity, which would be necessary to withstand summary judgment. Indeed, defendant’s rather conclusory averment falls far below what is necessary for his “affirmative duty to set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue of material fact.” Johnson v. QBAR Associates, 78 A.3d 48, 51 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Providence Journal Co. v. Convention Center Authority, 774 A.2d 40, 46 (R.I. 2001)) (emphasis added). Instead of pinpointing specific facts in Campbell’s deposition that uncover a genuine dispute as to the mortgage assignment, defendant paints with a broad brush in a manner insufficient to reverse summary judgment.', 'We are satisfied, therefore, that the confirmatory assignment, recorded with the registry and appended to plaintiff’s verified complaint, conclusively demonstrates that the assignment of the Arnold Street mortgage to plaintiff was effective. This document, dated August 12, 2008, unequivocally provided that Ameriquest had granted, assigned, and transferred “[a]ll of the right, title, and interest” in the mortgage to plaintiff. The confirmatory assignment further indicated that its purpose was “to replace the original assignment [with respect to the mortgage dated November 10, 2004] which due to inadvertence and/or mistake was lost * * * .” Additionally,', '- 10 - our review of the record, including Campbell’s deposition, reveals that defendant has not, by affidavit or otherwise, satisfied his burden of setting forth competent evidence that creates a genuine dispute of material fact on this issue. Instead, he relies on conclusory assertions bereft of factual support, which cannot overcome summary judgment in this instance. 4', 'As the motion justice correctly recognized, in circumstances where a mortgage is mistakenly discharged, equitable principles provide that the discharge be set aside and the mortgage reinstated to the position intended by the parties. See Progressive Consumers Federal Credit Union v. United States, 79 F.3d 1228, 1236 (1st Cir. 1996). In light of the undisputed fact that the defendant has resided continuously at the Arnold Street property yet has not made a mortgage payment since 2008 nor has he paid use and occupancy or property taxes, it is time to terminate this litigation. Consequently, equity demands that the discharge be set aside and the mortgage reinstated.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the Superior Court’s judgment.

Ware, 524 A.2d 1110, 1112-13 (R.I. 1987) (concluding that there was no incurable prejudice by the prosecutor’s opening statement that referenced a witness who did not testify because the prosecutor did not act in bad faith and there was “ample independent evidence” to find the defendant guilty). Chum maintains, however, that his trial attorney’s inaction in response to the prosecutor’s opening statement “fell below the objective standard of reasonableness and prejudiced the defense * * * .”', 'As we acknowledged in Chum’s direct appeal, “when, as in this case, a prosecutor makes an unfulfilled promise in opening statement about the evidence that will be put before the jury, a criminal defendant has several avenues available to address the issue.” Chum, 54 A.3d at 461. Specifically, the trial attorney can: (1) “remind the jury during closing argument that the prosecutor promised that certain evidence would be admitted and that the evidence never materialized”; (2) seek a mistrial; or (3) request a curative instruction. Id. Chum asserts that his trial attorney’s failure to use any of these available recourses constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.

See generally Hayes v. State, 932 So.2d 381 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2006); People v. Tenny, 586 N.E.2d 403 (Ill. App. Ct. 1991). The cases cited, however, are distinguishable from the instant matter. See Hayes, 932 So.2d at 382 (The District Court of Appeal of Florida concluded that the prosecutor’s opening-statement reference to the defendant’s confession and subsequent failure to introduce it into evidence was error where there was no physical evidence that implicated the defendant.); Tenny, 586 N.E.2d at 409, 412 (During opening statements, the prosecutor referenced the defendant’s statement to the police, which prompted the defendant’s attorney to discuss the statement and certain facts therein.', 'The Appellate Court of Illinois deemed the prosecutor’s failure to introduce the statement prejudicial because the prosecutor’s closing argument referred to the defense attorney’s comments as concessions.).', 'Here, however, there was no prejudice because, as the trial justice correctly found, “[t]he evidence of Chum’s complicity in this joint venture was overwhelming.” There were three eyewitness identifications of Chum from the three men (McArdle, Saraceno, and Monteiro) who were at the household when the shooting occurred. 8 Additionally, although the trial attorney did not request a curative instruction, the trial justice instructed the jury on numerous occasions that 8', 'Chum maintains that the evidence against him was “hardly overwhelming” because it relied on the aforementioned eyewitness cross-racial identifications from three witnesses who had criminal records. We note that Chum concedes that his trial attorney did not challenge the identification procedure, and moved to pass his motion to suppress the identifications.', '-7- the arguments of counsel were not evidence. Despite Chum’s assertion that these instructions were inadequate to lessen the harm of the prosecutor’s opening statement, this Court previously deemed them to be proper. Chum, 54 A.3d at 461. Further, “[i]t is well settled that this Court presumes that the jury follows a trial justice’s adequate cautionary instruction.” Id. Finally, the trial attorney’s failure to move for a mistrial was not prejudicial because the trial justice, in denying Chum’s application for postconviction relief, stated that he would not have granted a mistrial even if the attorney had so moved.

30,Eric Chase : v. : Nationwide Mutual Fire Insurance : Company.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The plaintiff, Eric Chase, appeals from a Superior Court order granting the motion of the defendant, Nationwide Mutual Fire Insurance Company, for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. This matter came before us for oral argument on April 27, 2017, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why this appeal should not summarily be decided. After considering the parties’ oral and written arguments and after thoroughly reviewing the record, it is our opinion that cause has not been shown and that this case should be decided at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'According to plaintiff, 1 a property that he owned on Bosworth Court in Newport suffered a casualty loss on June 25, 2010 that caused extensive interior and exterior damage. The plaintiff timely reported the loss to defendant, which insured the property pursuant to a policy that it had issued to plaintiff. After investigating the loss, defendant accepted the claim as covered under the policy. The defendant then authorized plaintiff to repair the property and further authorized a partial release of funds to enable plaintiff to begin the repairs. However, the funds released were not sufficient to pay for the repairs and to cover plaintiff’s alternative living expenses. Accordingly, plaintiff demanded that defendant release additional funds, but defendant refused. The plaintiff alleges that defendant then “engaged in a pattern of dilatory conduct thereby refusing to fulfill its obligations under the [p]olicy.”', 'Based upon plaintiff’s complaint, we are left in the dark as to the timing and particulars of the above events. Nevertheless, on March 6, 2014, after nearly four years had elapsed since the casualty loss, plaintiff attempted to invoke the policy’s appraisal provision. In a letter dated March 10, 2014, defendant rejected plaintiff’s demand for an appraisal, citing the passage of time and that plaintiff had failed to submit certain documentation that the insurer had requested under the terms of the policy.', 'In November 2014, some four years after the loss, plaintiff brought a two-count suit against defendant, alleging breach of contract and bad faith. 2', 'The defendant then moved, 1', 'Because this case comes to us from a judgment on the pleadings, we draw the facts from plaintiff’s complaint. 2', 'The bad-faith count was severed pending resolution of the count for the breach of contract claim.', '-2- pursuant to Rule 12(c), for judgment on the pleadings. In its motion, defendant highlighted two provisions from the policy:', '“3. Your Duties after Loss. In case of loss, you must:', '“* * *', '“c) as often as we reasonably require:', '“(1) show us the damaged property; and', '“(2) provide records and documents we request and permit', 'us to make copies.', '“(3) submit to examinations under oath and sign same.', '“* * *', '“8. Suit Against Us. No action can be brought against us unless', 'there has been full compliance with the policy provisions. Any', 'action must be started within two years after the date of loss or', 'damage.” Before the Superior Court, defendant argued that, even assuming everything that plaintiff alleged in his complaint were true, the claim must nevertheless fail because plaintiff did not fully comply with the provisions of the policy and because plaintiff brought suit more than two years after the date of loss. The plaintiff, for his part, argued to the hearing justice that defendant should be estopped from enforcing the contractual two-year limitations provision. However, he offered nothing to support that argument. 3', 'In a bench decision, the hearing justice noted that defendant “admits the date of loss is June 25, 2010. The complaint was filed on November 11, 2014[,] which is four years and four months later.” Accordingly, the hearing justice granted defendant’s motion for judgment on the pleadings. Judgment entered shortly thereafter, and plaintiff timely appealed to this Court. 3', 'Two months after defendant filed its motion, and just days before the hearing, plaintiff filed a memorandum opposing defendant’s motion for judgment on the pleadings. The plaintiff’s memorandum contained exhibits that sought to advance his estoppel theory. The hearing justice, however, declined to consider the exhibits because not only was the memorandum untimely filed, but also because the exhibits “weren’t introduced by affidavit or in any other manner.” Thus, the hearing justice chose not to convert defendant’s motion to a motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff did not object.', '-3-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“Rule 12(c) ‘provides a trial court with the means of disposing of a case early in the litigation process when the material facts are not in dispute after the pleadings have been closed and only questions of law remain to be decided.’” Chariho Regional School District v.

See Alternative Energy, Inc., 267 F.3d at 33.', 'Here, the insurance contract requires that plaintiff be in “full compliance with the policy provisions” before he may bring suit. It is clear from the pleadings that plaintiff did not comply with the terms of the insurance contract because he failed to bring suit within two years from the date of loss. The plaintiff argues that the two-year clock should not begin to tick “until the [d]efendant insurer formally rejects the [p]laintiff’s claim because the causes of action for breach of contract and bad faith did not accrue until the insurance company breached the contract by refusing to pay the claim.” As appealing as this reasoning may be on the surface, it is unavailing because the insurance contract clearly states that “[a]ny action must be started within two years after the date of loss or damage[,]” and not from the date that the claim is rejected. (Emphasis', '-6- added.) In this case, the casualty loss occurred in June 2010, but the suit was not filed until four years later, in November 2014.', 'The plaintiff’s only possibility of extracting himself from the two-year limitation provision is if he were to succeed on an estoppel argument. However, as with the compliance issue, the plaintiff simply has not pled sufficient facts that would create a prima facie estoppel argument. The sole hint that the defendant may be estopped from enforcing the two-year provision is the plaintiff’s broad and undetailed allegation that the defendant “engaged in a pattern of dilatory conduct thereby refusing to fulfill its obligations under the [p]olicy.” Without more than this salvo, however, we cannot make the leap to assuming that the delay was aimed at inducing or causing the plaintiff to exceed the two-year contractual window in which to file suit.

A trial was held on the six above-indicated charges over five days in April of 2015. We relate below the salient aspects of what transpired at that trial.', 'A', 'The Testimony at Trial', '1. The Testimony of Jessica Nunez', 'Jessica Nunez testified that she and defendant had been in a relationship until two weeks before the April 23, 2014 shooting. She stated that defendant is the father of her ten-year-old son. It was her testimony that she and defendant separated because he “threatened [her] with a knife, saying that he would stab [her], slash [her] face.” She then proceeded to testify in more 2', 'The defendant was charged with the above-indicated charges by indictment. In addition, he was charged with one count which alleged that Mr. Diaz “being an alien, did purchase, own, carry, transport, or have in his possession or under his control a firearm[], in violation of [G.L. 1956] § 11-47-7” (Count Six). Count Six was dismissed before trial pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.', '-2- detail about the incident that caused their separation. She stated that, two weeks before April 23, 2014, defendant picked her up from work and drove towards Foxwoods Casino in Connecticut. According to her testimony, defendant kept asking her questions about the previous night, when she “went out with [her] sister to buy an outfit.” It was her testimony that, during the drive, she told defendant that she was “fed up;” she added that he then said that he “was going to jump off a bridge.” She stated that she told defendant that she “no longer wanted to be with him” and that then “[defendant] said that he was going to drive [them] off a bridge.” Jessica testified that, in reaction to the latter statement, she called 911, “opened the car door, [put her] hand and [her] foot out one side” and that defendant took her phone away and hit her with it. It was Jessica’s further testimony that she then began “act[ing] as though * * * [she and defendant] were still going to be together after the incident.”', 'According to her testimony, upon returning to the home she shared with defendant and their son, Jessica “immediately * * * started packing.” Jessica next testified that, while she was packing in the bedroom, she heard “a gasping sound from the living room” and found defendant “hanging from the chandelier” “by a wire” “around his neck.” Jessica stated that she then twice grabbed the chair he had stood upon in order to reach the chandelier and put the chair back underneath him; she added that she threatened to call 911. It was her testimony that defendant then removed the wire from his neck. Jessica stated at trial that she returned to the bedroom and told defendant that she was leaving.', 'According to Jessica’s testimony, when defendant returned to the bedroom, she “could tell he was holding something behind him” and defendant “pulled out a knife.” She testified that she was within five inches of the knife and “felt very afraid.” She added that defendant threatened to stab her and to “slash [her] face.” Jessica’s testimony reflects the fact that she and', '-3- defendant moved to the bathroom and then to the kitchen while defendant was still holding the knife. She stated during her testimony that she had “tried to run” but “d[id]n’t know where [she] was going.” Jessica testified that she “decided [she] was going to tell [defendant] that it’s okay, that this is not the worst thing ever that had happened between a couple, and that why d[id]n’t [they] just go along about [their] day how [they] were supposed to.” It was her testimony that she made that statement because she did not have access to a phone and could not “get out of the house.”', 'It was further Jessica’s testimony that she and defendant then left the apartment to go to a Taco Bell restaurant, and defendant left the knife in the apartment. She testified that, when they were inside the Taco Bell, defendant “wasn’t able to eat;” she added that she took a bite of her taco and then told him “[y]ou have to go.” It was her testimony that, upon her threat to “tell everyone what [he did],” he gave her back her phone and left the restaurant. Jessica testified that she then called her stepfather and asked him to come and pick her up.', 'It was Jessica’s testimony that she went to the apartment she had shared with defendant only one time after the knife incident; she stated that she went to pick up some of her son’s belongings while her mother and her son waited in the car. She added that she and defendant continued to communicate over the phone, by text message, and in person in the two weeks preceding the shooting. Moreover, it was Jessica’s testimony that on April 23—the day of the shooting—she saw defendant at his place of employment when she went there “to collect $50.” She added that she agreed to see him that night “[b]ecause he said he would bring [her] make-up and camera.” Jessica stated at trial that defendant showed up around seven and they stood and talked on the porch of her mother’s house, where she was staying. It was her further testimony that they were both calm until she told him she “went out” with some friends; she stated that at', '-4- that point she “saw that the conversation wasn’t really going anywhere [and she] * * * started backing away.” According to her testimony, she backed into the foyer, which was separated by a door from the living room.', 'When asked what happened next, Jessica testified as follows: “Once I was inside and just poking out my head, [defendant] had gotten up from * * * where he was at, like, sort of in an angle way, held onto the knob, opened it, and immediately, like, pulled out the gun from the back of his waist.” She stated that defendant told her that he was not going to kill her but that he wanted to shoot her parents “[b]ecause he wanted [her] to understand what it felt like to be lonely and suffer.” It was her testimony that defendant then opened the door into the living room and “at that point [she] was standing in front of him, and [she] looked towards [her] left, and [she] saw [her] mom’s face, but then [she] focused [her] attention on [defendant], and [she] said, Don’t do it. You don’t have to do it. And by that time he was underneath [her] left arm. [She] was grabbing his – his arms, trying to get some sort of control, and he just raised [the gun], and he shot.” It was Jessica’s testimony that she did not know at the time that the shot had hit her mother.', 'According to her testimony, during her struggle with defendant over the gun, Jessica ended up on her knees with the gun being pointed at her temple and she heard “the click” of the trigger being pulled. She added that, after “the click,” defendant “seemed shocked” and started “reaching for something in his pocket[.]” She stated that she was then able to push him into the foyer and close the door between the living room and the foyer. It was Jessica’s testimony that she then heard defendant close the front door and leave. She added that she ran to her mother, applied pressure to her mother’s wound, and called 911.', '-5-', 'During her testimony on cross-examination,3 Jessica acknowledged that she did not tell the grand jury that she had opened the door of the car and stuck her foot out of the door when she was in the car with defendant immediately preceding the knife incident. On cross-examination, Jessica was also asked if defendant had any marks on his neck after attempting to hang himself from the chandelier, and she testified that she did not notice. She acknowledged that she did not tell the police about the attempted hanging when she gave them a statement on April 23. Jessica further acknowledged that, following the incident with the knife, she called her stepfather from Taco Bell but she did not call the police; she added that her stepfather did not call the police after she told him what had happened. Jessica also elaborated on cross-examination with respect to the knife incident, stating that she and defendant had stopped at Bank of America on the way to Taco Bell. She testified that defendant left her in the car alone during their stop at the bank.', 'Jessica also added on cross-examination that, when defendant came to her mother’s house on April 23, he sent her a text message which she did not read until after the shooting; according to Jessica’s testimony, the text message read as follows: “Tell your mother I’m sorry.” On redirect examination, Jessica stated that she received that text message before defendant arrived at the house.', 'On further cross-examination with respect to the events of April 23, Jessica was confronted with the fact that she did not tell the police on that day that defendant “immediately pulled out the gun while he was closing the door.”', 'Additionally, when confronted on cross-examination with the fact that she testified to the grand jury that, at the time the gun went off, her hands were on defendant’s wrists, she acknowledged that that was what she said to the grand jury but stated: “That is not true.” On 3', 'The defendant alleges numerous inconsistencies in Jessica’s testimony. Although we will not discuss every alleged inconsistency at length in this opinion, see footnote 8, infra, we shall recount Jessica’s cross-examination and redirect examination in somewhat greater depth than would ordinarily be our practice.', '-6- redirect examination, she explained the discrepancy between her testimony before the grand jury and her testimony at trial as follows: “I wasn’t mistaken. At that moment it was something that went by really quick. It could have been on his wrist, higher up on his arm, I did not know the exact location of where my hand was, * * * but it was on his forearm or on his wrist.” During the continued cross-examination with respect to the shooting, Jessica stated that, after the shooting, when she managed to back defendant into the foyer, she shut, but did not lock, the door between the foyer and the living room. She further testified on redirect examination that she would have “taken [defendant] back” if he had received the counseling she thought he needed; also, it was her testimony on cross-examination that she did not “terminate[] the relationship” during their discussion on the porch.', 'Notably, it was Jessica’s testimony on cross-examination that her mother was shot in the chest.', '2. The Testimony of Theodora Nunez', 'Theodora Nunez testified that Jessica was her daughter. She also stated that, during the two-week period between the knife incident and the shooting, Jessica and defendant were “on the phone * * * constantly.” She added that, on the night of the shooting, she heard Jessica tell defendant over the phone not to come to the house. It was also her testimony that, during the evening when Jessica and defendant were out on the porch, she heard Jessica tell defendant to go home and that she was “not going back.” She further testified that, when she was shot, the gun was “to Jessica’s * * * left shoulder;” on cross-examination, she testified that the gun was not underneath any part of Jessica’s body. Her testimony on direct examination also indicated that', '-7- she was facing defendant when he shot her and that, when the bullet hit her, she felt the impact in her right chest.4', 'When Theodora was asked on cross-examination about Jessica calling her on the phone from Taco Bell on the evening of the knife incident, she stated that Jessica told her that she and defendant “had a fight” and that she “ran out of the car.” It was further her testimony on cross- examination that Jessica asked to be picked up and that Theodora, who was in bed, “told” her husband to pick Jessica up. She also stated on cross-examination that, in the two-week period between the knife incident and the shooting, defendant dropped off some of Jessica’s belongings at her house. Finally, it was her testimony that Jessica “c[a]me home every night” during that same period.', 'B', 'Motion for a New Trial', 'The defendant was ultimately convicted on all of the six counts before the jury. On April 24, 2015, he moved for a new trial based on his assessment of the weight of the evidence; it had been his argument at trial that the shooting was accidental. A hearing was held on defendant’s motion on April 28, 2015. At the close of that hearing, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial. The trial justice acknowledged that there was some disparity between the testimony of Jessica and that of Theodora; however, he stated that “the two witnesses were * * * entirely consistent in their testimony that the defendant did level the gun at Theodora and fired at her.” He found that Theodora was struck in the chest, not in the back, and he further stated that “[t]he credible evidence is clear that the defendant went to the Nunez residence with 4', 'Doctor Marco Andrea Giorgi was the surgical resident who testified at trial. During his testimony, he stated that he could not “confirm it a hundred percent” that the bullet entered Theodora’s chest and exited through her back and not the other way around.', '-8- an intent to kill.” The trial justice referenced the fact that defendant sent a text message to Jessica before the shooting saying, “‘Tell your mother I’m sorry.’” He also found that a rational juror “could have clearly inferred that the defendant was intent on killing Jessica, too” on the basis of the testimony that Mr. Diaz grabbed Jessica’s hair while she was “on her knees begging for her life” and “put the gun to her head.” The trial justice stated that Jessica heard “that unmistakable clicking sound” while the gun was pointed to her head and that “it [was] plain that [defendant’s] actions bespeak a man bent on violence.” The trial justice also noted that there had been an earlier incident when defendant threatened Jessica with a knife and threatened to kill her.', 'With respect to the issue of whether or not the shooting was an accident, the trial justice noted that the jury was given an accident instruction, but he commented as follows about the jury’s resolution of that issue: “[O]bviously, [the jury] determined that the State had negated the defense of accident beyond a reasonable doubt. And I concur with that conclusion.” He further stated that “[a]ny suggestion that this was an accident seems hollow to me.” The trial justice pointed to the fact that, after the shooting, defendant “said nothing,” “[d]id nothing to assist [Theodora],” and did not “express any misgivings at the scene,” but rather “fled to New York and tossed the gun in the river.” The trial justice concluded by stating that “there was very little to command any verdict other than the one that the jury decided upon, and I am well satisfied that the evidence supported the guilty verdicts beyond a reasonable doubt.”5 5', 'We note that this final statement by the trial justice seems to reference an analysis of a motion for a new trial based on an argument that the evidence was legally insufficient to support the conviction despite the fact that the basis of the motion for a new trial in the instant case was a contention that the weight of the evidence was inadequate to convict defendant. See, e.g., State v. Karngar, 29 A.3d 1232, 1235 (R.I. 2011). However, we are satisfied, having reviewed the trial justice’s entire decision, that, despite his final statement, the trial justice did conduct the proper analysis for a motion for a new trial based upon the weight of the evidence.', 'That being said, we take this opportunity to reiterate that a motion for a new trial based upon the weight of the evidence and a motion for a new trial based upon the sufficiency of the', '-9-', 'Following the denial of his motion for a new trial, which is before this Court on appeal, defendant was sentenced to the following: (1) thirty years to serve on Count One; (2) thirty years to serve on Count Two, to be served concurrently with the sentence on Count One; (3) twenty years to serve on Count Three, non-parolable, to be served consecutive to the sentence on Count One; (4) ten years to serve on Count Four, non-parolable,6 to be served consecutive to the sentence on Count Two; (5) ten years to serve on Count Five, to be served concurrently with the sentence on Count One; and (6) twenty years to serve on Count Seven, to be served concurrently with the sentence on Count One.

Morales, 895 A.2d 114, 121 (R.I. 2006). If, upon concluding his or her three-step analysis, the trial justice “agrees with the jury’s verdict or if the evidence is such that reasonable minds could differ as to the outcome, the motion for a new trial should be denied.” Muralles, 154 A.3d at 931 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Bunnell, 47 A.3d 220, 232 (R.I. 2012). If the trial justice is not in agreement with the jury’s verdict or does not believe that reasonable minds could differ, he or she must conduct a fourth step “to determine whether the verdict is against the fair preponderance of the evidence and fails to do substantial justice.” State v.

The record “should reflect a few sentences of [the trial justice’s] reasoning on each point.” Muralles, 154 A.3d at 932 (internal quotation marks omitted). However, the trial justice “need not refer to all the evidence supporting the decision; rather, he or she need only cite evidence sufficient to allow this [C]ourt to discern whether the justice has applied the appropriate standards.” Robat, 49 A.3d at 71 (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted); see State v.

See Silva, 84 A.3d at 416. The trial justice specifically considered the evidence in the context of defendant’s intent on the evening in question. He stated that the credible evidence was “clear” that defendant “went to the Nunez residence with an intent to kill;” he added that defendant’s action “be[spoke] a man bent on violence.” Moreover, he pointed to the fact that the jury was given an accident instruction but “obviously, determined that the State had negated the defense of accident beyond a reasonable doubt.”', '- 12 -', 'The trial justice further complied with the second analytical step relative to the motion for a new trial when he assessed the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence. See Morales, 895 A.2d at 121. The trial justice acknowledged that there were inconsistencies in and between the testimonies of Jessica and Theodora, but he stated that the witnesses were consistent when it came to the issue of defendant actually shooting Theodora. He further considered the fact that defendant sent a text message containing an apology to Jessica before the shooting and the fact that there had been an earlier incident, before the shooting, when defendant had threatened Jessica—the knife incident. The trial justice gave weight to Jessica’s testimony that defendant put the gun to her head and, as the trial justice stated, she heard “that unmistakable clicking sound.” Finally, the trial justice also weighed the evidence that showed that defendant did nothing to assist Theodora after the shooting, but rather “fled to New York and tossed the gun in the river.” We note that the trial justice need not discuss all of the evidence supporting his decision, only enough to satisfy this Court that he “applied the appropriate standards.” Robat, 49 A.3d at 71 (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'Lastly, the trial justice completed the third analytical step relative to the motion for a new trial when he determined that he would not have reached a result different from that reached by the jury. See Silva, 84 A.3d at 416. The trial justice expressly stated that he “concur[red]” with the conclusion of the jury that the state had “negated the defense of accident beyond a reasonable doubt.” He also stated that there was “very little to command any verdict other than the one that the jury decided upon * * *.” Due to the trial justice’s conclusion on this third step in his analysis of the motion for a new trial, he was not required to proceed to the fourth step. See Robat, 49 A.3d at 71.', '- 13 -', 'Accordingly, we are completely satisfied that the trial justice conducted the proper three- step analysis of the motion for a new trial; we are unable to perceive any error on the part of the trial justice in his denial of defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'B', 'The Defendant’s Contentions on Appeal', 'Despite our determination that the trial justice did not err in his analysis or conclusion, we will briefly address defendant’s specific arguments on appeal. Initially, defendant posits that Jessica’s testimony was incredible when weighed against the rest of the evidence.', 'He specifically avers that Jessica’s description of the knife incident did not comport with her behavior towards defendant after the incident, such as continuing to communicate with him, agreeing to meet him in person, and stating that she would “take[] [him] back” if he went to counseling. The defendant also points to the fact that Jessica did not lock the door between the foyer and the living room after the shooting, stating that that act was “nonsensical when viewed in conjunction with her narrative.” (Emphasis in original.) However, it is clear to us that, in essence, defendant’s argument boils down to a question of whether or not Jessica was credible. We have stated that the “fact that [a] defendant disagrees with the trial justice’s conclusions about credibility is not a sufficient basis to warrant the granting of a motion for new trial.” State v. Jimenez, 33 A.3d 724, 738 (R.I. 2011) (internal quotation marks omitted).

By way of example, defendant alleges that Jessica’s', '- 14 - testimony is internally inconsistent because she testified differently at different points in time; defendant alleges that Jessica told the police that her mother was shot in the back but testified at trial that she was shot in the chest. He also contends that she added facts to her trial testimony that she did not relate either to the police or to the grand jury; he points, for example, to her testimony that she opened the door to the car and stuck her foot out of the car while driving with defendant immediately before the knife incident and her testimony that defendant tried to hang himself from the chandelier.', 'The defendant also details numerous allegedly inconsistent statements between the testimonies of Jessica and Theodora—e.g., the fact that: (1) Jessica testified that, when she and defendant were on the porch before the shooting, she had not ended the relationship—while Theodora testified that during the same conversation Jessica told defendant that she was “not going back” to him; (2) Jessica testified that, when the shot was fired, the gun was underneath her left arm—whereas Theodora testified that the gun was to the left of Jessica’s body when it was fired; and (3) Jessica testified she “went out” with friends during the two-week period between the knife incident and the shooting—whereas Theodora testified that Jessica “c[a]me home every night.”7 However, inconsistencies in a witness’s testimony do not “preclude a determination that the witness[] w[as] credible.” State v.

He also posits that Theodora’s testimony with respect to getting a call after the knife incident from Jessica at Taco Bell and simply telling her husband to pick Jessica up was not commensurate with the gravity of the knife incident; that statement, however, ignores the fact that Theodora testified that Jessica only told her that she and defendant “had a fight” and that she “ran out of the car.”', '- 15 - “the presence of some inconsistencies between or among utterances of a witness or witnesses at different points in time does not ipso facto render the testimony unworthy of belief”).

As such, in our judgment, the presence of some inconsistencies in Jessica and Theodora’s testimonies does not negate our belief that the trial justice conducted a proper analysis of the motion for a new trial and did not err in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial.8', 'The defendant also contends that the credible medical evidence “contradicted Theodora’s testimony that she was shot in the chest, not the back.” Our thorough review of Theodora’s medical records uncovered the fact that there are numerous statements within those records indicating that Theodora was shot in the back and numerous statements indicating that she was shot in the chest. Doctor Giorgi testified that he could not “confirm it a hundred percent” that the bullet entered Theodora’s chest and exited through her back. However, Jessica testified that Theodora was shot in the chest. We are unable to perceive any error on the part of the trial justice in weighing the medical records and the testimony of Dr. Giorgi, Jessica, and Theodora and arriving at the conclusion that Theodora was shot in the chest. See Morales, 895 A.2d at 121. 8', 'While we have sought to point to the majority of the inconsistencies within and between the testimonies of Jessica and Theodora which defendant references on appeal in our recitation of the pertinent testimony from trial and our discussion of defendant’s contentions, we did not and need not address every single alleged inconsistency.

With respect to defendant’s motive, we note that, even though Jessica testified that she would have “taken [defendant] back” if he went to counseling and that she did not terminate their relationship during their conversation immediately preceding the shooting, those statements alone do not rule out any possible motive for defendant to kill Jessica and Theodora; nor do those statements negate all other evidence of defendant’s intent. It is the function of the trial justice on a motion for a new trial to weigh the evidence and make credibility determinations, and defendant’s argument once again comes back to questioning which evidence the trial justice found credible. See id.; Paola, 59 A.3d at 104. It is clear to us that the trial justice appropriately exercised his role as the thirteenth juror in determining, based on the evidence he deemed credible, that defendant intended to kill Jessica and Theodora.

This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on April 5, 2017, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties’ arguments (both written and oral), we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this appeal may be decided at this time.', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On September 16, 2014, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, in which they contended that Mr. Bartlett had been treated on a weekly basis by defendant for a “cellulitis ulcer” at the', '-1- South County Hospital Wound Care Center between February 2, 2012 and June 21, 2012. The amended complaint alleged that defendant breached the standard of care and was “negligent during the period of treatment in failure to apply certain wound evaluation practices to evaluate the lack of progress of ulcer healing commonly used by doctors providing treatment for this type of condition.” The amended complaint went on to allege that defendant’s “practices” failed to diagnose a “foot bone infection” that developed and that required “right foot bone amputation on July 12, 2012.” The plaintiffs further alleged in their amended complaint that the “prolonged period of treatment and necessity of amputation resulted in [Mr. Bartlett’s] inability to pursue income production, significant unnecessary medical expenditures and prolonged period of physical inactivity for a seventy five year old with significant physical mobility problems.” The amended complaint also included an allegation that, as a result of Dr. Coppe’s alleged negligence, Mrs. Bartlett was required to care for her husband’s wound after the amputation, drive her husband to doctor’s appointments, and take full responsibility for household duties.', 'During the course of discovery, plaintiffs answered one of defendant’s interrogatories stating that they “[did] not plan or expect to use the services of an expert to testify in this complaint.” However, after a lengthy discovery period, in a letter to defense counsel dated December 16, 2015, plaintiffs identified a registered nurse, Lisa M. Burke, MSN, RN, CWOCN, as their proposed expert witness. Nurse Burke is identified, in the documents attached to the December 16 letter, as a “Certified Wound, Ostomy and Continence Nurse.” On March 25, 2016, defendant filed a motion to preclude plaintiffs from relying upon an expert witness at trial, contending that plaintiffs failed to meet a discovery deadline with respect to the disclosure of their expert witness and further contending that “the expert disclosed by [plaintiffs], Lisa Burke, MSN, RN, CWOCN does not possess the necessary qualifications to render opinions regarding', '-2- the applicable standard of care for a physician and surgeon.” On April 1, 2016, a justice of the Superior Court heard argument1 on defendant’s motion.

Prescod, 948 A.2d 304, 310 (R.I. 2008) (quoting Riley v. Stone, 900 A.2d 1087, 1095 (R.I. 2006)); see also Malinou v. Miriam Hospital, 24 A.3d 497, 509 (R.I. 2011). We have further stated that “[t]ime and time again, we have required expert testimony * * * to establish deviation from the standard of care when the lack of care is not so evident as to be obvious to a lay person.” Malinou, 24 A.3d at 509 (quoting Foley v. St. Joseph Health Services of Rhode Island, 899 A.2d 1271, 1277 (R.I. 2006)); see also Laplante, 110 A.3d at 265; Riley, 900 A.2d at 1095. The expert witness is needed to “measure the care that was administered against the degree of care and skill ordinarily employed in like cases by physicians in good standing engaged in the same type of practice in similar localities.” Malinou, 24 A.3d at 509 (internal quotation marks omitted). As such, the just-cited cases have made it amply clear that, for a plaintiff to prevail in a medical malpractice action, an expert witness is essential, unless the deviation from the standard of care would be clear to a layperson.', 'In the instant case, plaintiffs indicated they had no intention of retaining another expert witness, and the hearing justice thereafter precluded them from relying on any expert witnesses in the case. Additionally, we do not agree with plaintiffs’ contention that the allegations of malpractice which they made vis-à-vis Dr. Coppe “were not of a complex nature which could be understood by the average juror.” By way of example, we have stated that such a non-complex or obvious situation “might occur if a surgeon were to leave an instrument inside a patient.”', '-7- Laplante, 110 A.3d at 265. The instant case involves a drastically different situation. Here, plaintiffs allege that defendant breached the standard of care for treatment of a “cellulitis ulcer” on Mr. Bartlett’s foot. This is certainly not the type of case in which defendant’s negligence would be obvious to a layperson. Thus, plaintiffs’ claims could only have been established by expert testimony; given the fact that plaintiffs were precluded from relying on expert testimony, they were not able to establish an essential element of their case. See id. at 264. As such, no material facts remained in dispute, and defendant was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Walsh, 155 A.3d at 1204.', 'Finally, plaintiffs have raised the issue of what they contend was bias on the part of the hearing justice. However, plaintiffs did not move for the hearing justice’s recusal in Superior Court. See Huntley v. State, 109 A.3d 869, 874 (R.I. 2015) (“Since the appellants neither moved for recusal nor raised the alleged issue of bias on the record, we deem that argument to have been waived.”). Moreover, our consideration of the alleged bias of the hearing justice and whether or not that issue was raised on the record is certainly hampered by the fact that plaintiffs chose not to submit any transcripts to this Court on appeal. As such, their appeal on this ground is unavailing. See Loppi v. United Investors Life Insurance Co., 126 A.3d 458, 460 (R.I. 2015). That being said, after our in-depth review of the record before us, we are unable to perceive any evidence that the hearing justice was biased against plaintiffs or that she acted in any way that would be incompatible with the interests of justice.', 'Accordingly, there being no reversible error by the hearing justice evident in any of the areas preserved on appeal in the instant case, we affirm her grant of the defendant’s motion for summary judgment.', '-8-', 'V', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

The defendant, Joseph Ogoffa, filed a petition for issuance of a writ of certiorari before this Court, seeking review of his January 9, 2014 conviction in Providence County Superior Court on five counts of first-degree child molestation, in violation of G.L. 1956 §§ 11-37-8.1 and 11-37-8.2. On November 16, 2016, this Court granted his petition. The defendant contends that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial. He further posits that his “constitutional right to present a full and fair defense” was denied because the trial justice “unfairly limit[ed] his cross-examination of two witnesses.”', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On April 11, 2008, defendant was charged by indictment with five counts of first-degree child molestation. A trial took place over four days in January of 2014.1 We relate below the salient aspects of what transpired at that trial. 1', 'The defendant represents in his brief that the reason for the delay between the indictment and the eventual trial was the fact that he was living in Nebraska and was “unaware that he had been indicted.”', '-1-', 'A', 'The Testimony of Sarah2', 'Sarah, the complaining witness, testified that, at the time of trial, she was eighteen years old. She stated that, when she was six years old and in the first grade, her parents worked afternoon shifts and Sarah and her younger brother, Nicholas, would go to “Aunt [Pamela’s]” house; Sarah added that Pamela was her mother’s best friend.3 Sarah testified that Pamela’s mother, whom she called “Gramme,” would babysit her at Pamela’s house. She stated that she loved Pamela and Gramme.', 'It was Sarah’s further testimony that, at the time in question, Pamela’s son Joe (the defendant) was “old enough to be in high school or college” and that he did not come to Pamela’s house “a lot.” When asked to identify Joe at trial, Sarah identified defendant. It was her testimony that she remembered a time in September and October of 2001 when Joe came over to Pamela’s house and “told [Sarah] to come with him to the bathroom.” She stated that Gramme and Nicholas were in the living room at the time, but it was also her testimony that “sometimes” Gramme “do[z]e[d] off.” She added that she told defendant “no” initially, but that she then did accompany him to the bathroom. Sarah stated that she was “[s]cared” because she “didn’t really know who [defendant] was.” It was further Sarah’s testimony that, once inside the bathroom, defendant told her to lie down on the floor and that he proceeded to remove her pants and underwear. She testified that, after telling him to stop, she did not say anything further to him and did not scream because she was “scared.”', 'Her testimony was to the effect that 2', 'We have employed pseudonyms in referring to the complaining witness (Sarah), her brother (Nicholas), her mother (Cathy), her father (Gerald), her cousin (Leslie), and defendant’s mother (Pamela). 3', 'It is clear from the record that Pamela was not a blood relative of Cathy or Sarah.', '-2- defendant then put his penis into her vagina. Sarah added that defendant then told her not to tell anyone. It was further Sarah’s testimony that she did not tell Gramme or her own mother about what had happened in the bathroom because she was afraid of “[g]etting in trouble.”', 'Sarah testified that, either the next day or a couple of days later, she was in the bathroom with defendant again and “the same thing happened.” She added that she did not know why she went into the bathroom with defendant that second time. Sarah further testified that, on three further occasions, she was alone with defendant and “something happened.” It was Sarah’s testimony at trial that the third incident took place in a bedroom closet in Pamela’s house because “[s]omebody was in the bathroom.” It was her testimony that, on that third occasion, defendant “used his fingers.” She also testified that the final two incidents took place in the bathroom and that defendant engaged in digital vaginal penetration on both of those occasions as well. Sarah’s testimony reflected the fact that she did not reveal anything to anyone after any of the five incidents; she stated that she was afraid because “this was like a family, I guess.” It was her testimony that she viewed defendant as a “family member;” and she answered in the affirmative when asked by the prosecutor if she “loved” defendant. Sarah testified that she continued to go to Pamela’s house to be babysat for about a year after the assaults took place.', 'Sarah proceeded to testify that there did come a time, while she was twelve years old, when she told her cousin, Leslie, about the assaults. She stated that she made that revelation to Leslie because she had gotten “into an argument with [her] parents about them not letting [her] go out and hang with friends” and she “got frustrated.” It was her testimony that she asked her cousin “to keep [her] secret;” she stated that her reason for so doing was that “it happened six years before[, and she] didn’t want to still talk about it after [she] told her [cousin].” Sarah testified that, at the time of her disclosure to her cousin, Cathy (Sarah’s mother) and Pamela were', '-3- no longer friends and had “drifted apart,” although they still saw one another at church. She added that Cathy and Pamela had “drifted apart” because Sarah’s father, Cathy’s husband, “didn’t like their friendship.” In Sarah’s words, “[h]e thought they were too close.” It was further Sarah’s testimony that her cousin told Sarah’s “oldest brother” about the assaults and that Sarah’s parents eventually found out. Sarah testified that she spoke to the police the day after her parents “confront[ed]” her with respect to the assaults. She added that, “[m]aybe like a day or two after” she gave her statement to the police, she went to see a doctor. She was then asked at trial if she was sure that “[e]ach and every time of the five times that the defendant took [her] into the bathroom or the closet * * * it was Joseph Ogoffa and not one of his brothers?” and she responded: “I’m positive.”', 'On cross-examination, Sarah was confronted with the fact that she told the grand jury that the final assault was the one assault that took place in the closet—rather than it being the third assault which took place in the closet, as she testified at trial. She replied as follows:', '“When I was in front of the grand jury I was twelve years old and', 'it was very nerve wracking and I was very nervous. * * * At', 'twelve * * * I had never been in a situation like this before. I never', 'stood in front of people that don’t know who I am that don’t know', 'my story, so I did say that at twelve but I’m saying this now and I', 'know what I’m saying.” She was also asked on cross-examination if there had been any blood in her underwear after the assaults, but she answered in the negative. She was further asked whether she told the doctors that the “fifth time was anally?” She responded: “No. Not that I recall, no.”4 4', 'The Clinic Note generated after Sarah’s examination at the Child Safe Clinic at Rhode Island Hospital reflected the fact that she replied, “Yes,” when asked if defendant “put his penis in her butt.” The Clinic Note states that Sarah said that that manner of assault “‘happened 3-5 times.’” The Clinic Note was entered as a full exhibit at trial.', '-4-', 'B', 'The Testimony of Cathy', 'On cross-examination, Cathy, Sarah’s mother, testified that she “never noticed any blood in [Sarah’s] underwear when [she] did [Sarah’s] laundry during [the] time period [at issue].”', 'Further, on cross-examination, the following exchange took place:', '“[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: When you spoke to [Sarah] about this', 'incident that she disclosed in 2007 to you, she didn’t tell you', 'which one of [Pamela’s] son[s] was responsible; is that correct?', '“[CATHY]: She told me.', '“[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Do you remember speaking to a doctor', 'at Rhode Island Hospital back on December 5th, 2007?” The prosecution objected to the last question. A discussion at sidebar ensued. The prosecution stated that the reason for its objection was that the question was “inappropriate impeachment,” and the prosecutor also referenced “hearsay.” It is clear from the transcript of the sidebar discussion and from defendant’s contentions on appeal that his counsel was attempting to cross- examine Cathy with a statement she made at the Child Safe Clinic at Rhode Island Hospital that was reflected in the Clinic Note (which document was admitted as a full exhibit at trial). The Clinic Note states the following: “MOC[5] said the patient told her that when she was approximately six-years-old, she was sexually abused by one of the four sons of the woman who used to baby-sit the patient. * * * MOC said she named all four sons of the baby-sitter and asked the patient ‘which one’ sexually abused her. MOC said the patient said, ‘it was Joe.’” The trial justice ruled on the objection as follows:', '“What it says is mother of child said she, that refers to', '[Sarah], named all four of the sons and the babysitter and asked the', 'patient which one and it was the mother asked [Sarah], who is', 'patient, which one and she said it was him.

You can rephrase it. Go with something a little different', '* * * for what you are trying to establish. I don’t think it is', 'contained in the document so the objection is sustained at this', 'point.”', 'We note, additionally, that the Clinic Note reflected the fact that, in reference to the assaults, Cathy said the following: “‘and if this is true, I have to go through this;’” it also reflected the fact that Cathy then stated that she believed Sarah but that she “had difficulty understanding ‘how this could all happen in the bathroom.’”', 'C', 'The Testimony of Leslie', 'While cross-examining Leslie, Sarah’s cousin, with respect to Sarah’s disclosure of the assaults, defense counsel asked Leslie the following question: “And isn’t it true that she couldn’t identify to you who did it?” The following exchange then ensued:', '“[THE STATE]: Objection as to the characterization. ‘She', 'couldn’t,’ I think that is misstating the testimony.', '“[THE COURT]: I will sustain the objection. You can ask it in a', 'slightly different way.', '“* * *', '“[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: She didn’t tell you who did it?', '“[LESLIE]: She didn’t tell me.”', 'D', 'The Testimony of Doctor Amy Goldberg', 'Doctor Amy Goldberg testified that she was a “pediatrician with subspecialty training in the area of child abuse pediatrics;” she added that she worked at the “Child Safe Protection Center,” also referred to as the “Child Safe Clinic.” She was qualified as an expert witness at trial. It was Dr. Goldberg’s testimony that Sarah’s examination at the Child Safe Clinic was “normal.” She added that the examination showed a “loss of tissue” in the “fossa, * * * the area', '-6- just below the vaginal opening.” Doctor Goldberg testified that the loss of tissue may have been “the way that [Sarah] developed.” However, it was also her testimony that “it is something * * * suggestive of penetrating trauma but not definitive.”', 'The Clinic Note from Sarah’s visit to the Child Safe Clinic indicated that “[t]he entire hymen was seen and there was no evidence of lacerations or transection,” and it stated that the “labia majora and minora were both normal without bruising or scarring.” The Clinic Note also referenced the loss of tissue discussed by Dr. Goldberg.', 'E', 'The Motion for a New Trial', 'On January 9, 2014, the jury found defendant guilty on all five counts. The defendant subsequently moved for a new trial; he contended that the guilty verdicts were not supported by the weight of the evidence. On January 31, 2014, the trial justice held a hearing on defendant’s motion for a new trial. At the conclusion of that hearing, the trial justice issued his decision denying defendant’s motion. He began by accurately detailing the standard to be applied by a trial justice in deciding a motion for a new trial based on the weight of the evidence. The trial justice discussed the charges against defendant; he then briefly recounted the testimonies of Sarah, Cathy, and Leslie. He further detailed the testimony of Dr. Goldberg. After discussing the testimony, he noted that he was “mindful” of his instructions to the jury, and he acknowledged that “[t]here is no question that in a delayed reporting child molestation sexual assault case such as this, the accuracy, trustworthiness, and ultimately the credibility of the complaining witness will receive the most scrutiny by a jury or a judge sitting as a thirteenth juror.” Finally, the trial justice concluded that “all of the essential elements of these offenses were established by credible evidence supplied by [Sarah];” he added that Sarah was “credible', '-7- and persuasive,” “articulate, thoughtful and reasonably detailed,” and “sincere and genuine.” He continued as follows:', '“Simply put [Sarah] was believable throughout her testimony.', 'Therefore, this Court finds that it agrees with the jury’s verdict.', 'The guilty findings on all five counts are amply supported by the', 'credible evidence in the record. Accordingly, defendant’s motion', 'for new trial is denied.”', 'On May 1, 2014, the trial justice sentenced defendant to five concurrent life sentences on the five counts on which he was convicted. On October 20, 2016, defendant petitioned this Court for issuance of a writ of certiorari.', 'The defendant failed to timely file an appeal; nevertheless, we granted his petition for issuance of a writ of certiorari.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'In ruling on a motion for a new trial based upon the weight of the evidence, a trial justice “acts as a thirteenth juror and exercises independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.” State v.

In so doing, the trial justice must: “(1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” State v. Muralles, 154 A.3d 925, 931 (R.I. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Silva, 84 A.3d 411, 416 (R.I. 2014). After conducting the three-step analysis, if the trial justice “agrees with the jury’s verdict or if the evidence is such that reasonable minds could differ as to the outcome, the motion for a new trial should be denied.” State v. Bunnell, 47 A.3d 220, 232 (R.I. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Muralles, 154 A.3d at 932. However, if the', '-8- trial justice is not in agreement with the jury’s verdict or does not think that reasonable minds could differ, then the trial justice must engage in a fourth analytical step to “determine whether the verdict is against the fair preponderance of the evidence and fails to do substantial justice.” State v.

The defendant points specifically to the', '- 10 - following statements and facts elicited at trial: (1) Sarah never complained of any physical pain; (2) Cathy never noticed anything unusual in Sarah’s underwear; (3) Sarah never complained about going to Pamela’s house to be babysat by Gramme; (4) Sarah “made no sound loud enough to be heard by the people in the very next room” during the assaults; and (5) the fact that, according to defendant, Sarah had “no tears in her hymen, no abrasions, no bruising, and no scarring in either her vagina or anus.” (Emphasis in original.)', 'In the instant case, the trial justice began his decision by carrying out the first analytical step in an analysis of a motion for a new trial—that is, he considered the evidence in light of the charge to the jury. See Muralles, 154 A.3d at 931. The trial justice specifically discussed each charge of which defendant had been convicted before moving on to assess the evidence in light of those charges. He detailed the testimony of the witnesses. He stated that Cathy and Leslie testified to the timing and manner of Sarah’s eventual disclosure; and he set forth, at length, Sarah’s account of the assaults.', 'Finally, he discussed how Dr. Goldberg’s testimony corroborated Sarah’s testimony.', 'Moreover, the trial justice stated that, in conducting his analysis, he was “mindful of the instruction to the jury.” He even quoted the following portion of his instructions to the jury: “‘[B]ear in mind that the testimony of a single witness if believed is sufficient for the proof of any fact and can depending on your assessment justify a verdict in accordance with that testimony.’”', 'The record clearly reveals that the trial justice then moved to the second analytical step and assessed the credibility of the witnesses and weighed the evidence. See id. He stated that he was “aware,” as had been the jury, of the fact that, at the time of trial, Sarah was eighteen and was testifying about something that occurred when she was six years old. He noted that, in a “delayed reporting child molestation sexual assault case such as this,” the credibility of the', '- 11 - complaining witness “will receive the most scrutiny by a jury or a judge sitting as a thirteenth juror.” He then stated that “all of the essential elements of the[] offenses were established by credible evidence supplied by [Sarah].” (Emphasis added.) In addition to finding Sarah’s testimony to be credible, he also found it to be “accurate and trustworthy,” “articulate, thoughtful and reasonably detailed,” “sincere and genuine,” and “believable.”', 'The trial justice proceeded to the third analytical step in his analysis of the motion for a new trial—he found that he would not have reached a result different from that reached by the jury. See id. The trial justice stated: “[T]his Court finds that it agrees with the jury’s verdict. The guilty findings on all five counts are amply supported by the credible evidence in the record.” The trial justice then proceeded to deny defendant’s motion for a new trial. See Bunnell, 47 A.3d at 232 (stating that if a trial justice “agrees with the jury’s verdict * * * the motion for a new trial should be denied”). Having carefully reviewed the record, we are unable to perceive any error in the trial justice’s analysis of defendant’s motion for a new trial, and we are more than satisfied that the trial justice sufficiently articulated his reasoning on each step in his analysis of the motion for a new trial so as to be entitled to “great deference” by this Court. Muralles, 154 A.3d at 932; Whitaker, 79 A.3d at 803.', 'We turn briefly to defendant’s contentions on appeal. We acknowledge that the trial justice did not discuss every inconsistency or improbable fact that defendant alleges; however, a trial justice is not required to “refer to all of the evidence supporting [his or her] decision;” he need only refer to enough to allow this Court to determine whether or not he conducted the appropriate analysis. Muralles, 154 A.3d at 932 (emphasis in original). We further note that the existence of some inconsistencies in a witness’s testimony does not “preclude a determination that the witness[] w[as] credible.” State v. Lopez, 129 A.3d 77, 85 (R.I. 2016).

The trial justice found Sarah to be credible; and we will give that determination due deference, bearing in mind the fact that the “trial justice, being present during all phases of the trial, is in an especially good position to evaluate the facts and to judge the credibility of the witnesses.” Paola, 59 A.3d at 104 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Harrison, 66 A.3d 432, 446 (R.I. 2013).', 'Accordingly, it is our judgment that, in dealing with defendant’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice did not commit clear error or “overlook[] or misconceive[] material and relevant evidence [relating] to a critical issue in the case.” DiCarlo, 987 A.2d at 871.', 'B', 'Cross-Examination of the State’s Witnesses', 'The defendant avers that his constitutional right to present a “full and fair defense” was denied because his counsel’s cross-examination of Cathy and Leslie was unfairly limited.

The defendant contends that the trial justice erred in determining that the statement at the Child Safe Clinic was consistent with Cathy’s testimony. With respect to Leslie’s testimony, defendant maintains that the following question he asked of Leslie on cross-examination should have been allowed: “And isn’t it true that [Sarah] couldn’t identify to you who did it?”', 'The United States Supreme Court has stated that “[w]hether rooted directly in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment * * * or in the Compulsory Process or Confrontation clauses of the Sixth Amendment, * * * the Constitution guarantees criminal defendants a meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.” Crane v.

Cianci, 430 A.2d 756, 762 (R.I. 1981). Additionally, we remain mindful of the fact that we review the decisions of the trial justice with respect to the cross-examinations of Cathy and Leslie for an abuse of discretion. See Walsh, 731 A.2d at 698.', 'We begin by addressing Cathy’s testimony. After our review of the transcript and the Clinic Note, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion with respect to his ruling on Cathy’s testimony. He was well within his discretion to determine that the statement Cathy made at the Child Safe Clinic was not inconsistent with her testimony at trial. See Cianci, 430 A.2d at 762. Moreover, we note that defendant’s cross-examination of Cathy was not limited in the sense that he was unable to explore her possible bias or prejudice or lack of credibility, thus distinguishing this case from our decision in Tiernan; in that case, we held that defense counsel’s questioning on cross-examination was limited to such an extent as to be “tantamount to a complete denial of the right to cross-examine the complaining witness about his possible bias.” Tiernan, 941 A.2d at 137. That simply cannot be said with respect to the instant case. Furthermore, we point out that the statement that defense counsel wished to use in cross- examining Cathy was contained in the Clinic Note, which was entered as a full exhibit at trial satisfy the Sixth Amendment.” State v. Kausel, 68 A.3d 524, 532 (R.I. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted).', '- 15 - and, as such, was before the jury. Lastly, the trial justice did not completely restrict defense counsel from asking any question with respect to the Clinic Note; he merely suggested that defense counsel “rephrase [the question]” or “[g]o with something a little different * * * for what you are trying to establish.” And, notably, defense counsel then opted to pursue a different line of inquiry.', 'With respect to the cross-examination of Leslie, the question defendant proposed to ask—“And isn’t it true that [Sarah] couldn’t identify to you who did it?”—was not consistent with Leslie’s testimony. Leslie merely testified that Sarah did not tell her exactly who attacked her; she did not testify that Sarah could not tell her who attacked her. There was certainly no abuse of discretion by the trial justice in this very minor limitation on defendant’s cross- examination of Leslie. Accordingly, in our judgment, defendant’s right to present a complete defense was not infringed in the instant case.', 'In conclusion, we are unable to perceive any error on the part of the trial justice in the instant case with respect to his denying the defendant’s motion for a new trial or with respect to his rather minimal limiting of the defendant’s cross-examination.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we quash the writ and affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

These consolidated appeals arise from a judgment of the Superior Court regarding the statutory interpretation of the manner in which state education aid funds that are received by the Bristol Warren Regional School District (BWRSD or district) should be calculated and apportioned to its constituent towns, Bristol and Warren.', 'The defendants, the BWRSD, the Bristol Warren Regional School Committee (BWRSC or committee), and the Town of Bristol, appeal from a Superior Court judgment granting Warren’s petition and complaint for declaratory judgment. 1 The defendants argue that the trial justice misconstrued the Rhode Island Board of Education Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 7 of title 16 (Education Act) and the Rhode Island Education Equity and Property Tax Relief Act, G.L. 1956 1', 'The Rhode Island Department of Education was a named defendant in the second amended complaint in the lower court but did not appeal the decision of the Superior Court.', '-1- chapter 7.2 of title 16 (Funding Formula Act). The defendants further maintain that the trial justice failed to accord proper deference to the Rhode Island Department of Education’s (RIDE) interpretation of those statutes. In a separate argument, Bristol posits that the Superior Court did not have jurisdiction over this declaratory-judgment action because Warren failed to join all interested parties and further that Warren’s claims are barred by the doctrine of res judicata. After careful consideration of the record, and for the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The BWRSD and the Enabling Legislation', 'The contiguous towns of Bristol and Warren form the BWRSD, which was established pursuant to chapter 330 of the 1991 Public Laws of Rhode Island (enabling legislation). The BWRSC, consisting of nine members, was created to govern the BWRSD in accordance with the enabling legislation. The Joint Finance Committee (JFC) was formed under P.L. 1991, ch. 330, sec. 3, § X(I)(3) of the enabling legislation; it consists of nine members appointed by the town councils of Bristol and Warren. At the time of the dispute, the JFC comprised six representatives from Bristol and three from Warren. 2', 'The enabling legislation lays out the approval process for the district’s annual budget. In that regard, it provides that the superintendent of the district is to prepare and present a preliminary annual budget to the committee containing estimates of the funds needed to operate the district for the ensuing fiscal year. The committee then submits its proposed budget to the JFC for approval. Upon approval of the budget, each town is required to appropriate funds for 2', 'The representation of the JFC’s membership is apportioned according to the most recent federal census.', '-2- the district, which are “apportioned between the cities on a per public pupil calculation using enrollment as of the prior October 1,” pursuant to the enabling legislation. 3', 'The parties have stipulated 4 that, since the formation of the BWRSD, its treasurer would reduce the annual budget, as approved by the JFC, by the total amount of state aid and any other miscellaneous revenue sources, and then would apportion the remaining balance of the budget by the student population, on a per-capita basis from each municipality.', 'The Prior Litigation', 'In 2012, the BWRSD and the BWRSC filed suit against Warren, seeking a declaratory judgment and a writ of mandamus, demanding that Warren appropriate its full share of the 2012- 2013 school budget for the BWRSD, as was determined by the JFC. See Bristol Warren Regional School District v. Town of Warren, No. PC12-4653, 2014 WL 1396941 (Apr. 4, 2014) (the prior litigation). The budget for that fiscal year required that Warren pay the sum of $12,164,919 to the district. Id. at *2. However, Warren balked; at its financial town meeting, the town voted to appropriate only $11,748,919 of the budgeted amount. Id. In April 2014, the Superior Court determined that Warren was not authorized to reject a budget that had been approved by the JFC because the enabling legislation cloaked the JFC with final budgetary authority. Id. at *6. Therefore, the court ordered Warren to appropriate the additional funds to the BWRSD. Id. That judgment was not appealed. 3', 'In addition to P.L. 1991, ch. 330, sec. 3, § X(I)(3), sec. 3, § VII(I) provides that “[t]he total education costs of the [BWRSD] shall be apportioned between the towns based upon a per public pupil calculation, using enrollment as of the prior October 1.” 4', 'The parties submitted a stipulation of agreed facts to the trial court as well as a stipulation of disputed facts.', '-3-', 'The Current Dispute', 'In early December 2013, while the prior litigation remained pending, the state representative for Warren contacted RIDE about the state calculations for the education aid funding formula. In particular, he questioned why Bristol and Warren were assessed the same local share per pupil even though Warren students, because of a higher rate of state aid, were generating a greater per-pupil share of the state revenues. In response to his inquiry, RIDE provided a spreadsheet that compared the formula aid by region and by member town for the BWRSD. According to Warren, those calculations “confirmed Warren’s claim that it would in fact receive more aid if the calculations were made with reference to the comparative rates of students receiving free or reduced price lunch, rather than with reference to a blended figure.”', 'In March 2014, Warren’s finance director received an email from the district informing him of the projected 2014-2015 school budget. That same day, the finance director submitted a memorandum to the town manager, indicating that the proper allocation of state education aid should be on a weighted per-pupil basis in accordance with the basis of need of the municipalities. Attached to the memorandum was RIDE’s funding formula analysis for the 2015 fiscal year showing the figures for Bristol and Warren, both separately and as a regional district. The memorandum was presented to the JFC shortly thereafter. The JFC, however, did not adopt the recommendations set forth in the memorandum.', 'Later that month, Warren filed a petition for writ of mandamus, injunctive relief, and a complaint for declaratory judgment against the BWRSD, the BWRSC, and the Town of Bristol. In its filing, Warren claimed that the enabling legislation and the Funding Formula Act required that state aid be allocated not on a per-capita per-pupil basis, but on a weighted per-pupil basis,', '-4- taking into account the number of students with free or reduced-price lunch in each town, the median income of each town, and the total assessed property values of each town.', 'The Lower Court Proceedings', 'During a hearing on May 12, 2014, RIDE’s senior finance officer testified that RIDE made use of specific data components to determine state education aid for individual districts. Those data components include the state share ratio, which consists of, among other factors, property values, free and reduced-price lunch data for students, and adjusted equalized weighted assessed valuations (EWAV).', 'The senior finance officer affirmed that, under the funding formula, a poorer community typically is allocated more money from the state for education aid than a more affluent community. She further specified that, in the case of Bristol and Warren, state aid is currently “calculated as a regional district, so the data components are added together.” Significantly, she testified that, if state aid were to be calculated separately, the state aid assigned to each student for Bristol would be $2,897 and $5,442 for Warren for the 2015 fiscal year.', 'Subsequent hearings were held on May 13 and 15, 2014. During the May 15 hearing, the trial justice determined that Warren’s claim was not precluded under the doctrine of res judicata. In that regard, the trial justice concluded that he did “not believe that the issue of how the credits are to be apportioned [wa]s squarely addressed by the enabling legislation.” The trial justice, however, did not at that time come to a conclusion about the ultimate statutory interpretation issue; instead, he asked the parties to submit supplemental memoranda and encouraged Warren to consider joining RIDE as a party to the litigation.', 'Warren then filed a second amended petition and complaint, naming RIDE as a defendant, because that agency oversees and disburses state aid to schools. Warren alleged that,', '-5- rather than allocate aid separately to Warren and Bristol as provided for under the Education Act and the Funding Formula Act, RIDE disbursed a lump sum to the BWRSD, which in turn subtracted the amount of state aid from its total budget and then apportioned the remaining cost to each town on a per-student basis. According to Warren, this improperly shifted some of Warren’s state aid to Bristol and resulted in Warren being “overcharged” $2,054,790 in fiscal year 2014-2015.', 'RIDE subsequently filed a motion to dismiss Warren’s second amended petition and complaint on the ground that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted against RIDE. All parties, including Warren, Bristol, the BWRSD, and the BWRSC, filed objections to RIDE’s motion to dismiss. After a hearing on RIDE’s motion to dismiss in July 2014, the trial justice denied the motion.', 'The case was reached for trial in April 2015. At the close of all the evidence, and after taking into consideration the memoranda and oral arguments of the parties, the trial justice issued a bench decision. With respect to the argument that the Superior Court lacked jurisdiction under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (G.L. 1956 chapter 30 of title 9) because all interested parties had not been joined, the trial justice determined that there had not been any motion to add additional defendants by any party, nor had there been any request for intervention by any other school district to participate in the matter. The trial justice found that a determination in favor of defendants on the ground of failing to join all necessary parties would “essentially require[] the [c]ourt to speculate as to which other parties may or may not be affected by the [c]ourt’s holding[.]” And the trial justice declared that “the [c]ourt should not have to speculate as to which other parties are going to be affected and which parties should or should not be joined.”', '-6-', 'With respect to defendants’ arguments as to the amount of deference that should be afforded to RIDE, the trial justice recognized that there had been no regulation or authority that had been promulgated by the agency on the issue. The trial justice specified that', '“where the statute and any rule established by RIDE ha[d] not been', 'established pursuant to any rulemaking process, any vetting, any', 'solicitation of opinions, anything of that nature, that at most', 'RIDE’s position may have persuasive authority in order to give', 'effect to the purpose of the Act as intended by the [L]egislature * *', '*.” He concluded that RIDE was “not entitled to full Chevron[5] deference because there ha[d] been no rule or regulation established by RIDE in regards to this legislation.”', 'Turning to the statutory interpretation argument, the trial justice articulated “that RIDE and the Town of Bristol [we]re to a large extent basing their argument on a section that contain[ed] the definition of certain terms.” He continued, “that definitional section d[id]n’t in any way state how moneys [we]re to be allocated to other regional school districts. It only deal[t] with Chariho.[6]', 'And the only section that state[d] specifically how the equalized weighted assessed valuation [wa]s to be determined [wa]s at [§] 16-7-21.” The trial justice said that “the [L]egislature could have made a clear statement that Bristol Warren should be treated jointly for allocation and distribution, [but] it did not.” The trial justice voiced that “the clear language of that statute * * * indicate[d] that the allocation should be determined directly pursuant to Bristol and Warren’s individual tax bases as required by the funding formula both at [§] 16-7-21 and at [§] 16-7-20.” He found “that the clear language require[d] that the allocation be made pursuant to each city and town.” And he stated “that at best [§] 16-7-16 create[d] an 5', 'Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v.

The defendants’ arguments continuously hover around § 16-7-16(5), the definition of community. Although it is true that the definition of community includes “any city, town, or regional school district,” it is important to note that this definition is somewhat malleable, depending on the context of the section in which it is used.', 'We will begin our analysis at § 16-7.2-3(a) (Appendix D), where the foundation education-aid formula is provided. One of the factors that make up the formula is the district state-share ratio, which is calculated pursuant to § 16-7.2-4 (Appendix E). Section 16-7.2-4(a) then directs the reader to § 16-7-20 (Appendix F). Section 16-7-20 annunciates the formula for the state share for each community. The BWRSD and the BWRSC concede that “pursuant to [§] 16-7-21 an EWAV for each city or town must be generated and is based upon the value of real and personal property of such city or town.” However, the BWRSD and the BWRSC urge that, even though § 16-7-21 requires an EWAV to be calculated separately for each city and town, § 16-7-20 uses the EWAV of the “community” in the calculation of the state share ratio, and that the statutory definition of community includes regional school districts.', '- 17 -', 'Thoughtful as it may be, we are not persuaded by this reasoning. The controlling factor from § 16-7-20 is “v,” the adjusted EWAV for the community. The BWRSD and the BWRSC would have us stop our analysis at § 16-7-20; however, stopping the analysis at that point would, in our judgment, be premature. Section 16-7-20 further defines “v” pursuant to § 16-7-21(3), and although subsection (3) refers to the EWAV for each community, it cites to subsection (2) of § 16-7-21 and says that “[t]he equalized weighted assessed valuation for each community as allocated or apportioned in accordance with subdivision (2) of this section * * *.” (Emphasis added.) And subsection (2) of § 16-7-21 specifically says, “[t]he equalized weighted assessed valuation for each city and town shall be allocated to the particular city or town * * *.” (Emphases added.)', 'Moreover, it is our opinion that, when closely read, the language employed is clear and unambiguous. Therefore, we are bound to assign the plain and ordinary meaning of “each city and town.” The plain and ordinary meaning of this phrase does not include “regional school district.”', 'Consequently, when the entire statute is read as a whole, as it must be, the determination of state education aid is based on the values of each city and town, not the regional school district. The statutes do not articulate or even suggest any joining of EWAVs for separate cities and towns to create a regional EWAV, as defendants maintain. It is our opinion that, in essence, RIDE added an extra step to its process by calculating state aid on a straight per-pupil basis, a superfluous exercise that is not provided for in either the Education Act or the Funding Formula Act.', 'Because we have determined the statutes to be clear and unambiguous; it is, therefore, unnecessary for us to delve into the Legislature’s intent. However, we pause to note that, in enacting the statutory scheme, the Legislature has specifically provided a statement of purpose', '- 18 - and legislative findings. Importantly, the intent of the Funding Formula Act is “to ensure educational opportunity to each pupil in each city or town on substantially equal terms.” Section 16-7.2-1(b) (emphases added). Our decision directly aligns with the intent of the Legislature, in that it recognizes the impact on poorer cities and towns that the Legislature sought to protect when determining state education aid. To hold otherwise would undo RIDE’s city- and town- specific calculations and would defeat the underlying purpose of the Legislature in enacting the Education Act and the Funding Formula Act. It would allow Bristol, which is more affluent than Warren, to reap the benefits of the extra aid that Warren receives from these two statutes because of its more precarious finances.

35,Terry Andoscia : v. : Town of North Smithfield et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. In December 2008, Terry Andoscia (plaintiff) was reappointed to his fourth consecutive two-year term as assistant zoning inspector in the Town of North Smithfield (the town). The issue in this appeal is whether that appointment constitutes a contract of employment. The plaintiff appeals from a Superior Court judgment in favor of the town, by and through its finance director, Cheryl Ficarra, and the town administrator, Paulette Hamilton (collectively, defendants). This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we are of the opinion that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. We conclude, as did the trial justice, that, under the circumstances of this case, no contract exists; therefore, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The material facts in this case are undisputed. In 2002, plaintiff was appointed to serve a two-year term as an assistant zoning inspector for the town. After successfully carrying out his', '-1- duties, plaintiff was subsequently appointed to two consecutive two-year terms by the town administrator, in 2004 and 2006. Shortly after the end of the latter term, he received a letter from the town clerk dated December 16, 2008, informing him of another appointment for a two-year term “expir[ing] on December 1, 2010.” Less than two months later, however, on February 6, 2009, the town advised plaintiff to not report to work, and it ceased paying him. The plaintiff’s employment was terminated for budgetary reasons and not for cause.', 'Thereafter, plaintiff filed a complaint with the Superior Court, alleging breach of employment contract and a violation of his constitutional rights. 1 The matter was reached and heard by a trial justice in a jury-waived trial on June 16, 2014.', 'At trial, Robert E. Benoit, a building and zoning official for the town and plaintiff’s supervisor, testified that, in February 2009, there was a reduction in aid to the town from the state.', 'For that reason, several employees were “temporarily laid off,” and the remaining employees of the town “agreed to take a 20 percent cut in pay for a few months until the start of the new [fiscal] year on July 1st.” He further testified that plaintiff was temporarily laid off and told that, because of the budget cut, he would not be compensated for any further work. As a result, plaintiff received no compensation after February 6, 2009. Benoit also stated that, in July 2009, after the beginning of a new fiscal year, he informed plaintiff “that he could come back to work any time that he wanted to.” 2', 'At the conclusion of trial, the trial justice entered final judgment in favor of defendants, from which plaintiff timely appealed. 1', 'It appears, from the complaint, that plaintiff’s constitutional contention is based on the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution, as he alleges that his “constitutionally protected property right in his appointment” was infringed upon. On appeal, plaintiff does not raise any constitutional arguments. Therefore, we will not address this issue. 2', 'At oral argument, plaintiff asserted that he was offered an opportunity to return at a reduced salary.', '-2-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“[I]t is well settled that [t]his Court will not disturb the findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury unless such findings are clearly erroneous or unless the trial justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence * * *.” Bank of America, N.A. v.

Simmons, 45 A.3d 1246, 1256 (R.I. 2012)).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, plaintiff contends that the trial justice erred in concluding that there was no contract between the parties. He maintains that the letter that the town clerk sent him “clearly convey[ed]” a promise that his position as assistant zoning inspector was for a term of two years, expiring “on December 1, 2010.” Furthermore, plaintiff avers that “[t]he only question before the trial justice was the terms of th[e] contract[,]” which could have “readily be[en] determined from the * * * language of * * * [the] appointment letter.” Conversely, the town argues that the trial justice did not err because plaintiff, as an employee “[s]erving at the pleasure of the [t]own [a]dministrator[,]” could be terminated “at any time, for any reason[,]” and that “[t]he appointment letter merely advised plaintiff of the appointment but was never intended to encompass the contract between the parties.”', 'After the presentation of evidence, the trial justice provided substantial findings and ruled in favor of defendants. The trial justice found the testimony of Benoit credible; she also found that plaintiff’s testimony was credible, “as far as it went.” In particular, the trial justice found', '-3- that plaintiff “did not negotiate the terms of any agreement with the [t]own nor did he bargain over the terms of his employment.” The trial justice also indicated that plaintiff’s supervisor “offered no testimony to suggest” that plaintiff’s appointment was anything other than “an appointment pursuant to * * * the [t]own [ordinance].” In addition, the trial justice concluded that “there was no evidence of mutuality of obligation” because “there was no evidence that plaintiff agreed to be reciprocally bound” by the employment.', 'The trial justice further noted that “[n]ot one of [the] witnesses provided testimony from which this fact finder is willing to infer that the parties in fact reached an agreement to employ plaintiff for two years subject only to his failure to adequately perform his job.” In entering judgment for defendants, the trial justice specified that “[t]here was no testimony to evidence any meeting of the minds with respect to this essential term of the alleged contract, that is, termination for cause only” and, therefore, she “[was] not willing to infer its existence from the December 10, 2008 letter and the surrounding circumstances” because any agreement indicating “that plaintiff could be terminated only for cause plainly would have been in derogation of the clear and unambiguous language of * * * the [t]own [ordinance] which states that the assistant zoning inspector shall serve at the pleasure of the town administrator.”', 'This Court reviews the validity and interpretation of contracts de novo.

The Town of Johnston (the town), appeals from a Superior Court judgment denying both its motion to stay implementation of an arbitration award and its motion to vacate said award, and granting the Council 94, AFSCME, Local 1491’s (the union) motion to confirm the arbitration award. This dispute arose after the Johnston Board of Canvassers (the board) unanimously voted to eliminate a clerical position held by Colleen Crowley. The union thereafter filed grievances with the town on Crowley’s behalf as required under the terms of the then-operative collective-bargaining agreement (CBA) seeking to invoke Crowley’s alleged “bumping rights.” 1 After the town denied the union’s claims, the union filed a demand for arbitration. The appointed arbitrator found in the union’s favor, and the Superior Court confirmed the arbitration award. The sole issue on appeal is whether the Superior Court erred in confirming the arbitrator’s finding that Crowley’s dispute with the town was arbitrable. 1', 'Articles 10.8 and 10.6 of the applicable collective-bargaining agreement (CBA) would have allowed Crowley to continue her employment with the town by replacing a less senior employee. Specifically, § 10.8 provides that “[e]mployees whose jobs are abolished or eliminated shall be permitted to exercise their secondary seniority in accordance with Section 10.6 of this article.” Section 10.6 discusses in further detail the proper manner of layoffs based on an employee’s level of seniority.', '-1-', 'This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'The pertinent facts in this case are not in dispute. On July 18, 2005, Crowley was appointed to a “Clerk I” position with the board. During Crowley’s term of employment, “the parties followed the terms and conditions of the [CBA] then in effect * * * including for salary and benefits, which was uniform with all other [t]own employees working in the position of Clerk.” Crowley paid union dues while she worked for the board, and she was listed on the town’s seniority list along with her date of hire. 2 In 2010, Crowley moved to the classification and pay scale of “Clerk II.”', 'In 2014, after she had been employed by the board for approximately nine years, the board unanimously voted to eliminate Crowley’s position and, as a result, her employment was terminated. At a public hearing on June 11, where her clerical position was considered and ultimately eliminated, the board expressed that a decrease in funding was the basis for its decision to eliminate the least senior full-time position. Specifically, the minutes of this meeting included the board’s explanation that “the [c]ouncil [had] recently adopted its budget ordinance and the ordinance reduced the funding to the [b]oard * * *.” 2', 'It was further stipulated that three other employees (both present and former) holding clerical positions with the board also paid union dues and were listed on the town’s seniority list.', '-2-', 'The next day, the union wrote to the town seeking to assert Crowley’s “bumping rights” pursuant to Articles 10.8 and 10.6 of the CBA. In response, the town indicated to the union, in a letter dated June 19, 2014, that it did not consider Crowley to be a town employee covered by the CBA. Specifically, the town noted that, unlike the other employees with “bumping rights” who had been appointed by the mayor or town council, Crowley “was hired under the statutory authority of the [board] and not the [t]own [a]dministration.”', 'The union thereafter filed grievances in June and July 2014, all of which were denied at their respective stages. On or about August 14, 2014, the union filed a demand for arbitration.', 'An arbitration hearing was held on January 21, 2015, and the arbitrator agreed to bifurcate the arbitrability issue from the merits of Crowley’s claim. The town maintained that Crowley’s grievance was not arbitrable because, having been appointed by the board, Crowley was not a member of the bargaining unit covered by the CBA. The union’s position, with which the arbitrator ultimately agreed, was that Crowley was a member of the bargaining unit and entitled to all privileges of membership. The arbitrator, after citing to applicable law and reviewing the record and arguments presented by both sides, found that “[t]he [t]own [had] treated [b]oard employees as members of the bargaining unit since at least 1999[.]” He also noted that the town’s denial of Crowley’s bumping rights on the basis that she may not have been hired off the “civil service list” as required for such positions, “[did] not remove [Crowley] from the bargaining unit nor [did] it remove this grievance from arbitration, under the circumstances of this case.” The arbitrator found that Crowley was a “classified employee” of the town and concluded that the matter was therefore substantively arbitrable.', 'The town filed a miscellaneous petition in Superior Court seeking to vacate the arbitration award and to stay its implementation. The union filed an answer to the petition and a', '-3- motion to confirm the award, to which the town objected. After a hearing on the matter, the Superior Court issued a written decision confirming the award. In his decision, the hearing justice concluded that “the current dispute [was] arbitrable because * * * Crowley [was] a municipal employee in the [t]own * * * and therefore, an employee that falls under the provisions of the CBA.”', 'The hearing justice ruled that the arbitrator’s decision met the necessary standard—i.e., it “[drew] its essence from the contract and [was] based upon a passably plausible interpretation of the contract.”', 'Final judgment entered in favor of the union and the town subsequently filed a timely notice of appeal.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“The issue of whether a dispute is arbitrable is a question of law that this Court reviews de novo.” AVCORR Management, LLC v.

Moreover, the town’s assertion that the arbitrator’s decision is in conflict with state law because, according to § 17-8-5(a)(4), only the board has the authority to appoint its clerical assistants, is also unavailing. As noted, the statute contains no language preventing the board’s clerical assistants from belonging to a municipal employees’ union or from assuming other positions in the town in accordance with a union member’s rights under the CBA. It is our opinion that there is no conflict between § 17-8- 5(a)(4), § 28-9.4-2(b), and the CBA.

This case came before the Supreme Court on March 8, 2017, on appeal by the plaintiff, Jeanne Jackson (plaintiff) as Executrix of the Estate of Anthony J. Esposito, Jr. (decedent), from a grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant, Quincy Mutual Fire Insurance Company (defendant or Quincy Mutual). For the reasons set forth herein, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'The facts of this case, which we glean from the filings of the parties, are tragic. On September 9, 2011, decedent was riding his motorcycle on Route 6 in Providence when what has been described as a green trash barrel fell from a passing truck and entered the decedent’s lane of travel. The barrel collided with the motorcycle and became wedged in its front tire. The decedent lost control of the motorcycle and was ejected into the adjacent lane of travel. The decedent struck the ground, rolled into the high-speed lane, and was hit by a car traveling in that lane. He died from his injuries.', '-1-', 'The motorcycle was insured with the Foremost Insurance Company, which provided limited liability insurance but did not provide uninsured motorist (UM) coverage. Although the decedent did not have UM coverage from his motorcycle policy, he also owned an automobile that was insured with Quincy Mutual. The policy with Quincy Mutual (the Quincy Mutual policy) did have UM coverage. However, there was an exclusion to the UM coverage, which is the subject of this dispute. The exclusion section (A.1.) of the Quincy Mutual policy reads as follows:', '“We do not provide Uninsured Motorists Coverage for ‘bodily', 'injury’ sustained: By an ‘insured’ while ‘occupying’, or when', 'struck by, any motor vehicle owned by that ‘insured’ which is not', 'insured for this coverage under this policy.”', 'The definitions section (G.) of the Quincy Mutual policy reads as follows: “‘Occupying’ means in, upon, getting in, on, out or off.”', 'The plaintiff, as executrix of decedent’s estate, brought a declaratory judgment action in Superior Court, declaring that the estate was entitled to UM coverage under the Quincy Mutual policy. Quincy Mutual moved for summary judgment, stating that the exclusion clause bars plaintiff from recovery because decedent was “occupying” his owned-but-not-insured motorcycle at the time of the fatal injury.', 'On September 29, 2015, a hearing was held on the motion, during which plaintiff argued that there were disputed issues of material fact as to which of the two collisions was the cause of decedent’s death—the first collision with the trash barrel, which caused decedent to lose control of the motorcycle, or the second impact from the passing car. The plaintiff claimed that the timing between the two collisions was a critical factor in determining whether decedent was “occupying” the motorcycle at the time of his death as that term is defined in the Quincy Mutual policy. The motion justice acknowledged that “the coroner couldn’t even tell which accident', '-2- killed [decedent], whether it was the barrel being thrown or getting hit from the car.” Notwithstanding this question of fact, the motion justice, relying on this Court’s holding in General Accident Insurance Co. of America v. Olivier, 574 A.2d 1240 (R.I. 1990),1 concluded that, under Olivier, decedent was occupying his motorcycle at the time of his death. Accordingly, the motion justice granted summary judgment in favor of Quincy Mutual. An order granting partial summary judgment was entered on October 16, 2015, from which plaintiff timely appealed.', 'Standard of Review', '“Summary judgment is ‘a drastic remedy,’ and a motion for summary judgment should be dealt with cautiously.” Estate of Giuliano v.

Spirit Rent-A-Car, Inc., 965 A.2d 417, 424 (R.I. 2009)).', 'Analysis', 'Before this Court, plaintiff contends that summary judgment was inappropriate in this case because decedent was separated from his motorcycle “in distance, time, and place” at the time of his death and therefore, was not occupying the motorcycle as that term is defined in the Quincy Mutual policy. Specifically, plaintiff asserts that there were two separate collisions; the first of which occurred when the trash barrel became lodged in the front tire of the motorcycle and caused decedent to fall off, and the second when decedent was hit by an oncoming vehicle after landing in the high-speed lane of travel. The plaintiff seeks recovery for the injuries sustained as a result of the second collision when, according to plaintiff, decedent was no longer', '-4- an occupant of the motorcycle but was lying in the roadway after having been ejected from the motorcycle.', 'The plaintiff submits that this distinction is critical to the determination of occupancy under the Quincy Mutual policy.', 'Quincy Mutual responds that the sequence of events was instantaneous and that the sequential distinction in this case is insignificant based on the causal connection between decedent’s use of the motorcycle and his subsequent death. The defendant argues that the motion justice properly relied on the four prongs of Olivier, in determining occupancy, and submits that this Court should decline to depart from our holding in Olivier, in favor of plaintiff’s two-collision theory. Notwithstanding this argument, defendant disputes that decedent died as a result of the second impact; rather, defendant points to deposition testimony suggesting that decedent may have died upon striking the ground after the trash barrel collided with his motorcycle.', 'Although this case is not the first occasion on which this Court has been called upon to interpret the term “occupying” as defined in an insurance contract, see Olivier, 574 A.2d at 1241; see also D’Antuono v. Narragansett Bay Insurance Co., 721 A.2d 834 (R.I. 1998), we have not been called upon to address the term in the context of two collisions. Nor have we had occasion to examine an automobile policy provision that is designed to exclude an owner from the protections of his policy. We look first to the pertinent terms of the Quincy Mutual policy.', 'Generally, when reviewing an insurance policy, “[w]e shall not depart from the literal language of the policy absent a finding that the policy is ambiguous.” Allstate Insurance Co. v. Ahlquist, 59 A.3d 95, 98 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Beacon Mutual Insurance Co. v. Spino Brothers, Inc., 11 A.3d 645, 649 (R.I. 2011)); see also General Accident Insurance Co. of America v.

Aetna Casualty and Surety Co., 459 A.2d 954, 956 (R.I. 1983))).', 'The plain language of the Quincy Mutual policy defines “occupying” as “in, upon, getting in, on, out or off.” Although in Olivier, 574 A.2d at 1243, this Court accorded a broad and liberal interpretation to the term “occupying” as it related to a passenger in an insured vehicle, we recently recognized a distinction between insurance contract provisions that encompass coverage for persons other than the named insured from those policy provisions that exclude an insured from coverage protection. See Peerless Insurance Co. v. Luppe, 118 A.3d 500, 510 (R.I. 2015). Specifically, we acknowledged the “general principle favoring broad coverage” as the controlling standard. Id. (quoting Aetna Life and Casualty Co. v. Carrera, 577 A.2d 980, 983 (R.I. 1980)). The general principle was summarized as follows:', '“[W]here the policy provision under examination relates to the', 'inclusion of persons other than the named insured within the', 'protection afforded, a broad and liberal view is taken of the', 'coverage extended. But, if the clause in question is one of', 'exclusion or exception, designed to limit the protection, a strict', 'interpretation is applied.” Id. (quoting Mazzilli v. Accident &', 'Casualty Insurance Co. of Winterthur, Switzerland, 170 A.2d 800,', '804 (N.J. 1961)). Accordingly, the guidepost in determining whether to apply a broad and liberal view of the terms in an insurance policy or whether a strict interpretation of the language is more appropriate is whether the language relates to inclusion of persons within the policy or exclusion of the insured from protection.', 'Although neither party cited Peerless Insurance Co., 118 A.3d at 510, Quincy Mutual argues that decedent—the named insured under its policy—is excluded from coverage based on the policy provision defining occupancy and it relies on this Court’s holding in Olivier as support', '-6- for that contention.2 Because the owned-but-not-insured provision of the Quincy Mutual policy is a clause of exclusion designed and intended to limit the protection afforded to Quincy Mutual’s insureds, a strict interpretation of the term “occupying,” as defined in the Quincy Mutual policy, must be employed. See Peerless Insurance Co., 118 A.3d at 510. The pivotal question, therefore, is whether, at the time of the fatal injury, decedent was “in, upon, getting in, on, out or off” the motorcycle. A strict interpretation of the Quincy Mutual policy leaves open the overarching uncertainty of which collision caused decedent’s fatal injuries. It is not disputed that at the time of the first impact, decedent was on the motorcycle and driving on the highway. The question governing this controversy, however, is whether he was “in, upon, getting in, on, out or off” the motorcycle at the time he was struck by the passing motor vehicle.', 'We look for guidance to our sister states that have considered the term “occupying” in this context. See Kedy v. A.W. Chesterton Co., 946 A.2d 1171, 1182 (R.I. 2008) (“When our own procedural rules and our case law are silent on a particular issue, ‘[i]t makes eminent good sense to consider the experience and the reasoning of the judges in other jurisdictions * * *.’” (quoting Ciunci, Inc. v. Logan, 652 A.2d 961, 962 (R.I. 1995))). In Farmers Insurance Co. of Washington v. Clure, 702 P.2d 1247 (Wash. Ct. App. 1985), the Court of Appeals of Washington considered whether an insured, who was injured as a result of striking the ground after being thrown from his motorcycle in a collision with an uninsured motorist, was “occupying” the motorcycle, and thus precluded from recovering UM benefits. Id. at 1248. The court examined the term “occupying” in the context of an exclusionary policy provision that was defined as “in, on, getting into or out of,” id. at 1249, and determined that the average insured “would not 2', 'Quincy Mutual also relies on this Court’s decision in D’Antuono v. Narragansett Bay Insurance Co., 721 A.2d 834 (R.I. 1998), and argues that the cases are indistinguishable. We reject this comparison as the facts of this case are based on two impacts, and thus are separate and distinct from the one collision in D’Antuono.', '-7- reasonably conclude that the exclusion from coverage was merely dependent upon the fortuitous circumstance that a portion of his or her body remained in physical contact with the motorcycle at the precise moment of injury.” Id. at 1250. Rather, the court concluded that, “in any motorcycle accident the passenger is almost certainly going to be thrown violently from the vehicle * * *.” Id. (quoting Greer v. Northwestern National Insurance Co., 674 P.2d 1257, 1264 (Wash. Ct. App. 1984)). The court held that, because the insured was injured as a result of the immediate impact with the ground after being thrown from the motorcycle, he was occupying the motorcycle at the time of his injuries. Id.', 'Ten years later in Mid-Century Insurance Co. v. Henault, 905 P.2d 379 (Wash. 1995), the Supreme Court of Washington considered the circumstance of two collisions in deciding whether the insured was occupying her motorcycle when she was struck by an uninsured motorist as she lay in the roadway after having been ejected in an earlier collision. See id. at 381. Significantly, in Henault, the Washington Supreme Court distinguished Clure based on the fact that there were two separate collisions. Id. at 382-83. The court noted that, “[decedent] does not seek coverage for injuries sustained when she was thrown to the pavement in the first collision * * * [r]ather, she seeks coverage for injuries she sustained when she was struck by [a second vehicle] as she lay in the roadway sometime after having been ejected from her motorcycle in the first collision.” Id. at 383. The Washington court held that, because “exclusionary clauses are to be construed strictly against the insurer,” id. at 382, it was “reasonable to conclude that when the second impact occurred, [insured], who had been lying in the roadway for an unspecified period of time, clearly was not ‘in, on, getting into, or getting out of’ her motorcycle and therefore she was not ‘occupying’ it.” Id. at 383.', '-8-', 'Likewise, in Miller v. Amica Mutual Insurance Co., 931 A.2d 1180 (N.H. 2007), the decedent was riding his motorcycle when the tire got caught in a rut in the roadway; he was ejected from the motorcycle and was fatally struck by an oncoming vehicle while lying in the road. Id. at 1181. The decedent’s estate brought a claim to recover UM benefits under an automobile policy owned by the decedent, but was precluded from recovery based on the policy’s exclusionary clause, which defined “occupying” as “in, upon, getting in, on, out or off” of a vehicle. Id. The court observed that, regardless of whether the issue is “framed in temporal terms or spatial terms,” “a reasonable person in the position of the insured would not view someone lying in the middle of the highway forty feet from his motorcycle for a period of time between thirty seconds [and] one and a half minutes as ‘in, upon, getting in, on, out or off’ that motorcycle.”', 'Id. The court concluded that the decedent’s estate was not precluded from recovery under the insurance policy because the decedent was not occupying his motorcycle at the time of his fatal injuries. Id. at 1186; see also Swarner v. Mutual Benefit Group, 72 A.3d 641, 650-51 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2013) (holding that decedent, who was ejected from her motorcycle and lying in the roadway, was no longer “occupying” the motorcycle when she was struck by a passing truck because she was no longer “on” or in the process of “[g]etting in, on, out or off” of the motorcycle).', 'The defendant argues that the facts before this Court differ from those of Henault and Miller, based on a temporal distinction between the two collisions, as compared to the disputed, but potentially almost simultaneous impacts in the case at bar. The defendant directs our attention to Dunlap v. United States Automobile Association, 470 So. 2d 98 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1985) and Partridge v. Southeastern Fidelity Insurance Co., 323 S.E.2d 676 (Ga. Ct. App. 1984), in support of what defendant submits is the absence of a “significant break in time” between the', '-9- two impacts. These cases are distinguishable both on their facts and the courts’ utilization of an Olivier-type broad and liberal view of the term “occupying.”', 'In Dunlap, 470 So. 2d at 99, the insured was ejected from his motorcycle and then immediately run over by a taxi. The court held that the concept of “occupying” included a motorist who is struck by a passing vehicle “immediately following” an accidental ejection from the motorcycle. Id. at 100. And, in Partridge, 323 S.E.2d at 677, the court determined that the decedent, who was struck by a vehicle while lying in the road after having been ejected from his own motor vehicle, was “occupying” his motor vehicle at the time of the injury because the decedent had not “remove[d] himself to a neutral zone” before the fatal injury. Significantly, however, both the Dunlap and Partridge courts focused on the reasoning of United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. Daly, 384 So. 2d 1350 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1980)—a case in which the court broadly interpreted the term “occupying” for purposes of inclusion within an insurance policy providing personal injury protection benefits. Id. at 1350-51. Because the reasoning in these cases is not the law in this state, we reject defendant’s contentions.', 'The plain language of the Quincy Mutual policy, which we construe against the insurer, defines “occupying” as “in, upon, getting in, on, out or off.” Given this language, if decedent died from the resulting impact with the roadway after the first collision with the trash barrel, or in such a circumstance that the second impact was so close in time and proximity as to be considered simultaneous, it could be found, as the court did in Clure, that he was occupying his motorcycle at the time he was fatally injured. In that case—as harrowing as the image may be— decedent was indeed “getting off” his motorcycle at the time of the fatal injury.3 However, if, as 3', 'The concurring and dissenting opinion observes that the definition of “getting off” cannot possibly encompass an accidental ejection from a motorcycle because the process of “getting off” “connotes active and volitional activity.” We quote Sir Isaac Newton: “What goes up must', '- 10 - plaintiff suggests, a factfinder determines that decedent died as a result of the second impact with the vehicle after landing on the ground and rolling into oncoming traffic, a strict interpretation of “occupying” would proceed in accordance with Henault and Miller. Unquestionably, if decedent was fatally injured as a result of the second impact, while he was lying in the road, he clearly was not “in, upon, getting in, on, out or off” of his motorcycle at the time he was struck. His status could no longer be that of a motorcycle occupant, but only a helpless victim in the roadway.', 'Of course, these are questions that are committed to the factfinder and are not amenable to summary judgment.', 'See School Committee of North Providence v. North Providence Federation of Teachers, Local 920, 468 A.2d 272, 275 (R.I. 1983) (“[f]actual disputes are the sole province of the finder of fact”).', 'We recognize that a strict interpretation of the term “occupying” in circumstances where the contested policy seeks to exclude the insured from coverage is a departure from the factors enunciated in Olivier—a case in which the policy provision was inclusory. Moreover, we mirror the Miller court’s sentiment that “[i]t may be counterintuitive to analyze [occupancy] without considering whether the accident would have occurred if the decedent had never been upon his motorcycle in the first place.” Miller, 931 A.2d at 1185.', 'However, faced with these circumstances, “that is precisely what must be done * * * for the policy’s plain language does not provide otherwise.” Id.; see also New London County Mutual Insurance Co. v. Fontaine, 45 come down.” As the centuries-old tale goes, Sir Isaac was drinking tea under an apple tree when an apple fell from the tree and landed on his head, thus, leading to Sir Isaac’s theory of the Universal Law of Gravity, which requires only a force acting upon an object to cause its movement, and not a formation of intent. We are therefore abundantly satisfied that someone who gets on a motorcycle and is unintentionally ejected from the motorcycle, and is injured upon impact with the earth, was injured in the course of getting off the motorcycle. See Farmers Insurance Co. of Washington v. Clure, 702 P.2d 1247, 1250 (Wash. Ct. App. 1985) (“[A] fair and ordinary meaning * * * of the phrase * * * ‘while occupying’ refers to injuries sustained when thrown from a vehicle during a collision.”).', '- 11 - A.3d 551, 557 (R.I. 2012) (stating that, when interpreting the provisions of an insurance policy, “we look within the ‘four corners of [the] policy, viewing it in its entirety, [and] affording its terms their plain, ordinary and usual meaning’” (quoting Town of Cumberland v. Rhode Island Interlocal Risk Management Trust, Inc., 860 A.2d 1210, 1215 (R.I. 2004))); Miller, 931 A.2d at 1185 (“If [the insurer] wished to exclude from coverage injuries arising out of the use of—as opposed to ‘while occupying’—‘any motor vehicle * * * which is not insured for * * * coverage under [the policy],’ it could very easily have done so.”).', 'Accordingly, our resolution of this dispute may proceed no further. The question of which impact caused the decedent’s fatal injuries, and the time or distance between them, are questions of fact for the jury. Therefore, because the record evinces a genuine issue of material fact, the granting of summary judgment in favor of the defendant was erroneous. See Canavan v. Lovett, Schefrin and Harnett, 862 A.2d 778, 783 (R.I. 2004) (“[I]f the record evinces a genuine issue of material fact, summary judgment is improper and we will accordingly reverse.” (citing Belanger v. Silva, 114 R.I. 266, 267-68, 331 A.2d 403, 405 (1975))).', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we sustain the plaintiff’s appeal and vacate the summary judgment entered in favor of the defendant. The record shall be remanded to the Superior Court for proceedings in accordance with this opinion.', 'Robinson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part.', 'I do not substantively disagree with the legal discussion in the majority’s opinion; we part ways only as to the majority’s ultimate determination that genuine issues of material fact remain in the case due to the fact that, according to the majority, under some set of facts, Mr. Esposito could be said to', '- 12 - have been “getting off” his motorcycle. The majority identifies the following as being disputed facts which it deems to be material: (1) “[t]he question of which impact caused the decedent’s fatal injuries;” and (2) “the time or distance between [the impacts].” In explanation of its conclusion relative to the issues of material fact, the majority states the following:', '“Given [the definition of occupying in the insurance', 'contract,] * * * if decedent died from the resulting impact with the', 'roadway after the first collision with the trash barrel, or in such a', 'circumstance that the second impact was so close in time and', 'proximity as to be considered simultaneous, it could be', 'found * * * that he was occupying his motorcycle at the time he', 'was fatally injured. In that case * * * decedent was indeed ‘getting', 'off’ his motorcycle at the time of the fatal injury.” While I readily acknowledge that there are facts in dispute in this case, it is my opinion that those disputed facts are not material. It is my view that, regardless of which impact was fatal or how close in time the impacts took place, the decedent was not occupying his motorcycle at the time when he sustained the “bodily injury” that is referenced in the exclusion from the UM coverage provision in the Quincy Mutual policy. I am simply unable to perceive any other interpretation of the straightforward and unambiguous definition of “occupying” that is set forth in the insurance contract at issue. That definition reads as follows: “‘Occupying’ means in, upon, getting in, on, out or off.” While I intend absolutely no disrespect for the views of those who read the quoted language differently, it is very clear to me, as a matter of plain English, that the decedent, Anthony Esposito, cannot be said to have been “in, upon, getting in, on, out or off” his motorcycle when he sustained the bodily injuries that are referenced in the record.', 'I am especially unable to agree with any suggestion that Mr. Esposito was somehow “getting * * * off” his motorcycle at the time when he sustained a bodily injury. I find it to be highly unusual as a matter of English usage to understand the verbal expression “getting off” as being descriptive of a completely involuntary event such as being thrown from a motorcycle as', '- 13 - the result of a violent collision. If I stand up from the chair in my office in order to go to lunch, one can rightly describe me as “getting off” that chair. However, if a miscreant were to, by brute strength, gradually force me out of my chair onto the floor, I do not think that most speakers of English would say that I was in the process of getting out of my chair. Perhaps once I was on the floor, one could say, however infelicitously, that I had been gotten out of my chair. But the active verbal form “getting off” would not, in my view, accurately describe what had transpired. The verbal expression “getting off” as applied to a person leaving a place where he or she has, up to that moment been seated or otherwise located, connotes active and volitional activity— especially in the context of leaving one place to go elsewhere.1 It does not, to my mind, properly describe what is happening when a person is involuntarily displaced from the position that he had been occupying.2', 'For these reasons, I concur with the majority’s ultimate determination to vacate the judgment of the Superior Court, but I am respectfully unable to concur with the entirety of the reasoning which led it to that determination. 1', 'I cannot help recalling in this context the aphorism usually attributed to President Truman: “If you can’t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.” See John Bartlett, Familiar Quotations 788 (Emily Morison Beck ed., 15th ed. 1980). The verb “get” in that aphorism certainly implies active and volitional activity. 2', 'Furthermore, even if a diligent search should disclose a quotation from some respectable source using the “getting off” expression in the manner accepted by the majority, such a quotation would surely be an outlier. And I would then fall back on the venerable “contra proferentem” rule in construing the definition that is set forth in the Quincy Mutual policy of insurance. See Rhode Island Hospital Trust National Bank v. McKee Brothers Oil Corp., 649 A.2d 511, 511 (R.I. 1994) (mem.)

(1112 Charles or plaintiff), appeals the grant of summary judgment in favor of Fornel Entertainment, Inc. and Anthony Lancellotta (Fornel, Lancellotta, or defendants). This case came before the Supreme Court on March 30, 2017, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After hearing counsels’ arguments and reviewing the parties’ memoranda, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown.', 'Accordingly, we shall decide this appeal at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'This case concerns a lease dispute between 1112 Charles, a Rhode Island limited partnership that owns property at 1112 Charles Street, North Providence, Rhode Island, and Fornel, a Rhode Island corporation doing business under the name Lancellotta’s Banquet Restaurant, located across the street at 1113 Charles Street, North Providence. On December 30, 1999, Fornel, through its president Lancellotta, entered into a lease agreement (original lease) with Joseph Simone, the then-owner of the property and a bakery located at 1112 Charles Street.', '-1- Simone, lessor, agreed to lease a portion of his property to Fornel “for use solely by Lessee as a parking lot.” The original lease stated that its term was to run from January 1, 2000, through “December 31, 2114.” Under the original lease’s terms, Fornel agreed to keep the premises in good condition, pay the cost of repaving and improving the parking lot, and pay $1.00 per month for the term of the lease. 1', 'In September 2002, Simone entered into an agreement with Karam Properties, LLC (Karam) to sell the property. Prior to the sale, however, errors in the original lease were discovered wherein the building on the property was included in the lease agreement and the lease term erroneously stated that it expired on December 31, 2114. On September 24, 2002, Simone, Lancellotta, and Karam executed an amended lease to clarify that the lease term expired on December 31, 2014, not 2114, and to exclude the building located on the premises from the original lease.', 'Karam subsequently fell into receivership. In September 2005, the receiver agreed to sell the property to Eltahan Properties, LLC (Eltahan). Prior to closing, however, Sovereign Bank, Eltahan’s lender, expressed concern with the original lease and, among other things, questioned whether it provided Eltahan with the right to park any cars on the property. To address these concerns, on September 29, 2005, Eltahan and Fornel entered into a “Second Lease Extension and Modification Agreement” (second lease extension), which extended the lease for another ten years, through December 31, 2024. It also clarified that the lessor could use five parking spots in 1', 'The parties state that Fornel agreed to pay 100 percent of the cost of repaving the lot and demolishing a shed on the property at 1112 Charles Street, and Simone agreed to reimburse Fornel for 50 percent of the cost of the demolition and repaving. This agreement is not contained in the original lease, but appears within a promissory note wherein Simone promised to pay Fornel $9,125.', '-2- front of the bakery between the hours of 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. 2 The second lease extension added the following provision (release provision) to the original lease: “Lessor and Lessee acknowledge the validity of the Lease and Amended Lease * * * . Lessor and Lessee have no defenses, setoffs, or counterclaims against the other in connection with the Lease and Amended Lease.”', 'Further, as a part of the financing agreement with Sovereign Bank, Eltahan and Fornel entered into a “Non-Disturbance, Attornment and Subordination Agreement and Tenant’s Estoppel” (attornment agreement). Pursuant to the attornment agreement’s subordination clause, Fornel subordinated its right as lessee under the original lease “to the right, title and interest of [the] Lender under the Security Deed * * * .” The nondisturbance clause safeguarded the lessee by providing that the lease would not be terminated as long as Fornel had not defaulted on any payments, continued to perform its obligations under the lease, and “attorn[ed]” as set forth in the attornment clause. Under the attornment clause, if the lessor’s interests under the lease were transferred, Fornel, as lessee, was bound to the purchaser under the lease for the balance of its term, “with the same force and effect as if the Purchaser or Lender were the lessor under the Lease, and Tenant, as lessee under the Lease * * * .” 3 2', 'Specifically, it stated:', '“Lessee agrees to allow Lessor the use of five (5) parking', 'spaces immediately in front of Lessor’s bakery business (currently', 'marked as such) during the hours of 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and to use its', 'best efforts to insure that its agents, employees and invitees shall', 'not interfere with Lessor’s right to use the five (5) front spaces for', 'its patrons and invitees for Lessor. Lessor agrees to use its best', 'effort to insure that its agents, employees and invitees shall not', 'interfere with Lessee’s right to use the remaining parking spaces', 'solely for Lessees agents, employees, patrons and invitees.” 3', 'The attornment clause provides:', '“Unless the Lease is terminated * * * if the interests of the', 'lessor under the Lease shall be transferred * * * the lessee', 'thereunder shall be bound to the Purchaser or Lender, as the case', 'may be, under all of the terms, covenants and conditions of the', '-3-', 'After Eltahan defaulted, the property was again sold at auction on October 6, 2010 to Bennie Sisto. According to defendants, Sisto knew about the lease agreement prior to the auction because the receiver and Lancellotta had announced it at the auction. Additionally, Sisto signed the “Terms of Sale” agreement, which stated that the property was “sold subject to prior mortgages and other encumbrances of record, if any, including that certain Lease dated December 30, 1999 * * * .” After the purchase, Sisto then assigned his property interest to 1112 Charles.', 'On March 24, 2011, 1112 Charles filed a four-count complaint against defendants, alleging fraud and misrepresentation (count 1), a breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing (count 2), and seeking a declaratory judgment (count 3), and the quieting of title in the plaintiff (count 4).', 'With respect to the declaratory-judgment count, plaintiff sought declarations: (1) as to the parties’ rights, duties, and obligations; and (2) that the original lease was void ab initio.', 'On October 22, 2012, plaintiff moved for partial summary judgment on its declaratory- judgment count pursuant to Rule 56 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. In support of its motion, plaintiff argued that the original lease did “not reflect the agreement of the parties to the Original Lease on three material points, to wit:” (1) the original lease term was intended to end on December 31, 2014, not December 31, 2114, as the original lease stated; (2) the term “premises” as used within the original lease was not intended to include the building on the', 'Lease for the balance of the term thereof * * * with the same force', 'and effect as if the Purchaser or Lender were the lessor under the', 'Lease, and Tenant, as lessee under the Lease, does hereby attorn to', 'the Purchaser and Lender if it takes title to or possession of the', 'Property, as its lessor under the Lease.”', '-4- property, although the original lease included buildings and improvements in defining the term; and (3) Fornel’s rights under the original lease were not intended to be exclusive.', 'On January 11, 2013, defendants objected to the motion for partial summary judgment and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. In support of its motion—and in objection to plaintiff’s—defendants argued that plaintiff lacked standing to contest the original lease or any subsequent amendments thereto because plaintiff was not a party to the original lease or any of its amendments. Neither Sisto nor Stefania Mardo, plaintiff’s manager and Sisto’s daughter who attested to the allegations in the complaint, participated in the execution of the original lease or any of its amendments. Additionally, defendants maintained that Sisto knew about the parking lot lease prior to purchasing the property and his “buyer’s remorse and regrets” did not give him standing to challenge the original lease.', 'The defendants also challenged plaintiff’s complaint because Mardo attested to the allegations set forth in it; defendants, however, maintained that she lacked personal knowledge as to what she attested. Thus, defendants averred that the allegations undergirding the complaint were unsupported.', 'The defendants also contended that plaintiff’s complaint lacked particularized facts that supported its allegation of fraudulent conduct by defendant, as required under Rule 9(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. See id. (“In all averments of fraud or mistake, the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity.”). Lastly, defendants argued that plaintiff’s count alleging a breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing was not an independent tort—it only gave rise to a breach-of- contract claim.', 'The plaintiff objected to defendants’ summary judgment motion. It conceded that it was not involved in the execution of the original lease or any subsequent amendments, but it asserted', '-5- that it nonetheless had standing because, as the property owner, it was the assignee of the rights and obligations under the original lease. The plaintiff also challenged defendants’ argument that its complaint was not based on personal knowledge; it maintained that the averments in its complaint were based on the sworn testimony of Simone and Eltahan. The plaintiff disagreed with defendants’ contention that its fraud allegations failed to comply with Rule 9(b)’s heightened pleading requirement, and maintained that its “fraud allegations could not be more specific.” With respect to the argument that the breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing was not an independent tort, plaintiff argued that it asserted this claim as a contract claim, not as a separate tort.', 'On March 11, 2013, a justice of the Superior Court granted plaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment with respect to the three declarations sought: that the original lease term expired on December 31, 2014, not December 31, 2114; that the term “premises” as used within the original lease was not intended to include the building on the property; and that Fornel’s right to use the premises was nonexclusive. That day, the same justice also denied defendants’ summary judgment motion without prejudice.', 'On June 23, 2014, defendants again moved for summary judgment. The defendants raised arguments similar to those in their prior motion. This motion came before another justice of the Superior Court on September 9, 2014. By an order dated October 7, 2014, the justice denied defendants’ motion without prejudice. 4', 'The case proceeded to trial. The plaintiff maintains that “[o]n the eve of trial,” a third justice of the Superior Court “reconsidered” and ultimately granted defendants’ motion for 4', 'At oral argument, the parties stated that this motion for summary judgment was denied based on the law-of-the-case doctrine.', '-6- summary judgment. 5 As plaintiff did not order transcripts of that hearing—or any lower court proceeding for that matter—we must rely on the parties’ accounts of the justice’s decision. 6 According to the parties, the justice noted that, when property is conveyed subject to a lease, such as here, the lessee and grantee of the property are in privity of estate, not privity of contract. Having determined that plaintiff and defendants were not in privity of contract, the justice held that plaintiff lacked standing to pursue the claims in its complaint. The plaintiff quotes the justice as saying:', '“1112 Charles, LP is a third-party beneficiary of some of the', 'provisions of the Non-Disturbance, Attornment and Subordination', 'Agreement and Tenant’s Estoppel. However, that status only', 'permits it to enforce the benefits that inure to it under the lease. It', 'does not create privity of contract such that 1112 Charles, LP can', 'elect to avoid the underlying lease itself.” The defendants state that plaintiff solely challenged the second lease extension at the hearing, and plaintiff argued that it had privity of contract to challenge it because of the attornment agreement, an argument that defendants characterized as “never before raised by [plaintiff] and for which [plaintiff] provided no supporting law.” The justice granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment because plaintiff was not in privity of contract with defendants and lacked standing to assert the allegations raised in its complaint. On April 6, 2016, the justice entered final judgment for the defendants. 5', 'Although defendants did not refile their motion for summary judgment, plaintiff did not challenge its utilization by the justice. This Court notes that, generally, once a case has reached trial, it is not appropriate to entertain a motion for summary judgment. See Haxton’s of Riverside, Inc. v. Windmill Realty, Inc., 488 A.2d 723, 724 n.1 (R.I. 1985) (“A motion for summary judgment is * * * inappropriate after trial has commenced.”); Gallo v. National Nursing Homes, Inc., 106 R.I. 485, 487, 261 A.2d 19, 21 (1970) (“[S]ummary judgment is an extreme remedy which should not be used as a substitute for a trial * * * .”). 6', 'As this Court recently reiterated, “[t]he decision to pursue an appeal without ordering the full transcript of the Superior Court proceeding is ‘risky business.’” Bellevue-Ochre Point Neighborhood Association v. Preservation Society of Newport County, 151 A.3d 1223, 1229 n.8 (R.I. 2017) (quoting Holden v. Salvadore, 964 A.2d 508, 513 (R.I. 2009)).', '-7-', 'On April 25, 2016, plaintiff appealed to this Court. On appeal, it argues that the justice erred in ruling that the attornment agreement did not create privity of contract between plaintiff and defendants and therefore finding that plaintiff lacked standing to bring its suit challenging the second lease extension. 7', 'The plaintiff also contends that the justice erred by not incorporating the partial summary judgment and the additional declaration into the final judgment.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“We review a hearing justice’s grant of summary judgment de novo.”', 'Tri-Town Construction Co. v. Commerce Park Associates 12, LLC, 139 A.3d 467, 474 (R.I. 2016). “We will affirm a [trial] court’s decision only if, after reviewing the admissible evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, we conclude that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” High Steel Structures, Inc. v.

(quoting Narragansett Indian Tribe, 81 A.3d at 1110).

As such, in the context of contracts, this Court has long held “that third parties to a contract lack standing to challenge its validity.” Id. In Mruk, this Court made an exception to this general principle and held that “homeowners in Rhode Island have standing to challenge the assignment of mortgages on their homes to the extent', '-9- necessary to contest the foreclosing entity’s authority to foreclose.” Id. at 536. This exception is inapplicable here, however, as it “is confined to private residential mortgagors challenging the foreclosure of their homes.” Id. Therefore, based on the foregoing principles, a party must be in privity of contract with the other party to have standing to challenge the contract’s validity. 8', 'It is plainly apparent that plaintiff is not in privity of contract with defendants because it was not a party to the second lease extension, and therefore plaintiff lacks standing to challenge it.', 'Although plaintiff concedes that it is not in privity of contract with defendants in the traditional sense, it maintains that the attornment agreement created the requisite privity of contract. We disagree.', 'An attornment agreement is defined as “[a] tenant’s agreement to hold the land as the tenant of a new landlord.” Black’s Law Dictionary 155 (10th ed. 2014). The purpose of an attornment agreement, such as the one present in this case, is to ensure that the lessee remains bound under the lease to a new lessor who purchases the property. There is no language in the attornment agreement here that indicates that it grants plaintiff privity of contract. Nor is there legal support for plaintiff’s proposition that the attornment agreement creates privity of contract. As such, we agree with the justice that the attornment agreement did not create privity of contract between plaintiff and defendants, and therefore plaintiff lacked standing to challenge the second lease extension.', 'Nevertheless, even if plaintiff had standing to challenge the second lease extension, it is barred from doing so under the release provision, which states that “Lessor and Lessee have no defenses, setoffs, or counterclaims against the other in connection with the Lease and Amended 8', 'Privity of contract is defined as “[t]he relationship between the parties to a contract, allowing them to sue each other but preventing a third party from doing so.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1394 (10th ed. 2014).', '- 10 - Lease.” This provision makes it very apparent that plaintiff would not be able to assert the claims raised in its complaint.', 'Having concluded that the plaintiff is not in privity of contract either through the lease agreement or the attornment agreement and cannot challenge the validity of the original lease or any of its subsequent amendments, it is not necessary to address the plaintiff’s remaining arguments.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

This Court issued a writ of certiorari to review a Superior Court order denying the state’s request to adjudge Anthony Parrillo a probation violator. The hearing justice’s decision to deny the state’s request was based upon his finding that Parrillo was no longer on probation at the time that he allegedly committed the offense of felony assault. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the order of the Superior Court and remand the case for further proceedings.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'The pertinent facts in this case are not in dispute. In March 1982, Parrillo was charged with two separate counts of murder. Later that year, a Superior Court jury found him guilty of murder in the first degree on count 1 of the indictment and guilty of murder in the second degree on count 2 of the indictment. Parrillo appealed to this Court, and in 1984 we vacated the judgment of conviction. State v. Parillo, 480 A.2d 1349, 1359 (R.I.', '-1- 1984).1 The case was remanded to the Superior Court where, on January 21, 1986, Parrillo pled guilty to two counts of second-degree murder.', 'Significantly, per the judgment of conviction and commitment, he was sentenced to thirty years, the first twenty years to serve with “the remaining 10 years * * * suspended, probation for 10 years, said probation to commence upon [Parrillo’s] release from the [Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI)], each count concurrent.”2', 'On December 22, 1993, after receiving what appear to be credits for time served pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 12-19-23 and for good behavior pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 42-56- 24,4 Parrillo was released from the ACI on parole.

He sought a dismissal of the Rule 32(f) violation report on the grounds that “he was no longer on probation at the time of either the alleged conduct or the filing of the violation notice, but instead that his probation expired some time before that.” Parrillo attested that he “believed that [his] probation should have ended at the earliest on December 20, 2003, but in any event [he] 5', 'After a jury-waived trial before a Superior Court justice, Parrillo was convicted of aiding and abetting one felony assault and of misdemeanor assault.

He also argued, seemingly in the alternative, that the state should be barred from seeking to revoke his probation because to hold otherwise would constitute a violation of his due-process rights.', 'A violation hearing was held on November 2, 2012, at which time Parrillo argued that he was not “subject to being violated because his probation ha[d] already terminated” in 2009. He maintained that it was “inconceivable” that the state could inform Parrillo that his probation had ended, and then, years later, attempt to adjudge him a probation violator.', 'In response, the state maintained its position that Parrillo was in fact on probation at the time of the 2011 incident. Specifically, the state claimed that Parrillo’s thirty-year sentence in 1986 meant that he would “finish serving the full term of his sentence on January 22, 2016.”', 'The hearing justice disagreed with the state and quashed the Rule 32(f) violation report. The hearing justice rejected Parrillo’s argument that the doctrine of equitable estoppel barred the state from seeking to adjudge him a violator, reasoning that “the probation officer had no authority to modify [the sentence],” and that it was “absurd to even attempt to apply the detrimental reliance [analysis] in the context of the facts of this case.” However, the hearing justice held that the language of § 12-19-8 was clear in that it granted the sentencing justice the authority to set the period of probation. Therefore, he', '-5- concluded that the sentencing justice’s specification that probation would “commence upon [Parrillo’s] release from the ACI” should be given effect.7', 'An order entered denying the state’s request that Parrillo be adjudged a probation violator.', 'The state subsequently filed a motion to reconsider and, on April 5, 2013, its motion was heard.8 The hearing justice explained that his decision to deny and dismiss the Rule 32(f) violation report was based on what he felt was “the only evidence of the intent of the sentencing judge”—the clear language of the judgment of conviction that articulated that the probationary term would “commence upon [Parrillo’s] release from the ACI.” The hearing justice further explained that “[t]he [sentencing] judge could have sentenced [Parrillo] to 30 years, 20 to serve, with the balance of the term suspended and [Parrillo] placed on probation for that period of time[,] [but] [h]e did not.” Therefore, the hearing justice denied the state’s motion to reconsider.', 'The state thereafter filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, which this Court granted on May 27, 2014.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“This Court’s review ‘on writ of certiorari is limited to examining the record to determine if an error of law has been committed.’” Huntley v.

To do so, we must delve into the governing statutory provisions and our jurisprudence interpreting such provisions, most recently pronounced in Rose v. State, 92 A.3d 903 (R.I. 2014).', 'If Parrillo was indeed on probation at that time, then we must determine if the hearing justice committed an error of law in rejecting Parrillo’s equitable estoppel defense against the state.', 'A', 'Parrillo’s Thirty-Year Sentence', 'The determination of whether Parrillo was on probation at the time of the 2011 incident turns on the application and interplay of several statutory provisions, the first of which is § 12-19-8. Section 12-19-8(a) provides, in relevant part, that the sentencing court “may impose a sentence and suspend the execution of the sentence, in whole or in part, or place the defendant on probation without the imposition of a suspended sentence[,]” and that such “suspension shall place the defendant on probation for the time', '-7- and on any terms and conditions that the court may fix.” We have interpreted § 12-19-8 as granting a sentencing justice a wide range of discretion when imposing a sentence so long as that sentence does not conflict with any other statutory provision. See Rose, 92 A.3d at 909. Next at play are §§ 42-56-24 and 12-19-2(a). Section 42-56-24 authorizes the DOC to mitigate a defendant’s sentence by rewarding a prisoner’s good behavior and industriousness with credits towards his or her sentence (herein, good-time credits); meanwhile, § 12-19-2(a) requires that “if the punishment to be imposed [at sentencing] is imprisonment, the sentence or sentences imposed shall be reduced by the number of days spent in confinement while awaiting trial and while awaiting sentencing” (herein, time- served credit). This Court’s recent decision in Rose, 92 A.3d at 907-13, dealt with the interplay of these statutory provisions in light of a mandatory-minimum sentence.', 'In Rose, 92 A.3d at 907, this Court was tasked with deciding “[w]hat effect, if any, [did the defendant’s] credits for (1) good time and (2) time served have on the total length of his sentence[.]” Alexander Rose (Rose) had pled nolo contendere to one count of first-degree child molestation and was sentenced to twenty years—the mandatory minimum at that time pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 11-37-8.2.9 Rose, 92 A.3d at 905. At the sentencing hearing, the Superior Court justice stated that: “the defendant [was] sentenced to 20 years at the ACI, eight years to serve, credit retroactive to December 23, 1992, the balance, 12 years, suspended, and upon release the defendant is placed on 12 years probation.” Id. Rose was subsequently released from the ACI on parole on December 17, 1997, as a result of receiving time-served and good-behavior credits. Id. at 905-06. In July 1999, Rose completed his parole without incident and, in 2010, he filed a petition for 9', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-37-8.2 has since then been amended to a twenty-five-year mandatory minimum sentence. See P.L. 2006, ch. 206, § 3.', '-8- a writ of habeas corpus and an application for post-conviction relief—specifically requesting to be discharged from probation. Id. at 906.', 'Rose asserted that his probationary period ended in July 2011—twelve years after his successful completion of parole.10 Rose relied on the sentencing justice’s assertion at sentencing that his twelve- year probationary term would commence “upon release” from the ACI. Id. at 908.', 'In our opinion affirming the dismissal of Rose’s petition, this Court analyzed the language of § 42-56-24’s good-time credits. Rose, 92 A.3d at 907-11. We held that the plain language of the good-time-credit statute suggested that the “only form of mitigation contemplated in that provision [was] a reduction of the amount of time that a defendant must spend incarcerated.” Id. at 908. Thus, any mitigation of Rose’s sentence under § 42-56-24 did not change or reduce his twenty-year sentence, but instead reduced the time that he would be confined at the ACI. See Rose, 92 A.3d at 908. In response to Rose’s argument that he relied on the statements made by the sentencing justice that he would be on probation for twelve years “upon release from the ACI,” we acknowledged that:', '“Although we have previously interpreted § 12-19-8 as', 'affording a trial justice the discretion to determine when a', 'prisoner’s term of probation will commence, * * * we have', 'also held that a sentencing justice’s pronouncement about', 'the commencement of probation will not be given effect to', 'the extent that it conflicts with another statutory provision.', '“* * * [W]e conclude[d] that there [was] no authority', 'which would allow the sentencing justice’s words to', 'effectively reduce the total length of Rose’s sentence below', 'the mandatory minimum.” Rose, 92 A.3d at 908, 909.', 'In analyzing time-served credits pursuant to § 12-19-2(a), we held that although Rose “intellectualized [his] situation differently than the defendant” in State v. 10', 'In his filings, Rose had also argued that his probation ended on December 17, 2009— twelve years after the date of his release from the ACI on parole. Rose v. State, 92 A.3d 903, 906 (R.I. 2014). At oral argument, he abandoned this position. Id. at 907.', '-9- Bergevine, 883 A.2d 1158 (R.I. 2005) (mem.), in essence Rose sought the same outcome that this Court rejected in Bergevine, i.e.,—that Rose’s probation start and end date be dated back due to the fifteen-month credit that he received for time served. Rose, 92 A.3d at 912. In Bergevine, we decisively rejected the defendant’s argument that he was not on probation at the time of an alleged probation violation because the approximate nine- month time-served credit made his ten-year sentence, including his probation, retroactive. Bergevine, 883 A.2d at 1158-59. Accordingly, we concluded in Rose, as had the hearing justice, that “neither Rose’s credits for good time nor his credits for time served entitled him to an acceleration of the end date of his probationary term.” Rose, 92 A.3d at 912.', 'In the case under review, the state argues that this Court should apply Rose and, in view of its holding, reverse the hearing justice’s decision and his finding that Parrillo was not on probation at the time of the 2011 incident. The state also argues that any attempt to distinguish Rose from this case lacks merit.', 'In response, and in support of Parrillo’s assertion that he was not on probation at the time of the 2011 incident, Parrillo raises three key arguments. First, he argues that Rose is inapplicable to his case, as Rose relied heavily on State v. Jacques, 554 A.2d 193 (R.I. 1989),11 and State v. Dantzler, 690 A.2d 338 (R.I. 1997),12 two cases that were decided after Parrillo’s 1986 sentencing. Second, Parrillo argues that even if Rose is applicable, it is distinguishable from his case, as Rose dealt with a mandatory minimum sentence and whether the words of a sentencing justice, together with both the defendant’s good-time and time-served credits, could in 11', 'In State v. Jacques, 554 A.2d 193, 196 (R.I. 1989), we first announced that a probationary period began at imposition of a sentence, even if that meant at the commencement of incarceration. 12', 'In State v. Dantzler, 690 A.2d 338, 341-42 (R.I. 1997), we held that the trial court could revoke a probationary term on the basis of criminal acts committed after imposition of sentence but before the actual probationary portion of sentence commenced.', '- 10 - effect lower the defendant’s sentence to less than the statutory minimum. However, here, Parrillo argues that, unlike Rose, “there was no possibility that the combined length of [the] time [he] will spend incarcerated and on probation will fall below [the minimum mandatory term] if the sentencing justice’s words ‘upon release’ are allowed to control.” Lastly, Parrillo argues that principles of estoppel apply as a matter of due process, barring the state from seeking to adjudge him a probation violator.', 'Rose is central to our analysis of the state’s petition and to our application of good-time credits, time-served credits, and § 12-19-8 to this case. Here, Parrillo, like Rose, claims that the sentencing justice’s pronouncement that his probationary term was to begin “upon [his] release from the ACI” is binding pursuant to the authority granted to a sentencing justice, implying that the clock on his probationary term should have started ticking when he either was released on parole or had successfully completed parole. We reject, however, Parrillo’s contention that Rose does not apply because it was predicated on two decisions decided after he was sentenced. It is well established that a judicial interpretation of a statute “relates back” to the date the statute was enacted and, unlike legislative action, does not implicate ex post facto considerations. State v. Barber, 767 A.2d 78, 79-80 (R.I. 2001) (rejecting the defendant’s contention that Dantzler and Jacques were inapplicable to his case because they were decided after he was sentenced).', 'Moreover, this Court appreciates that here, unlike in Rose, if Parrillo’s probation were to “commence upon [his] release from the ACI,” it would not reduce his sentence below the mandatory minimum. See Rose, 92 A.3d at 909. The reduced sentence, which would range between seventeen and twenty-three years, depending on the operative', '- 11 - date,13 would be well above the ten-year mandatory-minimum for second-degree murder, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 11-23-2. It is our opinion, however, that this distinction does not require us to stray away from our clearly articulated interpretation of the good-time and time-served credit statutes enunciated in Rose, and the effect that these credits have on the length of a defendant’s overall sentence, nor does this distinction warrant a different outcome. Rose, 92 A.3d at 912, was clear—neither Parrillo’s “credits for good time nor his credits for time served entitle[] him to an acceleration of the end date of his probationary term[,]” because the DOC does not have the “power to modify the overall length of a judicially imposed sentence * * *.” Id. at 911.14 The power to reduce a sentence, either directly or indirectly, is reserved to the judiciary.15 Id.', 'Here, the sentencing justice sentenced Parrillo to thirty years. Although § 12-19-8 permitted the sentencing justice to suspend a portion of the sentence, as he chose to do, any suspended or probationary period did not reduce the sentence from what he specifically articulated was thirty years. 13', 'If his probation were to begin upon his physical release from the ACI in 1993, his sentence would end in 2003, seventeen years after it was imposed in 1986. If his probation were to begin upon his release from parole in 1999, his sentence would end in 2009, twenty-three years after it was imposed. 14', 'We are of the opinion that the dissent’s conclusion that the General Assembly has, by statute, modified Parrillo’s sentence is incorrect and not supported by our well-settled constitutional jurisprudence. The sentence imposed in this case is a final judgment of conviction by the Superior Court. A final judgment may be reopened or amended only according to law and in the exercise of judicial power. See Taylor v. Place, 4 R.I. 324, 363 (1856) (“the exercise of judicial power [is] prohibited to the general assembly” pursuant to the Constitution of Rhode Island). 15', 'A recent amendment to Rule 35 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure now provides a vehicle to amend a sentence. Rule 35(c) provides that: “At any time after a defendant has served at least three (3) years of a term of probation in the community, the probation unit of the department of corrections, either at a defendant’s request or administratively, may review the defendant’s case history and recommend amending the defendant’s sentence to terminate the defendant’s probation.”', '- 12 -', 'Accordingly, because Parrillo was sentenced on January 21, 1986, to a thirty-year term, and because the effect of his good-time or time-served credits reduced his period of incarceration, but did not reduce the overall length of his sentence, his sentence officially ended on January 21, 2016—thirty years later.', 'Consequently, the hearing justice committed an error of law in finding that Parrillo was not on probation at the time of the 2011 incident. Because we hold that Parrillo was on probation and subject to being adjudged a violator at the time of the 2011 incident, we must now address whether the hearing justice committed an error of law when he held that the doctrine of equitable estoppel did not bar the state from seeking to adjudge Parrillo a probation violator.', 'B', 'Equitable Estoppel', 'Parrillo argues that the state should be estopped from seeking to adjudge him a probation violator by invoking the doctrine of equitable estoppel because he relied, to his detriment, on the representation made by the DOC in the form of the 2009 letter informing him that he had completed his probationary term. Parrillo attested that he “conducted [himself] at all times as though [he] was not on probation” in reliance to the representation made. In response, the state insists that Parrillo has failed to meet the necessary elements of the equitable estoppel doctrine.', 'Necessary “to the successful invocation of the doctrine of equitable estoppel is the establishment of: ‘[F]irst, an affirmative representation or equivalent conduct on the part of the person against whom the estoppel is claimed which is directed to another for the purpose of inducing the other to act or fail to act in reliance thereon; and secondly, that such representation or conduct in fact did induce the other to act or fail to act to his', '- 13 - injury.’” Faella v.

Moreover, the applicability of equitable estoppel is dependent upon “[t]he facts and circumstances of each case.” Lerner v. Gill, 463 A.2d 1352, 1362 (R.I. 1983).', '“It must be emphasized that ‘[e]quitable estoppel is extraordinary relief, which will not be applied unless the equities clearly [are] balanced in favor of the part[y] seeking relief.’” Faella, 111 A.3d at 357 (quoting Sturbridge Home Builders, Inc. v. Downing Seaport, Inc., 890 A.2d 58, 67 (R.I. 2005)). “Indeed, ‘equitable estoppel is not a favored doctrine * * * [and should be] applied carefully and sparingly and only from necessity.

As we have previously noted, this authority is limited to the judiciary. See Rose 92 A.3d at 910-11. Accordingly, neither the administrative agent nor any member of the DOC had the power to determine when Parrillo had completed his probationary period.', 'Moreover, in Romano v. Retirement Board of the Employees Retirement System of Rhode Island, 767 A.2d 35, 37-38 (R.I. 2001), a retiree sought to invoke the equitable estoppel principle against the state which, through a retirement system counselor, had provided wrong information regarding the retiree’s retirement benefits. The retiree’s claims failed because neither the counselor nor the board’s executive director possessed any authority to “vary or contradict” state law. Id. at 39 (contrary to information the retiree received from the state employee, G.L. 1956 § 36-10-36(b) specifically provided, in relevant part, that “[p]ension payments shall be suspended” when a state retiree is employed or reemployed by a municipality).', 'Similarly, here, any statement that Parrillo’s probationary period had ended in 2009, was not only in direct contradiction to the judicially-imposed thirty-year sentence, it also contradicted §§ 42-56-24 and 12-19- 2(a), including the effect these credits had on the length of Parrillo’s sentence.', '- 15 -', 'Moreover, the only evidence before the Superior Court was the 2009 letter sent from the DOC administrative officer and Parrillo’s affidavit in which he attested that “he conducted [him]self at all times as though [he] was not on probation.” Parrillo, who bore the burden of proving the elements of equitable estoppel, presented no evidence that the DOC employee intended to induce any specific behavior on his part, nor that his conduct as it relates to the 2011 incident was somehow induced by the 2009 DOC letter. See Faella, 111 A.3d at 357. Our law is clear that no element of the equitable estoppel claim can be left to speculation, and, in any event, we agree with the hearing justice that to even attempt to apply the doctrine of equitable estoppel to these facts is “absurd.” See id. It would be preposterous for Parrillo to claim that a letter informing him that his probationary period had ended in 2009 induced him to commit the alleged felony assault in 2011, let alone for him to claim that the DOC employee actually intended to induce him to commit such act as the doctrine of equitable estoppel requires.17', 'Accordingly, it is our opinion that the hearing justice’s denial of Parrillo’s equitable estoppel claim was not an error of law.', 'C', 'Due Process', 'Parrillo’s equitable estoppel argument is firmly predicated upon principles of due process.

Specifically, it was my opinion that, when the majority interpreted § 42-56-24, it “focuse[d] on the word ‘sentence’ and equate[d] ‘sentence’ with ‘imprisonment.’” Rose,', '- 18 - 92 A.3d at 914. It was my view then, and it is now, that “nothing cited to by the majority contravene[d] my conclusion that good-time credits reduce the entirety of [the] sentence and not simply the period of incarceration.” Id. I also found fault with the majority’s interpretation of § 12-19-2 on nearly identical grounds. Rose, 92 A.3d at 919. That statute mandates that a “sentence or sentences imposed shall be reduced by the number of days spent in confinement while awaiting trial and while awaiting sentencing * * *.” Section 12-19-2(a). Like § 42-54-24, § 12-19-2 speaks of reducing the “sentence,” as opposed to the period of incarceration.', 'Now, the majority extends the holding in Rose to all probationers, finding that good-time and time-served credits do not reduce the length of a defendant’s overall sentence, irrespective of whether such a reduction would bring that sentence below a mandatory minimum. I disagree because the statutes clearly say that good-time credits should “be deducted from the term or terms of sentence of that prisoner * * *” and time- served credits should be “reduced” from the sentence.', 'Both statutes are clear and unambiguous. Notably, neither statute limits deductions or reductions to only the time of incarceration.', 'The gravamen of my dissent lies in the distinction between “sentence” and “imprisonment.” In addition to incorporating my dissent in Rose, I also observe that “sentence” is defined as “[t]he judgment that a court formally pronounces after finding a criminal defendant guilty; the punishment imposed on a criminal wrongdoer.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1569 (10th ed. 2014). Meanwhile, “imprisonment” is “[t]he act of confining a person, [especially] in a prison.” Id. at 875. Accordingly, it is my opinion that the only conclusion that can be drawn is that, when the General Assembly enacted', '- 19 - the legislation in question and used the term “sentence,” it was referring to the entirety of the judgment imposed against the defendant—i.e., both the period of incarceration and the probationary period. And, when the General Assembly referred to “imprisonment,” it spoke of only the period in which a defendant is incarcerated. Thus, when the General Assembly mandated that good-time credits be “deducted” from a defendant’s “sentence” and that a defendant’s “sentence * * * shall be reduced” by the amount of time served while awaiting trial and sentencing, I am led to what I consider to be the obvious conclusion that the General Assembly intended good-time and time-served credits to act to reduce the entirety of a defendant’s sentence, and not just that defendant’s period of incarceration.19', 'Despite my dissent in Rose, I accept, as I must, that the holding in that case is now the law in this state. Nevertheless, I do not believe that the holding in Rose is applicable here because the issue before us is simply not the same; the reductions that Parrillo received to his sentence did not bring that sentence below a mandatory minimum. The majority’s opinion in Rose was, in substantial part, driven by the conflict between G.L. 1956 § 11-37-8.2, which imposed a mandatory minimum sentence, and §§ 42-56-24 and 12-19-2, the good-time and time-served statutes. Here, no such conflict exists. Accordingly, it is my opinion that the statutory interpretation that I endorsed in Rose should control; under that interpretation, Parrillo’s probation would have ended by the time of his December 2011 arrest. As a result, it is my opinion that the order of the Superior Court should be affirmed. 19', 'The majority says that the Department of Corrections has no authority to reduce a sentence, but it is the General Assembly that set the sentence by statute. Through the enactment of G.L. 1956 § 42-56-24 and G.L. 1956 § 12-19-2, the General Assembly has modified the sentence, also by statute.', '- 20 - STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND', 'PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS', 'SUPREME COURT – CLERK’S OFFICE', 'OPINION COVER SHEET Title of Case', 'State v.

Peter F. Kilmartin, the Attorney General of the State of Rhode Island (the state), appeals from the entry of final judgment, following a bench trial, in favor of the defendants and the defendant-intervenors (defendants). 2 The state asserted that in 1909, the landowners (Plattors) of the beach property dedicated the disputed beach area to the public through the recordation of a Plat and Indenture. 1', '“By the Beautiful Sea,” published in 1914.

Below the beach area lies the “Atlantic Ocean,” which is separated from the beach area by multiple undulating lines. In addition to the many lots, the Plattors also carved out nine rights of way, marked as such on the plat, which run from Atlantic Avenue to the beach area.', 'Along with the 1909 Plat, the Plattors prepared, signed, and recorded an Indenture.

In its amended eight- count complaint against the beachfront landowners, the Attorney General alleged public nuisance, purpresture, private nuisance, trespass, and unreasonable use of easement. The state sought to enjoin the landowners from preventing public access to the beach area. 7', 'On November 2, 2012, defendants moved pursuant to Rule 19 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure to dismiss the state’s complaint for its failure to join persons needed for a just adjudication, or, alternatively, to require joinder of those persons. On November 30, 2012, the trial justice ordered the state to notify all landowners in the disputed area, as depicted on the 1909 Plat, and he allowed such landowners to intervene in the action.', 'The defendants answered and sought a declaration that they were the true property owners of the disputed area, with respect to their individual lots. The defendants also brought a counterclaim and asserted that: They owned their property through adverse possession; they acquired their property pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 34-13.1-2 of the Marketable Record Title Act; the state is liable for slander of title; and the state’s conduct constituted a temporary taking of defendant’s property in violation of the constitutions of the United States and the State of Rhode Island. 8 7', 'In its complaint, the state originally asserted that the incipient dedication gave it a fee interest in the disputed area. After trial, however, the state clarified that it sought only a public easement over the beach area. 8', 'Through a stipulation dated April 11, 2013, the counterclaims alleging slander of title and an unconstitutional taking were dismissed.', '-4-', 'The defendants moved for summary judgment, and the state filed a cross-motion for summary judgment and a motion for summary judgment on defendant-intervenors’ counterclaim to quiet title. The trial justice heard the parties’ arguments, and, on September 25, 2013, denied the three summary-judgment motions. The trial justice determined that there was a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether the Plattors intended a public dedication. Further, he concluded that “[t]he nature and volume of the pertinent evidence offered by plaintiff and defendants necessitate[d] a factual determination by the trial justice.”', 'C', 'Trial', 'On April 1, 2014, a lengthy bench trial commenced before the same trial justice. The parties agreed to a bifurcated format; phase one of the trial focused on whether the original 1909 Plattors intended to dedicate the disputed area to the public, and, if the trial justice found that the Plattors did intend to dedicate, the parties would reach phase two of the trial, which would address whether the public accepted the Plattors’ offer of dedication. 9 Over the course of phase one of the trial, the state presented seven witnesses and introduced over 200 documents; defendants presented three witnesses and also introduced over 200 documents.', 'Below we summarize the relevant testimony adduced at trial.', 'The state first called Alfred G. Thibodeau, an attorney licensed in Rhode Island, whose primary practice area was real estate conveyances and title searches. Thibodeau testified that he reviewed the 1909 Plat. He stated that the 1909 Plat demonstrated that the owners were trying to achieve a common-development scheme because the plat was a composite plan by five separate 9', 'Because the trial justice determined that there was no dedication, phase two of the trial was unnecessary and final judgment entered.', '-5- owners, when each property owner could have instead developed their lots on separate plans. Thibodeau said that it was necessary to review the Indenture to understand the Plat. When asked whether he deemed the line of foot of bank to be a representation of a natural feature or a boundary, he responded that it was a boundary because the dashed lines separating the lots run to and stop at the line of foot of bank.', 'Thibodeau interpreted the Indenture’s language that the rights of way run from Atlantic Avenue “to the Beach” as a right of way granting public beach access and use. “Otherwise,” Thibodeau stated, “whats [sic] the point of getting people up to the line at the beach * * * .” He opined that the 1909 Plat and Indenture “create[] public rights in the rights of way and on the beach, and it also creates private rights to any purchases of individual lots to the rights of way and the beach.” Thibodeau suggested that, even without the Indenture, the Plat still illustrated a public dedication because it showed “the beach as a separate area on the [P]lat with access to it.”', 'Alfred DiOrio, a professional land surveyor, testified next. DiOrio stated that he was familiar with the 1909 Plat as he had completed multiple surveys in the Atlantic Avenue area. He described the plat: There are lines indicating Atlantic Avenue; at the southerly limits of Atlantic Avenue, there is a series of beach lots; and continuing southerly, there is line work termed “line of bank and line of foot of bank.” DiOrio detailed the line of foot of bank as “an irregular undulating line that runs southerly of the beach lots.” Further south on the 1909 Plat, DiOrio testified, there is “an open area identified as beach” and then line work that signifies “the edge of a water body,” specifically the Atlantic Ocean. He noted that the 1909 Plat lacked a legend indicating the meaning of the various line types utilized.', 'DiOrio discussed the several boundaries shown on the 1909 Plat, the first being Atlantic Avenue, which is “shown in a bold or continuous line type, continuing southerly.” Demarking', '-6- the easterly and westerly beach lot boundaries is “a dashed line type.” He noted that the dashed lines that separate the beach lots extend from Atlantic Avenue but stop at the line of foot of bank and do not extend beyond that line towards the Atlantic Ocean. DiOrio testified that this demonstrates that the Plattors “fully intended that those lot lines terminate at the line of the bank.”', 'He noted, however, that this opinion was based solely on the 1909 Plat, without considering deeds or other evidence of the Plattors’ intent. DiOrio stated that he reviewed many deeds arising out of the Plat, and he testified that “as soon as the deeds start to talk about being bounded southerly by * * * the sea, the ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, now we have an ambiguity * * * . * * * We have a bounding description that clearly calls for the Atlantic Ocean as the southerly boundary.”', 'Grover Fugate, the executive director of the CRMC, testified next. Fugate said that during his time at the CRMC, he had supervised over 20,000 permits and thousands of enforcement proceedings. Fugate noted that the Division of Harbors and Rivers (DHR), the agency responsible for overseeing the area below the mean high water mark, 10 existed prior to the CRMC’s creation, which then absorbed the DHR’s powers.', 'In his testimony, Fugate discussed a 1969 letter from the then-chief of the DHR to defendant, Clarence Brown, regarding defendant’s application to the DHR to erect a fence. In the letter, the DHR chief stated that the fence could be built to the mean high water mark but reminded Brown that the waters were within the public domain and therefore must be kept open and accessible. Fugate explained this response, however, by stating that the DHR did not concern itself with anything above the mean high water mark, over which it lacked jurisdiction. 10', 'For purposes of this opinion, we treat the phrases “mean high water mark,” “mean high tide line,” and “mean high water line” as synonymous.', '-7- Rather, the DHR, in accordance with the Rhode Island Constitution,11 was concerned only with public property below the mean high water mark. Fugate testified that “[t]he general assumption is * * * that anything above the mean high water mark was probably in some sort of private property without going and doing a title investigation that would be sort of the general assumption.” He further noted that, regardless, the DHR chief lacked authority to determine the property’s boundary.', 'The state next called Steven Corey, a history professor and department chair at Columbia College of Chicago.', 'Corey described himself as a social historian who specialized in environmental history and urban history. 12 He testified that he examined the history of Pleasant View, the area now called Misquamicut, wherein the disputed area lies. Specifically, Corey stated that he researched Pleasant View’s development as a summer beach colony between the 1890s and 1920s. For this research, Corey reviewed local history collections and Westerly land records, including the 1909 Plat.', 'Corey discussed a trolley that arrived in Pleasant View in 1912. He testified that the trolley traveled along Atlantic Avenue to the Weekapaug breachway, the disputed area’s easternmost boundary, to bring people to Misquamicut for day excursions, such as beach visits. He discussed the trolley company’s incentive for ridership: “[B]y extending the railway line, they were certainly hoping * * * to have people taking day excursions to Pleasant View and 11', 'Article 1, section 17 of the Rhode Island Constitution provides in pertinent part:', '“The people shall continue to enjoy and freely exercise all the', 'rights of fishery, and the privileges of the shore, to which they', 'have been heretofore entitled under the charter and usages of this', 'state, including but not limited to fishing from the shore, the', 'gathering of seaweed, leaving the shore to swim in the sea and', 'passage along the shore * * * .” 12', 'Corey defined “urban history” as “the study of the process of urbanization,” which is the “concentration of population and processes that create the concentration of population and where people live in regions.”', '-8- going and enjoying the beach at Pleasant View.” Corey noted that the Winnapaug Company, one of the Plattors, “was part of the trolley company in terms of holdings.” With respect to the property developers’ perception of the beach, Corey noted that “[i]t’s clear that the promoter * * * and the realtor and those who [were] promoting the beach [saw] that as one continuous beach.” He testified that the Plattors viewed the beach as “one whole continuous beach;” and, in support, he explained that the Plattors planned to build an oceanfront boardwalk.', 'Next, David Thompson, tax assessor for the Town of Westerly, testified. As tax assessor, Thompson maintained responsibility for valuing real estate, personal property, and vehicles, and for maintaining and updating the town’s tax assessor’s plat maps. Thompson was shown a tax map of the Atlantic Avenue area that was recorded in the 1940s or 1950s and testified that it depicted the southerly boundary as “the line above the mean high tide line,” which equates with the line of foot of bank. With respect to the rights of way shown on the tax map, Thompson also testified that their southerly boundary was the line above the mean high tide line.', 'Thompson then viewed the current tax map of the disputed area, which was prepared in 1980. He noted that the southerly boundary on the current tax map differed from the one shown on the 1940s-50s tax map, in that the eastern and western lot boundaries now extend from Atlantic Avenue to the mean high tide line. Thompson testified that the current tax map depicted the southerly boundary as the mean high tide line and that, therefore, the lots are depicted as extending to the Atlantic Ocean.', 'Janet Freedman, a coastal geologist at CRMC, was the next witness. Freedman noted her familiarity with the 1909 Plat and stated that she had visited the disputed area in recent years. Freedman described the area: There is a cleared right of way, a low-grade slope onto the beach, and then the beach itself, which is fairly flat. She then discussed the conditions of the disputed', '-9- area in July of 1909, when the Plat and Indenture were recorded. She testified that the beach would have looked the same, but it was farther seaward than it is at present. Freedman testified that she used technology to project the Plat onto a 2008 aerial photograph of the disputed area, which revealed that the line of foot of bank has eroded and migrated northerly. Freedman explained, however, that “the beach is still a beach. * * * It’s just in a different place a little f[a]rther north.”', 'The state’s next witness was Paul Leblanc, the Westerly town engineer. After viewing the 1909 Plat, Leblanc was asked if he could determine whether the easterly and westerly division lines dividing the lots extended to the line of foot of bank or elsewhere. Leblanc testified that he checked the measurements by relative scale and determined that the lines were limited to the line of foot of bank. He stated, however, that it was unclear whether the line of foot of bank was the lots’ southerly boundary because it was not called the “southerly project limits or property limits.” Nevertheless, Leblanc testified that, if the Plattors intended to extend the property lines to the mean Atlantic Ocean, “those lines would have been extended through that physical feature to the ocean’s edge.” Leblanc concluded that “[t]he plan clearly is up for interpretation where that southerly boundary is.”', 'Leblanc was then shown the 1924 Westerly Water Works plan. He concluded that the plan was made (transferred and transposed) from a plat, such as the 1909 Plat. He interpreted a line running parallel and above a line marked ocean to be the line of foot of bank as depicted in the Plat. The line of foot of bank displayed on that plan, however, did not have breaks in the undulating line as the 1909 Plat’s line did. Leblanc noted that the plan did not reference the line of foot of bank as a boundary line. He also testified about a plan prepared for the Town of Westerly, which Leblanc said was prepared as a reference plan showing “the dedicated public', '- 10 - access points from the Atlantic Avenue right of way to the beach area.” His attention was directed to a line on the plan labeled as the approximate mean high water line. Parallel above that line was a line labeled “approximate lot limit as shown on plan.” Leblanc testified that this line represented the line of foot of bank depicted on the Plat.', 'At the close of the state’s case, defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 52(c) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, but the trial justice reserved decision. 13', 'The first witness for the defense was Joseph A. Priestley Jr., an attorney from Westerly, whose practice focused on “land related or administratively related” matters. Priestley described the Plat as a subdivision plan, which, by present-day standards, would have been “taken before a planning board and approved by the planning board.” In his testimony, Priestley discussed which lines on the 1909 Plat represent boundary lines. He testified that the line at Atlantic Avenue and the dashed lines separating the lots are boundary lines, but he was unable to determine the southerly boundary because “the dashed lines [that separate the lots] run occasionally to the line at the foot of the bank or stops [sic] near it, but there are certain exceptions * * * [where] the dashed lines go between a gap in that line and continue f[a]rther south.” Priestley testified that the line of foot of bank’s “fairly significant” break and the places where the dashed line runs past the line of foot of bank, indicate that it was not intended as a boundary line. Priestley opined that, if the line of foot of bank was intended as a boundary line, “it would continue without an unexplainable break.” He noted that the Indenture clarified that 13', '“In a nonjury case, a party may move for judgment as a matter of law after the presentation of an opponent’s case, in accordance with Rule 52(c) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.” Hernandez v. JS Pallet Co., 41 A.3d 978, 983 (R.I. 2012). Under Rule 52(c), “the court may enter judgment as a matter of law against the party who has been fully heard on an issue, but ‘[s]uch a judgment shall be supported by findings of fact and conclusions of law * * * .’” Hernandez, 41 A.3d at 983 (quoting Rule 52(c)).', '- 11 - the southerly side of Atlantic Avenue, above the lots, is an intended boundary; however, it was not helpful in determining whether the line of foot of bank is a boundary line.', 'Priestley testified that he had reviewed all of the deeds that arose out of the 1909 Plat, which amounted to about 200 deeds. He looked “at each conveyance of each of the lots shown on the 1909 map by the owner and * * * the great majority of those were described by bounding southerly on the ocean with the description of the lot number of various restrictions.” Priestley discussed a particular deed from one of the Plattors, the Saunderses, which reserved rights and warranties for them to enter the beach to remove seaweed from it. He noted that “seaweed rights” reservations were common in many of the deeds out of the Plat. He stated that the Saunderses’ deed also contained a condition that gave the grantors (the Saunderses) a right to enter and repossess the land upon a breach by the grantee. Priestley answered in the negative when asked whether such reservations are consistent with a public dedication to the beach. He noted that language in the Saunderses chain that warranted the property against encumbrances and agreed to defend title is also inconsistent with the allegation of public dedication of the beach area, which would be a violation of the implied covenant of quiet enjoyment.', 'Priestley testified that the Langworthy Plattors granted private easements to certain individuals who lived outside of the 1909 Plat, including two rights of way over one of the lots to the Atlantic Ocean, and another private right of way to reach the ocean. When asked if the Plattors conveyed any public beach rights, Priestley testified that the marked rights of way are reserved to the public and “extend from Atlantic Avenue through that area at the same width to the shore of the ocean.” He opined that these marked rights of way grant the public “[t]he right to pass to the beach and to walk back and forth across it.” He added, “I think they meant beach * * * in the historic way as the land below the mean high tide line and above the mean low water', '- 12 - [line] where you can walk.” Priestley expressed his belief that the only right conveyed with respect to the dry sand portion of the beach was “the right to pass across it as a continuation of the rights of way from Atlantic Avenue * * * .”', 'It was his testimony that, after reviewing the deeds, the 1909 Plat, and the Indenture, he concluded that the Atlantic Ocean—not the line of foot of bank—is the southerly boundary. To support this opinion, Priestley noted that the lots that pre-existed the Plat all showed the Atlantic Ocean as its boundary, and nearly all conveyances in the Plat chain listed the Atlantic Ocean as the boundary.', 'Nathan Lauder, a professional land surveyor for over thirty-five years, testified next. He stated that he had completed many surveys in Misquamicut and that he had encountered the 1909 Plat in connection with that work. Lauder testified that the properties’ southerly boundary is unclear from the 1909 Plat, and it was therefore necessary to look at each property’s deed description. Lauder noted that many of the deeds contained a “bounds description” stating that the property was bounded by the Atlantic Ocean. Lauder testified that such descriptions were “monument calls,” and he described “a monument” as “something that has come to be recognized as identifiable on the ground that you can see, you can touch; such as Atlantic Avenue.”', 'Lauder testified that, prior to the commencement of this suit, he prepared a survey for one of defendants to determine his property’s southerly boundary and concluded that it was the mean high water line. He stated that, in 2008, he performed a survey for another defendant for a building-permit application. Again, he determined that the property’s southerly boundary was the mean high water line. Lauder testified that, in 2002, about ten years prior to this litigation, he prepared a survey for defendant, Dunes Park, Inc., which lies at the easternmost end of the Plat.', '- 13 - The survey was prepared so that Dunes Park, Inc. could make improvements that required environmental and regulatory permits. This survey showed the southerly boundary as the mean high water line.', 'The defendants’ final witness was Richard H. Strause, an engineer and land surveyor employed at C.M.E. Associates, the successor engineering firm to the firm that prepared the 1909 Plat. Strause testified that he obtained the predecessor firm’s historic maps and field books associated with the Plat. Although he found the original field books associated with the Plat, they did not reference the proposed southerly boundary. After reviewing the Plat, Strause testified that, considered alone, it contained insufficient information to determine the southerly boundary. Given the ambiguity of the southerly boundary based on the 1909 Plat, Strause testified that he “would look to the deed for the intent of the conveyance.”', 'At the close of their case, defendants again moved under Rule 52(c) for findings and conclusions on “the issue of whether the 1909 [P]lat accomplished the dedication of the disputed areas.” The state rephrased the issue as whether there was an offer of incipient dedication. The trial justice requested briefing and oral argument on the motion. The parties submitted posttrial briefs and reply briefs to the trial justice. On July 2, 2014, the trial justice heard the parties’ posttrial arguments. 14', 'D', 'The Trial Justice’s Decision', 'On September 4, 2014, the trial justice issued a written decision. He noted that the threshold issue before him was whether the 1909 Plat, along with the Indenture’s language, 14', 'It is unclear whether the trial justice rendered an ultimate decision on the Rule 52(c) motion or whether it was disposed of in the context of his final decision. In any case, judgment was entered for defendants on March 24, 2015.', '- 14 - demonstrated the Plattors’ manifest intent for a public dedication of the beach area. Before reaching that issue, however, the trial justice first determined whether the Plattors had the power to dedicate an easement over the beach area through the 1909 Plat and Indenture. He found that the Plattors lacked the power to dedicate because they did not own all of the area that was allegedly dedicated. In describing each Plattor’s interest in the disputed area, the trial justice stated that “each individual owner of a lot along Atlantic Avenue has an exclusive ownership interest in fee in a strip of land that extends from the southern boundary of Atlantic Avenue all the way to the Atlantic Ocean;” he added that, as such, “the Disputed Area labeled as ‘Beach’ on the 1909 Plat is owned by more than one individual, but each individual owns, exclusively, a piece of the aggregate whole.” Because at least four lot owners depicted on the Plat (aside from the Plattors) signed neither the Plat nor the Indenture, the trial justice determined that the Plattors lacked the power to dedicate an easement over property that they did not own and any portions that they did own. Although he noted that this finding “should end the inquiry,” the trial justice nonetheless addressed the merits of the remaining legal questions. 15', 'The trial justice then discussed whether the 1909 Plat and Indenture, read together as a single instrument, clearly and unambiguously show the Plattors’ manifest intent to dedicate the beach area to the public. To do so, he first analyzed the lines and markings on the Plat. He compared the lines used for Atlantic Avenue’s northern and southern boundaries with the line of foot of bank. He noted that the former are “thick, straight, uninterrupted lines containing, at frequent intervals, survey markers pronouncing angle and distance measurements and have a clear beginning and end point,” whereas the line of foot of bank is made up of six separate 15', 'We note that in its papers before us, plaintiff asserts that the trial justice erred in concluding that the Plattors lacked the power to dedicate any portion of the beach area because they did not own the entire area. At oral argument, however, defendants conceded that the Plattors had the power to dedicate. Accordingly, we need not address this issue.', '- 15 - undulating lines, contains no survey markers, and has no beginning or end point. Additionally, the trial justice noted that the dashed easterly and westerly lot boundaries and the dashed property “set-back line” intersected the line of foot of bank in places.', 'The trial justice deemed inapplicable the common-law presumption of intent to dedicate when a road is shown on a plat because the Plattors did not view the beach area as a road or street. He held that merely labeling the disputed area “Beach” was insufficient to demonstrate intent to dedicate an easement on the property. Further, the trial justice surmised that the Plattors knew how to dedicate property to the public, as shown by their dedication of the rights of way, which they clearly articulated were “hereby dedicated to public use” in the Indenture. Notably, the Plattors did not use such language with respect to the beach area. Accordingly, the trial justice determined that the 1909 Plat and Indenture did not clearly and unambiguously demonstrate intent to dedicate an easement over the beach area.', 'The trial justice was careful to distinguish “a finding that the 1909 Plat and the Indenture do not clearly and unambiguously reflect the Plattors’ intention to dedicate an easement over the Beach Area to the general public” from “a finding that the 1909 Plat and the Indenture are unclear or ambiguous.”', 'Therefore, he still had to analyze those instruments, in and of themselves, to determine if they were ambiguous. In that regard, the trial justice stated that an instrument is ambiguous if it is subject to more than one reasonable interpretation. Finding unreasonable the state’s interpretation that the instruments demonstrated the Plattors’ intent to dedicate, he deemed the Plat and Indenture to be clear and unambiguous.', 'Having found the 1909 Plat and Indenture unambiguous, the trial justice noted that he could not consider extrinsic evidence to determine the question of dedicatory intent. Nonetheless, the trial justice offered his alternative analysis that, had he found the 1909 Plat and', '- 16 - Indenture ambiguous, he would have held that the extrinsic evidence was insufficient to resolve any hypothetical ambiguity in the state’s favor. The trial justice deemed irrelevant the extrinsic evidence of surveys, tax assessor plans, communication between state agencies and beachfront property owners, and “second-generation” deeds. Instead, he found the “most important body of extrinsic evidence” to be: the first deeds out from the Plattors, documents concerning the Plat that were produced up to the recording of the Plat and Indenture, and expert testimony about the meaning of the Plat’s lines and markings. With respect to the first deeds out of the Plat, the trial justice found that the “beach rights” reservations within the deeds were referring to “preexisting covenants that landowners may have had with these third parties, and not reflective of easement rights in the Beach Area held by the public at large.” 16 Also, the trial justice was persuaded that the evidence revealed that the Plattors intended the line of foot of bank to represent a geographic feature, not a boundary. Lastly, the trial justice determined that the Indenture’s language that the rights of way go “to the Beach” 17 did not indicate that the Plattors intended to grant an easement over the entire beach area. Going further, he questioned whether the rights of way even extended to the shore line. As previously noted, the CRMC and the Town of Westerly are concerned that the trial justice cast doubt on whether the rights of way provide any public access to the shore, as the CRMC had previously designated that they do. We regard the trial justice’s statements with respect to the rights of way as obiter dicta. Thus, those statements do not in any way disturb the CRMC’s designations that the rights of way provide public access to the shore. 16', 'Specifically, the trial justice was referencing two post-1909 Plat deeds, introduced by the state, executed in 1911 wherein the deed stated that the conveyances were “subject to * * * beach rights, as per plan.” 17', 'The phrase “to the Beach” appears in the context of the Plattors’ dedication of the rights of way: “the spaces indicated on said plan as a public walk or right of way will be set apart and kept open and are dedicated as a public walk and right of way from said highway to the Beach * * * .” (Emphasis added.)', '- 17 -', 'Based on the foregoing analysis and findings, the trial justice concluded that the 1909 Plat and Indenture did not reveal the Plattors’ manifest intent to dedicate an easement over the beach area, and he deemed the 1909 Plat and Indenture clear and unambiguous. The trial justice further found that, even if he had deemed the 1909 Plat and Indenture ambiguous, the extrinsic evidence did not demonstrate a manifest intent to dedicate a public easement over the beach area.', 'E', 'Appeal', 'The state appealed to this Court on March 31, 2015. 18 In pertinent part, it argues that: (1) the 1909 Plat clearly and unambiguously demonstrates the Plattors’ intent to dedicate the disputed area; and (2) even if the 1909 Plat was ambiguous, the extrinsic evidence reveals the Plattors’ intent to dedicate the beach. Among the arguments that defendants raise on appeal is that the state should be judicially estopped from asserting that the disputed area was dedicated to the public because such position is contrary to ones that it previously held. 19 18', 'The trial justice entered final judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure on plaintiff’s amended complaint, in favor of defendants.

The state points to three legal errors that it contends the trial justice made in interpreting the Plat and Indenture: He (1) misread the lines and markings on the Plat; (2) erroneously concluded that the rights of way did not grant any rights in the beach area; and (3) improperly narrowed the doctrine of incipient dedication to roadways.', 'Whether the beach area is public “hinges ‘on the owner’s intent at the time the plat is recorded and the lots are sold.’” Drescher, 45 A.3d at 1230 (quoting Newport Realty, Inc., 878 A.2d at 1033).', 'Although sometimes “a recorded plat is all that is needed to disclose a', '- 21 - landowner’s dedicatory intent[,] * * * [v]ery often lines and figures drawn on a land- development plat may be unclear as to their intended purpose.” Id. at 1231 (quoting Robidoux, 120 R.I. at 434, 391 A.2d at 1155). In that regard, “it is the task of the factfinder to interpret the meaning of the disputed item by careful scrutiny of all lines, figures, and letters that appear on the map as well as whatever pertinent evidence may be adduced by the litigants.” Robidoux, 120 R.I. at 434, 391 A.2d at 1155.', 'In making this determination, the trial justice’s first task was “to examine the plat, particularly the lines and declarations that relate to the disputed land, to determine whether this evidence gives rise to a finding of no dedicatory intent or whether it is ambiguous.” Newport Realty, Inc., 878 A.2d at 1034. The trial justice carefully examined the lines and markings on the 1909 Plat and Indenture to determine the Plattors’ intent. He first compared the lines used for the Atlantic Avenue boundaries with the line of foot of bank and correctly noted that the Atlantic Avenue boundaries are “thick, straight, uninterrupted lines,” whereas the line of foot of bank is an undulating line that breaks in six places. The trial justice then discussed the Atlantic Ocean boundary, which he described as “a series of very narrow undulating lines.” He likened this line to the line of foot of bank, noting that neither contains “surveyor’s benchmarks depicting angles, distances, or other measurements,” as the Atlantic Avenue boundaries do. Based on the vast differences between the Atlantic Avenue boundary lines and those bounding the beach area, the trial justice recognized that the Plattors did not regard the beach area as being the same as roadways for purposes of incipient dedication. The trial justice noted that, while dedication can be presumed in most roadway dedications, here the Plattors needed to do more than merely label the disputed area “Beach” to demonstrate manifest intent to dedicate it. See Donnelly, 716 A.2d at 748 (“[S]imply placing a line or a mark on a plat or delineating a way or a', '- 22 - street for boundary purposes is insufficient to establish conclusively the original owner’s intent to offer the property for dedication.”).', 'The Indenture further supports the trial justice’s conclusion that the Plattors did not intend a public dedication of the beach area. As he noted, the Plattors were certainly aware of how to dedicate property to the public because they successfully did so with the nine rights of way. In the Indenture, the Plattors stated that “the spaces indicated on said plan as a public walk or right of way * * * are dedicated as a public walk and right of way from said highway to the Beach * * * .” (Emphasis added.) As the trial justice noted, “[n]o such language is connected to the Disputed Area labeled simply as ‘Beach’ on the 1909 Plat, and described simply as ‘the Beach’ on the Indenture.” Based on his analysis of the Plat and Indenture, he concluded that the instruments did not “clearly and unambiguously reflect the Plattors’ intention to dedicate an easement to the general public over the Beach Area * * * .”', 'The state argues, however, that the trial justice “ignored key parts” of the Plat and Indenture in his decision. Specifically, it maintains that he disregarded the dimensions that show that the lots end before the mean high tide line. We deem this contention unavailing. As we outlined above, a review of the trial justice’s decision reveals that he carefully analyzed the Plat’s lines and markings and the Indenture’s language. Although he did not expressly discuss certain characteristics of the Plat and Indenture, “[a] trial justice need not ‘categorically accept or reject each piece of evidence in his decision for this Court to uphold it because implicit in the trial justice[’]s decision are sufficient findings of fact to support his rulings.’” Notarantonio v. Notarantonio, 941 A.2d 138, 147 (R.I. 2008) (quoting Narragansett Electric Co. v. Carbone, 898 A.2d 87, 102 (R.I. 2006)).', '- 23 -', 'The state also challenges the trial justice’s finding that the line of foot of bank is not the southerly boundary and asserts that this “is an error of law.” It cites to Nye v. Brousseau, 992 A.2d 1002 (R.I. 2010) for the proposition that “the issue of what constitute[s] the boundaries of a parcel of land is a question of law.” 21 Id. at 1009 (quoting Norton v. Courtemanche, 798 A.2d 925, 932 (R.I. 2002)). We are not convinced, however, that the trial justice made a conclusive finding about the property’s southerly boundary. He merely stated that he was persuaded by the evidence that the line of foot of bank “reflects the Plattors’ intention to depict a geographic feature, not the boundary of an easement or a right of way.” Any findings made regarding the line of foot of bank and the lots’ southerly boundary were made only to assist the trial justice in determining the Plattors’ intent. He was not charged with determining the southerly boundary of the lots, but rather with deciding whether the Plattors intended to dedicate the beach area to the public.', 'The state also contends that the trial justice erred in not finding that the Indenture’s language “to the Beach” granted implied easement rights to the public to use the beach. To support this argument, the state relies upon cases from other jurisdictions where courts held that easements “to the beach” implied easement rights in the beach. See generally Anderson v. De Vries, 93 N.E.2d 251 (Mass. 1950), abrogated by M.P.M. Builders, LLC v. Dwyer, 809 N.E.2d 1053 (Mass. 2004); Murphy v. Olsen, 826 N.E.2d 249 (Mass.

The present case is clearly distinguishable from those relied upon. See Anderson, 93 N.E.2d at 256 (The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court’s conclusion that an easement “to the beach” encompassed an easement to use the beach did not involve rights gained through the recording of a plat); Murphy, 826 N.E.2d at 251 (The Massachusetts Court of Appeals held that an easement “to the beach” granted an easement to use the beach because deeds included a “beach use” clause that granted “the right to use [the beach] for its entire length for walking, swimming, sunbathing, fishing, shellfishing and other recreational purposes * * * .”).', 'We also reject the state’s argument that the trial justice restricted the doctrine of incipient dedication to roadways. The state takes issue with the trial justice’s finding that “[n]o common law rule existed in 1909—and no common law rule exists now—on which the Plattors could have relied to manifest their supposed intention to create an incipient dedication of an easement over the Beach Area, merely by depicting it on the 1909 Plat.” The state argues that this determination is at odds with Warwick Sewer Authority, 45 A.3d at 501, where this Court applied the doctrine of incipient dedication to non-roadways. In that case, the landowner- defendant recorded a plat map, wherein a portion of the subdivision was depicted as “dedicated to the City of Warwick.” Id. at 495. In determining whether the landowner expressed manifest intent, this Court concluded that the plat map “sufficiently and unambiguously evidence[d] Mr. Carlone’s intent to dedicate the land in question to Warwick for general public use.” Id. at 501.', 'Here, the trial justice did not find the doctrine of incipient dedication inapplicable to the dedication of a beach.

Further, it is important to note the significant', '- 25 - difference between the facts present in Warwick Sewer Authority and those in the instant case. In Warwick Sewer Authority, 45 A.3d at 495, the recorded plat clearly indicated that the property was “dedicated to the City of Warwick.” Here, there is no such language demonstrating a manifest intent to dedicate.', '“[T]he trial justice was called upon to make a factual determination based upon the evidence then before him.”', 'Robidoux, 120 R.I. at 435, 391 A.2d at 1155.', 'He carefully considered the lines and markings of the 1909 Plat and Indenture before finding that the instruments did not reveal the Plattors’ manifest intent to dedicate the beach area. We find no error.', 'D', 'Extrinsic Evidence', 'While we could end our analysis with our determination that the trial justice did not err in concluding that the Plat and Indenture do not demonstrate manifest intent to dedicate, we will nevertheless address the state’s arguments concerning extrinsic evidence. The trial justice found the Plat and Indenture unambiguous and therefore could not consider extrinsic evidence to vary the recorded plat. 22 Assuming (in an arguendo manner) that he had found the instruments ambiguous, however, the trial justice offered his analysis of the extrinsic evidence and concluded that such evidence did not reveal the Plattors’ manifest intent to dedicate the beach area.', 'In his analysis, the trial justice, without detailed discussion, found that the most important extrinsic evidence was: the first deeds out of the Plat; the documents related to the platted area that were created leading up to the Plat and Indenture’s recording; and the expert testimony 22', '“In the absence of a finding that the recorded plat is ambiguous, we know of no authority that permits a trial justice to go beyond the plat and entertain parol or extrinsic evidence to vary the terms of a writing.” Newport Realty, Inc. v.

After considering this body of evidence, the trial justice concluded that any ambiguity in the 1909 Plat and Indenture supported the position that the Plattors did not intend to dedicate an easement to the public over the beach area. In support of this finding, he noted that the first deeds out of the 1909 Plat that reserve “beach rights” were not, contrary to the state’s contention, referring to a public easement in the beach, but rather to “preexisting covenants that landowners might have had with these third parties.” The trial justice was also persuaded by the evidence that the line of foot of bank represents a geographic feature and not a boundary.', 'The state challenges the trial justice’s findings and asserts that the extrinsic evidence demonstrates manifest intent to dedicate. It faults the trial justice for not considering various pieces of such evidence and argues that the trial justice placed too much weight on the post-1909 deeds that listed the “Atlantic Ocean” as the property’s southerly boundary. At bottom, the state’s arguments are criticisms of the trial justice’s analysis of the evidence or his failure to mention pieces of evidence. “We reject the suggestion that a trial justice must resolve every disputed factual contention that may arise during a trial.” Notarantonio, 941 A.2d at 147.', 'We also reject the state’s argument that the trial justice placed too much reliance on the deeds out of the 1909 Plat that refer to the Atlantic Ocean as the southerly boundary.', 'In his discussion of the extrinsic evidence, the trial justice stated that the original first deeds out were among the most probative evidence in determining the Plattors’ intent. The majority of the deeds out of the Plat listed the Atlantic Ocean as the southerly boundary. Additionally, many retained “seaweed rights,” so that the grantor could return to the beach to remove seaweed. The trial justice also heard testimony about a deed wherein a set of Plattors, the Saunderses, retained the right to re-enter and repossess the land if the grantee breached a condition. There was also', '- 27 - testimony about deeds that contained a warranty to defend against anyone claiming superior title and covenants against encumbrances. In Priestley’s testimony, he stated that such reservations and warranties are inconsistent with the assertion that the Plattors had dedicated the beach area to the public.', '“The trial justice’s role in the fact-finding process includes the drawing of inferences. * * * His findings will stand even though another equally reasonable set of inferences might be drawn from the evidence.” Robidoux, 120 R.I. at 435-36, 391 A.2d at 1155.

The defendant also told Danielle that she was going to be “a beautiful girl when [she] got older.” Danielle also testified that, during this same 2', 'For the sake of privacy, the parties will be referred to by their first names. 3', 'The case was originally tried in September 2014, but a mistrial was declared when the jury was unable to reach a verdict. 4', 'Danielle also recounted two occasions of sexual abuse that occurred while she was living in Massachusetts; she was approximately six years old at that time.', '-2- family cookout, she saw defendant in her bedroom with a child named Rosemary, who was a close family friend and who lived in the same building.5 Danielle stated that she observed defendant “doing the same thing to [Rosemary]” that he had done to her earlier that day. However, despite diligent efforts by the police, Rosemary could not be located. Warwick Police Detective Shaun Turcotte testified regarding the efforts he undertook to locate Rosemary, to no avail.', 'On another occasion, Danielle testified that she and John—defendant’s son—were playing in the family living room when defendant placed a blanket over the two cousins and “told [them] that [they] could touch each other if [they] wanted to.” The defendant then put John to bed and joined Danielle in the living room. According to Danielle, defendant placed his hand inside her underwear and “began doing the same thing as the other times, moving his hand around in a circular motion.” He again commented on Danielle’s beauty and kissed her face and neck.', 'The next incident occurred when Danielle was around thirteen years of age when she and defendant were watching a movie in defendant’s bed. The defendant placed a comforter over Danielle, put his hand up her shirt, and began touching her breast and areola. He also “put his hand down [Danielle’s] pants and * * * began doing the same thing as the other times.” The final incident occurred after Danielle and her family moved to East Providence when she was around age fifteen. Danielle was spending the night at defendant’s house because his home was closer to her school. She recalled that she was lying on the floor and watching television when defendant “got down on the floor” and grabbed her chest over her clothes. The defendant then 5', 'Danielle testified that Rosemary was approximately three years older than she.', '-3- unbuttoned Danielle’s pants and inserted his finger into her vagina. She then rolled onto her stomach in order to avoid this assault.6', 'Danielle initially attempted to tell her cousin, Jeffrey L. (Jeff), about the abuse when she was between the ages of eight and ten. Jeff testified at trial and corroborated this testimony, but added that Danielle indicated “that she was joking as like a way so as [he] wouldn’t tell anybody.” Many years later, on Christmas Eve 2010, when Danielle was having relationship issues, Danielle’s mother, Audrey R. (Audrey), asked Danielle if she had ever been abused by anyone. Audrey testified that she began naming male figures in Danielle’s life; when Audrey named defendant, Danielle “just looked at [her].” Although she denied having sexual intercourse with defendant, Danielle would not divulge much more. When defendant’s wife, Carol, who is Audrey’s sister, telephoned on Christmas Day, Audrey confronted defendant, stating: “I know what you did to my daughter. * * * I know what you did to my daughter when she was younger.” When Carol asked him what they were talking about, defendant responded, “She’s saying I molested Danielle.”', 'Audrey testified that she never used the word “molested” when she confronted defendant. The two families never spoke again. At trial, defendant testified and acknowledged that the families became estranged after the allegations, but he denied that he had sexually assaulted Danielle.', 'The defendant was convicted of all counts in the indictment. The Superior Court justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial and sentenced defendant to life in prison for first- degree sexual assault, and ten years suspended, to run concurrently with the life sentence, on the remaining counts of second-degree child molestation. 6', 'Because this act involved sexual penetration, defendant was charged with first-degree sexual assault pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 11-37-2.', '-4-', 'Because no timely appeal was taken in this case, defendant filed a petition for writ of certiorari, which this Court granted on October 20, 2015.', 'Standard of Review', '“In reviewing the admission or exclusion of evidence, it is well settled that ‘[t]he admissibility of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial justice, and this Court will not interfere with the trial justice’s decision unless a clear abuse of discretion is apparent.’” State v.

First, defendant directs our attention to the state’s cross-examination of defendant concerning his wife and son and the fact that they did not contact authorities after the sexual assault allegations were made.', 'According to defendant, this questioning improperly suggested that defendant bore a burden to produce evidence in this case, such that a mistrial was warranted. However, only the cross-examination concerning defendant’s wife was preserved for appellate review. The record discloses that during cross-examination of defendant, the state asked about defendant’s interaction with his son, John. Because there was no objection to this line of questioning, we deem this issue waived.', 'Turning to the cross-examination concerning defendant’s wife, the following colloquy occurred:', '“Q.', 'And you’ve talked to your wife since this?', '“A.', 'Yes.', '“Q.', 'Did you ever tell your wife to give a statement to Detective', 'Turcotte?', '“[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection', '“THE COURT: Overruled. You can answer yes or no.', '“A.', 'I didn’t have to tell them.', '“Q.', 'She didn’t give a statement to Detective Turcotte; right?', '“A.', 'He never called her.

I’m', 'going to sustain the last [objection].” (Emphasis added.)', 'After the Superior Court justice sustained the objection, defendant did not ask to have the answer stricken. The defendant did move to pass the case and argued that the questioning shifted the burden of proof by creating an impression that defendant had an obligation to produce evidence. After the Superior Court justice declined to declare a mistrial, defendant moved to strike all of the testimony related to defendant’s son and wife. We decline to review that portion of the motion that relates to defendant’s son because this testimony came in without objection, and thus, the issue was waived. See State v. Fry, 130 A.3d 812, 826 (R.I. 2016) (“[W]hether strategic or not, [the] defendant’s failure to object places her plaint toward the [prosecutor’s] questions squarely within our ‘raise-or-waive’ rule and, thus, her contention with regard to these * * * questions is not preserved for our review.”); State v. Moreno, 996 A.2d 673, 684 (R.I. 2010) (holding that the defendant did not object to the trial justice’s exclusion of certain evidence, thereby waiving the argument on appeal); State v. Merced, 933 A.2d 172, 174 (R.I.', '-7- 2007) (“[A]lleged errors ‘not specifically objected to at trial—that is, by an objection that is sufficiently focused so as to call the trial justice’s attention to the basis for said objection—are not preserved for consideration by this court on appeal.’” (quoting State v. Brown, 709 A.2d 465, 477 (R.I. 1998))).', 'Turning to the colloquy concerning defendant’s wife, we begin by recognizing that when defense counsel objected to the state’s inquiry about whether his wife gave a statement to police, the trial justice directed defendant to answer “yes or no.” However, defendant proceeded to give a substantive answer to which no objection was made. It was only after the fifth question was asked and answered that defendant offered an objection, which the trial justice sustained.', '“In the context of the examination of a witness at trial, ‘[w]e give considerable latitude to a trial justice’s rulings.’” State v. Mann, 889 A.2d 164, 166 (R.I. 2005) (quoting State v. Gomez, 848 A.2d 221, 237 (R.I. 2004)). We are not persuaded that the trial justice abused his discretion in declining to strike the testimony. “A defendant may be cross-examined not only on the basis of what he specifically states by way of factual information but also in respect to the inferences and conclusions that would naturally and probably be drawn from such testimony.” State v. Filuminia, 668 A.2d 336, 338 (R.I. 1995) (citing State v. McDowell, 620 A.2d 94 (R.I. 1993)). The defendant was questioned on direct examination about his home on Washington Street in Warwick; it was defendant’s contention on direct examination that he did not know whether Danielle had ever visited that house when his wife lived there alone.', 'When the state asked about an assault that occurred on Washington Street, defendant flatly declared that the incident “could [have] never happen[ed]” because “Danielle ha[d] never been in [that house].” The prosecutor then asked whether it was also Danielle’s testimony that defendant’s wife, Carol, was present. We are satisfied that this questioning was not a reference into defendant’s failure to', '-8- produce evidence, but that this inquiry had a bearing on defendant’s credibility. In State v. D’Alo, 435 A.2d 317, 320 (R.I. 1981), this Court declared that “[a]ny defendant in a criminal trial who testifies in his own behalf runs the risk of having his credibility impeached. By testifying, he places his own credibility in issue.”', 'A careful review of the cross-examination also reveals that it was defendant who volunteered information and argued with the prosecutor. As noted, when the trial justice directed defendant to answer “yes or no,” he did not do so. Also, when defendant was asked whether his wife gave a statement to police, defendant countered that it was the police who never contacted his wife, but that he had sent “the transcripts of the courthouse, of everything that was said.” He continued, stating that his wife “kn[e]w[] everything that [was] happening in * * * court.” When the prosecutor asked if his wife had contacted authorities after she received the transcript, defendant’s response was that no one had contacted her.', 'By volunteering these answers, defendant opened the door to further inquiry. See State v. Rosario, 14 A.3d 206, 217, 218 (R.I. 2011) (affirming the denial of a motion to pass and recognizing that “[the] defendant chose to do more than answer the question that had been asked” by answering “with an extremely broad and unqualified declaration,” thereby “open[ing] the door”).', 'Moreover, in order to eliminate any potential prejudice, the trial justice gave a comprehensive cautionary instruction to the jury. At the end of the state’s cross-examination of defendant, the trial justice instructed the jury as follows:', '“I want to go through with the jury something that I said at the', 'very beginning of the trial and I want to emphasize now and that’s', 'the issue of burden of proof. Certainly this jury can consider all of', 'the evidence and testimony before it by any of the witnesses in the', 'case itself, but the burden of proving the defendant guilty rests and', 'only rests with the State.', '“For example, there was certain testimony that the jury', '-9-', 'could consider about the defendant’s wife and the defendant’s son', 'and the jury can consider that. However, the burden of proof never', 'shifts. So, for example, the jury can’t say, well, why wasn’t', 'someone else called as a witness by the defendant because the', 'defendant has no obligation to put on any evidence. It’s the State’s', 'obligation to put on the evidence.', '“I will go through at the end as well, but I just wanted to', 'remind you it’s the State’s burden. Certainly, all the evidence that', 'you hear can be used for the jury to consider, the believability of', 'the witness, what to consider, what not to consider as fact. I just', 'wanted to make that point. I will be going through that in more', 'detail in the closing instructions. This comes up often in cases', 'where the defendant chooses to take the stand.” Defense counsel did not object to this instruction.', 'We are satisfied that this cautionary instruction was more than sufficient to cure any potential prejudice in these circumstances. Because we conclude that the trial justice did not commit error in denying the motion to strike, it goes without saying that the trial justice likewise did not err in denying the motion for a mistrial in relation to this questioning.', 'The defendant again moved for a mistrial after the prosecutor made the following comments during closing argument:', '“And I want to talk to you about his actions after that', 'because I asked him about, ‘Did you ask your son John to give a', 'statement to Detective Turcotte?’ And he said no. And [defense', 'attorney] said, [w]ell, his son wouldn’t have anything to add.', 'Danielle is claiming his son was there when he put the blanket over', 'her and his son. But he didn’t tell his son to go to the police. He’s', 'claiming that Danielle never went to that house on Washington', 'Street. His wife would know that, but he never asked her to give a', 'statement to the police and tell them, no, Danielle was never in that', 'house. He never did that. His actions are not the actions of an', 'innocent person. They’re the actions of somebody whose secret', 'finally caught up with him. He finally came face to face with it.” The Superior Court justice refused to pass the case, noting that defendant elected to testify in this case. He explained that he already gave a cautionary instruction concerning the burden of proof and informed the jury that closing arguments are not evidence; he additionally stated that he', '- 10 - would discuss the burden of proof as part of his customary instructions with some additional language.7', 'The defendant posits that the prosecutor’s remarks during closing argument, coupled with the testimony on cross-examination, amount to an improper reference to an “empty chair.” He directs our attention to State v. Taylor, 425 A.2d 1231 (R.I. 1981) and its progeny. In Taylor, we held that State v. Jefferson, 116 R.I. 124, 353 A.2d 190 (1976), “forbids prosecutorial comment on the failure of a defendant to present witnesses.” Taylor, 425 A.2d at 1234. Comments of this nature are considered inflammatory because they may suggest that the defendant has a burden to produce evidence or that “[the] defendant did not call the witnesses because he knew their testimony would be unfavorable.” Id. at 1234-35 (quoting Jefferson, 116 R.I. at 139, 353 A.2d at 199). It is well-settled that, although the state may make reference to the quality of a defendant’s evidence, it is impermissible to imply that a “defendant was required to offer evidence in his own defense.” State v. Williams, 656 A.2d 975, 980 (R.I. 1995).', 'However, this Court also has declared that potential prejudice from improper comments 7', 'The Superior Court justice instructed the jury as follows:', '“Always bear in mind that the defendant does not have to', 'prove or disprove anything, nor does a defendant have any', 'obligation to disprove that which the State asserts or claims. The', 'defendant has no obligation to call any witnesses, and you may not', 'speculate upon what another witness who did not testify may have', 'said during the course of the proceedings.', '“The burden of proof is on the State from the beginning to', 'the end of the trial. It never shifts. It is the State which has the', 'burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt to prove each and', 'every element of the offenses under your consideration.', '“* * *', '“As I instructed you at the beginning of the trial, a defendant is', 'under no obligation to prove anything or present evidence.”', '- 11 - by the prosecutor may be cured by a timely and adequate cautionary instruction:', '“[T]he cautionary instruction must (1) identify the prosecutor’s', 'conduct as improper[;] (2) unequivocally indicate that the jury', 'must disregard it[;] and (3) unequivocally indicate that since the', 'defendant has no duty to present witnesses or any other evidence,', 'his failure to do so cannot be construed as an admission that the', 'evidence, if produced, would have been adverse.” Taylor, 425', 'A.2d at 1235. Although the cautionary instruction given in this case did not meet the Taylor standard, we are satisfied that, in the context of this case, that precise instruction was unnecessary, because the prosecutor’s comments during closing argument did not rise to the level of an improper reference to an “empty chair.” It was defense counsel, during his final argument, who specifically called attention to the state’s cross-examination of defendant:', '“[The prosecutor] asked [defendant], ‘Did you tell your son', 'to give a statement to the police?’ First of all, since when is it', '[defendant’s] responsibility? Why didn’t Detective Turcotte call', '[defendant’s] wife? Why didn’t Detective Turcotte call', '[defendant’s] son? He was in charge of this investigation. He had', 'the obligation of interviewing witnesses.', 'That was his', 'responsibility. So why didn’t he do that? Is he interested in', 'finding the truth or is he interested in just getting a conviction?', 'The [s]tate has the burden of proving the case.', '“But what does [the prosecutor] think that [defendant’s]', 'son or wife would be able to help in this case; right? Because', 'remember these allegations are from a period of when she was six', 'years old to fifteen, for nine years. Does he think they would be', 'able to get on the stand and say, oh, no, [defendant] was never', 'alone with Danielle * * *, never. Never happened. There was', 'always someone in the room with him; right? Because anything', 'short of that testimony is not compelling. And even if they said', 'that, it’s not believable. Think about your relationships, where', 'you’ve been, cookouts, parties, you’ve gone to friends or relative’s', 'parties. There are children there. Can you ever know for certain', 'that you were never alone with a child at any of those events, any', 'cookouts, any picnics, any parties, anything, can you, over a period', 'of nine years?', '“So when the [s]tate says, ‘Why didn’t they call Detective', '- 12 -', 'Turcotte[,] he should have called them and f[ou]nd out if they had', 'any information that would either help the [s]tate or hurt the [s]tate', 'because they’re supposed to investigate. They’re supposed to be', 'neutral. They’re not supposed to make up their mind about the', 'charge until they thoroughly investigate the case and he did not', 'call them, he did not meet with them, and he didn’t go down to', 'Florida to interview them.” Clearly, defense counsel referenced the cross-examination of defendant and the failure of the police to contact defendant’s wife and son, which he characterized as the state’s failure to investigate. A prosecutor is permitted to respond to defense counsel’s remarks made during closing argument. See State v. Valenti, 772 A.2d 127, 131 (R.I. 2001) (assigning no error to the prosecutor’s response during his closing argument to statements made by defense counsel during his closing).', '“A prosecutor is given considerable latitude in closing argument, as long as the statements pertain only to the evidence presented and represent reasonable inferences from the record.” State v. Boillard, 789 A.2d 881, 885 (R.I. 2002). Here, the prosecutor’s comments dovetailed a summary of defendant’s actions after the initial disclosure and were not comments on defendant’s failure to produce evidence. See id. (“The probable effect of the prosecutorial statements on the outcome of the case must be evaluated by examining the remarks in the context in which they were made.” (citing State v. Brown, 522 A.2d 208, 211 (R.I. 1987))). In this case, the prosecutor’s remarks specifically relate to defendant’s performance on the witness stand and his interactions with his son and wife in the face of these disclosures.', 'The defendant draws our attention to cases of improper prosecutorial comment that are not similar to the case at bar. In Taylor, 425 A.2d at 1234, the prosecutor argued to the jury that “([t]he defendant) said his mother sent him money, his grandmother (sic). I didn’t see them come in to testify. He raised that issue. I didn’t see them come in here[.] * * * Yet, he cannot', '- 13 - produce, or he did not make any effort to show us this girl (sic) that he bought the car from in Tennessee.” Furthermore, in State v. White, 512 A.2d 1370, 1373 (R.I. 1986), the state, in responding to defense counsel’s argument, told the jury that the defendant had failed to present a variety of witnesses: “You didn’t hear from Carolyn Manfredi, that’s true. What do you know about her? Girl friend of this Defendant. What would you expect her to say? * * * You heard testimony about the LaFonds. What testimony did you hear? They were riding with this Defendant. They were friends of the Defendant.” In State v. Turner, 561 A.2d 869, 873 (R.I. 1989), the state argued, “Where is Mr. Saunders? Why didn’t we hear from Mr. Saunders? * * * That door has been open. The State doesn’t have a lock on that door[,]” and in State v. LaPointe, 525 A.2d 913, 914 (R.I. 1987), the state argued that “the defendant could have subpoenaed the doctor to testify.” These cases are clear examples of improper arguments by the state. We are satisfied that is not the case under review. Accordingly, we are of the opinion that the Superior Court justice did not err in denying the motion for a mistrial in relation to the prosecutor’s closing remarks. The record before us discloses that the jury was properly instructed on the burden of proof on multiple occasions by the court.', 'We caution, however, that comments of this nature may approach the line of improper prosecutorial conduct. In the case at bar, however, defendant elected to testify, placed his credibility in issue, and then volunteered information about his wife. It was defense counsel who discussed the state’s cross-examination of defendant during his closing remarks to the jury. These circumstances persuade us that, while coming close to the line of reversible error, the prosecutor did not cross it. However, we caution prosecutors to refrain from engaging in this type of conduct and to bear in mind that the state always bears the burden of proof in a criminal prosecution.', '- 14 -', 'Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence', 'The defendant assigns error to the trial justice’s decision to admit evidence that Danielle witnessed defendant assaulting another small child. Specifically, Danielle was permitted to testify that she saw defendant inappropriately touch Rosemary at the family cookout, on the same day that Danielle was first sexually assaulted by defendant. Defense counsel objected on the basis that this evidence was not relevant under Rule 402 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence8 and, if relevant, was inadmissible under Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence’s9 balancing test because Rosemary could not be located to corroborate the allegation. The state responded that it was offering the evidence under Rule 404(b), which allows for the admission of evidence in certain circumstances. Although defendant clearly anticipated this testimony, there was no pretrial motion in limine seeking to exclude this evidence.', 'We proceed to examine whether the Superior Court justice abused his discretion in admitting the testimony under Rule 404(b), or whether it should have been excluded in accordance with Rule 403. “When performing [an] abuse of discretion analysis in the context of Rule 404(b), this Court first looks to the scope of allowable proof under the rule.” Peltier, 116 A.3d at 153. “In reviewing a trial justice’s admission of Rule 404(b) evidence, this Court is ‘disinclined to perceive an abuse of discretion so long as the record contains some grounds for supporting the trial justice’s decision * * *.’” Clay, 79 A.3d at 838 (quoting State v. Ciresi, 45 A.3d 1201, 1211 (R.I. 2012)). Rule 404(a) excludes “[e]vidence of a person’s character or a trait 8', 'See Rule 402 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence (“All relevant evidence is admissible * * *.”). 9', 'See Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence (“Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.”).', '- 15 - of the person’s character * * * for the purpose of proving that he or she acted in conformity therewith on a particular occasion”; nor are “other crimes, wrongs, or acts * * * admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that the person acted in conformity therewith.” Rule 404(b). Such conduct, however, is admissible under Rule 404(b) for other purposes, such as proof of “motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake or accident, or to prove that [the] defendant feared imminent bodily harm and that the fear was reasonable.” Id. “[T]he list of admissible purposes contained within this rule provides ‘examples, rather than a complete enumeration, of permitted purposes.’” State v. Martinez, 59 A.3d 73, 85 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Ciresi, 45 A.3d at 1213).', 'In the context of sexual assault prosecutions, “evidence of a defendant’s prior sexual misconduct cannot be admitted to prove that ‘defendant is a bad man, and that he has a propensity toward sexual offenses and, therefore, probably committed the offenses with which he is charged.’” State v. Mohapatra, 880 A.2d 802, 806 (R.I. 2005) (quoting State v. Quattrocchi, 681 A.2d 879, 886 (R.I. 1996)). Nonetheless, prior sexual misconduct that is “nonremote” and “similar” to the crime on trial is admissible under Rule 404(b). See Mohapatra, 880 A.2d at 806. “Offenses will be considered sufficiently ‘nonremote’ and ‘similar’ when they are ‘closely related in time, place, age, family relationships of the victims, and the form of the sexual acts.’” Id. (quoting State v. Brigham, 638 A.2d 1043, 1045 (R.I. 1994)). In the case at bar, the similarity between the sexual acts of child molestation committed upon Danielle and allegedly upon Rosemary is striking to say the least. The assaults occurred on the same day and at the same party; Danielle and Rosemary were around the same age; they lived in the same building as defendant; and the form of the sexual acts likewise was the same—defendant placed his hand in the bathing suit bottom of both girls. We can conceive of few instances in which two sexual', '- 16 - assaults could be closer in time and manner.', 'However, such evidence is only admissible in “proving the charge lodged against the defendant” and when “reasonably necessary.” Mohapatra, 880 A.2d at 806 (quoting State v. Jalette, 119 R.I. 614, 627, 382 A.2d 526, 533 (1978)). In Mohapatra, we held that similar incidents of sexual assault are relevant to proving that the defendant committed the act “with the purpose of ‘sexual arousal, gratification, or assault.’” Id. at 808 (quoting § 11-37-1(7)). Therefore, defendant’s contemporaneous assault of Rosemary can serve as proof of a pattern of behavior.', 'We likewise recognized in Mohapatra that prior incidents of sexual assault are reasonably necessary to the state’s case when the victim’s credibility is placed at issue. Id. We are cognizant that this is a case in which the evidence revealed a crime committed in private with a significant lapse of time between the sexual assaults and the prosecution. The credibility of the complainant was placed at center stage. We therefore are persuaded that this evidence meets the test of relevancy and necessity to the state’s case. It is not cumulative.', 'The defendant’s attempt to distinguish these principles by homing in on Rosemary’s unavailability as a witness is unavailing. It is defendant’s contention that, by presenting this self- serving testimony that could not be verified because Rosemary, despite diligent efforts, could not be located, the state was able to corroborate Danielle’s testimony.', 'Although defendant acknowledges that certain prior incidents of sexual assault are reasonably necessary when the state’s case rests on credibility, he argues that in this context Danielle, in effect, corroborated her own testimony. This contention is incorrect. Our rules do not limit evidence of prior misconduct to testimony by the victim of that conduct, and we decline to make such a pronouncement. Danielle offered testimony about her own observations. Under Rule 602 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, “[a] witness’s testimony is inadmissible * * * only if the trial justice finds', '- 17 - that the witness could not have actually perceived or observed that to which he or she purports to testify.” State v. Grant, 840 A.2d 541, 546 (R.I. 2004) (quoting State v.

Ranieri, 586 A.2d 1094, 1098 (R.I. 1991). According to Danielle, she witnessed this assault first-hand.', 'She therefore testified from personal knowledge about her observations that fateful day, and she was subject to cross- examination, the unavailability of Rosemary notwithstanding.', 'We pause to note however, that the Superior Court justice did not engage in a Rule 403 balancing test to determine the probative value of this evidence, nor was he pressed to do so by counsel after the state submitted that the evidence was offered under Rule 404(b). Nonetheless, the Superior Court justice should have undertaken a Rule 403 analysis when deciding to admit the evidence. See State v. Cook, 45 A.3d 1272, 1280 (R.I. 2012) (reaffirming that Rule 403 is inherent in a Rule 404(b) analysis, but holding that a trial justice does not have to engage in a Rule 403 analysis, if an objection is not made). We deem this error harmless because the evidence was correctly admitted, and its probative value outweighed any potential prejudice.', '“A Rule 403 analysis requires the trial justice to not only examine the evidence in the context of the case on trial, but to balance the evidence to determine whether its probative force ‘is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, * * *.’” State v. Patel, 949 A.2d 401, 413 (R.I. 2008) (quoting Rule 403). We are not convinced that this testimony was unfairly prejudicial to defendant under Rule 403. See State v. Gaspar, 982 A.2d 140, 148-49 n.12 (R.I. 2009) (“[B]ecause most evidence offered at trial is inherently prejudicial, [o]nly unfairly prejudicial evidence is barred under Rule 403 * * *[.]” (quoting 29 Am. Jur. 2d Evidence § 338 at 360 (2008))). As noted, Danielle’s credibility was at issue throughout the entire trial. She', '- 18 - testified that she had personal knowledge of the alleged sexual assault upon Rosemary. See Mohapatra, 880 A.2d at 808 (“When charges of sexual abuse hinge upon a credibility contest between [a] defendant and * * * complainant, relevant evidence of prior sexual misconduct is reasonably necessary to support the complainant’s testimony.”). The jury was well aware that Rosemary could not be located and that this allegation was unsupported by any other evidence. Before this Court, defendant paints Rosemary as “a little girl who was never seen, never heard, but whose presence haunted the proceedings from beginning to end.” Although defendant contends that the state improperly gave reference to an “empty chair,” it is actually the defense that did so explicitly by arguing that “[w]ithout Rosemary testifying I would submit [the state] cannot prove [its] case beyond a reasonable doubt.”', 'Finally, the trial justice gave the following timely cautionary instruction:', '“And I just want to make clear to the jury there was', 'testimony that the Court allowed in about the incident that the', 'witness just described when she was leaving the bathroom and was', 'going in the bedroom. I just want the jury to understand that you', 'cannot consider that evidence of these acts to show that the', 'defendant, if you get that far, has a propensity to commit the crime', 'for which he is currently charged at this point. It is admissible for', 'other purposes for the jury to consider such as motive, opportunity,', 'intent and I’ll be going into that. But the jury can’t say, for', 'example, well, because he did such and such, he had a propensity', 'to do other things.” We are satisfied that this cautionary instruction served to eliminate any unfair prejudice that defendant may have faced from this testimony. See State v. Mitchell, 80 A.3d 19, 29, 30 (R.I. 2013) (determining that “trial justice fulfilled his obligation to give a sua sponte instruction on the Rule 404(b) evidence” and did not abuse his discretion in admitting “evidence of [the] defendant’s other sexual misconduct”); State v. Garcia, 743 A.2d 1038, 1052 (R.I. 2000) (noting that “in sexual assault cases * * * a trial justice is required to issue a cautionary instruction to the', '- 19 - jury regarding the limited use of Rule 404(b) evidence”).', 'Motion for Judgment of Acquittal', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal on counts 4 and 5 of the indictment because Danielle did not testify that defendant touched her vagina in relation to those counts. Counts 4 and 5 were charged under § 11-37-8.3, which prohibits sexual contact with a person under the age of fourteen. “Sexual contact” is defined as “the intentional touching of the victim’s or accused’s intimate parts.” Section 11-37- 1(7). “Intimate parts” is defined as “genital or anal areas, groin, inner thigh, or buttock of any person or the breast of a female.” Section 11-37-1(3). We are mindful that, in passing on a motion for judgment of acquittal, the trial justice is compelled to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the state and draw every reasonable inference consistent with guilt. See State v. Grantley, 149 A.3d 124, 131 (R.I. 2016).', 'Although Danielle did not explicitly offer testimony that defendant’s hand touched her vagina in describing every occasion of sexual assault, she clearly testified that defendant placed his hand in her bathing suit and “began touching [her] in [her] vaginal area in a circular motion.” When recounting the subsequent occasions of sexual abuse, Danielle testified that defendant placed his hand in her underwear and “began doing the same thing as the other times.” This later reference to defendant’s conduct during an earlier assault—that he touched her vaginal area in a circular motion—satisfies the requirement that Danielle’s testimony was precise and specific. See In re B.H., 138 A.3d 774, 782 (R.I. 2016) (affirming that “‘precise and specific testimony is necessary to support’ a prosecution for first-degree sexual assault or first-degree child molestation” (quoting State v.

See Brown, 709 A.2d at 481 (“Just as a reviewing court should not pick out one isolated statement from a slew of jury instructions without considering all the jury instructions as a whole, * * * so too should it not pick one isolated statement in a witness’s testimony out of context from the whole of it.” (citing State v. Peguero, 652 A.2d 972, 974 (R.I. 1995))). Because we are of the opinion that a reasonable jury could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on these charges, we conclude that the Superior Court justice properly denied the defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal on counts 4 and 5.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm the judgments of conviction.

This appeal came before the Supreme Court on February 10, 2017, and requires the Court to determine whether the law of contracts or the law of trusts governs the resolution of this dispute. An allegedly underfunded trust that was created by the decedent, Donelson C. Glassie, Jr. (Donelson), for the benefit of his daughter, the late Jacquelin Caffrey Glassie (Jacquelin),1 in accordance with a property settlement agreement between her divorcing parents, Donelson and Jacquelin’s mother, Marcia Sallum Glassie (Marcia), is the genesis of this dispute.', 'The plaintiff, Alison E. Glassie (plaintiff or Alison), Executrix of the Estate of Jacquelin Caffrey Glassie, appeals from a grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant, Paul Doucette, in his capacity as Executor of the Estate of Donelson C. Glassie, Jr. (defendant) on plaintiff’s breach of contract claim. The Superior Court justice applied the law of trusts and declared that plaintiff lacked standing to sue the estate because, except in limited circumstances, only a trustee may institute an action on behalf of the beneficiaries of a trust. Before this Court, 1', 'Jacquelin unexpectedly passed away on November 15, 2012, while this case was pending in Superior Court.', '-1- plaintiff argues that the trust created for Jacquelin’s benefit is not the basis of this suit and that her standing to sue arises from her status as a third-party beneficiary to the property settlement agreement entered into by her divorcing parents. For the reasons discussed herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'This case is but one chapter2 in what is a complicated, multistate continuing saga over the decedent’s estate, arising in the context of a legacy of wealth. On February 14, 1986, Donelson and Marcia were married; they had three children, Alison, Georgia, and the youngest, Jacquelin, the subject of this dispute. Prior to Jacquelin’s birth, Donelson’s mother, Sara Madison Eccles, created two trusts, with a principal of $100,000 each, for the benefit of Jacquelin’s older sisters, Alison and Georgia. Donelson and Marcia eventually ended their marriage and entered into a property settlement agreement on July 1, 1993. Article SEVENTEENTH provided as follows:', '“Whereas there is presently in existence two Trusts for the', 'benefit of the minor child, Alison and the minor child, Georgia.', 'Said Trusts are in the principal amount of $100,000. Therefore,', 'the Husband agrees to create a similar trust within 45 days for the', 'minor child, Jacquelin. He shall pay into said Trust the sum of', '$10,000 each and every year until said Trust is equal to the amount', 'of the Trusts for Alison and Georgia. Said Trust shall be used to', 'pay for the college and higher education of the minor child,', 'Jacquelin.”', 'On August 11, 1993, Donelson established the Jacquelin Caffrey Glassie Trust II (the Trust). Section 3.1 of the Trust states that the declared purpose of the Trust was “to provide benefits for the primary beneficiary through a trust providing benefits substantially similar to 2', 'A related case concerning Donelson’s estate is additionally pending before us. The defendant has appealed a grant of summary judgment entered in favor of Jacquelin’s mother, declaring that Marcia was entitled to additional monies under Donelson’s Last Will and Testament, in accordance with the property settlement agreement. Glassie v. Doucette, No. 2015-276-A., No. 2015-277-A.', '-2- those provided for Alison Glassie and Georgia Glassie by trusts created by Trustor’s mother, Sara Madison Eccles, on August 30, 1989 * * *.” Section 2.7 of the Trust indicates that the Trust would terminate “upon the death of the primary beneficiary.” In the event that Jacquelin, the primary beneficiary, failed to exercise a power of appointment, the Trust was to be distributed in equal shares to Jacquelin’s living issue, or in the case of no living issue, in equal shares to Donelson’s living issue, “with the Trustee of any trust created by Trustor’s mother * * * for the benefit of such issue similar to this trust receiving the share for such issue * * *.” Id. at 2.7(b). Notably missing from the Trust language is any provision that indicates that the Trust was created pursuant to the property settlement agreement, or that Donelson was required to contribute $10,000 a year until the Trust was “equal to the amount of the Trusts for Alison and Georgia.” The record discloses that Donelson conveyed property to the trustee of the Trust, First Security Bank of Utah, National Association,3 in accordance with Schedule A, a document which has not been produced. According to an affidavit of the Executor, Donelson made two cash contributions of $10,000, and all other contributions were transfers of equity securities.', 'On February 3, 2011, Donelson died. According to the Executor, Donelson had contributed $123,336.82 to the Trust at the time of his death, resulting in a market value of $175,425.70. Jacquelin filed a claim against her father’s estate, alleging that her father breached the property settlement agreement by failing to fund the Trust until it was equivalent to that of her sisters. After the Executor denied Jacquelin’s claim, she filed a petition for a determination of disallowed claim in the Newport Probate Court. On June 15, 2012, the Probate Court, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 33-11-16,4 ruled that Jacquelin’s claim should be decided by the 3', 'Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.

Jacquelin alleged breach of contract in that “[Donelson] failed to carry out [the] provisions of the property settlement agreement.” She also averred that, had the Executor allowed her claim to fund the Trust in accordance with Donelson’s obligations, the Trust would have had a value of approximately $1,600,000.', 'On November 15, 2012, almost five months after the complaint was filed, Jacquelin unexpectedly passed away. Alison, the eldest Glassie sister, was appointed Executrix of Jacquelin’s estate and was substituted as plaintiff in this action.5 On April 29, 2013, defendant moved for summary judgment, arguing that plaintiff lacked the requisite standing to sue because generally only the trustee has capacity to file suit on behalf of the beneficiaries of a trust and that plaintiff’s claim was not cognizable since the Trust had terminated on Jacquelin’s death. The plaintiff filed a cross-motion for summary judgment and raised a new argument, contending that she was not suing on behalf of the Trust, but as a third-party beneficiary to the property settlement agreement. On December 2, 2013, after hearing, summary judgment was granted in favor of defendant on the basis that the right to bring the claim rested with the Trustee. Immediately following this pronouncement, plaintiff requested that summary judgment be', '“[I]f the probate court in its sole discretion finds that pleading,', 'discovery and trial of the issues presented would be more', 'efficiently presented in the * * * superior court * * *, the', 'disallowance shall be affirmed by order of the probate court and', 'the claimant shall bring civil action on the disallowed claim', 'pursuant to § 33-11-48 * * *.” 5', 'Because Jacquelin did not execute a power of appointment for the Trust, pursuant to Section 2.7(b), Donelson’s children are entitled to equal shares of the Trust assets. The Trustee filed a petition for interpretation of trusts and authorization to distribute trust assets in Utah, contending that Section 2.7(b) of the Trust did not limit the distribution of assets to Jacquelin’s sisters. Alison and Georgia filed a counterclaim for, inter alia, a declaratory judgment that Section 2.7(b) required that the Trust assets solely be distributed to the two trusts established for their benefit.

The plaintiff contends that her claims are governed by the law of contracts, specifically the principles relating to third-party beneficiaries. She argues that, because she was the intended third-party beneficiary under the property settlement agreement between her parents, she has standing to maintain this action. At a minimum, she contends, a genuine issue of material fact remains as to whether Jacquelin or the Trustee was the third-party beneficiary under what she characterizes as the ambiguous language of the property settlement agreement. The plaintiff also argues that Jacquelin’s death did not affect the viability of this action because Jacquelin’s right to redress survived her death.8', 'The defendant, on the other hand, posits that the law of trusts governs this action. Specifically, he maintains that, except in limited, unrelated circumstances, only a trustee is vested with standing to sue on behalf of trust beneficiaries.

Vindalu, LLC, 962 A.2d 740, 745- 46 (R.I. 2009) (“This Court has long upheld ‘the right of a third person to enforce a promise made by one person to another for the benefit of said third person, although the consideration does not move from such third person and although he was not cognizant of the promise when it was made.’” (quoting Blake v. Atlantic National Bank, 33 R.I. 464, 467, 82 A. 225, 226 (1912))). In order to prevail on a contract claim as a third-party beneficiary, the claimant must prove that he or she is an intended beneficiary of the contract. See Cathay Cathay, Inc., 962 A.2d at 745; see also Davis, 576 A.2d at 1242 (“If the third party is an intended beneficiary, the law implies privity of contract.”).

We declared that “there is no question that an intended third- party beneficiary, in this case the children, may sue on a contract made for his or her benefit.” Id. at 635 (citing Davis, 576 A.2d at 1242; Elliott Leases Cars, Inc. v. Quigley, 118 R.I. 321, 330, 373 A.2d 810, 814 (1977)). Other jurisdictions also recognize that children who receive property under a property settlement agreement are third-party beneficiaries with standing to enforce the terms of the contract. See, e.g., Flanigan v. Munson, 818 A.2d 1275, 1280 (N.J. 2003) (“The law also is well settled that children of a marriage are third-party beneficiaries of a settlement agreement between their parents. * * * Based on the foregoing principles, we have no doubt that [the children] are beneficiaries of the property settlement agreement between their biological parents.

Fisher, 894 P.2d 118, 123 (Idaho 1995).', 'Nevertheless, in the circumstances of this case, the record is clear that the property settlement agreement required Donelson to create a trust for Jacquelin’s benefit and,', '-8- indisputably, he did so. Jacquelin’s estate is before the Court challenging the amount of contributions made by her father and the manner in which the Trust was funded. The defendant argues that, once the Trust was created, Donelson’s obligations to Jacquelin as a third-party beneficiary were fulfilled. In fact, defendant concedes that, if Donelson did not create the Trust as obliged, “[c]onceivably, Jacquelin * * * could have sought enforcement of the promise as [a] third-party beneficiary of the [property settlement agreement].”', 'The defendant directs our attention to Restatement (Second) Contracts § 302 at cmt. f., illustration 20 (1981), “Trust and agency,” which presents a complicated fact pattern that also could appear on a law school exam:', '“A, an insurance company, promises B in a policy of', 'insurance to pay $10,000 on B’s death to C as trustee for B’s wife', 'D. C is an intended beneficiary and may enforce his rights as', 'trustee; D’s rights as beneficiary of the trust and the contract are', 'enforceable only in the manner in which rights of other trust', 'beneficiaries are enforced.”9 Importantly, cmt. f. at § 302 expounds: “[A]lthough the beneficiary of such a trust is a beneficiary of the promise [under the contract], his rights must be enforced in accordance with the law of [t]rusts.” The plaintiff argues that the law of contracts applies in this case because the Trust was not in existence at the time her parents executed the property settlement agreement. We disagree.10', 'It is undisputed that the Trust was in fact created by Donelson, for Jacquelin’s benefit, as required by the property settlement agreement. That benefit that was intended by the parties to the property settlement agreement was thereby achieved.', 'The plaintiff’s complaint is that 9', 'In the instant case, Donelson would be A; Marcia would be B; the yet-to-be formed Trust would be C; and Jacquelin would be D. 10', 'We note that it was represented by counsel at oral argument that the Trust provisions closely mirror those set forth in the trusts for Alison and Georgia, including common trustees, and that the trusts were drafted by the same attorney, who was provided with a copy of the property settlement agreement.', '-9- Donelson nonetheless was in breach because he failed to adequately fund the Trust: “[Donelson] shall pay into said Trust the sum of $10,000 each and every year until said Trust is equal to the amount of the Trusts for Alison and Georgia.” However, this clause relates to Jacquelin’s status as a beneficiary of the Trust and not as a third-party beneficiary of the property settlement agreement. Whether the Trust was in existence when the property settlement agreement was executed has no bearing on this analysis. Similar to the trust beneficiary in the above-noted fact pattern, Jacquelin is attempting to enforce a provision that requires funds to be contributed to a trust created for her benefit. Jacquelin’s status is not that of a third-party beneficiary, but that of a “beneficiary,” in the colloquial sense of the word, based on her status as the sole beneficiary of the Trust. Cf. Saks v. Damon Raike and Co., 8 Cal. Rptr. 2d 869, 877 (Cal. Ct. App. 1992) (holding that “trust beneficiaries [have no authority] to maintain an action as third party beneficiaries of contracts between the trustee and agents of the trustee concerning the internal affairs of the trust”).', 'We also note that cmt. f. emphasizes the intent of the promisor and promisee when determining the relationships that arise when a trust is contemplated. A trust is recognized as a legal “entity.” See Restatement (Third) Trusts § 2, cmt. a. (2003) (“[M]odern common-law and statutory concepts and terminology tacitly recognize the trust as a legal ‘entity,’ consisting of the trust estate and the associated fiduciary relation between the trustee and the beneficiaries.”). Upholding this distinction is important when distinguishing between persons acting in their individual and representative capacities. See id. A settlor may opt to create a trust for a variety of beneficial reasons. We decline the invitation to blur the distinction between gifting to a beneficiary directly and doing so through a trust instrument.', '- 10 -', 'Lastly, the Restatement (Third) Trusts § 107(1) (2012) provides that “[a] trustee may maintain a proceeding against a third party on behalf of the trust and its beneficiaries.” Critically, a trust beneficiary may maintain a proceeding in limited circumstances when: “(a) the beneficiary is in possession, or entitled to immediate distribution, of the trust property involved; or (b) the trustee is unable, unavailable, unsuitable, or improperly failing to protect the beneficiary’s interest.” Section 107(2). Comment b. to § 107 reiterates this principle:', '“As holder of the title to trust property * * * and as the', 'representative of the trust and its beneficiaries, the trustee is', 'normally the appropriate person to bring * * * an action against a', 'third party on behalf of the trust. * * * [A] beneficiary has no', 'standing to sue a third party on behalf of the trust.” This principle is consistent with the basic concept that the beneficiaries of a trust instrument hold equitable title, while the trustee generally holds legal title. Whenever third-party liability is alleged, § 107 of the Restatement controls. “Third-party liability may arise not only from trust law * * * but also from other bodies of law * * *.” Section 107, cmt. a. Therefore, whether the cause of action arises from trust law or, as in this case, from a contract dispute, standing to sue is controlled by the law of trusts.11', 'Because we are of the opinion that a trustee is the appropriate party to bring suit against third parties on behalf of trust beneficiaries, we conclude that plaintiff does not have standing to maintain this cause of action.

This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On November 29, 2011, defendant was charged by criminal information with five counts of embezzlement in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-41-3 1 and one count of conspiracy to commit 1', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-41-3 states, in pertinent part, that:', '-1- embezzlement in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-1-6. 2 The criminal information alleged that, between June 1, 2007, and December 31, 2008, defendant colluded with Kimberly Gostomski to embezzle funds totaling $166,303. 3 These funds were entrusted to defendant in his capacity as a real estate attorney; Gostomski worked as defendant’s paralegal. 4 A jury trial was held in January 2014. The evidence adduced at trial may be summarized as follows.', 'Martin Aguilar was the first witness to testify. Aguilar testified that, on July 24, 2008, he purchased real estate in Coventry from E.M.C. Mortgage Group (E.M.C. Mortgage) for $140,000, which he financed through Sun Trust Mortgage, Inc. (Sun Trust Mortgage).

She later pled nolo contendere to all of these charges.', '-2- defendant was the settlement agent for the transaction, and on July 24, 2008, Sun Trust Mortgage wired $126,215.97 to defendant’s IOLTA account 5 to be disbursed to E.M.C. Mortgage after the closing. Aguilar ostensibly purchased title insurance from defendant underwritten by Mortgage Guarantee & Title Insurance Company (Mortgage Guarantee & Title). Aguilar stated that, at the closing, defendant gave him a commitment for title insurance, which defendant had signed, and a closing protection letter, which insured Sun Trust Mortgage against loss arising out of “[f]raud or dishonesty of the * * * [a]pproved [a]ttorney in handling [its] funds.” E.M.C. Mortgage never received the sales proceeds from defendant. Aguilar testified that, approximately one month after the closing, E.M.C. Mortgage’s attorney notified him that defendant had never disbursed any funds. Aguilar further testified that he met with Chief Disciplinary Counsel David Curtin and also filed an insurance claim with Mortgage Guarantee & Title. According to Aguilar, however, Mortgage Guarantee & Title informed him that his title insurance policy was “null and void.”', 'Next, the jury heard testimony from Joseph Tavarozzi. Tavarozzi explained that, in February 2008, he refinanced two existing mortgage loans on his real estate located in Warwick through IndyMac Bank (IndyMac). The defendant was the settlement agent for the refinancing transaction; and, on February 29, 2008, IndyMac wired $147,862.27 to defendant’s IOLTA account. The defendant was expected to disburse a total of $137,916.13 to Countrywide Home Loans (Countrywide) on February 29—$101,691.35 to pay off Tavarozzi’s first Countrywide loan and $36,224.78 to pay off Tavarozzi’s second Countrywide loan. Tavarozzi also purchased title insurance from defendant underwritten by Mortgage Guarantee & Title. Tavarozzi attested 5', 'Article V, Rule 1.15(f) of the Supreme Court Rules of Professional Conduct requires an attorney to deposit client or third-party funds into an interest-bearing trust account, the interest proceeds of which are payable to the Rhode Island Bar Foundation. These accounts are referred to as Interest on Lawyers’ Trust Accounts or “IOLTA” accounts.', '-3- that, at the time of the closing, he was three months ahead on his mortgage payments to Countrywide.', 'According to Tavarozzi, approximately four months after the closing, Countrywide notified him that his mortgages had not been paid. Tavarozzi testified that, upon receiving this notification from Countrywide, he attempted to contact defendant, but was never able to reach him. Instead, he spoke to Gostomski about the unpaid loans. Tavarozzi attested that, in June 2008, Gostomski called him to inform him that the first loan had been paid. Tavarozzi further testified that he received another call from Countrywide in August 2008 notifying him that the second loan for $36,224.78 was still outstanding. Tavarozzi explained that he again attempted to contact defendant, and, unable to reach either defendant or Gostomski, contacted Mortgage Guarantee & Title to file a claim under his title insurance policy. Tavarozzi attested that Mortgage Guarantee & Title paid Countrywide the outstanding balance on his second loan. The defendant never paid Countrywide the $36,224.78 on Tavarozzi’s second loan.', 'The jury also heard testimony from Michele Green, Senior Corporate Underwriter and Vice President of First American Title Insurance Company—formerly known as Mortgage Guarantee & Title. Green testified that defendant was an agent with Mortgage Guarantee & Title from January 2007 through May 2008. On May 9, 2008, however, Mortgage Guarantee & Title terminated its agency agreement with defendant because, as it explained in its correspondence to defendant, he failed to complete an “escrow review.” According to Green, an escrow review monitors for agent fraud and includes examining attorneys’ IOLTA accounts, real estate closing documents, and cross-referencing policies issued with premiums collected. Green testified that, upon defendant’s termination from Mortgage Guarantee & Title, the company promptly blocked defendant’s access to its computer systems and notified all lenders to which it had issued closing protection letters, and whose transactions were still pending with defendant, that it was revoking', '-4- the closing protection letters because defendant was no longer an active agent.', 'Green further recalled that, in August 2008, Tavarozzi contacted her to file a claim under his title insurance policy. According to Green, on Friday, August 29, she attempted to contact defendant about Tavarozzi and left defendant a voice mail saying, “We have somebody in our office who is making extremely serious allegations about a closing that you conducted. This is very[,] very serious. I need to speak to you right away. Please call me or e-mail me.” In response, defendant emailed Green, notifying her that he was on his way to his office to “get [her] the information A.S.A.P.”', 'Green testified, though, that she did not hear back from defendant until Tuesday, September 2, despite “dozens” of attempts to contact him over the holiday weekend. At 9:47 a.m. on September 2, defendant sent Green an email reading, in part, “The loan was not paid off. First thing this morning I requested an up-to-date payoff and will be wiring out the funds as soon as I receive it [sic] * * *.” The subject line read “15 Chelmsford Avenue Warwick”—Tavarozzi’s address.', 'According to Green, however, she had never disclosed to defendant which client she was contacting him about.', 'On Wednesday, September 3, defendant sent Green and her supervisor an email informing them that, prior to Green’s contact on August 29, 2008, he was not aware that Tavarozzi’s first loan had been paid late and that the second loan had not been paid at all. In the email, defendant acknowledged that Gostomski was informed of this and that she had “numerous phone conversations” with Tavarozzi. In the email, defendant also wrote that he “ordered the payoff [on] the second mortgage [and that it would] be paid today or tomorrow” and that he had “taken steps to ensure that this [did] not happen again.” Green replied by sending defendant a fax questioning his version of events, writing in part:', '“The series of events you describe [do] not make a lot of sense, or', 'stand up to scrutiny. Your recitation of events seems to suggest', '-5-', 'that your paralegal Kim either misappropriated the funds from this', 'closing or, for some unknown reason, failed to make the', 'disbursements even when numerous calls from the client were', 'made. She further, according to you, failed to notify you of any of', 'these events.', '“It is my understanding that, despite her having committed these', 'grievous errors in judgment, she is still in your employ.', '“In any scenario of events, had no misappropriation taken place,', 'your client account would have had nearly $138,000 in it for 5-6', 'months that you would have no accounting for. How would that', 'have escaped your notice?', '“In any event, since you have chosen to ignore our numerous', 'phone calls of this morning seeking an explanation of these', 'discrepancies, or proof that these funds have indeed been in your', 'client account for these entire six months, you can expect to be', 'required to deliver such explanations and proof to Rhode Island', 'Disciplinary Counsel and the Rhode Island State Police, both of', 'whom have now been notified.”', 'Green testified that defendant never responded to her fax. Green further testified that she knew defendant had not paid off Tavarozzi’s second loan with Countrywide. Green attested that, with respect to Tavarozzi’s insurance claim, Mortgage Guarantee & Title paid off his second Countrywide loan.', 'Green also attested that Mortgage Guarantee & Title received a title insurance claim from Aguilar alleging that defendant never disbursed the sales proceeds after Aguilar’s closing. Green testified, however, that Mortgage Guarantee & Title had never issued a title insurance policy to Aguilar and that the closing protection letter and title insurance commitment defendant gave to Aguilar were forged.', 'Next, the jury heard testimony from defendant’s alleged co-conspirator, Gostomski. Gostomski explained that she met defendant while she was working for another real estate attorney and that, after leaving that attorney’s office, she remained in contact with defendant. Gostomski testified that, in or around January 2007, Gostomski and defendant began a romantic', '-6- relationship. Gostomski further attested that, by that time, defendant had opened his own real estate law office and, in March or April of that year, she began working for him. Gostomski testified that she was defendant’s only employee, and that her position included preparing all pre-and-post-closing documents for the office’s real estate transactions. Gostomski attested that, at some point during the course of her employment, she began doing “some,” but not “all,” of the bookkeeping. According to Gostomski, although she was not listed as a signatory on either defendant’s IOLTA or business-operating account, she, with defendant’s permission, issued and signed checks from both of these accounts. Gostomski testified that she did not have the ability to access defendant’s accounts online, but that defendant monitored both accounts’ activities regularly. She recounted that she “would come in usually in the morning and that was usually up on the computer[;] what the balances were, what transactions had transpired in both accounts * * *.” Gostomski also testified that defendant had what she believed to be the business- operating account’s only ATM card.', 'According to Gostomski, in February and March 2008, the office began to unravel, meaning that “a lot of things got overlooked” and “were not being handled correctly.” At this time, she explained that defendant’s business-operating account was frequently overdrawn, and, on occasion, she had transferred unearned legal fees from defendant’s IOLTA account to his business-operating account. Gostomski testified that, even as the number of real estate closings continued to decrease, defendant never changed his spending habits. Gostomski attested that, when the business-operating account balance was really low, defendant would ask her “[w]hat do we have in the pipeline?”', 'Gostomski further testified about defendant’s working relationship with Mortgage Guarantee & Title. Gostomski testified that, during Mortgage Guarantee & Title’s repeated', '-7- attempts to audit defendant, defendant instructed her to withhold certain IOLTA account statements. According to Gostomski, during this time, defendant considered becoming an agent with another title insurance company, but did not pursue the matter any further after the company requested to review defendant’s IOLTA account statements. Gostomski testified that defendant “kept saying that [they] needed to open a new IOLTA account and start fresh so that there was [sic] no discrepancies.” She further attested that defendant would intentionally avoid Mortgage Guarantee & Title’s representative saying, “[H]ere comes [a representative] from Mortgage Guarantee. I’m going to go out the back door * * *.” Gostomski also testified that she believed that she saw the cancellation notice from Mortgage Guarantee & Title on defendant’s desk.', 'Gostomski also testified about the Aguilar closing. According to Gostomski, because Mortgage Guarantee & Title terminated defendant as an agent, she prepared the closing protection letter for Aguilar’s closing by copying and pasting the letter together from previously authorized letters because defendant told her that “all closings had to close.” Gostomski also testified that defendant gave Aguilar the forged closing protection letter.', 'According to Gostomski, defendant withdrew his legal fee for the Aguilar closing thirteen days before the closing date because defendant needed money. Moreover, Gostomski also testified regarding Tavarozzi’s refinancing transaction. Gostomski stated that, on July 31, 2008, after Tavarozzi contacted her, she initiated a wire transfer to pay off Tavarozzi’s first Countrywide loan— approximately five months after the closing in February 2008. She explained that funds from real estate closings are typically, in the case of a sale, disbursed immediately after the closing and, in the case of a refinance, disbursed three days after the closing. Gostomski testified that, after Mortgage Guarantee & Title contacted defendant about Tavarozzi, “[i]t did [not] seem like [defendant] took it as serious as [she] did” because he left the office that day as usual.', '-8- Gostomski also acknowledged that she had a criminal record and that defendant learned about this in December 2007. 6', 'Lori Tellier, a certified public accountant, certified fraud examiner, and civilian investigator in the state police’s financial crimes unit, was the final witness to testify. As part of the state police’s investigation into the allegations against defendant, Tellier conducted a forensic audit of defendant’s IOLTA and business-operating accounts. Tellier testified that this audit revealed that defendant, in fact, on several occasions did not disburse funds to the proper payees, despite having received sufficient funds from each lender prior to each transaction. Tellier further testified that defendant made improper disbursements from his IOLTA account. According to Tellier, total outflows from defendant’s IOLTA account to defendant, between January 2007 and September 2008, totaled approximately $496,000. Tellier attested that, out of the $496,000 withdrawn from defendant’s IOLTA account, only $386,678.35 was legal fees earned by defendant. Tellier testified that her analysis revealed a pattern wherein transfers, including online transfers, were made from defendant’s IOLTA account to his business-operating account to prevent the operating account from being overdrawn.', 'Tellier determined that approximately $168,000 entrusted to defendant was not remitted to the proper payees. Tellier testified that defendant spent this missing client money on personal expenses. She explained that defendant made over $87,000 in ATM withdrawals from his business-operating account. Tellier further explained that, from his business-operating account, defendant used the missing client money to pay the following estimated personal expenses: 6', 'On direct examination, Gostomski acknowledged that, in 1995, she pled nolo contendere to embezzlement and was sentenced to an eight-year suspended term of incarceration with probation. Further, in 1998, she pled nolo contendere to the fraudulent use of credit cards and was sentenced to a three-year term, with two years to serve in home confinement and the remainder to serve on probation. And, in 2001 and 2002, she pled nolo contendere to the fraudulent use of checks and was sentenced to a one-year suspended term of incarceration and one-year probation.', '-9- $30,000 in mortgage payments; $13,000 in car payments; $6,700 in grocery purchases; $8,600 in clothing purchases; $14,000 in household purchases; $9,600 in entertainment purchases; $1,800 in restaurant charges; $2,800 in furniture purchases; and $11,000 to Gostomski in addition to her weekly payroll. Tellier also testified about a $5,000 internet transfer from defendant’s IOLTA to his business-operating account that, according to the state, coincided with his vacation to Pennsylvania.', 'Additionally, the parties stipulated to the following facts. On June 21, 2007, defendant was the settlement agent in a real estate transaction involving Frank Hennessey and Normand LeClair. Hennessey and LeClair, as Trustees of the Hennessey/LeClair Trust, sold real estate located in Exeter for $35,000, and, on June 21, the sales proceeds were deposited into defendant’s IOLTA account. Because Hennessey and LeClair were not Rhode Island residents at the time of the sale, defendant was required to withhold a total of $2,100 to pay the nonresident real-estate-sales tax due to the Rhode Island Division of Taxation. The defendant never made any payments to the Division of Taxation to satisfy Hennesey and LeClair’s tax obligation and, as a result, the state withheld the taxes due from Hennesey and LeClair’s income tax refunds that tax year. Further, on March 17, 2008, defendant was the settlement agent in a real estate transaction involving Kevin Williams, who purchased real estate located in Providence. Wachovia Mortgage Funding, Williams’ lender, wired funds into defendant’s IOLTA account on March 17 and 18 of 2008. Out of these funds, defendant withheld $1,115.58 to pay real estate property taxes due to the City of Providence, but he never made the payment to the city.', 'At the close of the state’s case-in-chief, defendant filed a motion for judgment of acquittal, which was heard and denied on January 15, 2014. The defendant did not present any witnesses. After deliberation, the jury found defendant guilty of three counts of embezzlement', '- 10 - (counts 3, 4, and 5) and of conspiracy to commit embezzlement (count 6), but acquitted defendant of two other counts of embezzlement (counts 1 and 2). Thereafter, defendant filed a motion for a new trial, which was heard on February 10, 2014. The defendant argued that “the evidence presented by the [s]tate at trial was not sufficient * * * to prove * * * guilt beyond a reasonable doubt * * *.” In denying the motion, the trial justice agreed with the jury’s verdict, finding that the evidence of defendant’s knowledge and intent was “overwhelming.” On April 30, 2014, the trial justice sentenced defendant to a fifteen-year term of incarceration for counts 3, 4, and 5, to run concurrently, with four and a half years to serve, the balance suspended, with probation. On the conviction for conspiracy, the trial justice sentenced defendant to a five-year suspended term of incarceration, with probation, to run consecutively. Subsequently, defendant filed a timely notice of appeal. 7', 'II', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial because there was insufficient evidence to support the jury’s verdict and in “fail[ing] in his role as the thirteenth juror by misconceiving the evidence.” Additionally, he argues that the trial justice erred in admitting Green’s fax correspondence because it was irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial. We shall address these arguments separately herein.', 'A', 'The Defendant’s Motion for a New Trial', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial because the state failed to prove that he had the requisite intent to commit embezzlement in light 7', 'On May 30, 2014, defendant filed a second motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence, which was heard and denied on September 12, 2014. The denial of this second motion for a new trial is not challenged on appeal.', '- 11 - of Gostomski’s “unfettered access” to his IOLTA and business-operating accounts. He asserts that the evidence adduced at trial proves only that he was negligent in monitoring his IOLTA account and in supervising Gostomski. Indeed, as defendant sees it, the trial justice was clearly wrong in crediting Gostomski—whom he described as a “jilted girlfriend and veteran embezzler”—when there was evidence to suggest that she was directly responsible for these crimes.', 'It is well-settled that a defendant arguing a motion for a new trial may do so on two bases: (1) insufficiency of the evidence and (2) weight of the evidence. State v. Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 570-71 (R.I. 2009). Although defendant challenges the “sufficiency” of the evidence on appeal, which would require an examination of the trial evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, State v. Karngar, 29 A.3d 1232, 1235 (R.I. 2011), “[defendant’s] arguments and presentation of the law * * * to the trial justice * * * ask[ed] that his appeal be viewed through the prism of the more traditional, weight-of-the-evidence standard.” State v. Fleck, 81 A.3d 1129, 1133 (R.I. 2014). Specifically, at the hearing on his motion for a new trial, although defendant articulated that the evidence was insufficient, he nevertheless asked the trial justice, “sitting as * * * a thirteenth juror,” to weigh the evidence. Accordingly, we deem his argument as it relates to sufficiency of the evidence to be waived, and we limit our review to his weight-of- the-evidence argument. See id. 8 8', 'In any event, even if we were to deem defendant’s sufficiency-of-the-evidence argument to be preserved (despite his asking the trial justice to weigh the evidence), “a defendant seeking to prevail on a motion for a new trial based on the sufficiency of the evidence bears a heavier burden than does a defendant seeking to prevail on a weight of the evidence argument * * *.” State v. Mendez, 116 A.3d 228, 246 (R.I. 2015). Because we affirm the trial justice’s finding that defendant failed to meet the lesser burden, we need not go further.', '- 12 -', '1. Standard of Review', 'When deciding a motion for a new trial based on the weight-of-the-evidence standard, “the trial justice acts as a thirteenth juror and exercises independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.” State v. Watkins, 92 A.3d 172, 191 (R.I. 2014) (quoting State v. Clay, 79 A.3d 832, 841 (R.I. 2013)). “In so deciding, ‘the trial justice must consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, then independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and also ultimately determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.’” Id. (quoting Clay, 79 A.3d at 841- 42). “If, after conducting this independent review, the trial justice agrees with the jury’s verdict or if the evidence is such that reasonable minds could differ as to the outcome, the motion for a new trial should be denied.” Id. (quoting Clay, 79 A.3d at 842). “Only when the trial justice does not agree with the jury’s verdict, [must he or she] embark on a fourth analytical step.” Id. (quoting Clay, 79 A.3d at 842). The fourth step of the analysis requires the trial justice to “determine whether the verdict is against the fair preponderance of the evidence and fails to do substantial justice. If the verdict meets this standard, then a new trial may be granted.” State v. Guerra, 12 A.3d 759, 765-66 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Rivera, 839 A.2d 497, 503 (R.I. 2003)).', '“Because a trial justice, when deciding a motion for a new trial, is in an especially good position to evaluate the facts and to judge the credibility of the witnesses, on appeal, this Court’s review is deferential.” Watkins, 92 A.3d at 191 (quoting Clay, 79 A.3d at 842). “If the trial justice has articulated adequate grounds for denying the motion, his or her decision is entitled to great weight and will not be overturned by this Court unless he or she has overlooked or misconceived material evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.” Id. (quoting Clay, 79 A.3d at', '- 13 - 842).', '2. Analysis', 'Section 11-41-3 provides, in pertinent part, that:', '“[E]very officer, agent, clerk, servant, or other person to whom any', 'money or other property shall be entrusted for any specific', 'purpose, * * * who shall embezzle or fraudulently convert to his or', 'her own use, or who shall take or secrete, with intent to embezzle', 'or fraudulently convert to his or her own use, any money or other', 'property which shall have come into his or her possession or shall', 'be under his or her care or charge by virtue of his or her', 'employment * * * shall be deemed guilty of larceny * * *.” To prove embezzlement under § 11-41-3, the state must show that a defendant: (1) “was entrusted with the property for a specific use”; (2) “came into possession of the property in a lawful manner”; and (3) “intended to appropriate and convert the property to his own use and permanently deprive that person of the use.” State v. McKone, 673 A.2d 1068, 1073 (R.I. 1996) (quoting State v. Oliveira, 432 A.2d 664, 666 (R.I. 1981)). The defendant contends that the state failed to prove that he intentionally converted his clients’ property.', 'After a careful review of the trial transcript and exhibits, it is our opinion that the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive material evidence, and that he articulated sufficient grounds for denying defendant’s motion for a new trial. The trial justice found that the evidence of defendant’s knowledge and intent was “overwhelming.” He described the “significant paper trail” introduced through Tellier’s extensive testimony.', 'Further, he considered Tellier’s testimony that transfers from defendant’s IOLTA to his business-operating account coincided with vacations and that the amount of income defendant received significantly exceeded the legal fees he earned. He determined that the witness testimony and documentary evidence were sufficient to support defendant’s convictions. The trial justice’s findings were all supported by the record, and the evidence presented at trial met the necessary elements to convict defendant of', '- 14 - embezzlement.', 'With respect to counts 3, 4, and 5, defendant was the settlement agent for each transaction and, accordingly, he was entrusted with funds for the specific purpose of disbursing those funds after each closing. As Tellier testified, defendant’s bank records showed that, prior to each transaction, he received sufficient funds to make the required disbursements. Tellier further testified that defendant’s bank records showed that, in each of these transactions, he never disbursed the funds to the proper payee. In the case of Aguilar (count 5), defendant received $126,215.97 from Aguilar’s lender, which he was required to disburse to the seller after the closing. The defendant never made this disbursement. In the case of Tavarozzi (count 3), defendant received $147,862.27 from Tavarozzi’s lender—$36,224.78 of which should have been disbursed to Countrywide to pay off Tavarozzi’s second mortgage loan. The defendant, again, never made this disbursement.', 'And, in the case of Williams (count 4), defendant stipulated that he never disbursed $1,115.58 to the City of Providence on behalf of Williams.', 'It is also our opinion that the trial justice did not overlook material evidence when deciding that the evidence adduced at trial established the intent element of embezzlement. The trial evidence not only established that defendant failed to disburse the monies to the proper payees; it also established that he actually spent much of the money on himself. As previously noted, Tellier specified that defendant was using his business-operating account for personal expenses, from car payments to furniture purchases, totaling roughly $75,000, while at the same time failing to disburse the necessary payments to the proper payees.', 'Therefore, the trial justice’s determination that the evidence adduced at trial supported a finding that defendant “intended to appropriate and convert the [money] to his own use and permanently deprive [another] of the use,” was not clearly wrong. See McKone, 673 A.2d at 1073 (quoting Oliveira,', '- 15 - 432 A.2d at 666).', 'It is this Court’s opinion that the record established each element of embezzlement as alleged in counts 3, 4, and 5. 9', 'Moreover, the evidence also showed that Mortgage Guarantee & Title terminated its agency agreement with defendant because he failed to complete its annual escrow review. Further, Green testified about defendant’s evasive and misleading responses to her inquiries. The defendant’s uncooperativeness in completing Mortgage Guarantee & Title’s escrow review, and his attempts to avoid Green, coupled with the evidence of how he handled the money entrusted to him, all support the basis for the inference that he acted with the requisite intent to embezzle. It is clear to us, therefore, that the trial justice conducted the appropriate analysis and was not clearly wrong in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'B', 'The Admissibility of Green’s Correspondence', 'The defendant further maintains that the trial justice erred in admitting into evidence Green’s fax correspondence expressing her opinion about his veracity and credibility because it was both irrelevant and prejudicial. The trial justice found that Green’s correspondence was relevant to the issue of intent and that its probative value “outweighed its prejudicial effect.” In our opinion, the admission of Green’s correspondence at trial was a sustainable exercise of the trial justice’s considerable discretion in evidentiary rulings. 10 9', 'The defendant makes no argument to this Court that the evidence was insufficient to meet the conspiracy charge; accordingly, we do not address count 6. 10', 'The trial justice admitted Green’s correspondence under the business record exception to hearsay. Because defendant objected only on grounds that the correspondence had no probative value and was unfairly prejudicial at trial, this Court declines to decide whether Green’s correspondence was properly admitted as a business record.', '- 16 -', '1. Standard of Review', 'It is well established that “[t]he admission or exclusion of evidence on grounds of relevancy is within the sound discretion of the trial justice * * *.” State v. Lynch, 854 A.2d 1022, 1035 (R.I. 2004) (quoting State v. Calenda, 787 A.2d 1195, 1199 (R.I. 2002)). Thus, “absent a showing of abuse of this discretion, this Court will not disturb a ruling concerning the admissibility of evidence.” Id. (quoting Calenda, 787 A.2d at 1199). Further, Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence provides for the exclusion of relevant evidence “if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury.” This Court has stated that “determinations of relevance and prejudice are within the sound discretion of the trial justice, and such determinations will be upheld absent a showing of an abuse of this discretion.” DiPetrillo v. Dow Chemical Co., 729 A.2d 677, 692 (R.I. 1999).', '2. Analysis', 'Rule 401 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence defines “[r]elevant evidence” as “evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.” “This Court has stated that ‘[i]nherent in Rule 401 are two basic facets of relevant evidence—materiality and probativeness * * * [and] [i]f the evidence is offered to help prove a proposition that is not a matter in issue, the evidence is immaterial * * * [and] should be excluded.’” State v. Virola, 115 A.3d 980, 996 (R.I. 2015) (quoting State v. Thomas, 936 A.2d 1278, 1282 (R.I. 2007)).', 'Here, defendant was charged with and convicted of embezzlement and conspiracy to commit embezzlement. The state had the burden to prove that defendant intentionally embezzled', '- 17 - funds entrusted to him. See § 11-41-3. Green’s fax correspondence is the final communication from Green to defendant in a chain of communications between the two. The communication is relevant, as it created a timeline of events that led to defendant’s ultimate prosecution. It also made it more probable that defendant had notice of the misappropriations of funds or, at a minimum, of the severe allegations that Green was making regarding such misappropriations. Accordingly, we are of the opinion that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in finding that the evidence was relevant.', 'Moreover, Rule 403 provides that “evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice * * *.” “It is within the sound discretion of the trial justice whether to admit or exclude evidence under Rule 403.” State v. Mlyniec, 15 A.3d 983, 997 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. John, 881 A.2d 920, 927 (R.I. 2005)). We have “said that ‘a trial justice’s discretion to exclude evidence under Rule 403 must be used sparingly,’ and ‘[i]t is only when evidence is marginally relevant and enormously prejudicial that a trial justice must exclude it.’” Mlyniec, 15 A.3d at 997 (quoting State v. DeJesus, 947 A.2d 873, 883 (R.I. 2008)).', 'In reviewing the trial justice’s Rule 403 balancing, it is our opinion that he was not clearly wrong in finding that the probative value of Green’s correspondence outweighed its prejudicial effect. Green’s correspondence, as discussed herein, was more than “marginally relevant.” Moreover, in light of the abundant inculpatory evidence against the defendant, both through trial testimony and exhibits, the defendant failed to show how Green’s correspondence was “enormously prejudicial” to him. In our opinion, while the correspondence was clearly unfavorable to the defendant, it did not reach the level of being unfairly prejudicial. We also note that to the extent that Green’s correspondence improperly gave an opinion regarding the', '- 18 - defendant’s credibility—a function solely for the jury—the defendant did not request that the correspondence be redacted to remove such characterizations of credibility.

45,Victoria Roach : v. : State of Rhode Island et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. This civil matter comes before the Court on appeal from a Superior Court judgment in favor of the plaintiff, Ms. Victoria Roach (Roach or plaintiff). The plaintiff slipped and fell while she was working as a per diem contract nurse at the Rhode Island Veterans Home (Veterans Home or the Home) on November 10, 2008. She brought suit against the State of Rhode Island and Gary Alexander in his official capacity as Director of the Rhode Island Department of Human Services (collectively, the state).', 'The case was tried before a jury beginning on March 12, 2014. At the conclusion of plaintiff’s case-in-chief, the state moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, which the state renewed at the close of the evidence. On March 19, 2014, the jury awarded plaintiff $500,000. Under Rule 59(e) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, the state then filed a motion for new trial, and a motion to amend judgment and for a remittitur. The trial justice granted a remittitur, lessening plaintiff’s award to $382,000; however, the prejudgment interest award increased the judgment to $631,373.66.', '-1-', 'The state asserts multiple arguments on appeal: (1) the public-duty doctrine shields the state from liability; (2) the statutory tort cap in G.L. 1956 § 9-31-2 limits damages to $100,000; (3) the prejudgment interest award was improper; (4) the trial justice erred in denying the state’s motion for judgment as a matter of law; and (5) the trial justice erred in failing to instruct the jury on comparative negligence. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'A', 'Background', 'The Veterans Home serves as a nursing home for many of Rhode Island’s veterans. 1 Statutorily organized and governed under Rhode Island’s Department of Human Services, its population generally spans between ages seventy and eighty, with many residents having served in World War II and the Korean War. Dispersed in multiple units, the Home’s residents range from totally independent to bedridden. Each unit includes two wings (sides A and B), with each side housing about thirty to forty patients.', 'Of particular relevance here is Unit N-7 (N-7). A “skilled unit,” N-7 included residents requiring heightened care and palliative (end-of-life) residents. 2 As such, a charge nurse, 3 a staff 1', 'Residency at the Home is limited to Rhode Island resident veterans having served during a time of war. 2', 'The unit included residents with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), residents undergoing psychiatric treatments, and amputees. Many N-7 residents required help getting out of bed and ambulating, using the bathroom, eating, and bathing. 3', 'The charge nurse oversaw a particular unit, which included nurse and CNA oversight.', '-2- nurse, 4 and several Certified Nursing Assistants 5 (CNAs) staffed the unit during a typical shift. A supervisory RN oversaw the Home’s nursing operation, including resident-care oversight and nurse supervision. Nurses worked during three shifts: 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.; 4 p.m. to 12 a.m.; and 12 a.m. to 8 a.m.', 'At the start of a 4 p.m. shift, CNAs went directly to their respective room assignments and checked whether residents needed washing or changing. 6 This was important because residents could not visit the dining room if soiled and often had not been checked or cleaned for a few hours. However, the CNAs prioritized transporting residents to the dining room because they ate dinner early, around 4:30 p.m. Additionally, CNAs provided meals and fed the few residents who did not leave their rooms. Generally, three CNAs assisted residents to the dining room while one CNA fed residents in their rooms.', 'B', 'The Accident', 'On November 10, 2008, Roach reported to work for her Veterans Home assignment, arriving around 3:45 p.m. for the 4 p.m. to 12 a.m. shift. As a contract nurse 7 unacquainted with the Home’s operations, Roach briefly met with N-7’s charge nurse, Ms. Cheryl Kelley. Until about 4:25 p.m., Kelley orientated Roach with N-7, showing her the treatment cart, medical cart, bathroom, and kitchen. Then, Roach familiarized herself with N-7’s residents’ medications, 4', 'Working at the charge nurse’s direction, an N-7 staff nurse, who could be a Registered Nurse (RN) or Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN), primarily distributed resident medication, usually to either the A or B wing. 5', 'CNAs delivered meals to residents, fed, washed, toileted, and ambulated them. 6', 'Because most on-duty CNAs regularly worked in N-7, they needed little guidance in fulfilling their duties. 7', 'Roach worked on a per diem basis for MAS Medical Staffing.', '-3- which she planned to administer until about 5 p.m. While administering medications, she traveled down N-7’s “B” side hallway, beginning with Room B-1.', 'Roach eventually arrived at Room B-7—the room from which the crux of this case arises. At the time, Room B-7 housed two resident-patients. 8 Resident 1, a double amputee, often remained in his wheelchair. He was capable of pushing himself around the Home and usually wheeled himself to the dining room at dinnertime.', 'In addition to being non-ambulatory, Resident 1 was incontinent, so nurses would assist him in accessing the toilet via a lift, transporting him from his bed or wheelchair to the toilet, and back. Resident 2 had end-stage Parkinson’s disease. He rarely left his room or his bed, and he required nurse assistance to move from his bed to his wheelchair. Due to his lack of mobility, CNAs assisted Resident 2 with dinner in his room.', 'Roach proceeded to administer Resident 2’s medication. He required one medication, which she administered in a 30-cubic-centimeter (cc) cup along with a 90-cc Dixie cup filled about halfway with water. After he took his pill, about 30 ccs of excess water remained in his cup. Roach tossed the medication cup in the trash near B-7’s entrance and approached the bathroom to dump the excess water in the sink.', 'Walking towards the bathroom with the water cup in her right hand, Roach reached inside the room with her left hand and attempted to flick on the light switch. 9 However, before reaching the sink, she slipped and fell on the bathroom floor. Wearing her Nurse Mate sneakers, 8', 'For privacy purposes, we refer to both residents as Resident 1 and Resident 2. Resident 1 refers to the B-7 resident whose bed was closest to the door, and Resident 2 refers to the resident located proximate to the room’s window. 9', 'At trial, plaintiff offered diverging testimony regarding whether she turned on the light before or after entering the bathroom.', '-4- Roach recalled hydroplaning on liquid and landing in a split position. Roach felt “excruciating” pain, and her knee cracked on the way down.', 'While on the floor, Roach felt liquid on both sides of her. It was enough liquid to dampen both the back and side of her pants. Based on its smell, Roach believed the liquid was cleaning solution or soapy water used to bathe residents. Unable to reach the call light above her on the wall, Roach yelled out multiple times for help, to no avail. With no one around to assist, she used her uninjured leg to push herself up and out of the bathroom. Relying on the medical cart for support, Roach then made her way down the hall to the nursing station.', 'At the nursing station, Roach notified Kelley of her fall. Kelley provided Roach with an ACE bandage wrap and ice pack.', 'She also gave Roach an incident report, which Roach completed shortly thereafter. Kelley retained a mop and bucket and went to Room B-7 to clean up the spill. Kelley recalled needing only one mop swipe to clean the liquid. Although plaintiff remained in pain, which she described as a “ten” on a one-to-ten scale, she completed her shift.', 'C', 'Bathroom Access', 'While the jury heard no direct evidence regarding how the liquid reached the bathroom floor, the parties presented circumstantial evidence detailing the possible events leading to Roach’s slip and fall. All staff members, including nurses, CNAs, and housekeeping, could access B-7 and its bathroom. Additionally, the Home allowed visitors, who could access the Home and B-7, including the bathroom.', 'In particular, Heritage Healthcare Company (Heritage or housekeeping) cleaned the Home’s rooms and bathrooms daily, including on November 10. 10', 'Housekeepers worked 10', 'The Home contracted with Heritage for daily cleaning services.', '-5- between 7 a.m. and 3 or 3:30 p.m. They cleaned bedside tables, floors, and bathrooms, including the sink, toilet, and floor. Ms. Thelma Garcia, the Heritage housekeeper who cleaned the Home on November 10, cleaned N-7’s rooms between 9 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. She was also available after 11:30 through the end of her shift to respond to any calls to clean spills. The housekeeping manager, Ms. Maria Depina, inspected each room daily around 1:30 p.m. Depina testified that her staff used an orange cleaning solution to clean floors—a color that she claimed was visible both in the cleaning bottle and on the floor. Housekeeping kept cleaning products locked in a closet, which Depina testified only the housekeeping manager and assistant manager could access. Depina said that she could not recall whether housekeeping received a call to clean a spill after the November 10 morning cleaning.', 'Beyond housekeeping, nurses and CNAs also accessed unit bathrooms. Several nurses and CNAs testified that they accessed the bathroom during the resident-cleaning process. Generally, CNAs used one of two resident-cleaning methods: either Perineal (Peri) Spray and disposable wipes, or a bucket of soapy water and a washcloth. 11 For the latter method, CNAs washed residents either bedside or over the toilet. When finished, the CNAs disposed of excess soapy water in the toilet.', 'Regarding B-7, Kelley testified that CNAs washed Residents 1 and 2 either bedside or over the toilet. If over the toilet, Kelley said that the CNAs cleaned Resident 1 with Peri Spray, while if they cleaned him at his bedside, they probably used warm water and soap. Ms. Ursula Souza, the N-7 LPN on duty before Roach during the 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. shift, testified that CNAs 11', 'Ms. Charlene Demello, a CNA with twenty years of experience at the Home, described the washing process. She testified that, “[y]ou would go in the bathroom and -- you would first get the bucket, bring the bucket into the bathroom, get the water in the bucket, bring it to [the patient’s] bedside, wash them up, and then empty the water out immediately because in the process of getting them up, you don’t want to drop any of that water on the floor.”', '-6- always washed B-7 residents at their bedsides. She also noted that CNAs disposed of washing materials and water in bathrooms. Additionally, Ms. Patricia Brum, a CNA who worked in N-7 during Roach’s shift, testified that she used the bathroom to wash out any used urinals. Nurses also accessed bathrooms to wash their hands.', 'Because housekeeping staff left around 3:30 p.m., the nurses cleaned up spills after this time. Employees, including CNAs, consistently testified that if a CNA or nurse noticed a spill, they were responsible for cleaning it up. LPN Souza and CNA Demello covered Room B-7 during the 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. shift on November 10. Specifically, Demello cared for Resident 1 and eight to ten other B-wing residents. Souza testified that she could not recall seeing liquid on B-7’s floor at the end of her November 10 shift; however, she also could not recall whether she looked in the bathroom. She did note, though, that if she saw liquid, she would clean it up. Demello testified that she clearly remembered seeing no liquid anywhere in B-7 or its bathroom when she finished her shift. As a “perfectionist,” Souza stated that she double-checked her residents and rooms often. 12 She first noted that she checked every hour, hour-and-a-half at most, but later testified that CNAs should check residents every two hours.', 'CNA Mr. Allemand (Al) Morantus assisted one of B-7’s residents during the 4 p.m. to 12 a.m. shift on November 10. He could not recall whether he cared for both B-7 residents. While he did not remember a spill that evening, he noted the importance of cleaning spills, stating, “If you don’t [pick up spilled liquid], any nurses see that, you can get punished for that. That’s why everybody have [sic] a concern about it.” Morantus also noted that resident care during this shift does not begin until approximately 6:45 to 7 p.m. Another CNA, Ms. Francisca Pires, never 12', 'Interestingly, Demello did not initial a standard nursing observation record during her November 10 shift. When asked why she failed to complete the form, she repeatedly responded “Nolo,” which she asserted meant she could not answer the question. She did, however, assert that it was not because she was too busy to initial the form during her shift.', '-7- recalled meeting Roach nor did she recall her falling that day. She stated that if someone fell, she would have heard about it or seen an ambulance. When asked whether she remembered visiting B-7 or hearing reports of spills between 4 and 5 p.m. on November 10, Kelley replied in the negative. 13', 'Finally, the jury heard testimony regarding visitor access to the Home and N-7. Although rare, Kelley testified that some Home residents have had visitors who could access the Home units almost any time during the day.', 'Further, Kelley recalled that she never saw family members visit Resident 1 as he did not have family. She did not remember visitors for Resident 2, but she recalled that he had an out-of-state daughter. Souza, however, testified that Resident 2 occasionally had visitors; though she could not specifically recall the last time someone visited. Roach testified that on the evening in question, she did not observe any visitors between 4 and 5 p.m. and claimed that she would have noticed if anyone visited.', 'D', 'The Aftermath', 'As a result of the fall, Roach saw numerous physicians, underwent arthroscopic surgery, and engaged in several months of physical therapy, both before and after surgery. Although Roach experienced a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and torn meniscus, her surgery addressed only her torn meniscus.', 'Roach did not resume nurse employment for about three-and-a-half years. When she resumed work in the fall of 2012, she modified her schedule from forty hours per week to sixteen. Although she earned approximately $1,250 before taxes based on a forty-hour work 13', 'Pires’s testimony seemed to suggest that she had difficulty understanding the English language. Similarly, the trial justice noted that Morantus seemed to have trouble with English, and at certain points, it seemed that he simply agreed with questions, when posed in a leading form.', '-8- week, she earned about $450 before taxes based on a sixteen-hour work week. After her fall, Roach wore a brace on her injured knee for assistance and support while working.', 'After hearing arguments and considering all pending motions, the trial justice issued a bench decision on April 17, 2014. She denied the state’s Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law, finding that reasonable minds could differ and that there was sufficient evidence for a reasonable juror to side with Roach in terms of liability. Additionally, the trial justice found the public-duty doctrine inapplicable. In denying the state’s Rule 59 motion for a new trial, she found her jury charge correct, especially regarding her rejection of a jury instruction on open and obvious dangers, comparative negligence, and assumption of risk.', 'Finally, the trial justice granted the state’s request for a remittitur, reducing the jury’s award by $118,000 to $382,000. Approximately $250,000 in prejudgment interest was added to this amount, giving Roach a total award of $631,373.66. On April 30, 2014, the state appealed the judgment.

(quoting Sivo, 925 A.2d at 913).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Public-Duty Doctrine', 'Under traditional common-law sovereign immunity, individuals lacked recourse for state- induced tortious injuries. Grounded in the common-law theory that “The King Can Do No Wrong,” this liability-shielding principle was the law in Rhode Island for much of the twentieth century. See Catone v. Medberry, 555 A.2d 328, 330 (R.I. 1989). However, in 1970, this Court in Becker v. Beaudoin, 106 R.I. 562, 571-72, 261 A.2d 896, 901-02 (1970), pivoted away from this rule, abrogating sovereign immunity as applied to municipal and quasi-municipal corporations.', 'Following Becker, the General Assembly enacted the Rhode Island Tort Claims Act, § 9- 31-1, as enacted by P.L. 1970, ch. 181, § 2. Through § 9-31-1, the General Assembly further chiseled away at common-law immunity, construing state tort liability in a manner akin to that of a private person or corporation, while also confining potential damages. To the extent that governmental immunity survived Becker, § 9-31-1 held the state and its agents liable in tort in an attempt to legislatively abrogate what remained of common-law sovereign immunity.', 'This Court interpreted § 9-31-1 for the first time in Calhoun v. City of Providence, 120 R.I. 619, 390 A.2d 350 (1978). In Calhoun, the Court began to demarcate an exception to the', '- 11 - § 9-31-1 liability imposition—today known as the public-duty doctrine. Specifically, while acknowledging that the General Assembly significantly broadened the state’s susceptibility to tort suit, the Court remarked, “[W]e do not believe that the Legislature ever intended the statute to operate so as to impose liability upon the state for any and all acts or omissions of its employees and officers which might cause injury to persons.” Calhoun, 120 R.I. at 625, 390 A.2d at 353. This Court, therefore, recognized “a zone of governmental operation which should be insulated from tort claims, even in the absence of sovereign immunity * * * .” Id. at 629, 390 A.2d at 355.', 'In O’Brien v. State, 555 A.2d 334, 336-37 (R.I. 1989), this Court shed further light on the public-duty doctrine:', '“[It] does not resurrect the concept of sovereign immunity but it', 'does take into account the unquestionable fact that many activities', 'performed by government could not and would not in the ordinary', 'course of events be performed by a private person at all. Among', 'such activities would be those that we have considered in our', 'cases, such as licensing of drivers, management and parole of', 'incarcerated prisoners, and the exercise of the police power', 'through officers authorized and empowered by the state to perform', 'a police function. We believe that the exercise of these functions', 'cannot reasonably be compared with functions that are or may be', 'exercised by a private person.', '“However, the state as a landowner or an owner of motor vehicles,', 'to mention only two of its activities, performs the identical', 'function that a private person might perform or which a private', 'person might well parallel, and therefore, the duties of the state as', 'landowner or owner or operator of motor vehicles should be the', 'same as that of any private person or corporation as the Legislature', 'has ordained in § 9-31-1.” (Emphasis added).', 'The current jurisprudential landscape of the public-duty doctrine shields the state from liability in limited circumstances. Namely, the public-duty doctrine immunizes the state from “tort liability arising out of discretionary governmental actions that by their nature are not', '- 12 - ordinarily performed by private persons[.]” Morales v. Town of Johnston, 895 A.2d 721, 730 (R.I. 2006) (quoting Schultz v. Foster-Glocester Regional School District, 755 A.2d 153, 155 (R.I. 2000)). From this doctrine, the Court has carved out exceptions, which if present, may impose state liability.

Here, the parties stipulated that neither exception applies; thus, we limit our analysis to the public-duty doctrine’s application to the facts of this case.', 'As such, under our analysis of the public-duty doctrine, we differentiate between “discretionary” governmental activities and acts capable of performance by private citizens. For example, in Catone, 555 A.2d at 333, we noted that, “[The] need to protect the government’s ability to perform certain functions is particularly relevant when the activity in question involves a high degree of discretion such as governmental planning or political decision making.” See also Toegemann v. City of Providence, 21 A.3d 384, 387 (R.I. 2011) (“[T]he city’s placement of traffic-control devices * * * is precisely the type of discretionary governmental activity that is shielded from tort liability under the public-duty doctrine.”); Houle v. Galloway School Lines, 14', 'We note that, in certain instances, this Court has highlighted a third public-duty doctrine exception: “when the governmental entity engaged in [non-discretionary] activities normally undertaken by private individuals or corporations.” Medeiros v. Sitrin, 984 A.2d 620, 628 n.7 (R.I. 2009) (quoting Schultz v. Foster-Glocester Regional School District, 755 A.2d 153, 155 (R.I. 2000)); see also Morales v.

Although for analytical purposes this is a distinction without a difference, structurally, we analyze this private-person ordinary-activity test under the general rule, rather than as an exception.

Galloway School Lines, Inc., 643 A.2d 822, 825-26 (R.I. 1994).', '- 13 - Inc., 643 A.2d 822, 826 (R.I. 1994) (holding that municipal school bus route design constituted discretionary government activity).', 'Applying the correct standard, the trial justice found the public-duty doctrine inapplicable. The trial justice noted that the Veterans Home performs tasks analogous to private nursing homes, in that it houses and cares for patients, which includes care from agency- employed nurses. Further, she found that the Home’s sole distinguishing characteristic from a private nursing home is its legislatively defined population and funding structure, which bestows oversight authority on the Director of Human Services. The trial justice stated that, similar to how a private nursing home decides internal-policy matters, bylaws govern the Home’s internal processes. She also noted that daily nursing care and nursing care facilities are not unique to state entities.', 'The trial justice considered whether the public-duty doctrine applies “solely due to the fact that the Veterans’ Home is a creature of statute and the duties of which patient population, funding, and administration are statutorily imposed.”', 'In refusing to apply the public-duty doctrine, the trial justice first rejected the state’s assertion that the Veterans Home is distinct because its duties are statutorily imposed, noting that she could not “think of any of the [s]tate’s duties that are not statutorily imposed and regulated.”', 'Further, she cited Adams v. State Department of Corrections, 973 A.2d 542 (R.I. 2009), noting that the public-duty doctrine test turns on the “actual function.” In sum, the trial justice focused on the underlying activity and whether a private person or corporation could carry it out. She reasoned that because the Veterans Home performed a function that private persons routinely performed, the public-duty doctrine did not apply.', '- 14 -', 'The discrete function here—that is, care for nursing home resident-patients—is not the type shielded from tort liability. Although the parties agree that we must analyze whether the state is engaged in a function capable of private-party performance, the parties diverge on the vantage point from which we conduct this analysis. For instance, the state confines the function to the Veterans Home’s maintenance, which it argues a private person cannot replicate because the Home is statutorily created with its management vested in the Director of Human Services. The plaintiff, however, asserts that this Court should view the activity more functionally, contending that state and private actors alike can perform the relevant care function.', 'Importantly, the activity giving rise to plaintiff’s injuries is not a discretionary governmental function warranting immunity. To this point, Adams is instructive. In Adams, 973 A.2d at 544, we considered the public-duty doctrine’s application in the context of the Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP), a federally funded yet state-administered food distribution program. Specifically, the Rhode Island Department of Corrections selected the organizations to distribute federally sponsored food to the public. Id. Notably, TEFAP did not allow private persons or corporations to execute food receipt or distribution functions. Id. The plaintiff alleged that he became sick after consuming a program-distributed box of raisins. Id.', 'Despite the fact that TEFAP restricted its shipment to state agencies (excluding private individuals or corporations), this Court nonetheless imposed liability on the state. See Adams, 973 A.2d at 546. The Court reasoned, “While it is true that administration of a federally funded program could, potentially, be considered a governmental function, the actual government function at issue in this case—namely, the storage and distribution of food—is an activity that business entities and private persons can and do perform regularly.” Id. (emphasis added). Further, we emphasized, “The plaintiff does not argue that his alleged injuries arose out of the', '- 15 - discretionary decisions of government agents in administering the TEFAP program; instead, his allegations concern the relatively commonplace task of storing and distributing foodstuffs.” Id.', 'Similarly, here, the administration, operation, or maintenance (in a broad sense) of the Veterans Home is not at issue. Rather, the pertinent government function is resident-patient care. The plaintiff does not assert that her injuries stem from a discretionary decision of the Director of Human Services, such as a decision to admit or deny a resident. Instead, she asserts that the negligence of a nurse or housekeeper caused her injuries. Regardless of whether this incident occurred in the Veterans Home or a private nursing home, the underlying function at issue—resident-patient care—remains unchanged.', 'Therefore, we will not disturb the trial justice’s public-duty doctrine finding.', 'B', 'Statutory Tort Cap', 'Rhode Island operates under a general statutory-damage limitation applicable in tort cases asserted against the state. This limitation provides:', '“In any tort action against the state of Rhode Island or any political', 'subdivision thereof, any damages recovered therein shall not', 'exceed the sum of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000);', 'provided, however, that in all instances in which the state was', 'engaged in a proprietary function in the commission of the tort, or', 'in any situation whereby the state has agreed to indemnify the', 'federal government or any agency thereof for any tort liability, the', 'limitation on damages set forth in this section shall not apply.”', 'Section 9-31-2.', 'Thus, this Court recognizes that damages above $100,000 are permitted when the tort action stems from the state’s “proprietary function.” “Proprietary” functions are those “actions normally performed by private individuals.” Graff v. Motta, 695 A.2d 486, 489 (R.I. 1997). Alternatively, this Court has defined a “proprietary function” as “one which is not ‘so', '- 16 - intertwined with governing that the government is obligated to perform it only by its own agents or employees.’” Lepore v. Rhode Island Public Transit Authority, 524 A.2d 574, 575 (R.I. 1987) (quoting Xavier v. Cianci, 479 A.2d 1179, 1182 (R.I. 1984)).', 'This Court recognizes the somewhat murky nature of deciphering when the state executes a proprietary versus a governmental function. Yet, we do not read the above “proprietary function” articulations as inconsistent. Whether a function is so intermingled with governing, such that only government agents or employees can execute it, begs the question of whether nongovernmental employees or private persons can also perform the function. In both inquiries, this Court pinpoints the function at issue and examines whether it is so significantly tied to governing that private persons or entities could not possibly fulfill it.', 'In analyzing whether the statutory tort cap applied, the trial justice found that the Home’s daily operations were not so intertwined with governing to require the state to solely utilize state employees in executing its functions. The trial justice noted that the Home contracted with private employment agencies (including plaintiff’s employer) and a private company for cleaning services. She reasoned that the Home’s CNAs routinely executed tasks that private employees similarly performed. The trial justice cited Lepore, noting numerous similarities between the Veterans Home and the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA). For instance, she noted that both entities are legislatively created, neither is self-sustaining or expected to generate pecuniary profits, and although both collect revenue, each also relies on government funds. 15 The trial justice also stated that, like RIPTA, the Home furthers important public policy purposes for many elderly Rhode Island residents. 15', 'The trial justice made additional comparisons between the Home and RIPTA. She observed that, whereas RIPTA floats public bonds, the Veterans Home accepts private donations. Each entity’s governing authority is established by its respective enabling statute; RIPTA is an', '- 17 -', 'The state argues that the damages cap applies because Veterans Home maintenance is a governmental function. The state further asserts that the trial justice applied the improper test in analyzing the cap. Specifically, the state asserts that the trial justice incorrectly applied the public-duty doctrine standard in this context, concluding that “the CNAs * * * were performing tasks that privately employed CNAs routinely perform.” The state asserts that the trial justice should have instead asked whether it “engaged in a proprietary function in the commission of the tort.”', 'We deem the state’s arguments unpersuasive.', 'The trial justice correctly adopted plaintiff’s argument, finding the statutory tort cap inapplicable based on the Veterans Home’s performance of a proprietary function. While we acknowledge that similarities between the public-duty doctrine and statutory tort cap standards create overlap in the trial justice’s analysis of each issue, we are satisfied that the trial justice properly framed the issue before her. To inquire whether private individuals routinely perform the function is synonymous with asking whether the Veterans Home, in commission of the tort, acted in a proprietary manner. The state’s semantical assertion is unfounded.', 'Moreover, we are not persuaded by the state’s broad assertion that the Veterans Home is a creature of statute and therefore is protected by the tort cap. In determining the applicability of the statutory tort cap, whether an entity is statutorily created is not germane to this analysis. See Housing Authority of Providence v. Oropeza, 713 A.2d 1262, 1263-64 (R.I. 1998) (framing “essential question” as whether an activity is governmental or proprietary in the context of city housing authority notwithstanding fact that the housing authority was created by statute). Rather, we focus on the particular function at issue to the tort’s commission. Under the state’s instrumentality and “state political subdivision” whereas the Home’s supervision and administration is bestowed upon a state department head, the Director of Human Services.', '- 18 - reasoning, it is hard to imagine a scenario in which the Veterans Home—or any statutorily organized state entity—could be held fully liable in tort. To accept the state’s assertions would morph current jurisprudence into a cursory analysis whereby statutory organization alone is sufficient to limit the state’s liability. Further, such a standard would effectively reincarnate common-law sovereign immunity.', 'In this context, we are mindful that certain entities exercise a “dual nature,” and perform both governmental functions and proprietary functions. For example, in Rhode Island Student Loan Authority v. NELS, Inc., 550 A.2d 624, 627 (R.I. 1988), the Court “recognized that a governmental entity can exercise both governmental and proprietary functions.” NELS, Inc., involved a contract dispute between the Rhode Island Student Loan Authority (RISLA), a government entity, and a Rhode Island corporation. Id. at 625-26. The Court noted that, despite its nature as a state entity, RISLA served both governmental and proprietary functions. Id. at 627. The Court reasoned that RISLA contracted NELS “to serve as a rather ‘sophisticated’ collection agency [that] could neither exercise discretion nor set policy in the performance of its duties.” Id. The Court deemed the defendant’s function—collecting student loan principal and interest and maintaining transaction records—proprietary based on the disconnect between these activities and RISLA’s governance.', 'See id.', 'Similarly, in Parent v. Woonsocket Housing Authority, 87 R.I. 444, 143 A.2d 146 (1958), the Court recognized that city housing authorities “have a dual nature which partakes of a public as well as a private character. They function in an area which is public and governmental in character as well as in an area which is proprietary or private.” Id. at 448, 143 A.2d at 148.', 'Here, the Veterans Home is capable of fulfilling both governmental and proprietary functions.', 'The events giving rise to liability—the resident-care functions of CNAs, or', '- 19 - alternatively, contracted housekeepers—constitute proprietary functions. Under Graff, 695 A.2d at 489, which defines proprietary functions as “actions normally performed by private individuals,” the functions that the Home CNAs and housekeepers performed are not confined to a state veterans home context. Rather, private nursing homes can—and do—perform analogous patient-care functions.', 'Moreover, CNA and housekeeper duties are not “so intertwined with governing that the government is obligated to perform it only by its own agents or employees.” Lepore, 524 A.2d at 575 (quoting Xavier, 479 A.2d at 1182). Indeed, as the trial justice recognized, the Home utilized contracted workers to provide resident care.', 'The plaintiff herself was a per diem contract nurse at the Home, and she worked a similar private-nursing-home position after she ceased employment at the Home. The underlying daily activities of Veterans Home nurses, CNAs, and housekeepers are not unique to the Home, or its statutory inception.', 'Further, that the Veterans Home performed a proprietary function in this instance is not to say that it is incapable of performing a governmental function. This Court can imagine a scenario involving the management and operation of the Veterans Home that would involve discretionary government decision-making, such as negligence flowing from the director’s decision to admit or not admit a resident-patient. However, as this is a fact-intensive test, this Court examines the underlying activity or function at issue rather than the entity itself. Here, the underlying function is proprietary, and thus the trial justice correctly rejected the tort cap’s application.', '- 20 -', 'C', 'Prejudgment Interest', 'The state argues that the court erred in awarding approximately $250,000 in prejudgment interest against it. Moreover, it avers that, because plaintiff never requested interest, none should have been awarded.', 'The state cites Andrade v. State, 448 A.2d 1293 (R.I. 1982), positing that a waiver of sovereign immunity applies only to tort damages, and not prejudgment interest. In Andrade, the Court held the state liable for damages but not for prejudgment interest, reasoning that “interest” is separate and distinct from “damages.” Id. at 1295-96. However, this Court has sculpted an exception to the general rule that prejudgment interest is not awarded against the state, which, similar to the statutory tort cap analysis, turns on the proprietary versus governmental function distinction. See Lepore, 524 A.2d at 575; see also Webster v. Perrotta, 774 A.2d 68, 82 (R.I. 2001) (noting that prejudgment interest award turns on whether “municipality acts in a proprietary or enterprise capacity”); Housing Authority of Providence, 713 A.2d at 1263 (“[I]t is well settled that neither the state nor its political subdivisions are so shielded [from prejudgment interest] when the function performed that gave rise to the tort liability was proprietary rather than governmental in nature.”).', 'In Lepore, 524 A.2d at 574, the plaintiff brought suit against RIPTA, the state-operated public-transportation authority, for injuries sustained while riding a bus. The Court held that prejudgment interest attached to the judgment for personal injuries against RIPTA, reasoning that RIPTA engaged in a proprietary, rather than governmental, function. Id. at 575. Further, the Court explicitly noted that Andrade’s holding did not apply, deeming the trial justice’s prejudgment interest award appropriate. Id. Specifically, this Court in Lepore emphasized: “In', '- 21 - cases where the § 9-31-2 limitation on recovery applies, we have recognized that no prejudgment interest may be attached.” Lepore, 524 A.2d at 575. The Court further declared:', '“Section 9-31-2 does not place a limit on the amount of damages recoverable in the instant action because the government is performing a proprietary function. As a result, our holding in Andrade does not apply to this situation. Because it appears from § 9-31-2 that the Legislature did not intend to limit recovery in cases wherein the state is performing a proprietary function, we believe that the trial justice appropriately awarded prejudgment interest in the case at bar.” Lepore, 524 A.2d at 575. Here too, prejudgment interest was appropriate because the Veterans Home acted in a proprietary, rather than governmental, manner. As the statutory tort cap is inapplicable, the state, like any private person, is subject to prejudgment interest.', 'Alternatively, the state argues that plaintiff did not request that the trial justice award prejudgment interest, which therefore makes the award improper. The state’s assertion in this respect similarly lacks merit. The relevant interest statute provides, in pertinent part:', '“(a) In any civil action in which a verdict is rendered or a decision', 'made for pecuniary damages, there shall be added by the clerk of', 'the court to the amount of damages interest at the rate of twelve', 'percent (12%) per annum thereon from the date the cause of action', 'accrued, which shall be included in the judgment entered therein.”', 'G.L. 1956 § 9-21-10.', '“[W]hether [the plaintiff] specifically requested the interest by motion * * * [is] not relevant for the awarding of prejudgment interest pursuant to § 9-21-10.

State, 561 A.2d 384, 387 (R.I. 1989). “[O]nce the claim for damages has been ‘duly reduced to judgment the addition of interest is peremptory.’” Id. (quoting Kastal v. Hickory House, Inc., 95 R.I. 366, 369, 187 A.2d 262, 264 (1963)). Here,', '- 22 - that plaintiff did not request prejudgment interest by motion has no bearing on whether interest was appropriate. Accordingly, the award of prejudgment interest was not erroneous.', 'D', 'Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law', 'The state argues that the trial justice erred in her denial of the state’s motion for judgment as a matter of law. 16 Primarily, the state argues that plaintiff’s case relies on impermissible inference building in that plaintiff did not eliminate other possible causes of the spill. The state avers that because a third party with Room B-7 access may have caused the spill, a reasonable jury should not have been allowed to find that a CNA or housekeeper caused it, or that the liquid was present long enough to alert a CNA to its existence.', 'A review of the evidence reveals that plaintiff set forth legally sufficient evidence such that denial of the state’s motion for judgment as a matter of law was appropriate. Specifically, the trial justice recalled plaintiff’s statement that she fell on liquid, which she thought was housekeeping cleaning fluid. The trial justice further noted that housekeeping finished cleaning at 3 p.m. and left the Home by 3:30 p.m. She recalled that plaintiff fell around 4:45 to 5 p.m., more than an hour after housekeeping finished. She noted that many CNAs consistently testified that their responsibilities included patient-room and bathroom inspections about every two hours. The trial justice found that if the jury determined that housekeeping caused the spill, sufficient evidence demonstrated that the spill was present long enough for the CNAs to inspect, discover, and clean it.', 'The trial justice then recalled the testimony of Demello, the CNA who covered Room B- 7 during the 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. shift.', 'She noted that Demello testified:', '(1) patient-safety 16', 'Although the state moved for a new trial, it does not challenge the trial justice’s finding in this respect on appeal.', '- 23 - inspections were essential; (2) as a perfectionist, she conducted inspections at least every one- and-a-half hours; (3) one of the first things CNAs should do after starting a shift is check the patients, rooms, and bathrooms to ensure no spills or messes; (4) she was aware that discarding patient-bath water could cause spills; and (5) she visited Room B-7 frequently during her shift that day. The trial justice concluded that if the jury found housekeeping left the liquid, Demello could have discovered it through a reasonable inspection before her shift ended.', 'The trial justice also recalled the testimony of Morantus, the CNA who worked during plaintiff’s shift, starting at 4 p.m. She recalled evidence that one B-7 resident remained in his room for dinner, which started around 4:30 p.m. She noted that if necessary or appropriate, CNAs washed patients bedside, and, in the process, discarded excess water in the toilet. The trial justice also noted the CNAs’ high standard of care when washing patients and discarding water, which required avoiding spills or immediately cleaning up any spills.', 'The trial justice emphasized that all CNAs detailed the paramount importance of cleaning up spills in executing their functions. She recalled that Morantus was in B-7 shortly before plaintiff fell and noted that circumstantial evidence supported the inference that he was present in B-7 to feed a resident dinner. The trial justice gleaned sufficient evidence that could lead the jury to infer that one of the CNAs left the liquid, failing to reasonably inspect the bathroom during their shift. Because sufficient evidence allowed the jury to reach a verdict in plaintiff’s favor, the trial justice properly denied judgment as a matter of law.', 'E', 'Comparative-Negligence Instruction', 'The trial justice refused to instruct the jury on comparative negligence as she found that the state never articulated a clear comparative-negligence theory. The state asserts that this', '- 24 - refusal to instruct was erroneous. Below, the state struggled to communicate its reasoning in favor of a comparative-negligence instruction and later argued alternative comparative- negligence theories. 17', 'The state suggested that a comparative-negligence instruction was appropriate because plaintiff: (1) failed to supervise the CNAs; (2) failed to notify the CNAs; and alternatively (3) did not properly enter Room B-7 to administer medications.', 'These alternative suggestions justify the trial justice’s conclusion that a comparative-negligence instruction was not clearly articulated.', 'However, for the first time on appeal, the state posits a new theory, suggesting that the trial justice should have instructed on comparative negligence because the jury heard testimony that the plaintiff entered the bathroom before she turned on the light. “It is well settled [under our raise-or-waive rule] that a litigant cannot raise an objection or advance a new theory on appeal if it was not raised before the trial court.” State v. Bido, 941 A.2d 822, 828-29 (R.I. 2008) (citing Hydro–Manufacturing, Inc. v. Kayser–Roth Corp., 640 A.2d 950, 959 (R.I. 1994)). Because the state failed to sufficiently articulate its comparative-negligence theory at trial, and, for the first time, asserts a new theory on appeal, the raise-or-waive rule precludes our review. 17', 'At trial, among other inartful assertions of comparative negligence, the following colloquy occurred:', '“The Court: But, what was the negligent conduct?', '“[The state]: I mean, it’s really just that she had a duty of care.

In other words, § 9-31-2 presents the reader with a provision that is starkly clear (the legislative desire that there be a cap on tort damage awards against government), which provision is immediately followed by another provision (the “proprietary function” exception) that is undefined and not reducible to a precise definition.

In expressly acknowledging the General Assembly’s clear public policy option in that regard, this Court has stated:', '“When the government acts in the same manner as a private', 'individual, ‘the only difference between the State of Rhode Island', 'and other tort defendants is the [monetary] limitation on liability', 'contained in § 9-31-2.’ * * * This cap on damages * * * ensure[s]', 'that the state is not crippled by excessive judgments.” Catone v.', 'Medberry, 555 A.2d 328, 334 (R.I. 1989) (quoting Laird v.', 'Chrysler Corp., 460 A.2d 425, 429 (R.I. 1983)).', '- 29 - It is self-evident that the raison d’être of the statutory tort cap is to “protect[] the state’s treasury against excessive claims.” Barratt v. Burlingham, 492 A.2d 1219, 1225 (R.I. 1985) (Kelleher, J., concurring). I respectfully submit that that legislative concern about not saddling taxpayers with great fiscal burdens continues to be of enormous importance and should be constantly borne in mind in addressing the difficult legal issues that this case involves. 5', 'The majority correctly notes that § 9-31-2 excepts from the reach of the statutory cap “all instances in which the state was engaged in a proprietary function in the commission of the tort * * *.” The majority then focuses on certain opinions issued by this Court over the years which have sought to delineate what the General Assembly meant when it employed in that statute the undefined term “a proprietary function.” Those decisions relied upon by the majority vary in their analytical clarity, but they generally tend to equate a proprietary function with one that can be performed by a non-governmental actor as readily as by a governmental actor. See, e.g., Housing Authority of the City of Providence v. Oropeza, 713 A.2d 1262, 1264 (R.I. 1998) (“[T]he function at issue here, namely, the providing of security within and by the housing authority is proprietary in nature.”); Rhode Island Student Loan Authority v. NELS, Inc., 550 A.2d 624, 627 (R.I. 1988) (“NELS’s essential function[s] * * * to collect the principal and interest on outstanding student loans and to maintain records on all transactions * * * are proprietary in nature.”); Lepore v.

State, 448 A.2d 1293 (R.I. 1982). Although the specific issue before the Court in Andrade was the availability vel non of prejudgment interest, the Court opted to speak more broadly about the Tort Claims Act, saying that said act “must be strictly construed and whatever right of recovery is to be ascertained against the state must be expressly mentioned * * *.” Id. at 1294. I view that statement as reflective of a continuing judicial awareness that the Tort Claims Act is to be carefully cabined in accordance with the first clause of § 9-31-2. Subsequently, the Court quoted with approval that same language from Andrade in the case of Matarese v. Dunham, 689 A.2d 1057, 1058 (R.I. 1997).', '- 30 - that is so intertwined with governing that we will consider it a governmental function. Rather, we consider its operation proprietary in nature.”). 6 Those cases focus on the particular activity being performed when the alleged tort was committed. In my judgment, such a focus is not rooted in the statutory language and constitutes an “Open Sesame” for enormous damage awards—whereas I am convinced that the legislative intent as expressed in the statute was to limit the amount of damage awards in the governmental tort context save only for the genuinely exceptional case where government engages in a “proprietary function.”', 'By contrast, as I indicated at the outset, there is another line of cases that should not be overlooked. These cases focus not on the nature of the activity at issue but rather on whether or not the alleged tort was somehow related to the maintenance of a public building. See, e.g., Kuhl v. Perri, 706 A.2d 1328, 1329 (R.I. 1998) (mem.) (“[O]peration and * * * maintenance of a public school is a governmental function and not a proprietary one.”); Matarese v. Dunham, 689 A.2d 1057, 1058 (R.I. 1997) (“Maintenance of government buildings is plainly a governmental function * * *.”); Chakuroff v. Boyle, 667 A.2d 1256, 1258 (R.I. 1995) (“[T]he operation and the maintenance of a public school is a governmental function and not a proprietary one.”); Custom Flight Systems of New England, Inc. v. State, 641 A.2d 1324, 1324 (R.I. 1994) (mem.) (“[R]unning a public airport is exclusively an activity performed by a public entity.”); Saunders v. State, 446 A.2d 748, 751-52 (R.I. 1982) (“[The] maintenance of a correctional institution is a 6', 'The opinion in Lepore v. Rhode Island Public Transit Authority, 524 A.2d 574 (R.I. 1987) in effect defines “proprietary function” as being “one which is not ‘so intertwined with governing that the government is obligated to perform it only by its own agents or employees.’” Id. at 575 (quoting Xavier v. Cianci, 479 A.2d 1179, 1182 (R.I. 1984)). Notably, however, the quoted language from the Xavier case was articulated in the context of deciding “whether the mayor and the board can contract out the functions and duties of a city department that was created by the city charter and staffed and paid for in accordance with a duly enacted city ordinance.” Xavier, 479 A.2d at 1181. The opinion in Xavier in no way dealt with the “proprietary function” exclusion in the statutory tort cap.', '- 31 - governmental function. Consequently, in the event that a correctional officer employed by the state was guilty of negligence and was not protected by personal immunity, the state would be liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior for the negligence of its employee subject to the monetary limitation set forth in § 9-31-2.”). As I understand them, the just-cited cases indicate that the statutory tort cap (and not the proprietary function exception) should be applicable when the alleged tort is directly related to the maintenance of a public building. Accordingly, in view of the fact that the tort at issue unquestionably occurred in connection with the maintenance of a governmental building, I believe that these cases should control the instant case. 7', 'I view this Court’s opinion in the case of Matarese, 689 A.2d at 1057-58, to be particularly instructive and directly pertinent to the instant case. In Matarese, the Court was confronted with the following issue: whether a plaintiff who had been injured by a city-owned car driven by an employee of the City of Providence was entitled to prejudgment interest on the award of damages against the city (liability having been conceded). Id. There would be such an entitlement if driving the vehicle were held to be a proprietary function. However, the Court in Matarese held that, since the driver “was on twenty-four-hour call” with respect to the maintenance and operation of government buildings, he was performing a governmental function—and, therefore, the addition of prejudgment interest to the judgment against the city was barred. Id. at 1058. The Court in that opinion explicitly stated that the “[m]aintenance of government buildings is plainly a governmental function * * *.” 8 Id. (emphasis added). The 7', 'I would add that, in my judgment, the General Assembly’s clearly expressed preference for finite monetary limitations in the domain of governmental tort liability calls for the application of the statutory tort cap in doubtful cases—although I do not believe that this case is in any way doubtful. 8', 'It is important to note that, just like the plaintiff in the instant case, the plaintiff in Matarese “attempted to bring her case within the ambit of Lepore [524 A.2d at 575],” asserting that the “operation of a motor vehicle” was a “proprietary function” because that activity “might', '- 32 - breadth of that statement is noteworthy in that it is not in any way limited to the prejudgment interest context. Id. In the case at bar, the fact is that Ms. Roach was injured as a result of activities (allegedly conducted in a negligent manner) that related directly to the maintenance of the Veterans Home (incontestably a government building). Try as I might, I am unable to fathom why her situation is distinguishable from that of the plaintiff involved in Matarese or from that of the plaintiffs in the other cases that I have cited in the immediately preceding paragraph—all of which classify the maintenance of public buildings as a governmental function; for that reason, I do not believe that plaintiff’s case should be exempted from the statutory tort cap. 9 I realize that, if plaintiff had been injured while working in a private nursing home or in a hotel, the amount of damages awarded to her would have been far less susceptible to legitimate challenge. But that is not what in fact happened in this case. I am firmly of the view that the Matarese line of cases clearly should control. 10 The General Assembly remains free to increase the dollar amount in the statutory tort cap or, indeed, to abolish that cap entirely and allow tort claims against government to be treated just like such claims against private persons or entities. But, absent such legislative action, I am convinced that the statutory tort cap should apply to this case. just as easily be performed by a private person as by an agent of the municipality.” Matarese, 689 A.2d at 1058. However, the Court in Matarese disagreed with that argument based on the fact that the city employee “was engaged in a governmental function [(viz., the maintenance of government buildings)] * * * when the accident occurred.” Id. 9', 'I concede that not all cases under the Tort Claims Act will be controlled by the rationale of the Matarese line of cases, which focuses on the maintenance of government buildings. However, I am convinced that that line of cases should control the case at bar; and, for me, that is sufficient for this day. See Grady v. Narragansett Electric Co., 962 A.2d 34, 41-42 n.4 (R.I. 2009) (referencing “our usual policy of not opining with respect to issues about which we need not opine”). 10', 'This Court is free to overrule the Matarese line of cases if it concludes that the reasoning in those cases is faulty. But unless and until that happens, it is my view that those cases should govern the analysis and the result in cases involving the maintenance of public buildings.', '- 33 -', 'II', 'Prejudgment Interest', 'I am also of the opinion that the Superior Court erred in adding prejudgment interest to the award of damages.', 'I would not deviate from the rationale of this Court’s holding in Matarese, 689 A.2d at 1058. See Andrade v. State, 448 A.2d 1293, 1295 (R.I. 1982) (holding that prejudgment “interest is not an element of damages”); see also Andrade v. Perry, 863 A.2d 1272, 1275 (R.I. 2004); Mulvaney v.

With that in mind, I respectfully but earnestly submit that the scope of the “proprietary function” exception to the statutory tort cap cries out for definitive clarification by the General Assembly—lest the ever-beleaguered taxpayer be required to be responsible for very large awards of damages (such as those in the instant case) against a background of uncertainty as to the meaning of the “proprietary function” exclusion in the underlying statute.', 'For these several reasons, I respectfully dissent.', '- 35 - STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND', 'PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS', 'SUPREME COURT – CLERK’S OFFICE', 'OPINION COVER SHEET Title of Case', 'Victoria Roach v.

The state objected. On December 6, 2013, defendant filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds of duplicity and another motion to sever the counts. On January 23, 2014, defendant’s motions were heard and denied in Kent County Superior Court. Prior to trial, defendant also filed a motion in limine to preclude the state from introducing evidence of other uncharged conduct under Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. A pretrial hearing was held on September 22, 2014, at which Stephanie testified that defendant had sexually abused her “[o]ver a hundred” times during the course of “[t]hree years.”', 'At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion, stating that he was prepared to allow Stephanie to testify to those “instances of other sexual misconduct.”', 'A jury trial commenced the following day.', 'Stephanie testified that, when she was thirteen years old, after the weekend of July 4, 2009, she began smoking cigarettes. She testified that, shortly thereafter, at a family party at her aunt’s house in Webster, Massachusetts, defendant offered her his cigarette, handed it to her, and grabbed her breast as he pulled his hand away. Stephanie then testified that “[a]bout a week later,” when she was still thirteen years old, defendant called her into his bedroom and told her that he would give her cigarettes if she showed him her breasts. She related that defendant also told her that he wanted “to have sex with [her] and that it could be a secret for [them] to keep.” Stephanie stated that she then “lifted [her] shirt a little bit and he pulled it up the rest of the way” and fondled her breasts.

Stephanie testified that, about a week later, defendant called her into his room again and that “[h]e started talking to [her] about sex again and he said that he really wanted to. And he told [her] that [her] first time should be with someone that [she] knew, instead of if [she] had hooked up with someone[.]” She recalled that defendant “started undressing [her] and he bent [her] over his bed and he put his penis in [her] vagina.” She said that she “told him to stop because it hurt” but that “he told [her] that it always hurts the first time” and then he ejaculated inside of her, told her to go wash up, and “came back later and threw a pack of cigarettes at [her].”', 'Stephanie further testified that this abusive relationship continued and that, in exchange for sex, defendant would buy her alcohol, marijuana, or cigarettes. She said that the abuse ended briefly when defendant was in the hospital for approximately two months beginning in June 2011. According to Stephanie, the molestation “stopped for a few months because [defendant] was weak” but started again in March 2012, with defendant again offering her cigarettes for sex. Stephanie testified that, on this occasion, they “were in his room and he laid [her] down on his bed, and he gave [her] oral sex, and then [they] had vaginal sex,” after which he gave her a pack of cigarettes and “said that he liked that [they] kept doing it.” On direct examination, Stephanie again testified that the sexual acts occurred over one hundred times over the course of three years. 5 According to Stephanie, she never disclosed the sexual nature of her relationship with 5', 'On cross-examination, Stephanie testified that the sexual acts occurred at least one hundred times during the two-year period between July 2009 and June 2011.

When asked what prompted her to tell Hogan, she responded that she had been failing in school, had gone through a mental breakdown, had cut off almost all of her hair, and was feeling really depressed.', 'The state next called Hogan to testify for the prosecution. The defendant objected on the ground that Hogan was not listed as a witness in the state’s response to discovery and no summary of her testimony had been provided. The trial justice however, rejected defendant’s arguments and allowed the witness to testify. Hogan testified that Stephanie had “completely changed,” stating that “[s]he went from a great student, to failing out of school. Her appearance changed. Her behavior and attitude changed. She cut off all of her hair. She just completely changed. She was not the girl I had known for the previous [fifteen] years of her life.” Hogan also testified that, in June 2012, Stephanie stayed with her for a week and confided information to her that shocked her. Hogan described Stephanie as “[s]haking, crying” and at times unable to speak as she tried to answer Hogan’s questions.', 'The defense presented the following witnesses: Det.

Stephanie’s sister testified to Stephanie’s regular schedule and daily household activities. Danielle Walker, Cathrine Thibedau, Heather-Rose Mattias, and Jacqueline Walker all testified as character witnesses for defendant.', 'At the end of the state’s case and again at the close of the evidence, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on count 1 on the grounds of duplicity.

On December 17, 2014, the trial justice sentenced defendant to twenty-five years to serve on count 1 with “sexual abuse counseling as provided at the prison” and registration as a sex offender upon release.

Specifically, defendant takes issue with the admission of Stephanie’s testimony that defendant sexually assaulted her over one hundred times over the course of three years. He contends that the trial justice abused his discretion in admitting the evidence because (1) the evidence “was not reasonably necessary to the [s]tate’s case and the [trial justice] failed to make a determination that it was reasonably necessary and not cumulative[,]” (2) the trial justice “failed to delineate a specific exception to which the evidence was relevant and failed to properly instruct the jury as to the limited use for which the evidence was to be considered[,]” (3) “there was no determination made that the [uncharged] conduct was non-remote and similar to” the conduct for which defendant was being tried, and (4) the evidence was more prejudicial than probative. The defendant also argues that the trial justice erred by “giving a ‘scattershot’ [limiting] instruction to the jury regarding the permissible uses [of the] other-acts evidence in this case.” The defendant seeks reversal of his conviction on all counts.', '1.

Gomes, 690 A.2d 310 (R.I. 1997), for the proposition that evidence of uncharged sexual offenses committed against a complaining witness “may be introduced to show the accused’s lewd disposition or intent towards the [complaining witness].” The Jalette Court, however, was quick to admonish “that this type of evidence should be sparingly used by the prosecution and only when reasonably necessary.” Jalette, 119 R.I. at 627, 382 A.2d at 533. This Court further cabined the admissibility of such evidence in Gomes:', '-7-', '“Other-acts evidence should be excluded if it is merely cumulative.', '* * * Second, the evidence is only to be admitted when the', 'exception is relevant to proving the charges lodged against the', 'defendant. * * * Finally, a trial court should designate with', 'particularity the specific exception to which the evidence is', 'relevant and instruct the jury concerning the limited use for which', 'the evidence is to be considered.” Gomes, 690 A.2d at 317.', 'Here, the trial justice explained that the sexual conduct at issue in the uncharged offenses all involved the same complaining witness (Stephanie) as in the indicted offenses, thereby tending to demonstrate defendant’s “incestuous and lustful attitude toward” Stephanie. The trial justice also determined that the evidence displayed a “common thread among all of [the] charged instances, as well as the uncharged instances” whereby defendant employed a system of barter, in which “in exchange for cigarettes, or alcohol, or marijuana, * * * defendant solicited the complaining witness, to participate with her [sic] in sexual activities.” Finally, the trial justice determined that the other-acts evidence displayed “a common opportunity, intent, plan, with those acts that [were] charged.”', 'The defendant ascribes error to the trial justice’s admission of this evidence for several reasons. First, he argues that the other-acts evidence “was not reasonably necessary to the [s]tate’s case and that the [trial justice] failed to make a determination that it was reasonably necessary * * *.” He maintains that the evidence is “vague and not specific as to time, place and manner of sexual assault” and is merely cumulative.', 'Although it is true that the trial justice did not specifically state that the other-acts evidence in this case was “reasonably necessary,” we are satisfied that he did not abuse his discretion by admitting the proffered testimony. As he explained in his decision, Stephanie’s testimony concerning the more than one hundred instances of sexual misconduct during a three- year period was highly probative of defendant’s lewd disposition toward her. Moreover, her', '-8- testimony that “[u]sually, the same thing happened every time” was indicative of a common opportunity, intent, and plan with the offenses for which defendant was being tried.', 'This Court has long recognized that “evidence of other not too remote sex crimes with the particular person concerned in the crime on trial may be introduced to show the accused’s ‘lewd disposition or * * * intent’ towards the person[.]” Jalette, 119 R.I. at 627, 382 A.2d at 533 (quoting People v. Kelley, 424 P.2d 947, 955 (Cal. 1967)). We are well satisfied that, in the case under review, such evidence was both very probative and reasonably necessary. The state’s entire case rested primarily upon Stephanie’s testimony and more particularly upon her credibility, which was constantly called into question during the trial. Even her own mother testified that Stephanie had a reputation among the members of her extended family as being “more untruthful, than truthful.” The admission of the other-acts evidence in this case tended to demonstrate defendant’s lustful disposition toward his stepdaughter, as well as “his attitude regarding sexual activity with the victim.” Gomes, 690 A.2d at 316.', 'The defendant next argues that the trial justice erred by “fail[ing] to delineate a specific exception to which the [other-acts] evidence was relevant and fail[ing] to properly instruct the jury as to the limited [purpose] for which the evidence was to be considered.” On the contrary, the trial justice explained that most courts allow evidence of other sexual acts against the same victim and that the evidence at issue is probative of defendant’s “lewd disposition” toward Stephanie, and shows a common thread of defendant’s use of a bartering system of sex for drugs, cigarettes, and alcohol.', 'The trial justice’s statements indicate that he determined that the uncharged conduct was interwoven with the charged conduct and necessary to paint a picture of defendant’s continued abuse and use of a bartering system, a theory advanced by the state at trial.', '-9- We are of the opinion, therefore, that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in allowing Stephanie to testify about the other-acts evidence under this theory.', 'The defendant concedes that the trial justice initially stated that he felt the evidence fell under the “lewd disposition” exception; defendant argues, however, that the trial justice mentioned other exceptions as well, thereby abusing his discretion by making his ruling “too broad.” At trial, the trial justice explained that his enumeration of the other exceptions contained within Rule 404(b) was intended “to be inclusive, not scattershot[,]” because Stephanie’s testimony “has elements of each of those [exceptions] in it.”', 'We agree. In denying defendant’s motion in limine, the trial justice stated that the uncharged acts “display[ed] a common opportunity, intent, plan, with those acts that are charged.” We discern no error in the trial justice’s ruling. The evidence in question, if believed by the jury, bespeaks of a carefully conceived plan to victimize Stephanie and to coerce her compliance with defendant’s lustful desires by exploiting his role of authority as her stepfather and enticing her with cigarettes, alcohol, and other favors. It is both probative and permissible under Rule 404(b).', 'The defendant also argues that the trial justice erred when he gave a “scattershot” limiting instruction to the jury regarding the permissible uses of the other-acts evidence in this case. Specifically, he maintains that the jury instruction concerning the Rule 404(b) evidence was too broad and misled the jury. “We undergo a review of jury instructions on a de novo basis.” State v. Martin, 68 A.3d 467, 473 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Lopez, 45 A.3d 1, 22 (R.I. 2012)). “Moreover, we review jury instructions ‘to ascertain the manner in which a jury of ordinary intelligent laypeople would have understood them, * * * and we review challenged portions of jury instructions in the context in which they were rendered.’” Id.

As Jalette, 119 R.I. at 627-28, 382 A.2d at 533 made clear, “[i]n its charge the trial court should not take a scatter-shot approach and list all of the exceptions to the exclusionary rule. Rather, it shall designate with particularity the specific exceptions to which the ‘other crimes’ evidence is relevant and delete from its charge the remaining exceptions.”', 'In the case at bar, the trial justice admonished the jurors that they could not consider the uncharged sexual assaults as evidence to prove character or that defendant had a propensity to commit sexual acts. He further instructed the jurors that they could consider the other acts of wrongful conduct only as evidence of motive, intent, absence of mistake, and defendant’s lewd disposition towards Stephanie. We perceive no error in the trial justice’s instructions. He properly informed the jury that it could not consider the uncharged acts of sexual misconduct as evidence of defendant’s bad character or his propensity to commit sexual acts.', 'He then delineated four specific uses for which the evidence might be considered, all of which are permissible uses under Rule 404(b). We reject defendant’s contention that the charge to the jury was so prejudicial to defendant as to warrant a reversal of his conviction.', 'The defendant also faults the trial justice for failing to make a determination that the other-acts evidence was nonremote and similar to the offenses for which defendant was on trial. The trial justice did make a finding, however, that the uncharged acts were “not too distant from the charge[d] instances, and they do display a common opportunity, intent, plan, with those acts * * * charged.” This finding is consistent with Stephanie’s testimony that the more than one hundred uncharged acts of sexual misconduct occurred during a three-year period from 2009 to 2012, i.e., the same time frame as the three charged offenses, and that “[u]sually, the same thing happened every time.”', '- 11 -', 'Finally, with respect to the Rule 404(b) evidence, defendant argues that it was highly prejudicial and should have been excluded. Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence provides that even relevant evidence “may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.” We have cautioned, however, that “Rule 403 ‘must be exercised sparingly,’ * * * and ‘only when [the] evidence demonstrate[s] mere marginal relevance and enormous unfair prejudice should the trial justice exclude it.’” State v. Virola, 115 A.3d 980, 996 (R.I. 2015) (quoting State v. Brown, 42 A.3d 1239, 1244 (R.I. 2012) and State v. Bishop, 68 A.3d 409, 422 (R.I. 2013)).', 'As in most matters concerning the admission or exclusion of evidence, the application of Rule 403 in any given circumstance is entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial justice. See Rios, 996 A.2d at 638. Here, we have no cause to disturb the trial justice’s ruling. Although Stephanie’s testimony that defendant sexually assaulted her more than one hundred times was undoubtedly prejudicial to him, it clearly was more than marginally relevant, for it demonstrated in no uncertain terms defendant’s lewd disposition towards Stephanie. We are of the opinion that the trial justice’s ruling admitting such evidence into the record was a sustainable exercise of his considerable discretion in evidentiary matters.', 'B', 'Testimony of Donna Hogan', 'The defendant next argues that the trial justice erred when he allowed the state to introduce Donna Hogan as a witness in violation of Rule 16 of the Superior Court Rules of', '- 12 - Criminal Procedure. 6 The defendant supports this argument by claiming that Hogan was not listed in the state’s response to discovery and no proper summary of Hogan’s testimony was given to defendant. The state concedes that it omitted Hogan’s name from the list of witnesses in the discovery response. The state also concedes that the police package did not contain any statement given by Hogan herself. However, the state argues that the police packet provided to defendant in discovery was sufficient to put defendant on notice of the state’s intention to call Hogan as a witness. Moreover, the state argues that the report of a child protective investigator, which was disclosed to defendant, summarized a conversation with Hogan, which effectively put defendant on notice of Hogan’s anticipated testimony.', '1.

The state explained that a criminal information package was provided to defendant, which included a statement from the witness. The defendant argued that the statements were not taken from Hogan, herself, so they were not statements from the witness. The state explained that a statement of Hogan was taken by the DCYF worker, Robert McMahon. The trial court pointed out that defendant received the statement of Hogan, taken by McMahon, through discovery and that the statement is about three- quarters of a page long.

The plaintiff was the first and only witness to testify and he described what occurred on the day of the incident.', 'He testified that, on September 12, 2003, he was helping his friend move some items from her second-floor apartment. The plaintiff said that he had gone up and down the stairs roughly “seven to ten” times carrying boxes down for his friend before he attempted to bring down the two-drawer nightstand. He claimed that he proceeded to drag the nightstand outside of his friend’s apartment and towards the doorway and “maneuver it to get it down * * * [the] small, tight spiral staircase” and that he “leaned on the bannister [sic] that was behind [him].” He stated that, “[a]s [he] leaned against the bannister [sic], it cracked and [he] fell * * * downstairs.” He explained that the stairs were to his left and that he fell straight “down the drop,” meaning that he did not fall', '-3- down the stairs, but rather made a direct fall to the first-floor landing. He testified that, as the banister gave way, he pushed the furniture back so that it would not fall with him. At the moment just before the fall, both of his hands were on the nightstand and his backside was leaning against the banister. He denied putting any type of force against the banister to try to break it and instead said that he put “[j]ust a little bit of pressure.” He explained that the only reason he touched the railing was because the area was small and he “had no where [sic] else to go.”', 'The plaintiff testified that, after his fall, his friend took him home and that, on the next day, after observing that his wrist was “really swollen[,] * * * [he] knew [he] had to go to the hospital.” He proceeded to describe his injuries, which included a broken wrist, strained back, and cut knee, and he described the different treatments he received, including surgery to his wrist. Furthermore, he explained that he was unable to work for a period of time due to his wrist injury and that this injury had a financial and physical impact on his life. He testified that, as of the time of trial, he still felt pain.', 'On cross-examination, he conceded that he had not checked the railing on the second- floor landing area before he began moving but that he “might have touched it a couple times”— never rattling or shaking it. He testified that he did use the railing on the side of the stairs to help him go up and down the stairs. He acknowledged that the railing was not broken before he started moving, but he also expressed that he did not think he broke it. He recognized that he had simply heard a crack, the banister had broken, and he had fallen through.', 'At the close of plaintiff’s testimony, and outside the presence of the jury, defendant moved for judgment as a matter of law on the basis that there was no evidence to suggest that anything was wrong with the banister or landing, nor was there any evidence that defendant', '-4- knew or should have known of a danger or defect. The defendant argued that plaintiff failed to present any evidence that defendant breached her duty of care. The plaintiff strongly opposed the motion, arguing that the elements of negligence had been met. Specifically, plaintiff argued that the trial evidence showed that there was inadequate space to move furniture in and out of the second-floor apartment without having to lean into the banister due to the small size of the landing. The plaintiff insisted that defendant, therefore, had a duty of placing a strong railing and post on the landing and, had she done so, he would not have been injured. The trial justice expressed concern over plaintiff’s case, highlighting that “there[] [was] no evidence what the defect was” or that any defect could have been discovered. The trial justice explained that it was “not a per se liability or a strict liability” case; nevertheless, she reserved her decision on defendant’s motion until after the jury verdict.', 'During plaintiff’s closing argument, plaintiff proposed that the jury should conclude that the railing was defective by virtue of the fact that it broke when he leaned on it. He also claimed that because the landing was very small, the jury could “assume common sense, that a landlord knew that was a dangerous situation” and had notice of said danger. He claimed that, because the railing was a safety feature, the fact that it “did[] [not] work prove[d] * * * negligence.”', 'After deliberations, the jury returned a verdict in plaintiff’s favor. The jury found that “[p]laintiff ha[d] proven by a preponderance of the evidence that his injuries were proximately caused by * * * [d]efendant’s negligence,” but that defendant had also proven that plaintiff was negligent. The jury calculated plaintiff’s damages to total $65,000. The jury assessed 35 percent of comparative negligence to plaintiff and 65 percent to defendant. After apportioning the', '-5- comparative negligence of the parties, the jury awarded plaintiff a total of $42,250, plus interest and costs, for a total judgment of $78,101.15.3', 'The defendant subsequently renewed its motions for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial. The defendant again argued that judgment should enter in its favor “due to * * * plaintiff’s failure to introduce any evidence that the railing or stairway was dangerous or defective or that * * * defendant knew or should have known that the railing or stairway was dangerous or defective.” Alternatively, defendant argued that a new trial should be granted because the jury’s verdict was against the weight of the evidence and failed to do substantial justice and because of plaintiff’s purposeful violations of Rule 411 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence.4', 'The trial justice issued a written decision on October 13, 2011, granting both of defendant’s motions. Although the trial justice could not “discern whether the jury found that [d]efendant was negligent as a result of a defect in the railing, the landing, or both features 3', 'Although the jury verdict form lists “the amount of the damages awarded to [p]laintiff after adjustment for his comparative negligence” as $65,000, it was later clarified that that amount reflected the amount of damages prior to the adjustment for plaintiff’s negligence. 4', 'Rule 411 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence provides as follows:', '“Evidence that a person was or was not insured against liability is', 'not admissible upon the issue whether he acted negligently or', 'otherwise wrongfully. This rule does not require the exclusion of', 'evidence of insurance against liability when offered for another', 'purpose, such as proof of agency, ownership, or control, bias or', 'prejudice of a witness, or when the court determines that in the', 'interests of justice evidence of insurance or lack of insurance', 'should be permitted. A party intending to offer evidence of', 'insurance or the lack of it should make an offer of proof of such', 'evidence out of the hearing of the jury. If the court determines that', 'such evidence should be disclosed, in the exercise of its discretion', 'the court may direct that such evidence be disclosed to the jury by', 'the court or by the parties in a manner best calculated to serve the', 'interests of justice and avoid prejudice, confusion and waste of', 'time.”', '-6- because the jury questionnaire merely asked the jury whether [p]laintiff’s injuries ‘were proximately caused by [d]efendant[’]s negligence[,]’” the court analyzed the issues with respect to both possible defects. In her decision, the trial justice held that, “[t]o the extent that the jury verdict was based on [a] defective railing, [p]laintiff failed to satisfy the preliminary showing required to invoke the doctrine of res ipsa [loquitur], let alone the showing required to present a jury question.” The trial justice pointed out that plaintiff had “offered no evidence that the railing was not properly maintained or that * * * defendant had notice of any defect.” The trial justice concluded that neither plaintiff’s testimony nor the photographs of the railing that were admitted into evidence indicated any defect in the railing. Furthermore, the trial justice rejected plaintiff’s new claim made during closing argument that the landing where plaintiff stood as he attempted to move the furniture was defective as there was also no evidence to support this contention. Accordingly, the trial justice concluded that defendant was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.5 Moreover, in her analysis of the motion for a new trial, the trial justice also found that the jury’s verdict was against the weight of the evidence.6', 'Subsequently, plaintiff filed a premature notice of appeal on October 27, 2011.7 An order entered reflecting the court’s decision on April 12, 2013, and final judgment entered in defendant’s favor on October 24, 2013. 5', 'The trial justice also found that it was an error of law to allow the jury to consider the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur when it had not been properly instructed on the doctrine. Additionally, she declined to decide whether plaintiff’s continuous mention of the fact that defendant was insured in violation of Rule 411 was sufficient to warrant a new trial or whether the jury instruction sufficed to cure the harm. 6', 'Rule 50(c)(1) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure requires the trial justice to “also rule on the motion for a new trial, if any, by determining whether it should be granted if the judgment is thereafter vacated or reversed * * *.” 7', 'We treat such a notice as timely.

The plaintiff first raised the issue on the eve of trial in an “Amended Interrogatory Answer” which the trial justice construed as a motion in limine. In her decision, the trial justice stated that she denied plaintiff’s motion because it was unclear whether the international code was incorporated into the Rhode Island Building Code, and, even if it were, it would be irrelevant because defendant’s property was built “decades” before the Rhode Island Building Code was enacted.

After a careful review of the record, including the trial testimony and exhibits submitted, it is our opinion that plaintiff has not met his burden. At trial, plaintiff acknowledged that the banister on the second floor was not broken prior to his fall. His testimony did not suggest that the banister was defective in any way. To the contrary, his rendition of the incident at trial was that the banister snapped or broke when he leaned against it, trying to maneuver a heavy piece of furniture through a small space. Even if we were to accept, arguendo, plaintiff’s argument that the fact that the banister broke when he leaned on it was sufficient circumstantial evidence that the banister was defective, this argument completely overlooks his additional burden of also establishing that defendant knew or should have known of the defect. See Tancrelle, 756 A.2d at 752. The plaintiff presented no evidence at trial as to any defect that defendant should have discovered. Instead, we are left with his testimony that, prior to his furniture maneuver, the banister was not broken.9 There is not a scintilla of evidence, either direct or circumstantial, that defendant knew or should have known of any alleged defect or dangerous condition. 9', 'Moreover, plaintiff’s closing statement suggested to the jury that the mere fact that the banister broke establishes that defendant was negligent.

The plaintiffs brought suit against three defendants and now appeal the Superior Court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of one of the defendants, Arden Engineering Constructors, LLC. Before this Court, the plaintiffs argue that the hearing justice erred because he made an improper credibility assessment about the affidavit of their expert and because he overlooked material issues of fact that were in dispute. The matter came before this Court for oral argument on February 23, 2017, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why this appeal should not summarily be decided.', 'After considering the parties’ oral and written arguments and after thoroughly reviewing the record, it is our opinion that cause has not been shown and that this case should be decided at this time without further briefing or argument.

After a jury convicted the defendant of two counts of felony assault and one count each of possession of a controlled substance, resisting arrest, and reckless driving, the defendant petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari, arguing that the trial justice’s jury instructions constituted reversible error because the instructions amounted to commenting on the evidence and were “confusing, misleading, unnecessary and bolstering.” 1', 'The matter came before this Court for oral argument on February 23, 2017, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why this appeal should not summarily be 1', 'The defendant, having failed to file an appeal within the period allowed, petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari, and we granted the petition.', '-1- decided.', 'After considering the parties’ oral and written arguments, and after thoroughly reviewing the record, it is our opinion that cause has not been shown and that this case should be decided at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of conviction.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On the evening of July 6, 2011, Sgt. Gregory Sion, a supervisor in the Providence Police Department’s narcotics unit, was operating an unmarked car on patrol in the north end of the city. As Sgt. Sion was traveling east on Ledge Street, he “observed two vehicles approaching [him] at a high rate of speed.” One of those vehicles was a silver SUV bearing Massachusetts license plates, and the other vehicle had New York license plates. It appeared to Sgt. Sion that the silver SUV was chasing the vehicle with New York plates and, as the two vehicles approached him, the silver SUV veered across the center of the road and into Sgt. Sion’s lane of travel. Sergeant Sion said that, to avoid a collision, he “had to swerve to the right to get out of [the silver SUV’s] way,” causing the right-front wheel of the police vehicle to go up onto the sidewalk. In response, Sgt. Sion quickly executed a U-turn in an attempt to follow the two vehicles. He said that he initially lost sight of both vehicles but, with the aid of a passerby who was walking his dog, he quickly located the vehicles near 33 Marietta Street. By the time Sgt. Sion came upon the vehicles, both were unoccupied.', 'Using his police radio, Sgt. Sion alerted the six other members of his narcotics squad about the incident that had occurred on Ledge Street, which he described as “a road rage type of incident.” While Sgt. Sion had been driving around the block to see if he could locate the drivers of the two vehicles, Det. John Bento and his partner Det. Leo Pichs, both of the Providence Police Department’s narcotics unit, drove to Marietta Street and parked their unmarked police', '-2- vehicle approximately halfway down the street, facing towards Charles Street. Shortly after arriving at Marietta Street, Det. Bento saw the silver SUV “pull out of the parking lot of 33 Marietta” and come towards him. Detective Bento alerted Sgt. Sion that the silver SUV had pulled out onto Marietta Street.', 'Soon, Sgt. Sion positioned his car behind the silver SUV, and Detectives Bento and Pichs were in front of the car. Sergeant Sion observed a lone male driver in the silver SUV, who appeared to be the same person who was driving the car when it ran Sgt. Sion off the road. He then ordered Detectives Bento and Pichs “to move in.” Detectives Bento and Pichs got out of their vehicle and approached the driver of the silver SUV, which was being driven by defendant, José Angeles.', 'There is conflicting testimony about what happened after the police “boxed in” the silver SUV. According to the testimony of Sgt. Sion and Det. Bento, the emergency lights on Det. Bento’s vehicle were activated, and Detectives Bento and Pichs, who were in plainclothes, verbally identified themselves as police officers, and Det. Pichs’ badge was clearly visible. Several eyewitnesses, however, testified that the police did not turn on their emergency lights nor did they identify themselves as they approached the silver SUV. And two of the eyewitnesses testified that they believed that defendant was getting “jumped” by random people.', 'Detective Bento testified that, as he walked toward the silver SUV, he observed defendant “manipulate something in his hand and put it under his leg.” Then, defendant put the silver SUV into reverse, striking Sgt. Sion’s vehicle, and proceeded to drive back and forth, ramming into both Det. Bento’s vehicle and Sgt. Sion’s vehicle repeatedly until he had enough room to escape. The defendant drove the silver SUV onto the sidewalk towards Det. Bento, at which point Sgt. Sion drew his service pistol and at “point blank range shot the left rear tire of', '-3- the vehicle in hopes that it would somehow disable the vehicle from running down [Det.] Bento.” However, Det. Bento was struck 2 and defendant fled the scene. A high speed chase ensued.', 'The chase soon ended after defendant crashed into a parked car and lost control of the SUV, which went down a driveway, and ultimately through a yard and into a fence. The defendant fled on foot, but the police quickly apprehended him. Officer Andres Perez, who at the time of this incident was a detective in the Providence Police Department’s narcotics unit, participated in the pursuit and capture of defendant. After defendant was taken into custody, Officer Perez returned to the abandoned SUV to see “if there was any evidence left there.” As it turned out, Officer Perez “seized [from the driver’s side floor] a clear plastic bag, and that clear plastic bag contained nine individually wrapped bags of suspected crack cocaine.”', 'The state filed a criminal information, charging defendant with the offenses enumerated earlier in this opinion. Before trial, defendant filed a motion to suppress the seized bag of cocaine, alleging that the police lacked probable cause to stop his vehicle or to arrest him, and that the cocaine had been seized illegally. After a hearing on the issue, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion. 3', 'During defendant’s jury trial, several references were made, especially during defendant’s cross-examination of the police witnesses, about whether the cocaine that Officer Perez seized from the silver SUV had been in plain view, and whether the police had probable cause or a warrant allowing them to search the vehicle. There was also testimony that a 2', 'Detective Bento suffered minor injuries, including abrasions and “some bumps and bruises.” 3', 'At trial, defendant stipulated to admission of the cocaine and the accompanying toxicology report.', '-4- suppression hearing had occurred several weeks before trial. When the trial justice imparted his instructions to the jury, he included the following:', '“Now, let me say at the outset, ladies and gentlemen, there', 'was testimony about the legality if you would of the seizure of the', 'cocaine from the silver SUV by the Patrolman Perez.

The trial justice did not err when he told the jury that “when reference was made to a hearing that occurred about six weeks or almost two months ago, that was a hearing held before me to decide those particular issues * * *.” Even if his choice of words was somewhat inartful, the trial justice did not disclose how, or even if, he had decided the issue. The defendant, however, would have us believe that this comment would lead a juror to', '-6- conclude that the trial justice had ruled in favor of the state because evidence of the seizure was admitted, and then that juror would make the additional leap to believe that, because the trial justice sided with the state on that evidentiary issue, the trial justice must also be siding with the state on other issues. We do not accept that argument. Trial justices make evidentiary decisions many times throughout the course of a trial, and the mere fact that a trial justice admits or excludes a piece of evidence is simply not a ground to believe that the trial justice is then biased towards one party over another.', 'We hold that the trial justice’s jury instructions were acceptable. Indeed, the challenged portion of the jury instructions is but one paragraph amid twenty-three pages of transcript that make up the jury instructions in this case. When we consider the challenged paragraph within the context of the entire instruction, as we must, we see nothing that would be difficult for a person of ordinary intelligence to understand. Moreover, there is an absence of anything that would indicate that the trial justice commented on the evidence or in any other way confused or misled the jury.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth herein, we quash the writ previously issued and affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

50,Abdoulie Njie : v. : State of Rhode Island.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. Abdoulie Njie’s application for postconviction relief, premised on ineffective assistance of counsel, was denied in the Superior Court, and he appealed to this Court, contending that the hearing justice’s decision was in error. This case came before the Supreme Court on February 10, 2017, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided.', 'After carefully considering the record and the parties’ written and oral submissions, we conclude that cause has not been shown and proceed to decide the appeal without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On September 2, 2011, a grand jury indicted applicant, Abdoulie Njie, on four counts: two counts of first-degree sexual assault (counts 1 and 2), in violation of G.L. 1956 §§ 11-37-2 and 11-37-3, one count of second-degree sexual assault (count 3), in violation of §§ 11-37-4 and 11-37-5, and one count of intimidation of a witness in a criminal proceeding (count 4), in', '-1- violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-32-5(a). On December 4, 2012, after numerous pretrial conferences, Njie pled nolo contendere to counts 3 and 4 of the indictment. In exchange for his plea, the state dismissed counts 1 and 2 in accordance with Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. On count 3, Njie was sentenced to fifteen years at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI), twelve years to serve, the balance to be suspended, with probation. On count 4, he was sentenced to five years at the ACI, suspended, with five years’ probation to run consecutive to count 3.', 'A week after Njie’s plea was entered, the state filed a motion under Rule 35 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure to correct the sentence imposed on count 4 because it was illegal. The state submitted that it had “mistakenly advised the [c]ourt and defense counsel that count four (4) of the indictment was a Felony Witness Intimidation charge under * * * [§] 11-32-5 punishable by up to 5 years in prison.” After further review, the state determined that count 4 was actually “a misdemeanor offense of Witness Intimidation under * * * [§] 11-32- 5(a) punishable by up to one (1) year in prison.” The state requested the court “to correct the sentence imposed in count four (4) to one (1) year at the Adult Correctional Institution[s] (ACI) suspended with [one] (1) year probation consecutive to the sentence imposed in [c]ount three (3).” At a hearing on the same day, with applicant present, the state’s motion was granted and the original plea form was modified to incorporate this change. A judgment of conviction and commitment was later entered to reflect the modified sentence.', 'On January 3, 2014, Njie filed an application for postconviction relief.', 'In that application, he alleged that his sentence and conviction were in violation of the United States Constitution and the Rhode Island Constitution due to the ineffective assistance of counsel. During a hearing on December 9, 2014, Njie’s attorney articulated that Njie’s request for', '-2- postconviction relief “should be more interpreted as that [Njie] did not make a knowing and intelligent plea at the time of his plea.” Specifically, his attorney argued that Njie “did not know the consequences” at the time of his plea because “[c]learly he did not know the proper charges.” The state contended that no evidence was “presented to [the] [c]ourt that [Njie] would never have pled if he knew [c]ount 4 was a maximum of one” year instead of five years. Further, the state maintained that, when the motion to correct the sentence was granted, Njie “had no objection through his attorney” and that “there was absolutely no indication from [him] on that day at all that he was now confused as to what was going on.”', 'The hearing justice, who was the same justice who accepted Njie’s plea, determined that “[t]he [c]ourt engaged in a pretty detailed colloquy with * * * [d]efendant before determining that his decision to change his plea was knowing, intelligent and voluntary.” The hearing justice indicated that “exactly one week after [Njie’s] plea * * * the sentence was modified so that it was still 15 years, 12 to serve on [c]ount [3].” Further, the hearing justice acknowledged Njie’s attorney’s argument that it indeed was “quite different to plead to a felony rather than a misdemeanor”; however, he noted that in this case Njie “was willing to plead to a very serious element, that of second degree sexual assault. So whether or not he had pled to a misdemeanor in [c]ount 4, it still would have been a felon[y].” The hearing justice concluded that Njie “failed to demonstrate that his decision to plead guilty to [c]ount 3 was not a knowing, intelligent and voluntary one in exchange for the dismissal of [c]ounts 1 and 2, in exchange for a 12-year term to serve.” Furthermore, the hearing justice established that Njie “ratified the change” on the plea form by initialing it, adding that “[i]t was a change to [Njie’s] benefit and not to his detriment.” The hearing justice found that “nothing that occurred on the 11th day of December, 2011', '-3- modified, interfered or diminished his waiver of his Constitutional rights.” After the hearing justice denied his application for postconviction relief, Njie timely appealed to this Court.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'Under Rhode Island law, postconviction relief is set forth in G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-1(a)(1). Perkins v. State, 78 A.3d 764, 767 (R.I. 2013). “[P]ost-conviction relief is available to a defendant convicted of a crime who contends that his original conviction or sentence violated rights that the state or federal constitutions secured to him.” Torres v. State, 19 A.3d 71, 77 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Otero v. State, 996 A.2d 667, 670 (R.I. 2010)). “An applicant who files an application for postconviction relief bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that such relief is warranted.” Rivera v. State, 58 A.3d 171, 179 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Anderson v. State, 45 A.3d 594, 601 (R.I. 2012)).', 'When reviewing an appeal arising from the denial of an application for postconviction relief, “[t]his Court will not impinge upon the fact-finding function of a hearing justice * * * ‘absent clear error or a showing that the [hearing] justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence in arriving at those findings.’” Anderson, 45 A.3d at 601 (quoting Chapdelaine v. State, 32 A.3d 937, 941 (R.I. 2011)). “However, when a decision regarding postconviction relief ‘involv[es] questions of fact or mixed questions of law and fact pertaining to an alleged violation of an applicant’s constitutional rights,’ this Court’s standard of review is de novo.” Id. (quoting State v. Laurence, 18 A.3d 512, 521 (R.I. 2011)). Nevertheless, “[e]ven when the de novo standard is applied to issues of constitutional dimension, we still accord a hearing justice’s findings of historical fact, and inferences drawn from those facts, great deference in conducting our review.” Id. (quoting Rice v. State, 38 A.3d 9, 16 (R.I. 2012)).', '-4-', 'III', 'Analysis', 'Ineffective Assistance of Counsel', 'Before this Court, applicant initially contended that his conviction should be vacated because he received ineffective assistance of counsel. When reviewing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, “this Court employs the well-known standard articulated by the United States Supreme Court in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 * * * (1984).” Perkins, 78 A.3d at 767 (citing Hazard v. State, 64 A.3d 749, 756 (R.I. 2013)). Under the Strickland test, “applicants must demonstrate both that ‘counsel’s performance was deficient in that it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness’ and that ‘such deficient performance was so prejudicial to the defense and the errors were so serious as to amount to a deprivation of the applicant’s right to a fair trial.’” Id. (quoting Hazard, 64 A.3d at 756).', 'When determining the performance prong of the test, “[c]ourts evaluate counsel’s performance ‘in a highly deferential manner,’ * * * employing ‘a strong presumption that counsel’s conduct falls within the permissible range of assistance[.]’” Reyes v. State, 141 A.3d 644, 654-55 (R.I. 2016) (quoting Bido v. State, 56 A.3d 104, 111 (R.I. 2012)). Further, to satisfy the prejudice prong of the test, “[t]he [applicant] must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.” Id. at 655 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694). “[I]n a plea context, [this] means that the applicant would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial and, importantly, that the outcome of the trial would have been different.” Perkins, 78 A.3d at 768 (quoting Neufville v. State, 13 A.3d 607, 611 (R.I. 2011)). Significantly, this Court has said that “when counsel has secured a shorter sentence than what the defendant could have received had', '-5- he gone to trial, the [applicant] has an almost insurmountable burden to establish prejudice.” Id. (quoting Neufville, 13 A.3d at 614); see also Rodrigues v. State, 985 A.2d 311, 317 (R.I. 2009) (“This Court previously has held that a lawyer’s performance in advising a client to enter a plea involving a shorter sentence than the client otherwise might have received is not ineffective assistance of counsel, such that the client’s constitutional rights have been violated.”).', 'The applicant’s arguments before us regarding ineffective assistance of counsel are minimal. Njie has not demonstrated that his counsel’s performance was in any way deficient. Moreover, the record is devoid of any evidence of deficiency. Njie has also failed to establish that any deficient performance was so prejudicial as to amount to a deprivation of his right to a fair trial. The hearing justice importantly noted that “[t]he [s]tate was always willing to go forward on [the] two counts” of first-degree sexual assault but that “[i]t was only at the urging of * * * [d]efendant through counsel that the [c]ourt * * * urged the [s]tate to dismiss [c]ounts 1 and 2 * * *.” In other words, Njie had “an almost insurmountable burden to establish prejudice” because his counsel had secured a much shorter sentence than what he could have received if he had gone to trial on all four counts. Perkins, 78 A.3d at 768 (quoting Neufville, 13 A.3d at 614). It is our opinion that Njie failed to meet this high burden, and, therefore, he has failed to provide us with the evidence required to support a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.', 'Knowing and Voluntary Nature of Plea', 'Although Njie’s application sets forth only his argument of ineffective assistance of counsel, his Rule 12A statement clarifies that his “complaint is best described as a lack of a knowing and voluntary plea * * * in that [Njie] at the time of his plea was misinformed as to the proper charges against him, and the co[]nsequences of the charges.”', 'Before accepting a defendant’s plea, a trial justice is obliged to conduct a thorough review of the plea agreement', '-6- with the defendant as is required by Rule 11 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. Rule 11 provides, in pertinent part, that:', '“The court * * * shall not accept [a plea of guilty] or a plea of nolo', 'contendere without first addressing the defendant personally and', 'determining that the plea is made voluntarily with understanding of', 'the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea. * * *', 'The court shall not enter a judgment upon a plea of guilty or nolo', 'contendere unless it is satisfied that there is a factual basis for the', 'plea.” Pursuant to Rule 11, a hearing justice “should engage in as extensive an interchange as necessary so that the ‘record as a whole and the circumstances in their totality’ will disclose to a court reviewing a guilty or nolo plea that the defendant understood the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea.” State v. Frazar, 822 A.2d 931, 935 (R.I. 2003) (quoting State v. Feng, 421 A.2d 1258, 1267 (R.I. 1980)). This Court will “not vacate a plea unless the record viewed in its totality discloses no facts that could have satisfied the [hearing] justice that a factual basis existed for a defendant’s plea.” Id. at 935-36 (quoting Feng, 421 A.2d at 1269).', 'Our review of the record reveals that the hearing justice found that the Superior Court engaged in a detailed colloquy with Njie before determining that his plea was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. During the plea colloquy, the hearing justice established that Njie “graduated high school; that English was his first language; that he read and understood English; that he was not under the influence of alcohol or narcotics; [and] that he reviewed the plea form with his lawyer before he signed it.” The hearing justice also went over the charges, the constitutional rights that defendant would be waiving, and the immigration consequences of his plea.', 'One week after the plea colloquy, the state moved to correct the sentence that the court had imposed and in response Njie said: “Okay.” After the hearing justice explained the reason', '-7- for the sentence modification, she asked Njie if he understood and he answered, “Yes.” Furthermore, she asked if she could write on the plea form in order to make the modification; everyone, including Njie, was amenable to her suggestion.', 'She further indicated that she directed Njie to initial the modification “to confirm [his] agreement to the change.” Before articulating the sentence, the hearing justice asked Njie if there was anything he wished to say. When Njie answered, “Yes, [Y]our Honor,” she treated it as the invocation of a right of allocution and offered it to him. However, the record indicated that, after briefly consulting with his attorney, Njie responded, “No, Your Honor.”', 'After reviewing the record in its totality, we are satisfied that the Superior Court’s modification of Njie’s sentence one week after his plea did not require the hearing justice to vacate the original plea. In Armenakes v. State, 821 A.2d 239, 245 (R.I. 2003), the defendant’s counsel had overlooked a statutorily required sentencing requirement and had returned to the courtroom later that day, after the plea had entered, to request an amendment to the terms of the sentence. In Armenakes, this Court determined that “[t]he second session before the same justice later that day was a mere extension of the first session * * *.” Id. Therefore, this Court concluded that the second session “was not a second plea nor was the original plea vacated; thus, repetition of the panoply of plea formalities was not required.” Id. Similarly here, although a week later, the second session modifying the sentence imposed on count 4 was merely an extension of the first session and did not require the original plea to be vacated. Furthermore, the hearing justice correctly found that Njie’s plea was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary.', 'Moreover, the fact that the maximum sentence for count 4 was reduced from five years to one year does not persuade us that Njie’s plea was not knowing and voluntary. Rather, what is persuasive is that Njie, who at all times was represented by counsel, knowingly admitted to the', '-8- charges. He was not misinformed of the proper charges against him, as his attorney argues. Therefore, it is our opinion that Njie has not proven by a preponderance of the evidence that postconviction relief is warranted.', 'We discern no error or showing that the justice who conducted the postconviction relief hearing overlooked or misconceived material evidence in arriving at her findings.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

51,: v. : William Walmsley. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. This appeal emanates from a tragic automobile accident that occurred on the evening of March 9, 2003, in Coventry, Rhode Island. 1 Maureen O’Connell and Paul Roberti (plaintiffs) challenge the hearing justice’s grant of summary judgment in favor of William Walmsley (Walmsley or defendant). This matter came before the Supreme Court on March 8, 2017, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why this Court should not summarily decide the issues raised by this appeal. After hearing the arguments of counsel and reviewing the memoranda submitted on behalf of the parties, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown. Thus, further briefing or argument is not required to decide this matter. For the reasons outlined herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'At about 10:30 p.m. on March 9, 2003, Jason Goffe (operating a Toyota Corolla) and Michael Petrarca (operating a Ford F-350) were high-speed racing on the New London Turnpike 1', 'The facts pertinent to this case are outlined at length in O’Connell v. Walmsley, 93 A.3d 60 (R.I. 2014).', '-1- in a westerly direction. Also present in Goffe’s car was passenger Brendan O’Connell Roberti. After losing control of his vehicle, Goffe whirled into the eastbound lane. At this juncture, Walmsley, who had been driving his vehicle eastbound, struck Goffe’s vehicle. This tragedy resulted in the deaths of Goffe and Roberti.', 'The plaintiffs (Roberti’s parents), in their capacities as co-administrators of Roberti’s Estate, initiated suit against several defendants, including Walmsley. The plaintiffs also sued Donald Goffe, Goffe’s father, who owned the vehicle he drove, and Geico General Insurance Company (GEICO), which insured the same vehicle. Moreover, Walmsley joined Petrarca and Tapco, Inc., which owned the truck driven by Petrarca, by way of a third-party complaint for indemnification and contribution alleging that Petrarca’s negligence was a contributing cause of Roberti’s death.', 'Donald Goffe and GEICO settled with plaintiffs prior to trial for $145,000 (Goffe Release) whereby plaintiffs released both parties from future-damages claims stemming from the accident. Additionally, plaintiffs agreed that all potentially recoverable claims by plaintiffs were “hereby reduced by the statutory pro rata share of negligence of * * * Goffe * * * under the Uniform Contribution Among Joint Tortfeasors Act of the State of Rhode Island, or the sum of * * * $145,000 * * * whichever is the greater reduction.” Similarly, before trial, plaintiffs entered into a settlement agreement with Petrarca and Tapco, Inc. for $250,000 (Petrarca Release), which released Petrarca and Tapco, Inc. from future claims arising out of the accident. In the Petrarca Release, plaintiffs also promised to reduce “any damage recoverable by [p]laintiffs against all other persons * * * jointly or severally liable” to plaintiffs by the “pro rata share of liability of [Petrarca and Tapco, Inc.] * * * or in the amount of the consideration paid” under the agreement, “whichever amount is greater[.]”', '-2-', 'Because of the settlement releases, Walmsley was the sole defendant who advanced to trial, which began on June 21, 2010. The defendant moved for judgment as a matter of law at the conclusion of plaintiffs’ case; however, the trial justice reserved ruling on the issue to permit the case to go before the jury. On July 2, 2010, the jury found Walmsley negligent and deemed his negligence a proximate cause of Roberti’s death. The jury also apportioned fault among each driver and deemed Walmsley 3 percent at fault. 2 The jury assessed the estate’s total damages and awarded $10,000 against Walmsley without modifying this figure to account for liability percentages.', 'The defendant then renewed his motion for judgment as a matter of law, which the trial justice granted. The plaintiffs moved for a new trial and an additur. Specifically, plaintiffs cited G.L. 1956 § 10-7-2 to request an additur to $250,000—the statutory minimum corresponding with wrongful-death cases. The trial justice ruled conditionally that, if defendant’s motion for judgment as a matter of law was overturned on appeal, he would grant plaintiffs’ motion for an additur. Alternatively, the trial justice ruled that, if plaintiffs did not accept the additur, he would grant their motion for a new trial with respect to both damages and liability. On September 22, 2010, judgment entered for defendant. The plaintiffs timely appealed, with the sole issue on appeal being the trial justice’s grant of defendant’s motion for judgment as a matter of law. This Court vacated the Superior Court’s judgment and remanded the case for additional proceedings. 3', 'On remand before a different justice, plaintiffs sought judgment for $250,000 entered against Walmsley per the additur. Conversely, Walmsley moved for summary judgment and sought a finding by the Superior Court that he was not required to pay any sum to plaintiffs, based on the two releases that he asserted fully satisfied the damages award. 2', 'The jury also assigned Petrarca 3 percent fault and Goffe 94 percent fault. 3', 'O’Connell, 93 A.3d at 68.', '-3-', 'The plaintiffs asserted that § 10-7-2 mandated a finding that defendant was liable to them for at least $250,000, irrespective of the minor percentage of fault attributed to defendant and the other sums received under the Goffe and Petrarca Releases. The plaintiffs further averred that G.L. 1956 § 10-6-7, which governs the “[e]ffect of release of one tortfeasor on [the] liability of others[,]” did not mandate a reduction in damages upon a joint tortfeasor’s release. Instead, plaintiffs suggested that the language of the applicable releases governed only the effect of a joint tortfeasor’s release, if any. Lastly, plaintiffs argued that, because they read § 10-7-2 as a special provision that contradicted § 10-6-7, which they described as a general provision, § 10-7- 2 prevailed and rendered Walmsley liable for the $250,000 minimum.', 'In contrast, Walmsley asserted that the court should enforce the clear contractual language of the Goffe and Petrarca Releases, which he averred would reduce his payment obligation to plaintiffs as an “other tortfeasor[].”', 'Walmsley further posited that, because plaintiffs had already received aggregated damages in excess of $250,000, reducing his liability under § 10-6-7 would not defy the minimum recovery provision in § 10-7-2.', 'In a written decision filed on May 6, 2015, the hearing justice found that the Goffe and Petrarca Releases fully satisfied the judgment against Walmsley. He began with the premise that a court does not interpret a statute literally when doing so leads to an absurd result. With respect to the legislative intent of § 10-7-2, the hearing justice opined: “Based on the remedial and compensatory nature of the statute and damages principles generally, it is clear that the purpose of the minimum damages requirement in § 10-7-2 is to provide a fixed, baseline recovery amount for any wrongful death plaintiff.” The hearing justice relied on Petro v. Town of West Warwick ex. rel. Moore, 889 F. Supp. 2d 292 (D.R.I. 2012), a federal district court decision that grappled with the identical statutory interpretation. He concluded that the purpose of the minimum-', '-4- damages requirement—namely, to fairly compensate wrongful-death plaintiffs—had been satisfied because plaintiffs received an amount in excess of the statutory minimum. Further, the hearing justice emphasized that adoption of plaintiffs’ reading of § 10-7-2 would create an absurd result, to wit a plaintiff’s recoverable amount would hinge on the number of tortfeasors in a given case—an outcome, he concluded, that the Legislature certainly did not intend. He opined that there was no causal connection between the number of tortfeasors involved and the amount of damages from the decedent’s death, and, thus, a damages award premised on the number of tortfeasors would not advance the statute’s compensatory and remedial purpose.', 'Again citing Petro, the hearing justice iterated that joint tortfeasors are “jointly and severally liable” for the $250,000 minimum amount reflected in § 10-7-2.', 'Thus, because plaintiffs settled their claims against Goffe and Petrarca in the amount of $395,000, the hearing justice deemed § 10-7-2 satisfied and concluded that “there is no basis for holding Walmsley individually liable for $250,000.” Finally, the hearing justice reasoned that state law clearly provided that the release of one joint tortfeasor reduces the claim against other joint tortfeasors. The hearing justice cited to § 10-6-7 and the Goffe and Petrarca Releases to pronounce that any judgment obtained by plaintiffs against Walmsley “must be reduced by $395,000 (the sum of the joint tortfeasor settlements).”', 'Accordingly, summary judgment was granted in defendant’s favor, and plaintiffs timely appealed.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“This Court reviews a trial justice’s decision to grant summary judgment de novo.” High Steel Structures, Inc. v. Cardi Corp., 152 A.3d 429, 433 (R.I. 2017) (quoting Boucher v. Sweet, 147 A.3d 71, 73 (R.I. 2016)). “We will affirm a [trial] court’s decision only if, after reviewing', '-5- the admissible evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, we conclude that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Id. (quoting Boucher, 147 A.3d at 73).', 'Statutes and court rules are also reviewed de novo. Raiche v. Scott, 101 A.3d 1244, 1248 (R.I. 2014). “In matters of statutory interpretation our ultimate goal is to give effect to the purpose of the act * * * .” Id. (quoting State v. Hazard, 68 A.3d 479, 485 (R.I. 2013)). “[W]hen the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, this Court must interpret the statute literally and must give the words of the statute their plain and ordinary meanings.” Id. (quoting Hazard, 68 A.3d at 485). “However, the plain meaning approach must not be confused with ‘myopic literalism’; even when confronted with a clear and unambiguous statutory provision, ‘it is entirely proper for us to look to the sense and meaning fairly deducible from the context.’” Id. (quoting Hazard, 68 A.3d at 485). “Therefore, we must ‘consider the entire statute as a whole; individual sections must be considered in the context of the entire statutory scheme, not as if each section were independent of all other sections.’” Id. (quoting Hazard, 68 A.3d at 485).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, plaintiffs assert a rigid and technical plain-language reading of § 10-7-2, maintaining that the Legislature intended that each tortfeasor be held to a damages amount of no less than $250,000. In support of this assertion, plaintiffs parse through the provision’s language and submit that, because the Legislature used the singular form, “he or she or it” rather than “they,” it must have intended § 10-7-2’s minimum-damages amount to apply to each individual defendant.', 'The plaintiffs aver that the inclusion of the word “shall” further bolsters this requirement that each tortfeasor separately fulfill that amount. The plaintiffs assert that the', '-6- hearing justice’s reliance on and citation to Petro was misplaced because “[t]he [Petro] court did not undertake strict construction analysis of the language of [chapter 7 of title 10] to arrive at its holding.” They argue that the omission of language in § 10-7-2 to signify the joint and several nature of damages indicates that it was not intended to be construed as such. The plaintiffs cite to similar statutes in other states that “contain explicit language” signifying joint and several liability to support their argument that the absence of “explicit language” here suggests no joint and several liability.', 'Additionally, plaintiffs declare that § 10-7-2 cannot be reconciled with § 10-6-7 because the latter discusses joint and several liability. Citing to G.L. 1956 § 43-3-26 for the principle that when two statutes clash, a “general provision” yields to a “special provision,” plaintiffs aver that § 10-6-7, a general provision, should give way to § 10-7-2, a special one. The plaintiffs assert that this Court should not read language into the statute “[a]s the plain language of § 10-7-2 does not provide for such joint and several liability of the minimum recovery * * * .” Finally, plaintiffs allege that the hearing justice erred in referencing the language of the Goffe and Petrarca Releases because they exceeded the scope of § 10-7-2.', 'We begin our task of statutory interpretation with a keen awareness that our chief goal is to effectuate the purpose underlying the Wrongful Death Act. To this end, this Court has recognized that the Wrongful Death Act’s “primary intent [was] the compensation for the loss sustained by widows and children in the eventuality of the death of the family breadwinner.” Presley v. Newport Hospital, 117 R.I. 177, 180, 365 A.2d 748, 750 (1976); see also Walsh v. Bressette, 51 R.I. 354, 357, 155 A. 1, 3 (1931) (“The primary purpose of the statute is to provide a remedy for the loss sustained by the death of the person upon whom the beneficiaries were dependent.”); Read v. Dunn, 48 R.I. 437, 440, 138 A. 210, 212 (1927) (“The damages are for,', '-7- and are measured by, the loss to the estate of the deceased resulting from the death.”). In other words, through the wrongful-death statute, the Legislature sought to provide compensatory damages. See Simeone v. Charron, 762 A.2d 442, 446-47 (R.I. 2000).', 'We note, however, this case’s unique posture, which sits at a crossroads between two diverging legal principles. On one hand, we have recognized that the Wrongful Death Act is “in derogation of the common law,” which necessitates that we strictly construe its language. 4 Simeone, 762 A.2d at 445; see also Carrigan v. Cole, 35 R.I. 162, 165, 85 A. 934, 935 (1913). On the other hand, “[a]lthough we must give words their plain and ordinary meanings, in so doing we must not construe a ‘statute [* * *] in a way that would result in absurdities or would defeat the underlying purpose of the enactment.’” Commercial Union Insurance Co. v. Pelchat, 727 A.2d 676, 681 (R.I. 1999) (quoting Matter of Falstaff Brewing Corp. Re: Narragansett Brewery Fire, 637 A.2d 1047, 1050 (R.I. 1994)). Indeed, “[i]f a mechanical application of a statutory definition produces an absurd result or defeats legislative intent, this [C]ourt will look beyond mere semantics and give effect to the purpose of the act.” Id. (quoting Falstaff Brewing Corp., 637 A.2d at 1050). 4', 'We briefly pause to reference O’Sullivan v. Rhode Island Hospital, 874 A.2d 179 (R.I. 2005), where this Court suggested, “The wrongful death statute is not, strictly speaking, in ‘derogation’ of the common law.” Id. at 183 n.9 (quoting O’Grady v. Brown, 654 S.W.2d 904, 908 (Mo. 1983)). Nevertheless, whether the statute is in derogation of the common law or not is not ultimately dispositive of this appeal. O’Sullivan does, however, stand for the principle that we should prioritize upholding legislative intent over employing a rigid or technical statutory construction. See id. at 189 n.19 (“[M]any of the decisions in the past * * * have crippled the operation of [wrongful death] legislation by employing a narrow construction on the basis that these statutes are in derogation of the common law. The modern authorities are in agreement that the objectives and spirit of this legislation should not be thwarted by a technical application.”) (quoting 3A Sutherland Statutory Construction § 71.05 at 271 (Norman J. Singer 5th ed. 1992)). Even assuming arguendo that this provision operates in derogation of the common law, our task of strict statutory construction must give way to the clear intent of the General Assembly, especially where, as here, construing the statute in the strictest sense would yield an absurd result.', '-8-', 'In pertinent part, § 10-7-2 provides:', '“Whenever any person or corporation is found liable under §§ 10-', '7-1 -- 10-7-4 he or she or it shall be liable in damages in the sum of', 'not less than two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000).”', 'Here, we decline to indulge in a rigid and technical reading of § 10-7-2. Although we acknowledge that a strict reading of the above language might arguably suggest a minimum- damages amount of $250,000 per defendant because the statute uses singular language when referencing defendants, we deem such an interpretation unreasonable. From a review of the entire statutory scheme in light of common sense, we conclude that the Legislature intended the minimum-damages provision of § 10-7-2 to apply on a per-claim—rather than per-defendant— basis.', 'We find further support for our statutory construction in the principle that “words importing the singular number may be extended or applied to several persons or things unless such construction would be repugnant to the context of the statute or inconsistent with the manifest intention of the legislature.” Van Arsdale, et al., 73 Am. Jur. 2d Statutes § 145 at 381 (2012); see also Public Citizen, Inc. v. Mineta, 340 F.3d 39, 54 (2d Cir. 2003) (applying “the elementary rule of statutory construction that the singular * * * includes the plural”). In fact, § 43-3-4, which concerns “[s]ingular and plural” in constructing and effecting statutes, provides: “Every word importing the singular number only may be construed to extend to and to include the plural number also, and every word importing the plural number only may be construed to extend to and to embrace the singular number also.” Because application of this rule would not “lead to a construction inconsistent with the manifest intent of the [G]eneral [A]ssembly, or be repugnant to some other part of the statute”—indeed, quite the opposite—we read § 10-7-2 to apply to multiple actors. Section 43-3-2 (outlining “[a]pplication of rules of construction”).', '-9-', 'Both the Wrongful Death Act’s focus on the act that caused the death (rather than the actors) and the statute’s general compensatory purpose reinforce this conclusion. The statute, which prioritizes compensating the deceased’s family for its loss, does not differentiate as to how many defendants caused the loss. Whether the decedent’s death was caused by one tortfeasor or multiple tortfeasors, the act’s remedial goal—and the amount of loss endured by the estate— remains the same. The plaintiffs’ proposed statutory interpretation could yield absurd results in that the estate’s loss in a wrongful-death case could depend on the number of defendants. That a decedent’s death was caused by ten defendants rather than one would produce ten times more damages despite the estate enduring an identical loss. Such a result surely was not intended by the General Assembly.', 'Finally, we remain cognizant of the “fundamental principle of statutory interpretation that every effort is to be made to harmonize statutes.” DelSanto v. Hyundai Motor Finance Co., 882 A.2d 561, 562 n.2 (R.I. 2005). Our construction of § 10-7-2 is in harmony with § 10-6-7, which governs the impact of one tortfeasor’s release on other tortfeasors’ liability and “reduces the claim against the other tortfeasors in the amount of the consideration paid for the release.” The plaintiffs suggest that, because § 10-6-7 references joint and several liability, it flouts § 10-7-2, and therefore the latter provision should take precedence. We disagree. Our reading of § 10-7-2 synchronizes with § 10-6-7 and effectuates the Legislature’s intent. The hearing justice properly declined to hold Walmsley individually liable for $250,000 based on the Goffe and Petrarca Releases because the release of a tortfeasor reduces the claim against other joint tortfeasors. We decline to interpret § 10-7-2 to hold Walmsley—a defendant that the jury deemed merely 3 percent at fault—liable for the $250,000 statutory minimum above and beyond the plaintiffs’ previously executed settlement releases for $395,000. Rather than separately apply the statutory', '- 10 - minimum to each defendant, § 10-7-2 meshes with § 10-6-7 such that the Wrongful Death Act is subject to joint and several liability principles.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

52,Carel Bainum : v. : Coventry Police Department. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. The plaintiff, Carel Bainum (plaintiff or Bainum), no stranger to the elderly, or the courts for that matter, 1 appeals pro se challenging the motion justice’s grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant, the Coventry Police Department (the department or defendant). This matter came before the Supreme Court on March 8, 2017, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why this Court should not summarily decide the issues raised by this appeal. After hearing the parties’ arguments and reviewing the parties’ memoranda, we conclude that cause has not been shown. Accordingly, we decide this matter at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons outlined below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'This case stems from Bainum’s allegedly unwelcomed visits to the Coventry Health and Rehabilitation Center (the center), a nursing home in Coventry, Rhode Island. At the crux of plaintiff’s case is her relationship with Michael Koczan, now deceased, a former resident in the 1', 'See Baligian v. Bainum, 983 A.2d 271 (R.I. 2009) (mem.).', '-1- center’s dementia ward. On or around October 16, 2009, Bainum was visiting then-ninety- seven-year-old Koczan, when Officer Ryan Desisto of the department asked her to leave, at the center’s request.', 'The plaintiff, after answering some of the officer’s questions, eventually complied with his request and voluntarily departed the home. 2 The plaintiff was also notified at some point 3 by the center’s employees that Koczan’s daughter, Kristin Wild, sought to halt any future visits from Bainum with Koczan.', 'Nonetheless, plaintiff, on more than one occasion, subsequently visited Koczan at the center.', 'For example, on January 23, 2010, while disguised with a blonde wig to avoid recognition by the center’s staff, she visited Koczan. A staff member eventually recognized Bainum, however, and informed the department of her presence. Because of her contact with Koczan, the department summoned plaintiff to appear at the Kent County District Court on a criminal charge of willful trespass pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 11-44-26. That action was later transferred to the Superior Court, where a jury found Bainum guilty. On September 15, 2010, a trial justice sentenced Bainum. 4 Although plaintiff appealed to this Court, she withdrew her appeal on April 21, 2014.', 'Following her criminal conviction, on August 15, 2013, plaintiff brought a civil action against the department. In her complaint, she asserted that her willful-trespass conviction was the consequence of two “malicious acts” by defendant: (1) perjured testimony of Officer Desisto during plaintiff’s criminal trial; and (2) altered police reports concerning Bainum’s visits to the 2', 'As a consequence of this visit, the department purportedly mailed plaintiff “a formal no trespass warning.” 3', 'We note that it is unclear upon which visit Bainum was informed of Wild’s demand that she no longer see Koczan. The plaintiff, in her complaint, asserts that she was informed of Wild’s request on her visit to the center on January 23, 2010; in department records, however, this fact relates to Bainum’s October 2009 visit. 4', 'In sentencing, the trial justice issued a one-year suspended sentence with probation and a no- contact order for plaintiff with Koczan.', '-2- center. With respect to the false testimony allegation, plaintiff contended that Officer Desisto testified that he gave plaintiff a verbal no-trespass warning on October 16, 2009, at the direction of Earle Lerner, the center’s then-administrator. The plaintiff referenced, however, an affidavit she obtained from Lerner just prior to pressing this claim. In it, Lerner contradicted Officer Desisto’s testimony by stating that he did not request a no-trespass order or warning for Bainum on October 16 because he wanted to first discuss it with his supervisor, who was absent that day. Additionally, plaintiff alleged that members of the department inappropriately altered Officer Desisto’s October 16 police report about Bainum. Based on these assertions, plaintiff submitted that members of the department including Officer Desisto colluded and conspired against her. She further declared that “[t]he perjured testimony of Ryan Desisto, along with other intentional malicious acts by him and other employees of the Coventry Police Department, were intended to harm the Plaintiff, and they did.”', 'On June 4, 2015, defendant moved for summary judgment on the grounds that: (1) plaintiff’s criminal conviction defeated her malicious-prosecution claim; (2) collateral estoppel barred any false-arrest claim; (3) plaintiff’s conspiracy claim must fail based on its inviable underlying tort claim; and (4) qualified immunity shielded defendant from liability. Before the motion justice, plaintiff asserted that: (1) “this is a case of collusion and conspiracy”; and (2) the doctrine of collateral estoppel is inapplicable because the department was not a party in prior litigation nor was a claim of collusion and conspiracy litigated in a prior case against it.', 'In his bench decision on September 14, 2015, the motion justice found that plaintiff’s complaint failed as a matter of law and deemed each of her claims, which he understood as false arrest, malicious prosecution, and collusion and conspiracy, to be meritless. The motion justice', '-3- disposed of the false-arrest claim as he found that no arrest had occurred. 5 He also found that the malicious-prosecution claim turned on whether a prosecution was obtained without probable cause and reasoned that plaintiff’s willful-trespass conviction “conclusively establishe[d]” the requisite probable cause, which resolved this claim as a matter of law. Finally, the motion justice noted that he had never heard of a claim for “collusion and conspiracy”; but, assuming that such a claim existed, he held that collateral estoppel barred it because it intermingled with the events underlying plaintiff’s trespass charge, for which she was tried and convicted.', 'On appeal, plaintiff urges the reversal of the motion justice’s grant of summary judgment. She argues that a genuine issue of material fact exists on her claim of “[c]ollusion and [c]onspiracy” because she offered “specific, admissible facts in the records, through documentation and affidavits” that constitute prima facie evidence on this issue. In her papers before us, plaintiff, in spite of the above-mentioned affidavit, describes the catalyst of her claim to be a scheme by Lerner to “set [her] up” and “keep her out” of the center. She asserts that Lerner discovered that plaintiff knew of Medicare fraud occurring under his supervision. 6 She contends that this led Lerner to retaliate by persuading Officer Desisto and other department officers to ban Bainum from the center. Beyond conspiracy, plaintiff challenges the motion justice’s consideration of collateral estoppel in his grant of summary judgment. 7 5', 'During the motion justice’s ruling from the bench, plaintiff interjected that she “never claimed false arrest.” 6', 'Appended to plaintiff’s prebriefing statement is an article from the Hartford Business Journal that explains Lerner’s role at other nursing homes in “lying to obtain nearly $1.5 million in state Medicare payments to cover business debts and improvements to his luxury homes.” 7', 'Additionally, plaintiff, for the first time at oral argument, asserted what she described as a violation of her right to associate or “gather” under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution because she was blocked from visiting Koczan. Beyond this claim lacking merit, the raise-or-waive rule forecloses our consideration of it.', '-4-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'We review the grant of summary judgment de novo, utilizing standards identical to those used by the motion justice, while examining the evidence from a vantage point most favorable to the nonmovant.

Washington Trust Co. of Westerly, 840 A.2d 1099, 1102 (R.I. 2004) (quoting Guilbeault v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 84 F. Supp. 2d 263, 268 (D.R.I. 2000)). Although plaintiff does not expressly articulate an underlying tort theory, we glean the underlying tort of malicious prosecution from her papers. 8 8', 'Despite plaintiff’s puzzling assertion at oral argument that she has not raised a malicious- prosecution claim, we will proceed with analyzing this tort because malicious prosecution is the only possible claim we can perceive from the record. For example, in her complaint, she alleges that her willful-trespass conviction stemmed from “malicious acts by the Coventry Police Dept.” The plaintiff also highlighted what she described as “[t]he perjured testimony of Ryan Desisto, along with other intentional malicious acts by him and other employees of the Coventry Police Department, [which] were intended to harm the Plaintiff, and they did.”', '-5-', 'Malicious prosecution requires proof that the defendants (1) commenced a prior criminal case against the plaintiff, (2) lacked probable cause to bring such a proceeding, (3) maliciously commenced it, and (4) the prior proceeding closed in favor of the plaintiff.

(quoting Soares v. Ann & Hope of Rhode Island, Inc., 637 A.2d 339, 345 (R.I. 1994)). Here, plaintiff’s claim is easily disposed of as a matter of law because proof of a criminal conviction conclusively establishes evidence of probable cause. See Horton v. Portsmouth Police Department, 22 A.3d 1115, 1123 (R.I. 2011) (“When probable cause exists to initiate a proceeding, a claim of malicious prosecution must fail * * * .”); Dyson v. City of Pawtucket, 670 A.2d 233, 239 (R.I. 1996).', 'Further, the plaintiff’s malicious-prosecution claim fails under the fourth element, which requires that the criminal proceeding terminated in the plaintiff’s favor. Here, the plaintiff’s criminal willful-trespass conviction clearly demonstrates that the prior proceeding did not terminate in her favor. See Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 484 (1994) (“One element that must be alleged and proved in a malicious prosecution action is termination of the prior criminal proceeding in favor of the accused.”); Horton, 22 A.3d at 1123 n.8. Because the underlying malicious-prosecution claim fails as a matter of law, the plaintiff’s civil-conspiracy claim must also fail; and, accordingly, our de novo review leads us to conclude that summary judgment was proper.', '-6-', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the aforementioned reasons, 9 the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.

Mr. Walsh was doing “voice data, cable TV installation” on the project; he was “installing wiring throughout the building.” On June 16, 2008, Mr. Walsh was severely injured when he tripped on a can of plumber’s glue that was on the stairs between the first floor and the basement.

It further posits that Mr. Walsh’s injuries are covered by the contractual provision at issue because they arose “in the course of his employment,” and it avers that Rossi’s obligation to indemnify and defend Lend Lease is not dependent on Rossi’s negligence having contributed to Mr. Walsh’s injury. Lend Lease asks this Court to vacate the judgment of the Superior Court and direct the entry of summary judgment in its favor or, in the alternative, remand the matter for further proceedings in Superior Court.', '-4-', 'As we have stated, the “purpose of the summary judgment procedure is issue finding, not issue determination.” Estate of Giuliano, 949 A.2d at 391 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Steinberg v.

After a thorough review of the record in the instant case, we have no difficulty in noting the presence of issues of material fact that remain to be determined. Accordingly, in our judgment, this case was not ripe for summary judgment.', 'We turn our attention, initially, to the contract provision forming the basis of this dispute:', '“To the full extent permitted by law, [Rossi] agrees to', 'defend, indemnify and save harmless [Lend Lease] and Owner, as', 'well as any other parties which [Lend Lease] is required under the', 'Contract Documents to defend, indemnify and hold harmless, and', 'their agents, servants and employees, from and against any claim,', 'cost, expense, or liability (including attorneys’ fees, and including', 'costs and attorneys’ fees incurred in enforcing this indemnity),', 'attributable to bodily injury, sickness, disease, or death, or to', 'damage to or destruction of property (including loss of use', 'thereof), caused by, arising out of, resulting from, or occurring in', 'connection with the performance of the Work by [Rossi], its', 'subcontractors and suppliers, or their agents, servants, or', 'employees, whether or not caused in part by the active or passive', 'negligence or other fault of a party indemnified hereunder;', 'provided, however, [Rossi’s] duty hereunder shall not arise if such', 'injury, sickness, disease, death, damage, or destruction is caused', 'by the sole negligence of a party indemnified hereunder.

The last clause plainly predicates Rossi’s obligations under the contract on a finding that Lend Lease was not the only negligent party.2 Such a finding is partially fact-based and has yet to be made in the instant case. See Holley v. Argonaut Holdings, Inc., 968 A.2d 271, 274 (R.I. 2009) (stating that, in a negligence case, whether or not there has been a breach of duty, causation, and damages requires factual determinations). Thus, if we apply the contract language as written (there being no allegation of duress or the like in this case), we are led to the ineluctable conclusion that summary judgment in favor of either party at this stage in the litigation would be inappropriate since there are unresolved factual issues in dispute. See Gorman, 883 A.2d at 739. Our holding to that effect is in line with our repeated statement that “issues of negligence are ordinarily not susceptible of summary adjudication.” Holley, 968 A.2d at 274 (quoting Gliottone v.

However, in Rodrigues, the wrongful death action against DePasquale was tried and DePasquale was found to be seventy percent negligent before a trial was conducted on the third-party action for indemnity.

Accordingly, when this Court construed the indemnification provision of the contract between DePasquale and Spino, it did so on the basis of a factual finding that DePasquale was seventy percent negligent.

We summarize below the salient aspects of what transpired at that trial, noting from the outset that there are widely differing accounts as to the chronology of events.4', 'A', 'Jessica’s Testimony', 'The complaining witness, Jessica, testified first at trial. She stated that she was born on January 11, 2002, making her eight years old at the time when defendant allegedly molested her. She testified on cross-examination that, in 2009, her aunt Lucy (who is defendant’s wife) had come to where she was then living in order to bring both her and her brother Jacob to the home that Lucy and defendant shared in Woonsocket. Jessica added that her parents, Charlene and Joshua, joined her and Jacob at that Woonsocket home some time later.', 'Jessica testified that the garage of defendant’s Woonsocket home had been converted into a computer room; she stated that defendant would from time to time call her into the computer room and “tell [her] to sit on his lap, and [she] would get distracted watching the [video] game.” With respect to the molestation, Jessica testified as follows:', '“[JESSICA]: Um, I would feel movement down in my private area.', '“[PROSECUTOR]: When you say private area, what are you', 'talking about, [Jessica]?', '“[JESSICA]: The one below where -- below your hips.', '“[PROSECUTOR]: Okay.

So one of his hands would be on', 'your vagina; is that right?', '“[JESSICA]: Yes.” Jessica further testified that the touching occurred over her nightgown and that, after defendant had engaged in the sexual touching, he would give her one dollar, usually in quarters. When defense counsel asked why Jessica did not do anything, she replied: “I was afraid I would get yelled at [by defendant]” because of “his bad temper;” and, she indicated that, at that time, “[she] didn’t know if it was wrong or right.” She indicated that defendant had touched her on four previous occasions, the last incident having occurred in April of 2010.5', 'Jessica then testified that she told her cousin (Christine), who is defendant’s daughter, about the alleged molestation approximately one week after the April 2010 incident; she noted that Christine ultimately “convinced [her] to tell [her] mom” about that incident. Jessica stated, “At first I thought maybe I shouldn’t [tell my mom] because if she got sick” or “stress[ed],” but “then I started worrying and my cousin helped me through it.” It was Jessica’s testimony that thereafter, at the end of April of 2010, she told her mother and her aunt about the molestation, at which time the two women were preparing to leave for a “[g]irls’ night out.” Jessica stated that her disclosure to her mother and her aunt was prompted by the fact that she did not wish to remain alone with defendant at his home while her mother and aunt were away; Jessica added that she was “sick and tired of it.” Although there was some discrepancy in the evidence as to just when Jessica and her family moved out of defendant’s Woonsocket home, Jessica testified that she remained in Rhode Island until September of 2010, before permanently moving to Minnesota. 5', 'Although Jessica testified that defendant had molested her on four previous occasions, for the purposes of the present appeal we are concerned solely with the fifth and final incident that allegedly occurred in April of 2010 because the other four were alleged to have occurred before defendant’s deferred sentence.', '-4-', 'B', 'Charlene’s Testimony', 'Jessica’s mother, Charlene, testified next at trial. She stated that, at some point later than April of 2010, she and her sister (Lucy) had been planning to go to New Hampshire to visit their mother,6 at which time Jessica asked the women not to be left alone with defendant at the house in Woonsocket. On direct examination, Charlene testified as follows:', '“[Jessica] was scared. She was crying. She said, ‘I don’t want you', 'to go.

On direct examination, Charlene testified that, at some point after April of 2010, she and Lucy visited their mother and, “later,” their grandmother in New Hampshire; however, she denied that they had visited her grandmother on the day that Jessica revealed the molestation. Although Charlene stated on several occasions that her grandmother had been alive at the time of Jessica’s disclosure, it was then her testimony that her grandmother had died on September 1, 2009. When confronted with this discrepancy in her testimony, Charlene indicated that her grandmother’s death may have been “around 2010.”', '-5- decided to take Jessica with them to New Hampshire.7 She testified that, from that day forward, she never left Jessica alone with defendant.

She testified that, in February of 2009, Jessica and her family began residing at defendant’s home in Woonsocket; she said that they did not move out of that home until October of 2010.

The hearing justice preliminarily noted that he was not collaterally estopped from finding defendant to have been in violation of his deferred sentence, even though the jury had acquitted him. Thereafter, he found Jessica’s testimony to be credible, commenting that she was “polite,” “[a]rticulate,” “[m]ature,” and had a “[g]ood memory.” Although the hearing justice acknowledged that there was “some confusion” as to the “chronology of events related to the incident itself and how much time transpired before [Jessica’s] family moved out of [defendant’s] home,” he ruled that such confusion did not undermine “[Jessica’s] recollection of the incident.” In his bench decision, he expressly stated as follows:', '-7-', '“This [c]ourt accepts [Jessica’s] testimony and finds that the', 'defendant at a time in reasonable proximity to April of 2010 called', '[her] to his computer room, sat her on his lap and over her clothing', 'moved his hand over her vagina.”', 'After hearing closing arguments from the parties, the hearing justice reviewed the testimony and evidence presented at trial and found that defendant had indeed violated the conditions of his deferred sentence. He specifically stated:', '“This [c]ourt is reasonably satisfied that this defendant', 'by this sexual contact with [Jessica] did not keep the peace or', 'be of good behavior as required by his probationary status. He', 'is declared to be a violator.” Consequently, the hearing justice imposed on defendant a twenty-year sentence with five years to serve. The defendant then timely filed a notice of appeal.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'At the outset, we note that the standard for finding a violation of probation is the same as that relative to a violation of a deferred sentence. See State v. Plante, 109 R.I. 371, 377, 285 A.2d 395, 398 (1972). In Plante, this Court expressly stated as follows:', '“We perceive no logical reason to support such a', 'distinction.

Both * * * are', 'placed on probation and retention of their liberty depends on good', 'behavior during the period of probation.” Id. at 377-78, 285 A.2d', 'at 398. The only issue for the hearing justice to consider at a deferred sentence or probation violation hearing is whether or not a defendant “has breached a condition of his or her probation by failing to keep the peace or remain on good behavior.” State v. Barrientos, 88 A.3d 1130, 1133 (R.I. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'Additionally, at a deferred sentence or probation', '-8- violation proceeding, “[t]he burden of proof on the state is much lower than that which exists in a criminal trial—the state need only show that reasonably satisfactory evidence supports a finding that the defendant has violated his or her probation.” State v. Tetreault, 973 A.2d 489, 491-92 (R.I. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).9', 'In determining whether or not a defendant has committed a violation of his or her deferred sentence or probation, “the hearing justice is charged with weighing the evidence and assessing the credibility of the witnesses.” State v.

In doing so, the hearing justice may “draw reasonable inferences from the evidence presented to determine whether the defendant violated the terms of his probation.” State v. McLaughlin, 935 A.2d 938, 942 (R.I. 2007). We “will not second-guess supportable credibility assessments of a hearing justice in a probation-revocation hearing.” State v.

The defendant further argues that the hearing justice erred in finding Jessica’s testimony to be credible and in overlooking inconsistencies among the testimonies of Jessica and that of her mother (Charlene) and her aunt (Lucy) with respect to chronology—specifically as to when various events took place. We are in disagreement with all of his contentions.', 'After thoroughly reviewing the record, we are satisfied that the hearing justice did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in assessing the credibility of the witnesses, especially Jessica, or in adjudicating defendant to be a violator of his five-year deferred sentence. As we have stated on multiple occasions, “the presiding judicial officer need only be reasonably satisfied that a defendant breached a condition of probation by failing to keep the peace or remain on good behavior.” State v. Bouffard, 945 A.2d 305, 313 (R.I. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted); see, e.g., State v. Seamans, 935 A.2d 618, 623 (R.I. 2007). It is noteworthy that we “accord[] deference to the credibility determinations of the hearing justice,” Jensen, 40 A.3d at 778, because “[w]e do not have the same vantage point as [him or her], and we are unable to assess the witness’ demeanor, tone of voice, and body language.', 'Our perspective is limited to analyzing words printed on a black and white record.” State v. Woods, 936 A.2d 195, 198 (R.I.', '- 10 - 2007). Consequently, it is not the role of this Court—but instead that of the hearing justice—to assess the credibility of a witness in a probation violation hearing.

Hazard, 68 A.3d 479, 499 (R.I. 2013).', 'In the instant case, the hearing justice carefully reviewed and discussed the testimony of the several witnesses; he weighed the evidence and assessed the credibility of each of the witnesses, as is required. See State v. Forbes, 925 A.2d 929, 934 (R.I. 2007). He prefaced his bench ruling by stating that often, in probation violation hearings, the ultimate determination as to whether a defendant has kept the peace and been of good behavior hinges upon the hearing justice’s assessment of the credibility of the various witnesses.', 'In this regard, it should particularly be recalled that the hearing justice focused upon Jessica’s in-court demeanor when making a credibility determination, stating:', '“This [c]ourt has made a careful and thorough assessment', 'of [Jessica’s] testimony that this defendant engaged in sexual', 'contact with her when she was living in his home.', '“* * *', '“I make notations often in the margins about the demeanor and', 'attitude and candor and memory of the witnesses that are testifying', 'before the [c]ourt.

Mature.', 'Good memory.’”', '“* * *', '“This [c]ourt accepts [Jessica’s] testimony and finds that', 'the defendant at a time in reasonable proximity to April of 2010', 'called [her] to his computer room, sat her on his lap and over her', 'clothing moved his hand over her vagina.”', 'Ultimately, the hearing justice found Jessica’s testimony to be credible; from his vantage point, he had been able to infer from her testimony and demeanor that the last molestation', '- 11 - occurred in April of 2010. After perusing the record, it is quite evident that the hearing justice had more than plausible reasons for accepting Jessica’s testimony.', 'We are aware that there were some inconsistencies between and among the testimonies of Jessica, Charlene, and Lucy. However, from a review of the pertinent case law, we are also mindful that we have “on more than one occasion acknowledged that the presence of some inconsistencies between or among utterances of a witness or witnesses at different points in time does not ipso facto render the testimony unworthy of belief.” Jensen, 40 A.3d at 781; see State v. Lopez, 129 A.3d 77, 85 (R.I. 2016) (“Percipient witnesses often differ concerning some details about events in which they had some degree of involvement.”); see also State v. Rosario, 35 A.3d 938, 948-49 (R.I. 2012). With respect to the testimonial inconsistencies concerning the chronology of events, the hearing justice stated “[t]hat [such] area of confusion does not undermine the remainder of [Jessica’s] recollection of the [molestation] incident that occurred between her and this defendant.” In the end, we cannot say that the hearing justice’s credibility determinations were based on an implausible foundation. After reviewing all of the evidence presented at trial, he was “reasonably satisfied” that defendant had violated the conditions of his deferred sentence.', 'When, as in the case at bar, an inquiry as to w hether the defendant violated his deferred sentence “turns on a determination of credibility”—and, after considering all the evidence, the hearing justice “accepts one version of events for plausible reasons stated and rationally rejects another version”—we “can safely conclude that the hearing justice did not act unreasonably or arbitrarily in [assessing witness credibility and in] finding that a * * * violation [of the conditions of the defendant’s deferred sentence] ha[d] occurred.” State v.

55,State : v. : Nigel Nichols.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. On December 6, 2009, David Thomas, on leave from the Army, and Domingo Ortiz, both of whom were twenty-two years old, were mercilessly gunned down and killed in front of the Garrahy Judicial Complex in Providence (Garrahy Complex) in a senseless act of depravity. A third victim, then eighteen-year-old Dwayne Thomas, was shot seven times but survived with permanent injuries. 1 The defendant, Nigel Nichols, was ultimately arrested, charged, and convicted of these inexplicable crimes. He now appeals from the Superior Court judgment of conviction of two counts of first-degree murder, one count of felony assault, and three counts of discharging a firearm during a crime of violence. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On December 5, 2009, David, Dwayne, and Ortiz planned for a night of “having a good time[,] * * * [d]ancing” and “having fun” at Club Ultra in downtown Providence. 1', 'David Thomas and Dwayne Thomas were brothers. We refer to them by their first names to avoid confusion.', '-1- On this particular weekend, David was visiting home from his military base at Fort Drum, New York; it was Dwayne’s first time attending a nightclub.', 'In the early morning hours of December 6, 2009, after an incident-free evening of “dancing, meeting new friends and just having a good time,” the club closed, and the trio proceeded directly to a parking lot to procure David’s car and return home to Boston. In the car, David drove, Dwayne sat beside him in the passenger seat, and Ortiz sat behind Dwayne in the rear passenger seat. After exiting the parking lot, David’s sedan continued onto Dorrance Street, in the direction of Interstate 95 North’s entrance ramp, towards Boston.', 'At the corner of Clifford and Dorrance Streets—in front of the Garrahy Complex—the vehicle came to a stop at a red light.', 'Dwayne testified that, while “waiting for the light to turn green,” he observed David “texting one of his friends” and “the next thing [he] kn[e]w, all [he] hear[d] [was], ‘What the F[uck] you looking at?’’’ Attempting to “see what was going on,” Dwayne arose to a fusillade of gunfire. He heard his brother “moaning * * * because he [was] in so much pain” and then Dwayne “blacked out.” Dwayne further testified that when he regained consciousness he had to muster “all [his] strength” to open the passenger door, exit the vehicle, and yell to bystanders that his brother “got shot * * * [and] needs help,” before collapsing on the ground. Twenty-two .40-caliber shell casings were subsequently recovered from the crime scene, all of which were fired from a semiautomatic weapon.', 'Devon Boswell, who considered defendant to be his “best friend” and “brother,” testified that on December 5, 2009, he, defendant, Kevin Innocent, and Kerron Phillip left Boston and traveled to Providence to attend a nightclub.', 'According to Boswell’s testimony, both he and defendant left their homes with a firearm that night: Boswell', '-2- carried a .45-caliber Taurus 911 and defendant a .40-caliber Glock 23 with a fifteen- round magazine as well as an extended magazine, capable of holding thirty rounds of ammunition, which they stowed behind the radio in Boswell’s vehicle.', 'Boswell said they arrived at Level 2 nightclub in Providence before midnight. Boswell and defendant left their firearms in the vehicle before entering the club. According to Boswell, they socialized in the club, hung out, consumed “a few drinks,” and met some friends with whom he and defendant had attended high school. Boswell testified that at some point during the evening he said to defendant, “Snag is crazier than you,” referring to a March 2009 incident in Boston in which a Keron “Snag” Pierre shot and killed “[t]wo girls [and] one boy,” all of whom were under the age of twenty-one. This comment caused defendant to become very upset; he responded “Snag is a bitch. He kills women and children.” According to Boswell, defendant was furious and “looking to fight somebody right away.” Boswell stayed close to him to make sure “he didn’t do anything or fight anybody.”', 'Approximately forty or forty-five minutes later, the club closed. As defendant and his friends were descending the stairs to leave, they became involved in an altercation with another club patron. Boswell testified that defendant “started swinging at the guy,” and then the entire group “started to beat up on” him for about fifteen to twenty seconds until security pushed them down the stairs. Eventually, the group returned to Boswell’s vehicle and proceeded to drive home to Boston.', 'Shortly thereafter, while driving in Providence traffic, Boswell’s car was sideswiped by an SUV. According to Boswell’s testimony, the SUV attempted to leave the scene, so Boswell drove up and pulled in front of the SUV to secure it. Boswell said', '-3- that he started fighting with the driver of the SUV, and defendant jumped on top of the SUV and kicked in the windshield. After some time, Boswell, defendant, and the rest of the party returned to Boswell’s vehicle and continued to drive to Boston.', 'Boswell testified that, before they reached Interstate 95 North, defendant received a call and directed Boswell to stop, prompting Boswell to pull over in front of the Garrahy Complex. There, two other vehicles arrived occupied by the acquaintances who had met Boswell and defendant earlier at Level 2. Shortly thereafter, another vehicle pulled up, driven by Kevin Innocent’s girlfriend, Rachel Regis. Boswell testified that defendant was visibly upset when speaking to one of his friends on the sidewalk. Boswell further testified that defendant went into Boswell’s car to retrieve his firearm. Boswell testified that he “[saw] [defendant] * * * [p]ull the radio out, le[ave] the radio hanging, [and] * * * grab[ ] his gun,” and “[take] the 15-round clip out and * * * grab[ ] the extended magazine and put * * * the magazine in the gun.”', 'A vehicle then pulled in front of the Garrahy Complex and stopped at a red light. Boswell testified that the vehicle was a four-door sedan with three male occupants, all of whom appeared to be between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five. According to Boswell, defendant then said, “[w]hat the fuck are you looking at?” as he stared at the vehicle and opened fire.', 'Boswell testified that, after firing several shots, defendant “got into [his] car” and everyone that had congregated in front of the Garrahy Complex entered their vehicles and left. On their way back to Boston, according to Boswell, defendant “screamed out, ‘Body number 8, left three of them slumped.’”', '-4-', 'Providence Police Sgt. Robert Yekelchik, who at the time was a detective assigned to the BCI division, was patrolling the area of Providence in the early morning hours of December 6, 2009. At approximately 2:30 a.m., Sgt. Yekelchik responded to a call indicating that there had been a shooting outside of the Garrahy Complex. Upon arrival, Sgt. Yekelchik saw a sedan with two male victims inside. He testified that the victims had apparently been shot and appeared to be deceased. Thereafter, the sergeant secured the scene and collected the spent shell casings. Sergeant Yekelchik testified that all of the shell casings “start[ed] from the passenger side of the vehicle and they appeared to be ejecting towards the front of the vehicle”—indicating that the shooter was on the passenger side of the vehicle because most semiautomatic weapons eject to the right when fired. In total, Sgt. Yekelchik collected twenty-two casings, all of which were .40 caliber. The sergeant subsequently submitted the shell casings to the Rhode Island State Crime Lab (crime lab) for analysis. At trial, Sgt. Yekelchik testified that the shell casings were indicative of being from a semiautomatic firearm and that they also had a unique rectangular mark on them.', 'Neil Clapperton, a criminalist employed by the crime lab, testified that the crime lab received twenty-two shell casings and thirteen projectiles from the Providence police in December 2009. In addition, Clapperton testified that he also received a .40-caliber extended, high-capacity magazine from the Providence police department for analysis. According to Clapperton, the extended magazine is capable of holding thirty cartridges and was specifically designed for .40-caliber ammunition, but was also capable of holding 9-millimeter ammunition. The criminalist’s goal was to determine whether the extended magazine fit a Glock pistol and to analyze the markings the magazine left on', '-5- the ammunition to determine whether the extended magazine created the rectangular marks on the cartridges. Clapperton determined that the extended magazine fit a Glock firearm “well,” but he stated that he could not conclusively determine that the shell casings found at the crime scene had once been housed in that particular magazine.', 'Providence Police Det. Angelo A’Vant was assigned to investigate this case in October 2011. He testified as to the difficulties he had in locating several key witnesses in this case. Nonetheless, Det. A’Vant testified that he traveled to Boston to elicit testimony from Kevin Innocent and his girlfriend, Rachel Regis. According to Det. A’Vant, Regis stated that she saw defendant with a gun in his hand on the night of the shooting. 2 Detective A’Vant testified that Regis then “pointed to [his] firearm and she said, [i]t was a lot bigger than the one [Det. A’Vant] ha[d] on [his] side,” and she continued pointing to the hand grip of the firearm and specifically indicated, using her fingers, that that portion “was a lot larger.”', 'On February 18, 2015, a jury convicted defendant of two counts of first-degree murder, one count of assault with a dangerous weapon, and three counts of discharging a firearm during a crime of violence resulting in injury or death. The defendant filed a motion for a new trial, which was denied. The trial justice then sentenced defendant to the maximum allowable prison term—four consecutive life sentences, followed by two consecutive twenty-year sentences. 3 The defendant timely appealed. 2', 'At trial, Regis testified that she did not remember seeing defendant with a firearm on the night of the shooting. 3', 'The defendant was sentenced to two consecutive life terms under G.L. 1956 § 11-23-1, murder; in addition to two consecutive life sentences under G.L. 1956 § 11-47-3.2(b)(3), discharging a firearm when committing a crime of violence; and two terms of twenty years, also consecutive, under G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2(a), felony assault, and § 11-47-3.2(b), for discharging a firearm when committing a crime of violence.', '-6-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'It is well established that decisions concerning the admissibility of evidence are “within the sound discretion of the trial justice, and this Court will not interfere with the trial justice’s decision unless a clear abuse of that discretion is apparent.” State v. Mohapatra, 880 A.2d 802, 805 (R.I. 2005) (quoting State v. Grayhurst, 852 A.2d 491, 504 (R.I. 2004)). “The trial justice will not have abused his or her discretion as long as some grounds supporting his or her decision appear on the record.” State v. Evans, 742 A.2d 715, 719 (R.I. 1999).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Admission of the High-Capacity Magazine', 'On appeal, defendant contends that the trial justice erred as a matter of law in admitting into evidence the extended, high-capacity magazine based on the expert testimony of Clapperton. The magazine in question was seized from defendant’s home by Det. Gregory Brown of the Boston police department, pursuant to a search warrant executed on October 19, 2011—nearly two years after the shootings.', 'Before the commencement of trial, defendant filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude the magazine from the evidence because it “ha[d] no arguable relevance to any issue in the case.” The trial justice denied the motion.', 'At trial, Clapperton testified that the magazine seized from defendant’s home was capable of holding thirty .40-caliber cartridges. He was unable to state with certainty,', '-7- however, that the twenty-two shell casings found at the crime scene had come from that particular magazine; the results of his examination, rather, were inconclusive.', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in admitting the high- capacity magazine and Clapperton’s expert testimony related thereto. He asserts that Clapperton could not establish within a reasonable degree of scientific certainty that the magazine seized by the Boston police was linked to the Providence homicides, nor were his test results probative as to whether the magazine was in fact used in the murders. Thus, defendant posits, the jury was allowed to speculate as to whether the magazine was connected to the crimes for which he was being tried.', 'The fact that the state was unable to establish conclusively that the magazine seized from defendant’s home was the same magazine used in the shootings, or that the spent shell casings were ejected therefrom, however, does not preclude its admission into evidence.', 'Such considerations may properly be evaluated by the trier of fact in determining the weight to be given to the evidence, but they do not affect its admissibility. See State v. Rios, 996 A.2d 635, 640 (R.I. 2010) (“evidence was relevant despite [witness]’s inability to say definitively that the handgun he had seen [the] defendant carry was the same as the * * * firearm he described as the murder weapon”); State v. Reyes, 984 A.2d 606, 615, 616 (R.I. 2009) (affirming trial justice’s ruling that “probability exists” that handgun found near crime scene and shell casings found at crime scene were used to murder [the] victim when a firearms expert testified that, “although he could not say with certainty that the * * * handgun fired the bullets that caused [the victim]’s death, the bullets were consistent with and could have been fired from that weapon”).', '-8-', 'In the instant case, the twenty-two .40-caliber shell casings found at the scene and the manner in which the witnesses described the shooting, were consistent with the use of an extended, high-capacity magazine. Significantly, Boswell testified that defendant had stashed two .40-caliber Glock handgun magazines, one capable of holding thirty rounds of ammunition, in Boswell’s car that evening. Boswell had also observed defendant retrieve the gun, remove the fifteen-round clip and replace it with the extended magazine. Boswell further testified that defendant later told him that he had “buried” the Glock because “[i]t had so many bodies on it.” He also testified that defendant said that he would never get rid of the extended magazine because “[t]hose were hard to come by.”', 'In denying defendant’s motion in limine, the trial justice said that he thought “there [was] a clear nexus to that which [was] found in * * * defendant’s apartment, even though it[ ] [was] a couple, three years down the road.” The trial justice also noted that “[i]f he ha[d] a fondness and a liking for this particular magazine, and * * * it’s a type of magazine that would have held as many shots as were fired during the course of the shooting in 2009, [he thought] it[ ] [was] clearly admissible.” The trial justice also found that its probative value outweighed any prejudice to defendant.', 'Based upon our review of the record, we are of the opinion that the trial justice was acting well within his discretionary authority when he admitted the evidence. Here, the jury was capable of sifting through the evidence that defendant was in possession of a high-capacity magazine, that he was seen inserting it into his .40-caliber Glock just prior to the shooting, and that the number of shell casings found at the crime scene were consistent with the use of such a magazine. The jury was then entitled to weigh the evidence against the state’s inability to establish that the magazine seized from', '-9- defendant’s apartment two years later was in fact the same magazine used to murder David Thomas and Domingo Ortiz and grievously injure Dwayne Thomas. Accordingly, we perceive no error in the trial justice’s evidentiary ruling.', 'B', 'Rule 16 Violations', 'Next, defendant argues that the trial justice violated Rule 16 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure when he admitted certain testimony of Boswell, Det. A’Vant, and Clapperton.', '“Rule 16 governs discovery procedures in criminal trials.” State v. Santiago, 81 A.3d 1136, 1140 (R.I. 2014). “The overarching purpose of Rule 16 is ‘to ensure that criminal trials are fundamentally fair.’” Santiago, 81 A.3d at 1140 (quoting State v. Briggs, 886 A.2d 735, 754 (R.I. 2005)). “The rule strives to avoid surprise at trial.” Id. “It includes a requirement that ‘[w]hen a criminal defendant requests discovery material concerning witnesses the state may call to testify at trial, Rule 16 obligates the state to produce only prior recorded statements of a witness, a summary of the witness’s expected trial testimony, and any records of prior convictions.’” Santiago, 81 A.3d at 1140 (quoting Briggs, 886 A.2d at 754).', '“Significantly, Rule 16 also imposes a continuing duty to disclose.” Santiago, 81 A.3d at 1140. “This duty requires a party, having previously complied with requests for discovery, to ‘promptly notify the other party of the existence’ of ‘additional material previously requested which is subject to discovery or inspection under this rule[.]’” Id.

(quoting State v. Ricci, 639 A.2d 64, 68 (R.I. 1994)).', 'Accordingly, “[t]he appropriateness of a sanction under Rule 16 can be determined only after the trial justice has considered (as must this Court on review) the following factors: ‘(1) the reason for nondisclosure, (2) the extent of prejudice to the opposing party, (3) the feasibility of rectifying that prejudice by a continuance, and (4) any other relevant factors.’” State v. Perez, 882 A.2d 574, 585 (R.I. 2005) (quoting State v. Coelho, 454 A.2d 241, 245 (R.I. 1982)).', '“It is well established that, when this Court reviews questions regarding claimed Rule 16 discovery violations, ‘the applicable standard is narrow: [T]he trial justice must have committed clear error.’” Santiago, 81 A.3d at 1139 (quoting Briggs, 886 A.2d at 755). “The trial justice is in the best position to determine whether any harm resulted from alleged noncompliance with discovery motions and whether the harm can be mitigated.” Id. (quoting State v. Boucher, 542 A.2d 236, 241 (R.I. 1988)). “Therefore, ‘[w]e accord great deference to the trial justice’s decision regarding whether a violation of Rule 16 occurred.’” Id. at 1139-40 (quoting State v.

Devon Boswell', 'In particular, defendant takes issue with the trial justice’s admission of Boswell’s testimony that he saw defendant take the pistol out from behind the radio console in Boswell’s car, remove the magazine from the firearm, and insert the extended magazine because such testimony was “neither disclosed by the [s]tate in discovery, nor per its', '- 11 - continuing duty.” 4 Conversely, the state asserts that defendant is not entitled to a new trial because he fails to aver how the alleged discovery violations were intentional and how the “alleged violations contributed to his conviction.”', 'Our review of the record reveals no reason to disturb the trial justice’s rulings. After defendant’s objection to Boswell’s testimony that defendant took one clip out of the gun and put the extended magazine in, the trial justice explained that, “as [he] recall[ed], the discovery indicate[d] that he used the extended magazine when he was doing the shooting.”', 'Upon defendant clarifying his objection to “new testimony that one [magazine] was in the gun and one wasn’t,” the trial justice indicated that, if the extended magazine was used in the shooting, it was “not terribly novel, new or surprising that one [magazine] was substituted for the other,” and determined that it was not a “prejudicial[ ] surprise” or could even be “character[ized] as [a] surprise.” We have long recognized that a “trial justice is in the best position to determine whether any harm result[s] from [an] alleged noncompliance with [a] discovery motion * * *.” Santiago, 81 A.3d at 1139 (quoting Boucher, 542 A.2d at 241). Here, we perceive no abuse of the trial justice’s discretion in admitting Boswell’s testimony.', '2. Detective Angelo A’Vant', 'Next, defendant argues that Det. A’Vant’s testimony regarding Regis’s description of defendant’s weapon, viz., that Regis pointed to the hand grip of the 4', 'The defendant also contends, without much discussion, that Boswell’s testimony, that defendant “screamed out ‘Body number 8, left three of them slumped’” on their way back to Boston, was not disclosed to him before trial by the state. What had been disclosed to the defense, in a report from Det. A’Vant, however, was that defendant had made a similar statement to Boswell “shortly after the shooting.” At trial, defendant argued that the disclosure did not place the statement in its proper context, i.e., that it was said in the car on their way back to Boston. The term “shortly,” he argued, could mean days or it could mean weeks. We perceive no merit to defendant’s contentions.', '- 12 - detective’s weapon and indicated that the grip of defendant’s firearm was longer, was not disclosed to defendant under Rule 16.', 'We conclude, however, that the trial justice’s ruling was supported by the evidence and that he conducted an appropriate analysis under Rule 16. At sidebar, defendant indicated that Det. A’Vant’s testimony was going “to elaborate on [the firearm’s] description beyond what[ ] [was] in the report.” The trial justice concluded that the testimony was “not new evidence” because “[t]here [was] other evidence that was given in discovery about the size of the gun and the magazine” and that Regis’s description of the firearm was “in the report * * * offered in the interview of February 3rd, 2015.” The trial justice then supported his decision by stating that “[t]here was a reference to [Regis] having seen the gun and asking her to describe it, and * * * she was much more specific when she spoke to [Det.] A’Vant, and I will permit him to testify to it.” Again, we perceive no error in the trial justice’s ruling.', '3. Criminalist Neil Clapperton', 'Finally, defendant avers that the trial justice improperly allowed Clapperton’s testimony concerning the rectangular markings on the shell casings and the extended magazine’s compatibility with both 9-millimeter and .40-caliber ammunition because the report submitted by Clapperton in discovery did not include these items. As a result, defendant maintains that he was caught by “surprise” at trial. The state contends that defendant was aware of this testimony because Clapperton’s report did in fact include that 9-millimeter ammunition could be loaded into the extended magazine and, furthermore, that, although the report was silent on the markings on the spent shell', '- 13 - casings, the jury had already heard testimony from Clapperton regarding this without objection from defense counsel.', 'At trial, defendant’s objection to the testimony of Clapperton was entertained at a lengthy sidebar. The state read from Clapperton’s report that “[t]he extended magazine from item 39 was used to load four laboratory cartridges of caliber [9]-millimeter.” The defendant argued that he had no way of knowing from the report which of the three magazines that had been sent to the crime lab for inspection was tested with 9-millimeter cartridges. In overruling defendant’s objection, the trial justice noted that “it’s this particular clip that the [s]tate [h]as always targeted as being the relevant clip” and that the testing by Clapperton with 9-millimeter cartridges was in the report. We cannot say that the trial justice abused his discretion in allowing Clapperton’s testimony. Moreover, on appeal, defendant fails to show how he was prejudiced thereby.', 'C', 'Batson Peremptory Challenge', 'During jury selection, the state used its peremptory challenges to strike several potential jurors, including Juror No. 110. The defendant, who identifies as African- American, immediately objected to the state striking Juror No. 110, who defendant claims was Hispanic. 5 The trial justice indicated that he “tend[ed] not to agree with [defendant]”and that, in his opinion, there were not any Batson issues whatsoever, but he nonetheless asked the state to proffer its race-neutral reasons for the strike. See Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 96 (1986). 5', 'The record is not clear whether Juror No. 110 is in fact Hispanic. Before the jury was impaneled, the trial justice indicated that he did not know whether Juror No. 110 was Hispanic and that “[h]e very well might be Italian with that name.”', '- 14 -', 'In response to the trial justice’s inquiry, the state offered two purportedly race- neutral explanations for challenging Juror No. 110. First, the state was concerned that Juror No. 110 had some knowledge of the legal system because he had “two friends in [the Attorney General’s] [O]ffice, as well as in the criminal defense [bar],” and he had asked a question during voir dire concerning circumstantial and direct evidence. Second, the state alleged that Juror No. 110 “appear[ed] to be a leader on the jury” and therefore might influence other jurors.', 'The trial justice then permitted defendant to challenge the state’s reasons. The defendant countered that there were other potential jurors “who ha[d] all the characteristics that [the state] described” and that there had been instances where other potential jurors “asked questions about [the] law” and knew defense attorneys and people in the Attorney General’s Office. In closing, defendant proclaimed that the reasons for challenging Juror No. 110 were “individually and collectively * * * pretextual” and that “the real reason for the challenge” was that Juror No. 110 was “a minority.”', 'After hearing the parties’ arguments, the trial justice allowed the state’s peremptory challenge, indicating to defendant that:', '“I don’t join your concerns as to whether this is a juror who', 'invites a Batson discussion at all, and even if it did invite', 'Batson, I’m satisfied that the reasons offered by [the state]', 'are credible, sensible and not at all pretextual for striking', 'him.”', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice erred in dismissing the juror pursuant to the state’s peremptory challenge, which defendant contends was in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Particularly, defendant contends that the real reason for the prosecution’s challenge was', '- 15 - the juror’s race and was thus “pretextual in nature, and not race-neutral.” Conversely, the prosecution avers that the trial justice was not clearly wrong in accepting the prosecution’s race-neutral reasons for using a peremptory challenge to strike the potential juror.', 'The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment “guarantees the defendant that the [s]tate will not exclude members of his [or her] race from the jury venire on account of race[.]” State v. Pona, 66 A.3d 454, 472 (R.I. 2013) (Pona II) (quoting State v. Pona, 926 A.2d 592, 601 (R.I. 2007) (Pona I)). “To determine whether a defendant has been deprived of this guarantee by the state’s use of a peremptory challenge, we employ Batson’s familiar tripartite test.” Id. “First, the defendant must ‘establish a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination[.]’” Id. (quoting Pona I, 926 A.2d at 601). “Upon such a showing, the burden shifts to the prosecution to articulate its race-neutral reason(s) for challenging that particular juror.” Id. (quoting State v. Price, 706 A.2d 929, 935 (R.I. 1998)). “Finally, ‘[t]he trial court is then left to determine whether the defendant has carried his or her burden of proving purposeful racial discrimination.’” Id. (quoting Price, 706 A.2d at 935).', 'Accordingly, “[t]he trial justice’s evaluation of the prosecutor’s state of mind is accorded great deference.” Pona II, 66 A.3d at 472 (quoting Price, 706 A.2d at 935). “Thus, the ‘ruling on the issue of discriminatory intent must be sustained unless it is clearly erroneous.’” State v. Gallop, 89 A.3d 795, 804 (R.I. 2014) (quoting Pona II, 66 A.3d at 472).', 'Based upon our review of the record, we are satisfied that the trial justice’s decision regarding the peremptory challenge to Juror No. 110 was not clearly erroneous', '- 16 - and was supported by the record. In this case, we will assume that Batson’s first prong is met because, upon defendant’s peremptory objection, the trial justice required the state to offer its race-neutral reasons for the strike. See Pona I, 926 A.2d at 607 (“Although the trial justice did not state explicitly whether [the] defendant made a prima facie showing of purposeful discrimination * * * ‘the preliminary issue of whether * * * [the] defendant had made a prima facie showing [became] moot’”) (quoting State v. Austin, 642 A.2d 673, 678 (R.I. 1994)). Further, the record is clear as to the state’s race-neutral reasons proffered at trial, which satisfies the second prong. Therefore, the issue before this Court is whether the state’s proffered reasons were pretextual in nature.', 'Here, defendant has offered no evidence to disturb the trial justice’s evaluation of the prosecutor’s stated reason for striking the juror, other than claiming that Juror No. 110’s last name was perhaps Hispanic and that other potential jurors had similar friendships with lawyers in the bar. The trial justice, however, was satisfied with the state’s presentation and reasonably determined that the challenges were “credible, sensible and not at all pretextual.” We cannot say that the trial justice erred in so finding.', 'D', 'Motion for New Trial', 'Lastly, defendant avers that the trial justice incorrectly determined that the testimony supported a conviction of first-degree murder because the prosecution’s case relied primarily on the testimony of Boswell, whose testimony defendant described as “quite unworthy of belief” due to his lack of candor to the court. Additionally, defendant argues that the testimony of Michael James, Kevin Innocent, and Rachel Regis, whom the', '- 17 - prosecution also relied upon, were also unworthy of belief because of the witnesses’ reluctance to testify and similar lack of candor to the tribunal.', '“When considering whether or not to grant or deny a motion for a new trial, ‘the trial justice acts as a thirteenth juror.’” State v. Texieira, 944 A.2d 132, 140 (R.I. 2008) (quoting State v. Imbruglia, 913 A.2d 1022, 1028 (R.I. 2007)). “In dealing with a motion for a new trial, ‘the trial justice must (1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.’” Id. (quoting State v. Morales, 895 A.2d 114, 121 (R.I. 2006)). “If the trial justice concludes that reasonable minds could differ as to the result or if the trial justice reaches the same conclusion as the jury did, the verdict should be affirmed and the motion for a new trial denied.” Id. “If the trial justice does not agree with the jury’s verdict, ‘the trial justice must * * * determine whether the verdict is against the fair preponderance of the evidence and fails to do substantial justice.’” Id. (quoting State v. Banach, 648 A.2d 1363, 1367 n.1 (R.I. 1994)).', '“On review, we accord great weight to a trial justice’s ruling on a motion for a new trial if he or she has articulated sufficient reasoning in support of the ruling.” Texieira, 944 A.2d at 140-41.', '“This Court will not overturn a trial justice’s determination with regard to such a motion unless we determine that the trial justice committed clear error or that he or she ‘overlooked or misconceived material and relevant evidence [relating] to a critical issue in the case.’” Id. at 141 (quoting State v. Bolduc, 822 A.2d 184, 187 (R.I. 2003)). “We employ this deferential standard of review with respect to a motion for a new trial because a trial justice, being present during all phases', '- 18 - of the trial, is in an especially good position to evaluate the facts and to judge the credibility of the witnesses.” Id.', 'Here, the trial justice determined that there was sufficient evidence supporting defendant’s convictions.', 'The trial justice independently considered the evidence proffered against defendant and determined that the state’s key witnesses were Boswell and Regis. The trial justice then distilled the issue surrounding their testimony as one of credibility. The trial justice then focused on Boswell’s testimony: Boswell testified that he saw his “very good friend” nearly empty an extended magazine into a car and leave two dead and one seriously injured, and that defendant had stated on their ride back to Boston “that he left three of them slumped,” which, the trial justice noted, was “precisely how the two [deceased victims] appeared.” The trial justice continued by indicating that Boswell was “severely cross-examined” by defendant with respect to his prior inconsistent statements and the cooperation agreement made in connection with his testimony. The trial justice then determined that “[i]t [was] plain that the jury accepted * * * Boswell’s incriminating testimony, warts and all” and noted that, frankly, he, too, “found [Boswell’s] trial testimony compelling.”', 'The trial justice then directed his attention to Regis’s testimony. He indicated that “after several starts and stops and, obviously, false professed lapses of memory, [Regis] eventually conceded that she had told the police early on that she saw [defendant] with the gun in his hand.” The trial justice then determined that the jury must have decided that Regis’s “professed amnesia” was not real and that “her prior statements to the police and the Grand Jury, * * * when pieced together, reflected her actual and true full recollection of the events.”', '- 19 -', 'In dismissing the motion for a new trial, the trial justice indicated that he was “satisfied that th[e] jury properly adjudicated the case and did justice to the evidence which was presented.” We conclude that the trial justice articulated sufficient reasoning and did not overlook or misconceive any critical issue relating to the testimony proffered by the state when he found that there was sufficient evidence to support a conviction of first-degree murder.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

The petitioners, the Preservation Society of Newport County and Newport Catering, Inc., d/b/a Glorious Affairs, Ltd., seek review on certiorari of a May 2014 decision of the respondent, the City Council of the City of Newport (the Council), denying two applications for victualing licenses.1 In their applications, the petitioners proposed to sell pre-wrapped food prepared off-site, along with snacks and nonalcoholic drinks, at two historic mansions in Newport: The Elms Carriage House (The Elms) and the Marble House Chinese Tea House (Marble House).', 'On appeal, the petitioners contend that the Council impermissibly relied upon zoning considerations as its basis for denying their applications for victualing licenses; they further argue that, pursuant to § 5.72.020 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Newport, the Council was required to consider only health and safety issues in deciding whether to issue or deny the licenses. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, the 1', 'Section 5.72.010 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Newport defines a “Victualer” as “a restaurant, coffee shop, cafeteria, lunch cart, delicatessen, caterer, ice cream parlor, cafe, bar, luncheonette, tavern, sandwich stand, soda fountain, and all other types of eating or drinking establishments.”', '-2- petition for certiorari is granted, and the decision of the Council is quashed. The Council is directed to issue the licenses forthwith, absent any compelling evidence of significant health and safety issues.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On May 7, 2014, petitioners jointly filed applications with the Council for victualing licenses.2 In their applications, they proposed the following under the heading “Type of BUSINESS:”', '“Sale at [The Elms and Marble House] museum of pre-wrapped', 'sandwiches, wraps and salads prepared off-site, soft drinks', '(including coffee and tea) and other snack foods to ticketed', 'museum guests of the Preservation Society.” 2', 'Section 5.72.020 of the Code of Newport Ordinances sets forth “[t]he following regulations * * * as prerequisites to the issuance of a victualing license by the [City Council]:”', '“A.

The zoning enforcement officer of Newport, Guy Weston, testified that, in his judgment, the above-referenced applications are “approved for zoning” because they “conform[] with the [Newport] zoning code;” specifically, he indicated that “what [petitioners are] applying for” is a “permitted, customary accessory use to the museum.”3 Throughout Mr. Weston’s testimony, Councilors Michael Farley, Justin McLaughlin, and Kathryn Leonard repeatedly questioned and expressed disagreement with his interpretation of the Newport zoning ordinance (viz., his view that petitioners’ proposed food service constituted an accessory use to a museum).4 In response, Mr. Weston expressly noted that the Council was not authorized to decide zoning matters: 3', 'Counsel for Bellevue-Ochre Point Neighborhood Association, which organization was granted intervenor status, argued that petitioners’ proposed food service is not a permitted accessory use with respect to museums in a residential zoning district. He further asserted that the Council was allowed to take into account zoning considerations in deciding whether to issue or deny victualing licenses. 4', 'Immediately prior to a vote by the Council on the issue of whether to grant or deny petitioners’ applications, Council Chair Henry Winthrop made the following remarks:', '“Laws are open to interpretation.

Those two witnesses did testify at some length, focusing on health and safety issues.', 'However, for present purposes, there is no need to discuss the substantive testimony of those two witnesses. It should also be noted that, in addition, the Council heard brief comments from numerous members of the public supporting and opposing petitioners’ applications for victualing licenses.5', 'in this room is nodding their head and saying safety and health is', 'not an issue.

However, notwithstanding that the case at bar is moot, it should be recalled that we have recognized an exception to the mootness doctrine for cases that are of extreme public importance and are capable of repetition yet evade judicial review. City of Cranston v. International Brotherhood of Police Officers, Local 301, 115 A.3d 971, 977 (R.I. 2015). Especially in view of the manifest public interest in the instant licensing issue, it is our opinion that this case falls within the parameters of the just-referenced exception. See State Department of Environmental Management v. Administrative Adjudication Division, 60 A.3d 921, 925 (R.I. 2012); see also In re New England Gas Co., 842 A.2d 545, 554 (R.I. 2004). 8', 'As we have repeatedly stated, city and town councils acting in a quasi-judicial capacity are required to set forth factual findings and legal conclusions in support of their decisions for the purpose of “facilitating judicial review, avoiding judicial usurpation of administrative functions, assuring more careful administrative consideration, helping parties plan their cases for rehearings and judicial review, and keeping agencies within their jurisdiction.” Cullen v. Town Council of Lincoln, 850 A.2d 900, 904 (R.I. 2004); see Hooper v. Goldstein, 104 R.I. 32, 44, 241 A.2d 809, 815 (1968).', '-7- Pawtucket, 99 R.I. 41, 44, 205 A.2d 589, 592 (1964). A written decision, although strongly recommended, is not required; rather, this Court requires “the making of findings of fact and the application of legal principles in such a manner that a judicial body might review a decision with a reasonable understanding of the manner in which evidentiary conflicts have been resolved and the provisions of the * * * ordinance applied.” Thorpe v. Zoning Board of Review of North Kingstown, 492 A.2d 1236, 1237 (R.I. 1985); see also May-Day Realty Corp. v. Board of Appeals of Pawtucket, 107 R.I. 235, 239, 267 A.2d 400, 403 (1970). Accordingly, we have held that council members “must do more than make a motion and take a vote. The determination must contain findings of fact which support the ultimate decision of the body.” Sambo’s of Rhode Island, Inc. v. McCanna, 431 A.2d 1192, 1194 (R.I. 1981). We may, “where appropriate, imply an ultimate finding from the action taken.” Hooper v. Goldstein, 104 R.I. 32, 45, 241 A.2d 809, 816 (1968). This is especially appropriate after a careful review of the proceedings before the Council.', 'After carefully reviewing the entire record, it is clear to us that the Council failed to provide factual findings and legal grounds to support its decision denying the petitioners’ applications for victualing licenses. Neither the City Clerk’s terse denial letter of May 30, 2014 to the petitioners nor the transcript of the hearing before the Council contained a statement of the reasons relied upon by the Council for its decision. The record reveals a failure on the part of the Council to have cited “any provision of the * * * ordinances, or [even specify] any other legal authority for that matter, upon which it based [the denial].”', 'Cullen, 850 A.2d at 905. Although, in the course of the hearing, several council members did express concerns relative to zoning, it is not possible to deduce from the record whether or not the members of the Council constituting the majority relied upon those concerns as actual grounds to deny the petitioners’', '-8- applications. See id. at 904-05; see also Cranston Print Works Co., 684 A.2d at 691. What is clear, however, is the fact that the Council in 2014 was in derogation of its responsibilities for its failure to have pointed to any meaningful evidence in the record relative to health and/or safety concerns—which are, pursuant to § 5.72.020 of the Newport Ordinances, required to be the focus of such licensing decisions.9 And it is clear from the record that several members of that Council chose to embark on a detour into zoning concerns, which should not have been the focus of the Council’s decision-making.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth herein, the petition for certiorari is granted, and the May 2014 decision of the Council is quashed. The present Council is hereby directed to issue victualing licenses to the petitioners forthwith, absent any compelling evidence of significant health and/or safety issues.

57,Mark Mancini : v. : City of Providence et al. :,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. This case comes before us pursuant to a September 26, 2013 order of the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island certifying a question to this Court in accordance with Article I, Rule 6(a) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure.1 The certified question reads as follows: 1', 'Article I, Rule 6(a) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure provides in pertinent part as follows:', '“This Court may answer questions of law certified to it by the', 'Supreme Court of the United States, a Court of Appeals of the', 'United States, or of the District of Columbia, or a United States', 'District Court when requested by the certifying court if there are', 'involved in any proceeding before it questions of law of this state', 'which may be determinative of the cause then pending in the', 'certifying court and as to which it appears to the certifying court', 'there is no controlling precedent in the decisions of this Court.” The authorization which is accorded by the above-quoted rule is discretionary.

It suffices to say that there is an action pending in federal court in which plaintiff, Sergeant Mark Mancini, alleges that he was illegally denied a promotion to the position of Lieutenant in the Providence Police Department. According to the Certification Order, the eleven-count complaint involves claims of employment and disability discrimination against the City of Providence and Hugh Clements, Jr., the Chief of Police of the Providence Police Department. At issue in the instant proceeding is plaintiff’s count claiming that Chief Clements is liable, in his individual capacity, for the City’s failure to have promoted plaintiff in alleged violation of FEPA § 28-5-7(6). In the federal action, Chief Clements moved to dismiss the count alleging that he had violated § 28-5-7(6) on the basis that, in his view, that statutory section does not provide for individual liability.

When confronted with an ambiguous statute, we must look to the entire statutory scheme to deduce the legislative intent; our interpretive gaze should not be restricted to a mere “isolated provision,” In re Harrison, 992 A.2d 990, 994 (R.I. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted); and “under no circumstances will [we] construe a statute to reach an absurd result.” National Refrigeration, Inc., 88 A.3d at 1156 (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'In our opinion, it is evident upon reading § 28-5-7(6) that that statutory section is ambiguous with respect to whether or not it imposes individual liability.

See In re Harrison, 992 A.2d at 994. The rest of the statutory section imposes liability for aiding and abetting employment discrimination, preventing compliance with FEPA, and/or attempting to commit an unlawful employment practice. In the instant case, the alleged unlawful employment practice involved a decision of Chief Clements which negatively affected Sergeant Mancini’s ultimate chances for promotion. It was solely the act of Chief Clements which was the alleged unfair employment practice at issue in the instant case.', 'Accordingly, for § 28-5-7(6) to constitute a rational basis for the imposition of individual liability on the Chief, the finder of fact individual could be personally liable for “conduct amounting to FEPA violations.” Conversely, seven years later, in Bringhurst v.

Dec. 30, 2011), another justice of the Superior Court chose not to vary from a previous ruling by another justice in the still-pending case which had dismissed charges brought under FEPA against an individual defendant.', 'In 1996 and 1998, the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island held that FEPA did impose individual liability.

In our judgment, such an interpretation would contort the statutory language to an extent that would not be linguistically or jurisprudentially acceptable. We recognize that at least one trial court has interpreted a similarly worded statute5 as allowing for a finding of liability on the basis of the employee at issue having aided and abetted himself. See Maher, 650 F. Supp. 2d at 261. However, we are simply unable to conclude, after carefully scrutinizing the statutory language at issue, that such an interpretation is reasonable or reflective of what we perceive to have been the legislative intent. To apply the language of § 28-5-7(6) against an employee who was the sole perpetrator with respect to the alleged unlawful employment practice “would create a strange and confusing circularity where the person who has directly perpetrated the harassment only becomes liable through the employer whose liability in turn hinges on the conduct of the direct perpetrator.” Rasmussen, 832 N.W.2d at 801 (internal quotation marks omitted). We decline to construe a statute to reach a result that we consider to be incompatible with logic and conventional English usage. See Ryan v. City of Providence, 11 A.3d 68, 76 (R.I. 2011) (“Such an illogical interpretation is not permitted by our rules of statutory construction.”); see also National Refrigeration, Inc., 88 A.3d at 1156.6 5', 'Under N.Y. Exec.

If the General Assembly had intended such a result, it is our view that it would not have used such ambiguous language to achieve that end.', '-7-', 'We recognize that the General Assembly has expressed its desire that FEPA be “construed liberally.” Section 28-5-38(a). But such a call for a liberal construction should not be understood as an authorization for the courts to “fl[y] in the face of the structure of the statute;” we decline to construe a statute to reach an incongruous end as a result of a misguided view that a liberal construction mandate calls for the wholesale abandonment of other venerable principles of statutory construction.

At the end of the day, after closely analyzing the language of § 28-5-7(6), it is our unequivocal conclusion that said statute does not authorize the imposition of individual liability.', 'Our conclusion is buttressed by the fact that § 28-5-6(8)(i), as amended by P.L. 2013, ch. 413, § 1, defines “[e]mployer” to include “any person in this state employing four (4) or more individuals[;]” in our view, it would not be logical to conclude, without far more textual evidence, that the General Assembly intended to exempt employers with less than four employees from potential liability but simultaneously intended to authorize the imposition of liability on individuals under the ambiguous language of § 28-5-7(6).', 'We base our response to the certified question squarely on traditional principles of statutory construction. However, we note that allowing for the possibility of individual liability would have a predictably chilling effect on the discretionary management decisions of 7', 'We are aware that the United States Supreme Court’s decision in Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 243 (1985), was superseded by statute, as recognized in Lane v. Pena, 518 U.S. 187, 198 (1996). However, it goes without saying that that fact does not alter the viability of the hermeneutic approach to statutory interpretation employed by the Supreme Court in Atascadero State Hospital, which we emulate in this opinion. 8', 'Alaska Stat. Ann. § 18.80.260 (West 2016) reads as follows: “It is unlawful for a person to aid, abet, incite, compel, or coerce the doing of an act forbidden under this chapter or to attempt to do so.”', '-9- supervisory employees—since such a regime would, in all likelihood, result in supervisors frequently tending to make employment decisions based on their apprehensiveness as to the possibility of suit rather than on what they deem to be in the best interest of the employer. It is our view that, as a matter of public policy, a supervisor should not have to be concerned about keeping his or her house or car, or having enough wherewithal to pay for the education of his or her children when deciding, for example, between two employees who are candidates for a promotion. That is especially true because, if the supervisor makes such a decision for unlawful reasons, the individual aggrieved has recourse against the employer under FEPA and therefore has a means to remedy the harm done. We further note that imposing individual liability would create a substantial question, in the case of a collective decision, as to which individual might be liable. Also, the remedies provided by FEPA include the issuance of a cease-and-desist order, hiring, reinstatement, upgrading of employees with or without back pay, and admission or restoration to union membership. Section 28-5-24. It is clear to us that those statutory remedies more clearly relate to the employer as such rather than to an individual. See Rhode Island Board of Governors for Higher Education v. Newman, 688 A.2d 1300, 1302 (R.I. 1997) (stating that, in conducting statutory analysis, a court should “first examine the statute in its entirety and then the individual provisions in the context of the whole, not as if each provision were independent of the whole”).', 'The Supreme Court of California took into account many of the just-referenced concerns in holding that the California Fair Employment and Housing Act did not provide for individual liability. Reno, 957 P.2d at 1347. After carefully parsing that court’s reasoning, we find its opinion especially convincing. The court in Reno noted that “[m]any of the federal cases which found no personal liability against individual supervisory employees based their decisions in part', '- 10 - on the incongruity that would exist if small employers were exempt from liability while individual nonemployer supervisors were at risk of personal liability.” Id. at 1339 (quoting Janken v. GM Hughes Electronics, 53 Cal. Rptr. 2d 741, 751 (Cal. Ct. App. 1996)). The Supreme Court of California likewise found it “incongruous” to think that the legislature in California would protect employers with fewer than five employees from the burden of litigating discrimination claims but simultaneously intended to impose the possibility of liability on individual persons who are not employers at all. Id. at 1340. In discussing further factors weighing in favor of its conclusion that the California statute in question did not impose individual liability, the Reno court made the following observations that strike us as being especially perceptive and telling:', '“[T]o submit all officials, the innocent as well as the guilty, to the', 'burden of trial and to the inevitable danger of its outcome, would', 'dampen the ardor of all but the most resolute, or the most', 'irresponsible, in the unflinching discharge of their duties * * *.', '“ * * * [I]t is manifest that if every personnel manager', 'risked losing his or her home, retirement savings, hope of', 'children’s college education, etc., whenever he or she made a', 'personnel management decision, management of industrial', 'enterprises and other economic organizations would be seriously', 'affected.', '“ * * * [S]upervisory employee[s] [would be coerced into]', 'not [making] the optimum lawful decision for the employer.', 'Instead, the supervisory employee would be pressed to make', 'whatever decision was least likely to lead to a claim of', 'discrimination against the supervisory employee personally, or', 'likely to lead only to that discrimination claim which could most', 'easily be defended. The employee would thus be placed in the', 'position of choosing between loyalty to the employer’s lawful', 'interests at severe risk to his or her own interests and family,', 'versus abandoning the employer’s lawful interest and protecting', 'his or her own personal interests.” Id. at 1340, 1341 (internal', 'quotation marks omitted).', '- 11 -', 'Finally, in addressing aiding and abetting language similar to that contained in § 28-5- 7(6),9 the California Supreme Court found it linguistically questionable whether an employee who exercises personnel management authority is aiding and abetting his or her employer: “[T]he stilted and unusual nature of such a usage alone casts doubt on [a construction imposing individual liability].” Reno, 957 P.2d at 1343. The California Supreme Court held that, if the legislature intended to provide for individual liability, it “would have done so by language more direct and less susceptible to doubt.” Id. We are fully in accord with, and find applicable to our situation, the jurisprudentially sound conclusion reached by the California Supreme Court: if the General Assembly intended to impose individual liability under FEPA, it could and would readily have done so without resorting to the markedly unclear and ambiguous language contained in § 28-5-7(6). We do not believe that the General Assembly would mandate so far- reaching a result by speaking in so veiled and cryptic a manner.', 'Accordingly, after extensive review of the relevant statute and considerable reflection, we answer the certified question in the negative—§ 28-5-7(6) does not provide for the individual liability of an employee of a defendant employer.10 9', 'California Gov’t Code § 12940(i) (West 2016) states that it is an unlawful employment practice, “[f]or any person to aid, abet, incite, compel, or coerce the doing of any of the acts forbidden under this part, or to attempt to do so.” 10', 'While we have based our response to the certified question on our own jurisprudence and principles of statutory construction, we note with great interest that the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has reached a decision that is quite comparable to the instant decision in its construction of Title VII (42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq.). See Fantini v. Salem State College, 557 F.3d 22, 28 (1st Cir. 2009). In construing our own employment discrimination statute, we have often looked for guidance to federal jurisprudence. See, e.g., Weeks v. 735 Putnam Pike Operations, LLC, 85 A.3d 1147, 1156 n.11 (R.I. 2014). And we are pleased to note that our reasoning with respect to the instant case contains similarities to the reasoning of the First Circuit with respect to the federal statute.', '- 12 -', 'B', 'Deference to Agency Interpretation', 'The Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights (RICHR) points out, in its amicus curiae brief, that it is the administrative agency to which has been confided a significant role with respect to the administration and enforcement of FEPA and that it has “a long history of holding individual non-employer respondents liable for aiding and abetting discrimination.” The agency urges us to give deference to its reading of FEPA. However, deferential consideration of the approach of RICHR with respect to the issue of individual liability does not alter our ultimate legal conclusion under the particular circumstances of the instant case.', 'We are well aware that this Court has stated that, “[i]f a statute’s requirements are unclear or subject to more than one reasonable interpretation, the construction given by the agency charged with its enforcement is entitled to weight and deference as long as that construction is not clearly erroneous or unauthorized.” Duffy v.

Burke, 488 A.2d 676, 679 (R.I. 1985).', 'However, it should not be forgotten that we have also expressly stated that an agency’s interpretation is “not controlling” and, further, that “regardless of * * * deference due, this Court always has the final say in construing a statute.” In re Proposed Town of New Shoreham Project, 25 A.3d 482, 506 (R.I. 2011); see also Berkshire Cablevision of Rhode Island, Inc., 488 A.2d at 679. We certainly have never suggested that we owe any administrative agency’s interpretation blind obeisance; rather, the “true measure of a court’s willingness to defer to an', '- 13 - agency’s interpretation of a statute ‘depends, in the last analysis, on the persuasiveness of the interpretation, given all the attendant circumstances.’” Unistrut Corp. v.

In the instant case, we are confronted with widely divergent opinions from other jurisdictions as well as from courts within this state.11 In addition, rather than being confronted with a fact-intensive issue or an issue of a technical nature, we are in this case considering a pure question of law, which does not require special expertise beyond what the members of this Court possess. See Arnold v. Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training Board of Review, 822 A.2d 164, 167 (R.I. 2003) (stating, in the context of an appeal from a decision of an administrative agency, that this Court is “free * * * to conduct a de novo review of determinations of law made by an agency”); see also Rossi v. Employees’ Retirement System, 895 A.2d 106, 110 (R.I. 2006). Accordingly, under the circumstances of this case, any deference due to RICHR’s interpretation of § 28-5-7(6) simply does not overcome our conviction that, if the General Assembly intended § 28-5-7(6) to provide for individual liability, it would not have used language so abstruse to accomplish its aim.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we answer the question certified to us in the negative—§ 28-5-7(6) does not provide for the individual liability of an employee of a defendant employer.

McVay et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court.', 'This case came before the Supreme Court on January 26, 2017, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. The plaintiffs, Charles S. Faber, M.D. (Dr. Faber), and Karen M. Faber1 (Mrs. Faber) (collectively, plaintiffs), appeal from a grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants, Francine A. McVay (McVay), Wickford Insurance Agency, Inc. (Wickford), Lauren Albright (Albright), Mastors & Servant, Ltd. (M&S), Judith Gordon (Gordon), and Marketing Associates Insurance Agency, Inc. (Marketing Associates) (collectively, defendants),2 on the plaintiffs’ claims of insurance malpractice. The Superior Court directed the entry of summary judgment on the basis that the plaintiffs’ claims were time-barred under G.L. 1956 § 9-1-14.1, which sets forth a three-year limitation period for insurance malpractice claims.', 'After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda submitted by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and 1', 'Mrs. Faber has alleged a claim for loss of consortium which is derivative of Dr. Faber’s claims. 2', 'Chubb Group of Insurance Companies (CHUBB) a/k/a Chubb Indemnity Insurance Company and Chubb National Insurance Company, Vigilant Insurance Company, and Federal Insurance Company were also named as defendants. On May 21, 2014, summary judgment was entered in favor of these defendants, but plaintiffs did not appeal.', '-1- that this case should be decided without further briefing or argument. We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'We derive the facts relevant to this appeal from the filings of the parties; they are largely undisputed. From 19983 until her retirement in 2005, McVay acted as Dr. Faber’s insurance agent. McVay was originally employed by Bodin Insurance Agency but became associated with Wickford around 1994 or 1995. Marketing Associates,4 an insurance broker, functioned as an intermediary between McVay and Dr. Faber’s insurance carriers. According to both Dr. Faber and McVay, Dr. Faber expressed a desire to obtain the best and maximum insurance coverage.', 'For the October 2002 to October 2003 term, Dr. Faber’s automobile insurance was written by Vigilant Insurance Co.5 (Vigilant) and included $5,000,000 of underinsured motorist bodily injury (UM) coverage.6 It is alleged that, in late 2002, Dr. Faber inquired with McVay as to whether a different carrier could provide the same coverage for a reduced premium; it is further alleged that McVay reported to Dr. Faber that he could obtain the same coverage and lower his premium payments by contracting with Progressive Insurance for $250,000 in UM coverage and with Vigilant for an umbrella policy of $5,000,000 that also included UM coverage. However, during her deposition, McVay relayed a different version, stating that she informed Dr. Faber that the policies were different and that they would “come back and bite him 3', 'A review of the record indicates that there is conflicting evidence as to when McVay initially became Dr. Faber’s insurance agent. Accordingly, we refer to the date referenced in the complaint. 4', 'Gordon was employed by Marketing Associates. 5', 'Vigilant is a subsidiary of CHUBB. 6', 'UM coverage provides protection if the insured is physically injured in a motor vehicle accident and the tortfeasor does not have adequate insurance coverage.', '-2- in the a**.” Nonetheless, Dr. Faber directed McVay to make this change, which reduced his premium by $4,951. The policy changes became effective on December 11, 2002. The umbrella policy with Vigilant provided for $5,000,000 in excess liability only, 7 but it did not include UM protection.', 'Although Dr. Faber was sent notice of these changes, which included succinct summaries of his coverages, it is undisputed that he failed to read the coverage update. Over the years, he also received notices that detailed his automobile insurance coverage, usually after he added or removed vehicles from his policies. Nonetheless, Dr. Faber testified at his deposition that he did not read these notices but filed them in a drawer because he relied on McVay’s insurance expertise. Doctor Faber maintained that he assumed that his automobile policies provided maximum coverage for UM.', 'After McVay retired in May 2005, Dr. Faber retained M&S for his insurance needs, and Albright became his direct agent for personal insurance. He was informed by M&S that his policies would be reviewed and that he would be advised if additional coverage was necessary.8 Doctor Faber again received notice as to the terms and coverage of his automobile insurance. During his deposition, Dr. Faber stated that he did not recall receiving notice of this cancellation and renewal.9 7', 'Excess liability coverage provides protection if a claim is asserted against the insured and other insurance held by the insured is exhausted. 8', 'Doctor Faber’s automotive policy with Vigilant was technically canceled due to defendant CHUBB’s internal procedure, but the new policy was renewed by the same carrier on February 22, 2006, and the coverage was identical. 9', 'In 2007, Dr. Faber removed two vehicles from his automobile policy and added a new vehicle. A coverage update was sent to Dr. Faber, which declared that the Vigilant policy only provided excess liability coverage. As usual, Dr. Faber did not read the update.', '-3-', 'On April 24, 2007, Dr. Faber was injured in a motor vehicle accident that occurred in Scottsdale, Arizona. After he exhausted the tortfeasor’s insurance in the amount of $250,000, he attempted to submit a claim to Vigilant for his excess damages. He was informed that his Vigilant policy did not provide UM coverage, but only excess liability. Doctor Faber did recover $250,000 under his UM coverage with Progressive.', 'On August 6, 2009, plaintiffs filed an action against defendants, alleging that defendants negligently failed to adequately provide the insurance coverage that he expected. On March 14, 2014, McVay and Wickford moved for summary judgment on the basis, inter alia, that plaintiffs’ claims were barred by the statute of limitations, § 9-1-14.1.10 The plaintiffs responded that the discovery rule set forth in § 9-1-14.1(2) served to toll the limitation period because Dr. Faber could not reasonably have discovered the alleged insurance malpractice until he was injured in the collision and submitted a UM claim. Although Dr. Faber conceded that he received the coverage updates from defendants, plaintiffs argued that a reasonable person does not read his or her insurance policies. On April 22, 2014, the hearing justice granted summary judgment in favor of McVay and Wickford, finding that “a reasonable and diligent inquiry would have placed [plaintiffs] on notice of a claim in December of 2002[;] to have timely filed a complaint in compliance with * * * [§] 9-1-14.1, the plaintiffs would have had to have done so on or before December 11, 2005.”', 'Because the complaint was filed on August 6, 2009, plaintiffs’ claims were held to be untimely. An order granting summary judgment was entered on May 21, 2014. Subsequently, on June 10, 2014, summary judgment was entered in favor of Gordon and Marketing Associates on the same grounds. 10', 'General Laws 1956 § 9-1-14.1 provides, in pertinent part: “[A]n action for * * * insurance * * * malpractice shall be commenced within three (3) years from the time of the occurrence of the incident which gave rise to the action[.]”', '-4-', 'On October 10, 2014, Albright and M&S also moved for summary judgment. Although plaintiffs initially objected to summary judgment, their objection was subsequently withdrawn, and a consent order entered dismissing plaintiffs’ claims against Albright and M&S.11', 'Final judgment was entered on May 20, 2015. The plaintiffs timely appealed to this Court on June 1, 2015.', 'Standard of Review', '“This Court reviews de novo a trial justice’s decision granting summary judgment.” Sola v. Leighton, 45 A.3d 502, 506 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Lynch v. Spirit Rent-A-Car, Inc., 965 A.2d 417, 424 (R.I. 2009)). “[S]ummary judgment is a drastic remedy, and a motion for summary judgment should be dealt with cautiously.” Cruz v.

State, 869 A.2d 1185, 1187 (R.I. 2005)). “Only when a review of the admissible evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party reveals no genuine issues of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, will this Court uphold the trial justice’s grant of summary judgment.” Id.

Standen Contracting Co., 942 A.2d 968, 971 (R.I. 2008)).', 'Analysis', 'In Rhode Island, a cause of action for insurance malpractice “shall be commenced within three (3) years from the time of the occurrence of the incident which gave rise to the action[.]” 11', 'The consent order makes explicit reference to the April 2014 order that dismissed plaintiffs’ claims against the other defendants based on the statute of limitations.', '-5- Section 9-1-14.1. The plaintiffs do not argue that their claim was filed within this three-year limitation period. Rather, plaintiffs contend that the discovery rule set forth in § 9-1-14.1(2) serves to toll the limitation period in this case. In accordance with § 9-1-14.1(2), the limitation period does not begin to run until “the act or acts of malpractice should, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, have been discovered.”', 'The plaintiffs’ argument is two-fold:', 'First, plaintiffs maintain that the limitation period was tolled until Dr. Faber was injured in an automobile collision and sought UM benefits because he could not reasonably have discovered his claim for damages until he was denied coverage under the Vigilant policy. Second, plaintiffs aver that, to the extent that the discovery date hinges on notice of the wrongful conduct as opposed to the injury, Dr. Faber did not discover, nor should he have discovered, the wrongful conduct because a reasonable person does not read his or her insurance coverage updates. Before this Court, all defendants contend that Dr. Faber was provided clear and unambiguous notice as to his insurance coverage and that these numerous coverage updates put Dr. Faber on notice as to any alleged insurance malpractice. We agree with this contention.', 'In the medical malpractice context, this Court has declared, “[t]he discovery date is the date that the plaintiffs knew or should have known of the ‘wrongful act’ that is the basis of their lawsuit.” Bustamante v. Oshiro, 64 A.3d 1200, 1204 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Hanson v. Singsen, 898 A.2d 1244, 1249 (R.I. 2006)). We see no reason to depart from this interpretation of the tolling provision in the context of insurance negligence, and we note that the limitation period for both causes of action is set forth in the same statute. Our decision in Burns v. Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Co., 743 A.2d 566 (R.I. 2000) is instructive. In Burns, the plaintiff purchased a disability insurance policy from the defendants in 1988, but his application for the policy contained inaccurate information. Id. at 567. The plaintiff received notice of the policy', '-6- and was directed to “READ [HIS] POLICY CAREFULLY.” Id. The policy stated that it was issued in consideration of the plaintiff’s application, which was also attached to the policy. Id. Nonetheless, the plaintiff claimed that he was unaware of these inaccuracies and was not harmed until the defendants canceled his policy years later in 1993. Id. The plaintiff did not file a claim until June of 1993. Id. We affirmed the hearing justice’s finding that the plaintiff’s claims were time-barred, relying on Dionne v. Baute, 589 A.2d 833, 835 (R.I. 1991) for the proposition that a recipient of a relevant document is under an obligation to examine the document. Burns, 743 A.2d at 568. The focal point of the inquiry was not on when the plaintiff learned of the extent of his damages, but rather when the plaintiff discovered or should have discovered the liability causing conduct.', 'A careful reading of § 9-1-14.1(2) also supports the conclusion that the operative date of discovery is the date that a plaintiff discovers or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered the wrongful conduct of the tortfeasor. See In re Brown, 903 A.2d 147, 149 (R.I. 2006) (“It is a[] * * * fundamental maxim of statutory construction that statutory language should not be viewed in isolation.”).', 'Although the discovery rule references “injuries or damages” that may originally be undiscoverable, the rule also provides that the limitation period is tolled until the “malpractice should * * * have been discovered.” Section 9-1-14.1(2).', 'This Court adheres to “the longstanding principle that ‘statutes should not be construed to achieve meaningless or absurd results.’” McCain v. Town of North Providence ex rel. Lombardi, 41 A.3d 239, 243 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Ryan v. City of Providence, 11 A.3d 68, 71 (R.I. 2011)). Under the interpretation that plaintiffs urge upon the Court, an insured would be free to ignore deficiencies in his or her policies or coverage and be relieved from taking corrective action unless and until there was a denial of coverage. The discovery rule does not toll the limitation', '-7- period until the point when damages reasonably are discoverable, but when the negligent conduct is or should have been reasonably discovered. See Bustamante, 64 A.3d at 1207 (“The discovery rule does not require perfect crystallization of the nature and extent of the injury suffered or a clear-cut anchoring to the allegedly negligent conduct of a defendant.”).', 'In the case at bar, the issue of possible insurance malpractice arose in late 2002, when, in an effort to reduce Dr. Faber’s premiums, McVay changed carriers and failed to obtain additional UM insurance coverage for her client. Doctor Faber received a coverage update of the changes made to his policy, which indicated that the policy was effective on December 11, 2002. The summary indicates that two vehicles were deleted from the policy and one vehicle was added. This new coverage is described as “EXCESS LIABILITY ONLY.” This coverage stands out even more because the previous coverage for the two deleted vehicles is listed as “VEHICLE LIABILITY, UMBI, UMPD.” Doctor Faber acknowledged that he understood the difference between UM insurance and excess liability coverage. It is clear that the coverages in the policies were not identical. Nevertheless, Dr. Faber neglected to read this coverage update. The second allegation of malpractice occurred in February 2006 when Albright and M&S allegedly failed to obtain adequate UM coverage.', 'Doctor Faber also received notice of this renewal, which included a summary of his coverage, but he failed to read this notice as well. Finally, Dr. Faber was sent coverage updates as he added and deleted vehicles from his policy that detailed the coverage that he bought. We are satisfied that, in the face of a multitude of opportunities, beginning in December 2002, Dr. Faber failed to discover the alleged insurance malpractice.', 'The plaintiffs also urge this Court to hold, as a matter of law, that a reasonable person exercising reasonable diligence does not read his or her coverage updates. We are unpersuaded by this contention. Doctor Faber was not charged with reading every iteration of insurance', '-8- jargon in his policies.', 'In fact, we have recognized that “the detailed provisions of insurance contracts are seldom read by the consumer”; therefore, “[t]he contents of the declarations sheet is of paramount importance.” Mallane v. Holyoke Mutual Insurance Co. in Salem, 658 A.2d 18, 20 (R.I. 1995) (quoting Sentry Insurance Co. v. Grenga, 556 A.2d 998, 1000 (R.I. 1989)). Doctor Faber was bound to act as a reasonably diligent insured—to at least peruse a personalized summary of the policy’s coverage. See Sentry Insurance Co., 556 A.2d at 1000 (“The ordinary insured would assume that such a personalized document would contain any significant limitations on coverage.”). We therefore conclude that Dr. Faber failed to exercise the necessary reasonable diligence that was required of him.', 'Doctor Faber repeatedly stated that he relied on defendants’ insurance expertise when he changed his automobile policies. However, “[t]o accept [Dr. Faber’s] present assertions of assuming the coverage was the same could leave an insurer exposed to whatever risks an insured could later persuade a jury he had been thinking were covered—so long as he had been careful not to read the policy.” Sutherland v. NN Investors Life Insurance Co., 897 F.2d 593, 596 (1st Cir. 1990). Cf. Manchester v. Pereira, 926 A.2d 1005, 1012 (R.I. 2007) (“[I]t has long been a settled principle that ‘a party who signs an instrument manifests his assent to it and cannot later complain that he did not read the instrument or that he did not understand its contents.’” (quoting F.D. McKendall Lumber Co. v. Kalian, 425 A.2d 515, 518 (R.I. 1981))); Murray v. Cunard S.S. Co., 139 N.E. 226, 228 (N.Y. App. Ct. 1923) (Cardozo, J.) (“[One] who omits to read takes the risk of omission.”). Moreover, we note that the changes in Dr. Faber’s policies reduced his premium by $4,951, not an insignificant savings. Such a substantial reduction should have likewise alerted this busy and successful professional that something was amiss, such that he would have read the declarations page or contacted his agent. Accordingly, we are of the', '-9- opinion that the Superior Court justice did not err in concluding as a matter of law that a reasonable person would have, at a minimum, perused the summary pages of the coverage update to ensure that the policy changes were correct and adequate, especially in light of the sizable reduction in the premium.', 'Accordingly, the operative date for the commencement of the running of the statute of limitations certainly was no later than December 11, 2002, the date listed on the first coverage update. Because the complaint was filed nearly seven years later, it was untimely. As a result, plaintiffs’ claims against McVay, Wickford, Gordon, and Marketing Associates were untimely and summary judgment was appropriate.', 'We also conclude that the plaintiffs’ claims against Albright and M&S equally are untimely. Doctor Faber received notice of the renewed automobile policy, effective February 22, 2006, and the limitation period commenced on that date and ran until February 23, 2009,12 almost six months before the complaint was filed. We note that Albright and M&S also argue that the claims against them were dismissed pursuant to a consent judgment that may not be set aside absent agreement of the parties.', 'Having concluded that the statute of limitations is dispositive of this appeal, we need not address the consent judgment.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons articulated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

59,"CACH, LLC : v. : Brandon Potter. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. The defendant, Brandon Potter, appeals from a grant of summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff, CACH, LLC (CACH), in this credit card debt collection action. He contends on appeal that the hearing justice erred in granting CACH’s motion for summary judgment. He further posits that the hearing justice committed error in denying his motion to compel arbitration and his motion to amend his answer. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on January 25, 2017 pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties’ arguments (both written and oral), we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this appeal may be decided at this time.', 'For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The defendant is in debt in the amount of $10,288.04, plus statutory interest and costs, under a credit card account which he opened and maintained with Bank of America, N.A. At some point, Bank of America assigned the right to collect the debt to CACH. On July 22, 2013, CACH filed a complaint in Superior Court whereby it sought to recover the above-referenced amount. On May 7, 2014, Mr. Potter eventually filed an answer to the complaint.1 Notably, that answer did not include a demand for arbitration.', 'Well over a year later, on September 28, 2015, CACH filed a motion for summary judgment. Thereafter, on December 8, 2015, Mr. Potter filed an objection to CACH’s motion as well as a motion to compel arbitration and to dismiss the case (or, in the alternative, stay proceedings) pursuant to the arbitration provision of the Cardholder Agreement entered into between Mr. Potter and Bank of America.2 On January 11, 2016, a hearing was held on CACH’s motion for summary judgment. At that hearing, the hearing justice denied Mr. Potter’s motion to compel arbitration because he had failed to raise a right to arbitrate as an affirmative defense in his answer. Then, after denying Mr. Potter’s request for a continuance, the hearing justice 1', 'Mr. Potter’s answer was timely.

On January 25, 2016, following another hearing, the hearing justice denied Mr. Potter’s motions.', 'Orders granting plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment and directing the entry of judgment in plaintiff’s favor entered the same day. Thereafter, Mr. Potter filed a notice of appeal.', 'II', 'Analysis', 'A', 'Mr. Potter’s Motion to Compel Arbitration', 'Mr. Potter contends that the hearing justice erred in denying his motion to compel arbitration and dismiss the case.', 'He posits that the Superior Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the action as a result of the arbitration provision in the Cardholder Agreement. As evidence of his intent to arbitrate the dispute, he directs this Court’s attention to the fact that he did not “participate in any discovery, file a counterclaim, submit interrogatives [sic], or challenge the plaintiff’s standing at any point prior to filing for arbitration * * * .” He adds that he is seeking to enforce the arbitration clause in the Cardholder Agreement in order to obtain relief for violations of the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act.', 'In denying Mr. Potter’s motion to compel arbitration, the hearing justice stated that an assertion that a dispute is subject to arbitration must be affirmatively pled in an answer or a', '-3- defendant would run the risk of having it deemed waived; he held that Mr. Potter had failed to raise a demand for arbitration in his answer and that such a demand had, accordingly, been waived. After a thorough review of the record and Mr. Potter’s arguments on appeal, we are in complete agreement with the hearing justice.', 'Initially, we note that our review of a trial court’s denial of a motion to compel arbitration is conducted de novo. DeFontes v. Dell, Inc., 984 A.2d 1061, 1066 (R.I. 2009).', 'Rule 8(c) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure provides that, “[i]n pleading to a preceding pleading, a party shall set forth affirmatively * * * arbitration and award * * * and any other matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense.”', 'It has been our consistent holding that arbitration is an affirmative defense and that “a defending party seeking arbitration must specifically plead the right to arbitrate in its answer or the defense will be deemed waived.” Soprano v. American Hardware Mutual Insurance Co., 491 A.2d 1008, 1010 (R.I. 1985); see also Associated Bonded Construction Co. v. Griffin Corp., 438 A.2d 1088, 1091 (R.I. 1981). Moreover, we have stated that “a defending party who fails to plead an affirmative defense, thereby waiving it, may not later move to dismiss the opponent’s complaint under [Rule 12 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure], using that waived affirmative defense as a basis for dismissal.” Associated Bonded Construction Co., 438 A.2d at 1091. Yet, Mr. Potter sought to do precisely that in the instant case. He failed to raise a demand for arbitration as an affirmative defense in his answer and then some time later moved to compel arbitration and to dismiss CACH’s case based on the arbitration provision in the Cardholder Agreement. Accordingly, it is', '-4- our judgment that the hearing justice did not err in denying Mr. Potter’s motion to compel arbitration.3', 'B', 'Mr. Potter’s Motion to Amend', 'Mr. Potter argues that the hearing justice should have granted his motion to amend his answer to add a demand for arbitration as an affirmative defense due to this Court’s liberal policy in favor of amendment. He further avers that there would be no prejudice to CACH if he were permitted to amend his answer and that any delay in his moving to amend his answer was not, by itself, sufficient reason to deny his motion.', 'We accord great deference to the decision by a hearing justice to grant or deny a motion to amend and will not disturb his decision unless he abused his discretion. Lomastro v. Iacovelli, 56 A.3d 92, 94 (R.I. 2012); see also Harodite Industries, Inc. v. Warren Electric Corp., 24 A.3d 514, 529 (R.I. 2011). Rule 15(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure states that “leave [to amend] shall be freely given when justice so requires.” It has been our view that that rule allows for amendment “absent a showing of extreme prejudice.” Wachsberger v. Pepper, 583 A.2d 77, 78 (R.I. 1990). We apply such a liberal interpretation “in order to facilitate the resolution of disputes on their merits rather than on blind adherence to procedural technicalities.” Id. And we have stated that “mere delay is not enough to deny the amendment.” Inleasing Corp. v. Jessup, 475 A.2d 989, 992 (R.I. 1984).', 'In spite of our generally liberal approach to motions to amend, after a thorough review of the record before us, we are unable to perceive any abuse of discretion by the hearing justice in 3', 'We acknowledge that Mr. Potter is acting pro se.

Moreover, in addition to our taking into account the delay of Mr. Potter in filing his motion to amend, it is clear to us that extreme prejudice to CACH would result if amendment were to be permitted at this late date: having filed a complaint in Superior Court in July of 2013 and having subsequently gained relief in Superior Court, CACH would now be forced to start all over again with arbitration. Additionally, we also find the following reasoning in favor of denying Mr. Potter’s motion to amend to be the most convincing: if amendment were to be permitted in this case, it would effectively allow Mr. Potter to circumvent our well- established rule that a demand for arbitration is an affirmative defense which must be raised in an answer or run the risk of having it deemed waived.

60,: Guardian of Josue Espinal v. : City of Providence et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. Because the state and its cities and towns are immune from liability for injuries suffered by members of the public who use public recreational facilities, the claim brought by this mother on behalf of her seriously injured child must fail. This case came before the Supreme Court on January 26, 2017, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. The plaintiff, Carmen Rohena (plaintiff), as parent and natural guardian of Josue Espinal (Josue), brought suit to recover damages for injuries that Josue suffered while sliding into home plate at Corliss Park in Providence. The plaintiff appeals from a grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant, the City of Providence (the city or defendant). This case was a home run for the city because the General Assembly has provided the state and its cities and towns with immunity from liability under Rhode Island’s Recreational Use Statute, G.L. 1956 chapter 6 of title 32. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda submitted by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that this case', '-1- should be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On June 17, 2006, Josue, a member of the North End Wanskuck Little League, was participating in a baseball game at Corliss Park1 in Providence. While sliding into home plate, his right foot and lower shin allegedly slid under a corner of the plate that was lifted. When he attempted to stand up, his leg broke in two places.', 'On October 13, 2006, plaintiff filed suit against the city, alleging that defendant failed to properly maintain the field.', 'On August 7, 2014,2 defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that it was not liable pursuant to the Recreational Use Statute. The plaintiff filed an objection, contending that discovery was incomplete and that she had been unable to determine if a genuine issue of material fact existed. However, on November 18, 2014, at the hearing on the motion, both parties conceded that discovery was complete. The plaintiff did not press an objection, but asked that the Superior Court justice “note the objection * * * based upon the recreational use statute.”', 'The Superior Court justice held that “there is no allegation here that the city charges[] to have a baseball game played on the park” and “[t]he owner of the land is not liable unless there is an allegation of some kind of willful misconduct and there is none here[.]” The defendant’s motion for summary judgment subsequently was granted, and final judgment entered on December 16, 2015. The plaintiff appealed. 1', 'The defendant posits that the incident may have occurred in Prete-Metcalf Park, another park owned by defendant.

Before this Court, plaintiff contends that defendant’s conduct falls outside the scope of the Recreational Use Statute because the city willfully or maliciously failed to guard or warn against a known dangerous condition. As support, plaintiff avers that, on June 21, 2006, an individual identified as Zenaida Martinez (Ms. Martinez) provided a hand-written statement to plaintiff’s attorney. Ms. Martinez wrote that, approximately one week before the child’s injury, she informed Nicholas J. Narducci Jr. (Mr. Narducci), the President of the North End Wanskuck Little League', '-3- and a member of the Providence City Council, about the poor condition of Corliss Park, including the bases. Mr. Narducci allegedly responded that it would be too expensive to repair the park. Our careful review of the record indicates that this argument was not raised in the Superior Court.', 'This Court has staunchly adhered to the “raise-or-waive” rule. “It is well settled that a litigant cannot raise an objection or advance a new theory on appeal if it was not raised before the trial court.” State v.

Moreover, “[t]his directive will not be disturbed unless ‘basic constitutional rights are concerned.’” Bido, 941 A.2d at 829 (quoting State v. Gomez, 848 A.2d 221, 237 (R.I. 2004)).', 'The plaintiff’s objection to defendant’s motion for summary judgment, filed on August 27, 2014, centered on plaintiff’s contention that discovery was incomplete. Although the objection referenced the scope of the Recreational Use Statute, the argument focused on the fact that discovery was outstanding. This objection was subsequently withdrawn as moot.', 'Notably absent from plaintiff’s argument in the Superior Court is any suggestion that defendant willfully or maliciously failed to guard or warn against the known dangerous condition of home plate. Not only did plaintiff fail to submit a supporting affidavit, as required by Rule 56 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, plaintiff failed to submit the letter from Ms. Martinez, which was in plaintiff’s possession. Because plaintiff failed to raise the argument, our raise-or-waive rule precludes us from addressing that contention. See Bido, 941 A.2d at 828 (“[T]his Court’s ‘raise-or-waive’ rule precludes our consideration of an issue that has not been', '-4- raised and articulated at trial.”). Accordingly, we are of the opinion that plaintiff’s argument has not properly been preserved for appeal.', 'Moreover, even if the plaintiff had presented an affidavit attesting to the facts stated in Ms. Martinez’s letter, whether verbal notice about the condition of Corliss Park to a member of the city council qualifies as notice to the city under § 32-6-5(a)(1) is questionable. Compare Berman v. Sitrin, 991 A.2d 1038, 1052 (R.I. 2010) (determining that “a fact-finder reasonably could find that after learning about the Cliff Walk’s instability, * * * [Newport] voluntarily and intentionally failed to guard against the dangerous condition, knowing that there existed a strong likelihood that a visitor to the Cliff Walk would suffer serious injury or death”), with Carlson v. Town of South Kingstown, 111 A.3d 819, 824 (R.I. 2015) (declaring the evidence in the case— awareness that holes in an athletic field can occur, and a witness’s description of the holes as a “repetitive problem”—“f[ell] woefully short of establishing the existence of sufficient facts to show that the town knew of the particular hole that injured [the] plaintiff or of similar persons injured by similar defects in the park”). In the case at bar, Ms. Martinez may have made a general complaint about the field’s poor condition one week before Josue was injured. The record is devoid of any evidence that anyone else was injured on the baseball field at Corliss Park or that the city was on notice of an alleged defect. Because the plaintiff failed to produce evidence showing that the city possessed the requisite knowledge to have “willfully or maliciously” failed to guard or warn of a known danger, this argument does not carry the day.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

On appeal, the defendant contends that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial because, in the defendant’s view: (1) the trial justice overlooked and misconceived the evidence; and (2) the verdict failed to truly respond to the evidence and failed to do substantial justice between the parties.', 'This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on October 5, 2016.

The Expert Medical Testimony', 'Doctor Christine Barron, one of the two physicians who examined Rick at Hasbro Children’s Hospital, was also a witness for the prosecution; she testified as an expert witness, qualified in child abuse pediatrics.

She explained that the purpose of taking such a history from alleged sexual abuse victims is for medical diagnosis and treatment. Doctor Barron further testified that, after obtaining Rick’s medical history, she and Dr. McCann conducted a complete “head-[to]-toe” physical examination of Rick, including a genital exam and a rectal exam (by means of a colposcope). It was her testimony that the result of Rick’s physical examination was “normal.” According to Dr. Barron, in her experience treating over five thousand children in a fifteen-year time span, the physical examination results of 95 percent of children who have alleged sexual abuse were “normal;” she explained that that means that there would not be “any trauma or injuries.” She testified that the reason for this is that “penetration with some micro trauma * * * heal[s] in one to two days.” She stated that a “normal” physical examination does not preclude a determination that sexual abuse has occurred.', '5. The Testimony of Detective Rotella', 'Detective Christopher Rotella of the Providence Police Department was called by the defense and testified that, on October 24, 2008, he interviewed Rick, who was then age ten, in order to elicit preliminary facts about the sexual assault allegations. He stated that he referred Rick to the Central Assault and Trauma Center for an interview, which took place on November', '-7- 19, 2008. It was Det.

The Testimony of Victor Muralles', 'Victor Muralles, defendant’s brother and the owner of the two-story house in which the alleged sexual molestations occurred, testified for the defense. He testified that, in April of 2004, defendant moved into one of the two bedrooms in the basement of his house on Penn Street in Providence. According to Victor, defendant’s bedroom included a “bed, a chair, a closet and [a] TV.” He testified that he and his wife and their two children were living on the first floor during the period when the alleged incidents took place.', 'Victor further testified that defendant saw Rick, Oliver, and Wallace every two weeks on Saturdays; he stated that all three boys would stay at the house for “about an hour.” On cross- examination, he testified that he worked from seven in the morning until noon on Saturdays; and he conceded that, for that reason, he was not continuously present when defendant’s children would visit his house. When asked if he saw defendant in the basement with the children, he replied: “Yes, but not that much. * * * Sometimes one would go down, or two, but not the whole group.” It was Victor’s testimony that he never saw anything inappropriate take place between defendant and Rick.', '7. The Testimony of Defendant', 'The defendant, Oscar Muralles, took the stand in his own defense. He denied that he had ever touched Rick or asked or forced him to touch his penis or to perform oral sex on him; he also denied that he had ever anally penetrated Rick. He further testified that Rick, Oliver, and', '-8- Wallace were in his basement apartment “very little;” but he did acknowledge that, during the course of the visits, there were times when only one of the boys was in the basement with him.', 'According to defendant, he separated from Danielle in 2002 because he would return from work to find their home “dirty” and also because he had “found her with another guy in [his] bed.” It was further defendant’s testimony that Danielle was “mad” at him for two reasons: first, because he had rebuffed a reconciliation request that she had made as he was driving her to visit her then-boyfriend, who was in jail; and, second, because he and his girlfriend had chosen to give their baby the same first name as that of Danielle’s youngest son.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'When ruling on a motion for a new trial, the trial justice “acts as a thirteenth juror and exercises independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.” State v.

Specifically, the trial justice stated that “[Oliver] was able to peek into the [bed]room and see what the defendant was doing with [Rick,] * * * [and later] recounted the fondling and the fellatio that he saw.” He remarked that “[t]his was one of the few cases where there was evidence” (viz., Oliver’s “eyewitness testimony”) that corroborated the victim’s testimony.', 'Next, the trial justice completed the second analytical step by independently assessing the credibility of the witnesses and weighing the evidence.', 'See Hie, 93 A.3d at 976.', 'He preliminarily characterized the testimony of Rick and Oliver as follows: “Both boys were hesitant and a bit embarrassed in their testimony, and there were a few educational or learning shortcomings.” He also took into account the purported inconsistencies in the boys’ testimonies, stating that, “[i]n large part, some of th[e] answers that they gave may have seemed reticent or a bit unsharpened, because both counsel were asking questions in confusing or compound fashion.” Eventually, the trial justice expressly stated:', '“[S]ince they disclosed the unsavory events to their mother in', '2008, they have never wavered from their report that the defendant', 'sexually molested [Rick]. They have been steadfast in those', 'accusations.” From his vantage point as a “front-row observer” at the trial, the trial justice concluded: “There was no way * * * that these youngsters fabricated the accusations.” Significantly, the trial justice found Rick and Oliver to have been “articulate and specific enough,” and “totally guileless.” The trial justice rejected outright “any suggestion that the boys’ mother * * * prevailed on them,', '- 12 - or overbore their will and somehow prompted them to lie about the accusations.” He reasoned that Danielle was financially dependent on defendant and that, accordingly, it would not have been in her interest to have her sons make false accusations against him.

Accordingly, we reject defendant’s argument that the trial justice “erroneously[] disregard[ed]” Danielle’s “potential motives” to promote false accusations.', 'As for the third step in his analysis, the trial justice expressed satisfaction with the jury’s verdict. He determined that “the jury carefully evaluated all the testimony and came to the proper conclusion.” And he proceeded to explicitly declare: “I would have made the same determinations [as the jury] and found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the molestation charges, and [on] all of them.” See State v. Imbruglia, 913 A.2d 1022, 1028 (R.I. 2007) (“If the trial justice concludes that he or she would have reached the same result as the jury did or that reasonable minds could differ as to the result, the motion for a new trial must be denied.”).', 'After carefully reviewing the record, we are of the opinion that defendant’s various arguments on appeal essentially amount to nothing more than a disagreement with the trial justice’s assessment of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence. In view of the verdict, the trial justice inferred that the jury disbelieved defendant—and he agreed with the jury’s credibility determinations. In partial explanation of his reasoning, the trial justice referred to this Court’s decision in State v. Mattatall, 603 A.2d 1098 (R.I. 1992).

62,"Ajax Construction Company, Inc. : v. : Liberty Mutual Insurance Company et al. : Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty, Robinson, and Indeglia, JJ. OPINION Justice Indeglia, for the Court. Ajax Construction Company (Ajax) and Beacon Mutual Insurance Company (Beacon) are before this Court on consolidated writs of certiorari from a decree of the Appellate Division of the Workers’ Compensation Court (the Appellate Division), in favor of Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (Liberty). 1 The Appellate Division vacated a prior decree of a judge of the Workers’ Compensation Court and entered a new decree ordering Beacon to pay workers’ compensation benefits to an injured Ajax employee and to reimburse Liberty for any benefits paid to Beacon by Liberty under the prior decree. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we quash the Appellate Division’s decree. I Facts and Travel The facts are largely undisputed. On October 26, 2004, an Ajax employee, Mark Furia, was injured while working as an iron worker on a job site in Milton, Massachusetts. Following his injury, Furia filed a petition against Ajax in the Rhode Island Workers’ Compensation Court. 1 Ajax filed two petitions for certiorari in this case (No. 2014-55-M.P., No. 2014-58-M.P.) and Beacon filed one (No. 2014-56-M.P.). By an order dated October 27, 2015, this Court consolidated the three cases. -1- Shortly thereafter, on November 18, 2004, Ajax petitioned the Rhode Island Workers’ Compensation Court, pursuant to § 28-35-12 and G.L. 1956 § 28-30-13, to determine which insurer (Beacon or Liberty) was obligated to pay Furia’s claim. On December 22, 2004, a judge of that court entered a pretrial order with respect to Furia’s petition that held that Furia sustained a work-related injury that resulted in total incapacity. That same day, the judge also entered an interlocutory order on Ajax’s petition that required Beacon to pay benefits to Furia, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 28-35-12(b)(1). The interlocutory order also stated that, if Beacon was found liable after trial, it would be entitled to receive a credit for all payments that it made to Furia; and, if Liberty was found liable, it would be ordered to reimburse Beacon for all payments that Beacon made to him. The same judge who entered the abovementioned orders conducted the trial on Ajax’s petition on July 11, 2005, September 8, 2005, and May 11, 2006. Donald Morel, Ajax’s president, was the only witness to testify. He stated that Ajax was located in Harrisville, Rhode Island, but he added that it did business in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, and Rhode Island. He testified that Ajax’s insurance agent, Christopher & Regan Insurance Inc., handled all of Ajax’s insurance. Morel stated that Ajax carried workers’ compensation insurance in every state that it worked in, which included insurance with Liberty in Massachusetts and Beacon in Rhode Island. Morel discussed the calculation of each insurer’s premium and explained that “[a]ny wages that were worked in Massachusetts on any Massachusetts job would be reported to Liberty like every other state. Whatever wages are worked on those jobs get reported to that insurance company, and our tax returns are used as back up for the wages.” The Liberty policy’s annual premium for workers’ compensation coverage was $282,707, and the Beacon policy’s annual premium was approximately $69,000. -2- In his testimony, Morel discussed Furia, who had been employed with Ajax for between fifteen and twenty years. He stated that Furia was injured while working in Milton, Massachusetts. 2 Morel explained that the particular job site where Furia was working when he was injured was not his sole place of employment, as Ajax moved iron workers to other job sites periodically. Morel testified that, after Furia’s injury, a Liberty representative called him and inquired as to where Furia had been hired and where he worked. Morel stated that he told the representative that he was unsure, but that Furia was likely hired at Ajax’s Rhode Island office. He said that he was uncertain because, at the time of his hire, Ajax was not located at its present office and did much of its hiring at the job sites. Morel was asked about his response to the Liberty representative who, during the phone call, inquired about the amount of work Ajax performed in Massachusetts and in Rhode Island. Morel testified that he may have told the representative that Ajax performed about 50 percent of its work in Massachusetts and 50 percent in Rhode Island, although he did not recall saying that to the representative. He stated that, at times, Ajax could have performed more work in Rhode Island; historically, however, 80 percent of Ajax’s work had been in Massachusetts. Morel testified that for any given year, Ajax was unsure of where it would perform the majority of its work. In the year of Furia’s injury, however, Ajax did more work in Massachusetts than Rhode Island. Morel also noted that, for employees who worked in Massachusetts, Ajax withheld Massachusetts income taxes and paid Massachusetts unemployment taxes. He said that his next contact with Liberty after the phone call was a letter from Liberty denying coverage for the 2 Morel noted that Furia had since returned to work at Ajax. -3- claim. Morel stated that he did not personally discuss Furia’s claim with a Beacon representative. The parties also introduced various documents into evidence, including the deposition transcripts of Furia and Jessica Reardon, a Liberty case manager. In Furia’s March 3, 2005 deposition, he stated that he was hired at the Ajax headquarters in Rhode Island and had worked for Ajax as an ironworker for twelve to fifteen years. Furia stated that, since his hire, he had worked in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. When asked what percentage of work he did in Massachusetts compared to Rhode Island, Furia responded “70/30.” Furia was asked whether Massachusetts or Rhode Island taxes were deducted from his Ajax paychecks, to which he replied, “Both, I believe.” Furia stated that, after his injury, his wife brought him to Kent Hospital, and he was later transferred to Rhode Island Hospital. He recalled a visit from a Liberty representative, Don Friar, while in the hospital. Friar told Furia that his claim was a “no-brainer” Rhode Island workers’ compensation case because Furia lived in and was hired in Rhode Island. Furia stated that Friar, before leaving, handed him a business card for a Rhode Island workers’ compensation attorney and told him to contact the attorney. In Reardon’s deposition, she stated that she was, at that time, assigned to handle Furia’s claim, but she noted that another adjuster, Ellen Cunningham, previously handled it. Reardon was unsure whether Liberty sent a representative to speak with Furia in the hospital. She was also asked about various case notes on Furia’s claim file, including a note that said, “Claim is Rhode Island jurisdiction based on PWALSH.” Reardon explained that “PWALSH” was an acronym for a test that Liberty used to determine a claim’s jurisdiction; she said that it stood for -4- “[p]aid, works, accident, lives, supervised, hired.” Reardon testified that Cunningham performed the PWALSH test for Furia’s claim and denied it on jurisdictional grounds. On May 11, 2006, the trial judge issued a bench decision. In it, he discussed G.L. 1956 § 28-36-5, which states, in pertinent part, “Every policy shall cover the entire liability of the employer under chapters 29 -- 38 of this title * * * .” He cited to an opinion of the Appellate Division of the Workers’ Compensation Court, Flaxington v. Persona Management, W.C.C. No. 92-14565 (App. Div. 1995), for the proposition that an insurer violates § 28-36-5 if it insures an employer but excludes coverage of a particular class of employees. Thus, the trial judge rejected Beacon’s argument that it had a right to limit the coverage it provided to various groups of employees by listing specific classes of covered employees in its policy. The trial judge stated that any attempts by Beacon to limit its coverage or exclude classes of employees from coverage were a nullity and, thus, did not exempt Beacon from liability. The trial judge stated that Ajax was liable to Furia under the Rhode Island Workers’ Compensation Act (the act) because Furia was hired in Rhode Island. He determined that Beacon was primarily liable to Furia because he brought his claim in Rhode Island and Beacon issued a policy to Ajax pursuant to the act. The trial judge stated, “I do believe that Mr. Furia has a right to expect payments from a single entity, and in this case, I have designated Beacon Mutual as that entity.” He also found that Ajax had dual or overlapping coverage regarding this claim because Furia had a right to compensation under the workers’ compensation laws of both Rhode Island and Massachusetts. Given the overlapping coverage, he determined that Liberty was required, under the policy it issued to Ajax, to share in Beacon’s responsibility to pay Furia. As such, the trial judge held that Liberty must reimburse Beacon for 50 percent of the benefits that Beacon paid to Furia. -5- The trial judge stated that the act lacked a particular remedy that addressed the matter at hand. He noted, however, that workers’ compensation law was “equitable in nature,” so he fashioned a remedy that was “equitable and in accordance with the existing law.” As such, the trial judge ordered that: Beacon provide workers’ compensation benefits to Furia, Beacon receive a credit for all sums paid to Furia after the interlocutory order entered, and Liberty indemnify Beacon for 50 percent of the workers’ compensation benefits paid to Furia. 3 In May 2006, following the decree, Ajax, Beacon, and Liberty each appealed to the Appellate Division. On appeal, Ajax argued that the trial judge erred in assigning Liberty only 50 percent liability for the payment of Furia’s benefits. It argued that Liberty should have been 100 percent liable for the payment of benefits because Ajax paid Liberty a premium exceeding $280,000 to provide workers’ compensation coverage for its employees who worked in, and were injured in, Massachusetts. Beacon argued that the Liberty policy covered Furia’s claim. It further asserted that § 28- 36-5 did not discharge Liberty from its obligation to pay benefits to Furia. Beacon also contended that Liberty engaged in unfair-claim-settlement practices in violation of G.L. 1956 § 27-9.1-4 and breached its fiduciary duty owed to Ajax because “it undertook to deny a legitimate Massachusetts claim without considering the impact their denial would have on its other coverage and potential premium effect.” Liberty argued that the trial judge erred in ordering it to indemnify Beacon for 50 percent of the benefits paid to Furia. It maintained that § 28-36-5 rendered Beacon responsible for covering Ajax’s entire liability. Further, Liberty asserted that its policy only covered a “Massachusetts employee” and Furia was a Rhode Island employee. 3 A decree encompassing the trial judge’s order was entered on May 19, 2006. -6- On November 7, 2013, more than seven years after the parties appealed, Beacon moved for a decision from the Appellate Division pursuant to § 28-35-28. 4 By an order dated January 21, 2014, the Appellate Division vacated the trial judge’s decree and ordered that Beacon be held fully responsible for paying workers’ compensation benefits to Furia and to reimburse Liberty for any workers’ compensation benefits it paid to Beacon under the prior decree. In its written decision, the Appellate Division first noted that Furia was covered under the Rhode Island Workers Compensation Act, specifically G.L. 1956 § 28-29-1.3, which states that it “shall apply to any and all employees, as defined in § 28-29-2(4), who are injured or hired in the state of Rhode Island.” The Appellate Division then addressed § 28-36-5 and its language that “[e]very policy shall cover the entire liability of the employer under chapters 29 -- 38 of this title * * * .” Relying on Professor Arthur Larson’s treatise on workers’ compensation, the Appellate Division determined that this language rendered Rhode Island’s workers’ compensation statute “in the category of ‘full-coverage’ statutes.” The Appellate Division noted that “[a] majority of courts in states with such ‘full-coverage’ statutes have interpreted this language to mean that the insurance policy is deemed to cover all employees of the insured in all occupations and all businesses.” Thus, the court found Beacon liable under § 28-36-5 for all of the benefits awarded to Furia because: (1) Beacon issued Ajax an insurance policy to cover its liability to its employees under the act; (2) Furia filed a claim in Rhode Island under the act; and (3) Furia was awarded workers’ compensation benefits pursuant to the act. The Appellate Division then addressed Ajax and Beacon’s argument that Liberty should pay Furia’s claim because it collected significantly more of its premium based on the payroll of construction workers, like Furia. It rejected this argument, however, noting that “the Rhode 4 We have found no explanation in the record for this inordinate delay, the length of which is concerning. -7- Island statute dictates the outcome in this case and places no weight on which insurer included the injured worker’s wages in their premium in determining which insurer is responsible.” The Appellate Division agreed with the trial judge that both Massachusetts and Rhode Island had concurrent jurisdiction over Furia’s claim because the Rhode Island Workers’ Compensation Act applied to employees hired in Rhode Island, like Furia, and the Massachusetts Workers’ Compensation Act applied to employees injured in Massachusetts, also like Furia. The court concluded that Liberty, under its policy’s terms, would have been responsible for paying benefits to Furia if he filed his claim in Massachusetts. The court noted that both the Liberty and the Beacon policies contained nearly identical provisions concerning the payment of benefits awarded in another state. Liberty’s policy provision entitled, “Massachusetts Limited Other States Insurance Endorsement” stated: “1. We will pay promptly, when due, the benefits required of you by the workers’ compensation law of any state other than Massachusetts, but only if the claim for such benefits involves work performed by a Massachusetts employee * * * .” Because the Liberty policy did not define “Massachusetts employee” as used in the endorsement, the Appellate Division looked to a bulletin issued by the Massachusetts Workers’ Compensation Rating and Inspection Bureau (WCRIB). The WCRIB was tasked with administering the assigned risk pool in Massachusetts, through which Ajax obtained the Liberty policy. The WCRIB bulletin defined “Massachusetts employees” as “individuals who are hired in Massachusetts to work primarily in Massachusetts, but who are temporarily working in another state in furtherance of their Massachusetts employers.” Based on this definition, the Appellate Division determined that Liberty was required “to pay benefits awarded in another state to an employee who was hired in Massachusetts by a Massachusetts employer and was -8- injured while working temporarily in that other state.” Because Furia was not hired in Massachusetts by a Massachusetts employer, the Appellate Division concluded that he was not a “Massachusetts employee” and, thus, Liberty was not responsible for paying benefits awarded to him in another state. The Appellate Division rejected Beacon’s contention that Liberty acted in bad faith, because the Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act stated that it was “not intended to cover claims involving workers’ compensation.” Section 27-9.1-1. 5 It deemed Beacon solely responsible for paying Furia’s benefits under the Act. Accordingly, the Appellate Division denied Ajax’s and Beacon’s appeals and granted Liberty’s appeal. The court entered a new decree vacating the trial judge’s decree and ordering Beacon to: pay workers’ compensation benefits to Furia on behalf of Ajax; take a credit for all payments made to Furia up to that point; and reimburse Liberty for any workers’ compensation benefits paid to it under the terms of the trial judge’s decree. Ajax and Beacon filed petitions for certiorari, which this Court granted. Before us, Ajax argues that the Appellate Division erred in: (1) finding Beacon solely responsible for the payment of Furia’s benefits; (2) concluding that the Liberty policy did not cover the benefits awarded to Furia under the act; and (3) not determining that equity rendered Liberty liable to cover the claim. Beacon asserts that the Appellate Division erred in: (1) allowing the location where Furia filed his claim to determine Liberty’s liability under the policy; (2) not interpreting the Liberty 5 We acknowledge and reproach some of Liberty’s behavior, most notably, the fact that a Liberty representative visited a hospitalized Furia, told him that his case was a Rhode Island workers’ compensation case, and gave him a Rhode Island workers’ compensation attorney’s business card. Neither party, however, pressed this issue on appeal, and thus, beyond expressing our displeasure, we need not address it further. -9- policy in a light most favorable to its insured, Ajax; (3) interpreting § 28-36-5 as requiring Beacon to provide coverage over all benefits awarded to Ajax employees who file a claim for benefits under the act; and (4) holding Beacon responsible for the payment of Furia’s benefits, although the parties had stipulated that Liberty set its premium based on Furia’s Massachusetts wages. Lastly, Liberty argues that Beacon contravened the act by defining “Rhode Island Employee” in its policy more narrowly than the act defined it. 6 II Standard of Review “Upon a petition for certiorari, we review a decree of the Appellate Division for any error of law or equity pursuant to * * * § 28-35-30.” Ellis v. Verizon New England, Inc., 63 A.3d 510, 513 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Mumma v. Cumberland Farms, Inc., 965 A.2d 437, 441 (R.I. 2009)). This Court’s review is limited “to examining the record to determine if an error of law has been committed.” Id. (quoting Matter of Falstaff Brewing Corp. Re: Narragansett Brewery Fire, 637 A.2d 1047, 1049 (R.I. 1994)). “If legally competent evidence exists in support of the factual findings of the Appellate Division, those findings are binding upon this [C]ourt, and the decree of the Appellate Division must be sustained.” Impulse Packaging, Inc. v.

Truex, 700 A.2d 1085, 1087-88 (R.I. 1997)). “This Court 6 We reject Liberty’s argument that Beacon violated G.L. 1956 § 28-29-2(4) by defining “Rhode Island Employee” more narrowly than defined in the act because we find Beacon’s definition of “Rhode Island Employee” neither relevant nor in contravention of the act. The phrase and accompanying definition of “Rhode Island Employee” appear within the “Temporary Exposure in Other States” provision in the Beacon policy, which addresses its payment of workers’ compensation benefits awarded in another state. This provision is inapplicable here because benefits were awarded to Furia in Rhode Island, Ajax is not requesting that Beacon pay benefits awarded out-of-state, and further, this provision applies to “Rhode Island Employee[s]” temporarily working in another state, not Furia who primarily worked in Massachusetts. The definition does not limit jurisdiction under the act; rather, it limits Beacon’s payment of out-of- state benefits. - 10 - will, however, conduct a de novo review if a question of law or a mixed question of fact and law is in issue.” Id. III Discussion The parties raise contract-interpretation and statutory-construction issues. The first concerns the Appellate Division’s interpretation of Liberty’s “Massachusetts Limited Other States Insurance Endorsement.” Specifically, Ajax and Beacon assert that the Appellate Division erred in concluding that Furia was not a “Massachusetts employee” entitled to recover under the endorsement. Second, Ajax and Beacon challenge the Appellate Division’s interpretation of § 28-36-5, namely, the meaning of the phrase “entire liability of the employer.” Ajax and Beacon contend that the phrase does not render Beacon responsible for paying the entire liability. We address each of these issues in turn. A “Massachusetts employee” Both Ajax and Beacon challenge the Appellate Division’s interpretation of the term “Massachusetts employee” as used in Liberty’s “Massachusetts Limited Other States Insurance Endorsement.” Ajax deems the term unambiguous and argues that the only reasonable interpretation of “Massachusetts employee” is an employee who works primarily in Massachusetts. It maintains that the Appellate Division’s conclusion that an employee who worked predominantly in Massachusetts, such as Furia, did not qualify as a “Massachusetts employee” was “unreasonable and contrary to the plain and ordinary meaning of that term.” Alternatively, Ajax contends that the Appellate Division’s resort to the WCRIB bulletin to define - 11 - “Massachusetts employee” renders the term ambiguous causing it to be construed against Liberty. Beacon also asserts that the term is unambiguous because “the ordinary reader and purchaser” of the Liberty policy would have understood the “Massachusetts Limited Other States Insurance Endorsement” to require Liberty to pay benefits awarded in another state. Further, Beacon avers that the Appellate Division erred in looking to the WCRIB bulletin to define the term because the endorsement was not attached to the Liberty policy or otherwise sent to Ajax. Because “the material facts of this case are undisputed, and the issue before us is one of contract interpretation[,]” we conduct a de novo review. New London County Mutual Insurance Co. v. Fontaine, 45 A.3d 551, 557 (R.I. 2012). “An insurance policy is contractual in nature[.]” Medical Malpractice Joint Underwriting Association of Rhode Island v.

Therefore, “when interpreting the disputed terms of an insurance policy, we must do so in accordance with the rules of construction that govern contracts.” Id. “[W]e shall not depart from the literal language of the policy absent a finding that the policy is ambiguous.” Van Hoesen v. Lloyd’s of London, 134 A.3d 178, 181 (R.I. 2016) (quoting Allstate Insurance Co. v. Ahlquist, 59 A.3d 95, 98 (R.I. 2013)). To determine whether a policy’s terms are ambiguous, “we give words their plain, ordinary, and usual meaning.” Medical Malpractice, 115 A.3d at 1002 (quoting Derderian, 44 A.3d at 128). “[W]e read the policy in its entirety, giving words their plain meaning; importantly, we refrain from ‘engaging in mental gymnastics or from stretching the imagination to read ambiguity into a policy where none is present.’” Peerless Insurance Co. v. Luppe, 118 A.3d 500, 506 (R.I. 2015) (quoting - 12 - Mallane v. Holyoke Mutual Insurance Co. in Salem, 658 A.2d 18, 20 (R.I. 1995)). “If an ambiguity is found, it is strictly construed in favor of the insured.” Koziol v. Peerless Insurance Co., 41 A.3d 647, 649-50 (R.I. 2012). Giving the term “Massachusetts employee” its plain, ordinary, and usual meaning, it is clear that the term is unambiguous. An ordinary reader and purchaser would have believed the term to mean an employee who works primarily in Massachusetts. No ordinary reader would have read “Massachusetts employee” to mean “individuals who are hired in Massachusetts to work primarily in Massachusetts, but who are temporarily working in another state in furtherance of their Massachusetts employers.” Under the term’s plain meaning, an employee who works primarily in Massachusetts, such as Furia, undoubtedly qualifies as a “Massachusetts employee.” Furia estimated that he worked in Massachusetts about 70 percent of the time. Additionally, Morel testified that Ajax predominantly worked in Massachusetts, Ajax withheld Massachusetts income taxes for every employee that worked in Massachusetts, and Ajax paid Massachusetts unemployment taxes. Moreover, the premium that Liberty received from Ajax was based on Ajax employees’ wages, including Furia’s, for jobs worked in Massachusetts. We further hold that the Appellate Division erred by looking to the WCRIB bulletin to define “Massachusetts employee.” “[B]efore the [Appellate Division] may look to extrinsic evidence[,] an ambiguity must be found in the terms of the contract.” Merrimack Mutual Fire Insurance Co. v. Dufault, 958 A.2d 620, 624-25 (R.I. 2008). The WCRIB bulletin constituted extrinsic evidence because it was not attached to the insurance policy. See Children's Friend & Service v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Insurance Co., 893 A.2d 222, 232 (R.I. 2006) (“It is the general rule that an endorsement or rider attached to an insurance policy becomes and forms a - 13 - part of the contract * * * .”) (quoting National Union Fire Insurance Co. of Pittsburgh v. Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co., 385 F.3d 47, 55 (1st Cir. 2004)). In its decision, the Appellate Division acknowledged that the Liberty policy issued to Ajax did not include the relied-upon definition of “Massachusetts employee.” Here, because the Appellate Division did not expressly find ambiguity in the term, reliance on extrinsic evidence for its definition was error. Even if the Appellate Division declared “Massachusetts employee” ambiguous, “[w]hen a policy term is found to be ambiguous, * * * ‘the policy will be strictly construed in favor of the insured and against the insurer.’” Medical Malpractice, 115 A.3d at 1003 (quoting Derderian, 44 A.3d at 127). The Appellate Division failed to construe “Massachusetts employee” in favor of Ajax, the insured, and instead, adopted the WCRIB’s definition that limited Liberty’s liability to pay benefits under its “Massachusetts Limited Other States Insurance Endorsement.” Accordingly, we deem the term “Massachusetts employee” unambiguous; and, under its plain meaning, Furia, who worked primarily in Massachusetts, is a “Massachusetts employee” under Liberty’s policy. As Liberty’s policy states that it will pay the benefits required by the workers’ compensation law of any state other than Massachusetts, if the claim involves work performed by a Massachusetts employee, Liberty must pay Furia’s benefits. Having so found, we must still determine whether Beacon could also be liable for Furia’s claim under § 28-36-5. B “[E]ntire liability of the employer” Ajax and Beacon also challenge the Appellate Division’s interpretation of “entire liability of the employer” as used within § 28-36-5, which states, in pertinent part, “[e]very policy shall - 14 - cover the entire liability of the employer under chapters 29 -- 38 of this title * * * .” (Emphasis added). Ajax argues that the Appellate Division erroneously broadened the scope of § 28-36-5 and failed to further the statute’s legislative intent of ensuring that an employer covers all of its employees. It asserts that nothing in the statute states that this must be accomplished through one policy. Further, Ajax contends that the interpretation “leads to absurd, unintended and unreasonable results.” It maintains that the Appellate Division’s interpretation would make it necessary for Ajax and similar employers “to obtain expensive, duplicative coverage in multiple states based solely on the employee’s choice of forum.” Similarly, Beacon argues that the phrase “entire liability of the employer” is unclear and ambiguous. It therefore contends that the Appellate Division’s interpretation flouted the statute’s legislative intent because it would prevent employers from obtaining workers’ compensation coverage through different insurers, so long as all employees were covered under the act, and it would limit competition among insurers. Rather, Beacon maintains that a “more logical” interpretation of the phrase is that a policy cannot exclude benefits that the act provides, but there is no requirement that all coverage must be from one policy. Beacon concludes by asserting that Furia’s decision to file his claim in Rhode Island should not determine Liberty’s liability as “Ajax bargained for coverage with Liberty, paid for that coverage, [and] had an expectation of coverage for claims such as Mr. Furia’s * * * .” We review this statutory-construction issue de novo. Conley v. Fontaine, 138 A.3d 756, 760 (R.I. 2016). To this end, “[i]f its language is ‘clear and unambiguous,’ this Court must apply its ‘plain and ordinary meaning’ and abstain from judicial construction.” Prew v. Employee Retirement System of Providence, 139 A.3d 556, 561 (R.I. 2016) (quoting Pierce v. Providence - 15 - Retirement Board, 15 A.3d 957, 963 (R.I. 2011)). If a statute’s language is ambiguous, however, “we must apply the rules of statutory construction and examine the statute in its entirety to determine the intent and purpose of the Legislature.” 5750 Post Road Medical Offices, LLC v. East Greenwich Fire District, 138 A.3d 163, 167 (R.I. 2016) (quoting In re Tetreault, 11 A.3d 635, 639 (R.I. 2011)). We deem the phrase “entire liability of the employer” unclear and ambiguous, and accordingly, we must analyze the act to glean its legislative intent and purpose. “The primary object of [workers’] compensation is to provide economic assistance to an employee who is injured and thereby suffers a loss of earnings” and “to impose upon the employer the burden of taking care of the casualties occurring in his employment, thus preventing the injured employee from becoming a public charge.” Geigy Chemical Corp. v. Zuckerman, 106 R.I. 534, 541, 261 A.2d 844, 848 (1970). With that purpose in mind, the Legislature enacted § 28-36-5, which provides that “[e]very policy shall cover the entire liability of the employer * * * .” Because “[t]his Court always will strive to adopt a construction of a statute that avoids an absurd or unjust result,” we decline to adopt the Appellate Division’s statutory interpretation. Berman v. Sitrin, 991 A.2d 1038, 1049 (R.I. 2010). Instead, we conclude that the legislative intent of “entire liability of the employer” was to ensure that employers obtain complete coverage for all of their employees. It did not, however, bar them from doing so with more than one policy or insurer. Here, Ajax, through the same insurance agent, purchased policies from Beacon and Liberty to cover the act’s mandate. By its interpretation, the Appellate Division extended the Beacon policy, without the corresponding premiums to cover the added risks, and deflated the Liberty policy, despite its already significant premiums. - 16 - Although we have not previously interpreted the phrase “entire liability of the employer” and interpretations from other jurisdictions are scant, we take guidance from an earlier opinion of the Connecticut Supreme Court. In Miller Bros. Const. Co. v. Maryland Casualty Co., 155 A. 709, 713 (Conn. 1931), the Connecticut Supreme Court concluded that “the entire liability of the employer” did “not require coverage for the entire liability of an employer, anywhere and at any time; but such liability of the employer as the insurance company undertakes to assume must be assumed in its entirety.” Rather, it held that “[f]ull coverage of the entire liability of an employer at a given place or places, on specified work, fully meets the intent of the statute in this respect.” Id. The court noted that otherwise “it would be necessary for an employer in all cases to obtain a single policy covering all his liability in every place, and would prevent his taking out several policies in different companies * * * .” Id. While insurance policies cannot exclude benefits provided under the act, § 28-36-5 does not prevent an employer from having more than one insurer for all of its workers, especially if doing so will result in savings to the employer. As Beacon points out, this “would be akin to a requirement that a property owner insure their home, car, and other personal belongings with the same insurer.” We further disagree with the Appellate Division’s interpretation that based an insurer’s responsibility to pay benefits on the place where the claim was filed, rather than the policy’s language, leaving liability to something as arbitrary as the location of the employee’s filing. Indeed, other states have declined to adopt interpretations that would cause liability to hinge on the location of the filing. See Miller Bros. Const. Co., 155 A. at 713; American Mutual Insurance Co. v. Duvall, 372 A.2d 263, 266 (N.H. 1977); Weinberg v. State Workmen’s Ins. Fund, 81 A.2d 906, 909 (Pa. 1951); Lenny Szarek, Inc. v. Maryland Casualty Co., 829 N.E.2d - 17 - 871, 875 (Ill. App. Ct. 2005). 7 An employee’s choice to file a workers’ compensation claim in a particular state is merely “a happenstance” that is immaterial to an insurer’s liability under its policy. American Mutual Insurance Co., 372 A.2d at 266. Having examined the legislative intent and purpose of the act, we hold that the phrase “entire liability of the employer” was meant to ensure that an employer obtained coverage for all of its employees, not that it had to do so with a single policy. Beacon is not responsible under § 28-36-5 to pay the benefits on Furia’s claim solely because he filed it in Rhode Island. Accordingly, the Appellate Division erred in its interpretations of “Massachusetts employee” and “entire liability of the employer.” As such, Liberty is liable under the “Massachusetts Limited Other States Insurance Endorsement” for the payment of benefits awarded to Furia in Rhode Island, and Beacon is not liable under § 28-36-5 to pay any benefits on the claim. Liberty shall reimburse Beacon for any payments made by Beacon pursuant to the lower courts’ rulings in this case. IV Conclusion For the reasons outlined in this opinion, the petitions for certiorari are granted, and the decree of the Appellate Division is quashed. The record in this case is remanded to the Appellate Division with our decision endorsed thereon. 7 In Lenny Szarek, Inc. v. Maryland Casualty Co., 829 N.E.2d 871, 872-73 (Ill. App. Ct. 2005), a factually analogous case, an Illinois employer had two insurance policies: one for its work in Wisconsin and one for its work in Illinois. A Szarek employee was injured while working in Wisconsin and filed his workers’ compensation claim in Illinois, the state of his residence. Id. at 873. The Wisconsin insurer denied liability, arguing that its policy only covered claims brought in Wisconsin. Id. The Appellate Court of Illinois rejected this view, to “avoid[] having an employer’s coverage rest totally on the whim of the employee in his choice of the forum state in which to process the claim.” Id. at 877. - 18 - STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS SUPREME COURT – CLERK’S OFFICE OPINION COVER SHEET Ajax Construction Company, Inc. v.

Archetto, Esq.",non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court.', 'Ajax Construction Company (Ajax) and Beacon Mutual Insurance Company (Beacon) are before this Court on consolidated writs of certiorari from a decree of the Appellate Division of the Workers’ Compensation Court (the Appellate Division), in favor of Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (Liberty). 1 The Appellate Division vacated a prior decree of a judge of the Workers’ Compensation Court and entered a new decree ordering Beacon to pay workers’ compensation benefits to an injured Ajax employee and to reimburse Liberty for any benefits paid to Beacon by Liberty under the prior decree. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we quash the Appellate Division’s decree.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The facts are largely undisputed. On October 26, 2004, an Ajax employee, Mark Furia, was injured while working as an iron worker on a job site in Milton, Massachusetts. Following his injury, Furia filed a petition against Ajax in the Rhode Island Workers’ Compensation Court. 1', 'Ajax filed two petitions for certiorari in this case (No. 2014-55-M.P., No. 2014-58-M.P.) and Beacon filed one (No. 2014-56-M.P.). By an order dated October 27, 2015, this Court consolidated the three cases.', '-1- Shortly thereafter, on November 18, 2004, Ajax petitioned the Rhode Island Workers’ Compensation Court, pursuant to § 28-35-12 and G.L. 1956 § 28-30-13, to determine which insurer (Beacon or Liberty) was obligated to pay Furia’s claim. On December 22, 2004, a judge of that court entered a pretrial order with respect to Furia’s petition that held that Furia sustained a work-related injury that resulted in total incapacity. That same day, the judge also entered an interlocutory order on Ajax’s petition that required Beacon to pay benefits to Furia, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 28-35-12(b)(1). The interlocutory order also stated that, if Beacon was found liable after trial, it would be entitled to receive a credit for all payments that it made to Furia; and, if Liberty was found liable, it would be ordered to reimburse Beacon for all payments that Beacon made to him.', 'The same judge who entered the abovementioned orders conducted the trial on Ajax’s petition on July 11, 2005, September 8, 2005, and May 11, 2006.', 'Donald Morel, Ajax’s president, was the only witness to testify. He stated that Ajax was located in Harrisville, Rhode Island, but he added that it did business in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, and Rhode Island.', 'He testified that Ajax’s insurance agent, Christopher & Regan Insurance Inc., handled all of Ajax’s insurance. Morel stated that Ajax carried workers’ compensation insurance in every state that it worked in, which included insurance with Liberty in Massachusetts and Beacon in Rhode Island. Morel discussed the calculation of each insurer’s premium and explained that “[a]ny wages that were worked in Massachusetts on any Massachusetts job would be reported to Liberty like every other state. Whatever wages are worked on those jobs get reported to that insurance company, and our tax returns are used as back up for the wages.” The Liberty policy’s annual premium for workers’ compensation coverage was $282,707, and the Beacon policy’s annual premium was approximately $69,000.', '-2-', 'In his testimony, Morel discussed Furia, who had been employed with Ajax for between fifteen and twenty years.', 'He stated that Furia was injured while working in Milton, Massachusetts. 2 Morel explained that the particular job site where Furia was working when he was injured was not his sole place of employment, as Ajax moved iron workers to other job sites periodically.', 'Morel testified that, after Furia’s injury, a Liberty representative called him and inquired as to where Furia had been hired and where he worked.', 'Morel stated that he told the representative that he was unsure, but that Furia was likely hired at Ajax’s Rhode Island office. He said that he was uncertain because, at the time of his hire, Ajax was not located at its present office and did much of its hiring at the job sites.', 'Morel was asked about his response to the Liberty representative who, during the phone call, inquired about the amount of work Ajax performed in Massachusetts and in Rhode Island. Morel testified that he may have told the representative that Ajax performed about 50 percent of its work in Massachusetts and 50 percent in Rhode Island, although he did not recall saying that to the representative. He stated that, at times, Ajax could have performed more work in Rhode Island; historically, however, 80 percent of Ajax’s work had been in Massachusetts. Morel testified that for any given year, Ajax was unsure of where it would perform the majority of its work. In the year of Furia’s injury, however, Ajax did more work in Massachusetts than Rhode Island. Morel also noted that, for employees who worked in Massachusetts, Ajax withheld Massachusetts income taxes and paid Massachusetts unemployment taxes. He said that his next contact with Liberty after the phone call was a letter from Liberty denying coverage for the 2', 'Morel noted that Furia had since returned to work at Ajax.', '-3- claim.', 'Morel stated that he did not personally discuss Furia’s claim with a Beacon representative.', 'The parties also introduced various documents into evidence, including the deposition transcripts of Furia and Jessica Reardon, a Liberty case manager. In Furia’s March 3, 2005 deposition, he stated that he was hired at the Ajax headquarters in Rhode Island and had worked for Ajax as an ironworker for twelve to fifteen years. Furia stated that, since his hire, he had worked in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. When asked what percentage of work he did in Massachusetts compared to Rhode Island, Furia responded “70/30.” Furia was asked whether Massachusetts or Rhode Island taxes were deducted from his Ajax paychecks, to which he replied, “Both, I believe.”', 'Furia stated that, after his injury, his wife brought him to Kent Hospital, and he was later transferred to Rhode Island Hospital. He recalled a visit from a Liberty representative, Don Friar, while in the hospital. Friar told Furia that his claim was a “no-brainer” Rhode Island workers’ compensation case because Furia lived in and was hired in Rhode Island. Furia stated that Friar, before leaving, handed him a business card for a Rhode Island workers’ compensation attorney and told him to contact the attorney.', 'In Reardon’s deposition, she stated that she was, at that time, assigned to handle Furia’s claim, but she noted that another adjuster, Ellen Cunningham, previously handled it. Reardon was unsure whether Liberty sent a representative to speak with Furia in the hospital. She was also asked about various case notes on Furia’s claim file, including a note that said, “Claim is Rhode Island jurisdiction based on PWALSH.” Reardon explained that “PWALSH” was an acronym for a test that Liberty used to determine a claim’s jurisdiction; she said that it stood for', '-4- “[p]aid, works, accident, lives, supervised, hired.” Reardon testified that Cunningham performed the PWALSH test for Furia’s claim and denied it on jurisdictional grounds.', 'On May 11, 2006, the trial judge issued a bench decision. In it, he discussed G.L. 1956 § 28-36-5, which states, in pertinent part, “Every policy shall cover the entire liability of the employer under chapters 29 -- 38 of this title * * * .” He cited to an opinion of the Appellate Division of the Workers’ Compensation Court, Flaxington v. Persona Management, W.C.C. No. 92-14565 (App. Div. 1995), for the proposition that an insurer violates § 28-36-5 if it insures an employer but excludes coverage of a particular class of employees. Thus, the trial judge rejected Beacon’s argument that it had a right to limit the coverage it provided to various groups of employees by listing specific classes of covered employees in its policy. The trial judge stated that any attempts by Beacon to limit its coverage or exclude classes of employees from coverage were a nullity and, thus, did not exempt Beacon from liability.', 'The trial judge stated that Ajax was liable to Furia under the Rhode Island Workers’ Compensation Act (the act) because Furia was hired in Rhode Island. He determined that Beacon was primarily liable to Furia because he brought his claim in Rhode Island and Beacon issued a policy to Ajax pursuant to the act. The trial judge stated, “I do believe that Mr. Furia has a right to expect payments from a single entity, and in this case, I have designated Beacon Mutual as that entity.” He also found that Ajax had dual or overlapping coverage regarding this claim because Furia had a right to compensation under the workers’ compensation laws of both Rhode Island and Massachusetts. Given the overlapping coverage, he determined that Liberty was required, under the policy it issued to Ajax, to share in Beacon’s responsibility to pay Furia. As such, the trial judge held that Liberty must reimburse Beacon for 50 percent of the benefits that Beacon paid to Furia.', '-5-', 'The trial judge stated that the act lacked a particular remedy that addressed the matter at hand. He noted, however, that workers’ compensation law was “equitable in nature,” so he fashioned a remedy that was “equitable and in accordance with the existing law.” As such, the trial judge ordered that: Beacon provide workers’ compensation benefits to Furia, Beacon receive a credit for all sums paid to Furia after the interlocutory order entered, and Liberty indemnify Beacon for 50 percent of the workers’ compensation benefits paid to Furia. 3', 'In May 2006, following the decree, Ajax, Beacon, and Liberty each appealed to the Appellate Division. On appeal, Ajax argued that the trial judge erred in assigning Liberty only 50 percent liability for the payment of Furia’s benefits. It argued that Liberty should have been 100 percent liable for the payment of benefits because Ajax paid Liberty a premium exceeding $280,000 to provide workers’ compensation coverage for its employees who worked in, and were injured in, Massachusetts.', 'Beacon argued that the Liberty policy covered Furia’s claim. It further asserted that § 28- 36-5 did not discharge Liberty from its obligation to pay benefits to Furia.', 'Beacon also contended that Liberty engaged in unfair-claim-settlement practices in violation of G.L. 1956 § 27-9.1-4 and breached its fiduciary duty owed to Ajax because “it undertook to deny a legitimate Massachusetts claim without considering the impact their denial would have on its other coverage and potential premium effect.”', 'Liberty argued that the trial judge erred in ordering it to indemnify Beacon for 50 percent of the benefits paid to Furia. It maintained that § 28-36-5 rendered Beacon responsible for covering Ajax’s entire liability.', 'Further, Liberty asserted that its policy only covered a “Massachusetts employee” and Furia was a Rhode Island employee. 3', 'A decree encompassing the trial judge’s order was entered on May 19, 2006.', '-6-', 'On November 7, 2013, more than seven years after the parties appealed, Beacon moved for a decision from the Appellate Division pursuant to § 28-35-28. 4 By an order dated January 21, 2014, the Appellate Division vacated the trial judge’s decree and ordered that Beacon be held fully responsible for paying workers’ compensation benefits to Furia and to reimburse Liberty for any workers’ compensation benefits it paid to Beacon under the prior decree.', 'In its written decision, the Appellate Division first noted that Furia was covered under the Rhode Island Workers Compensation Act, specifically G.L. 1956 § 28-29-1.3, which states that it “shall apply to any and all employees, as defined in § 28-29-2(4), who are injured or hired in the state of Rhode Island.” The Appellate Division then addressed § 28-36-5 and its language that “[e]very policy shall cover the entire liability of the employer under chapters 29 -- 38 of this title * * * .” Relying on Professor Arthur Larson’s treatise on workers’ compensation, the Appellate Division determined that this language rendered Rhode Island’s workers’ compensation statute “in the category of ‘full-coverage’ statutes.” The Appellate Division noted that “[a] majority of courts in states with such ‘full-coverage’ statutes have interpreted this language to mean that the insurance policy is deemed to cover all employees of the insured in all occupations and all businesses.” Thus, the court found Beacon liable under § 28-36-5 for all of the benefits awarded to Furia because: (1) Beacon issued Ajax an insurance policy to cover its liability to its employees under the act; (2) Furia filed a claim in Rhode Island under the act; and (3) Furia was awarded workers’ compensation benefits pursuant to the act.', 'The Appellate Division then addressed Ajax and Beacon’s argument that Liberty should pay Furia’s claim because it collected significantly more of its premium based on the payroll of construction workers, like Furia. It rejected this argument, however, noting that “the Rhode 4', 'We have found no explanation in the record for this inordinate delay, the length of which is concerning.', '-7- Island statute dictates the outcome in this case and places no weight on which insurer included the injured worker’s wages in their premium in determining which insurer is responsible.”', 'The Appellate Division agreed with the trial judge that both Massachusetts and Rhode Island had concurrent jurisdiction over Furia’s claim because the Rhode Island Workers’ Compensation Act applied to employees hired in Rhode Island, like Furia, and the Massachusetts Workers’ Compensation Act applied to employees injured in Massachusetts, also like Furia. The court concluded that Liberty, under its policy’s terms, would have been responsible for paying benefits to Furia if he filed his claim in Massachusetts.', 'The court noted that both the Liberty and the Beacon policies contained nearly identical provisions concerning the payment of benefits awarded in another state.', 'Liberty’s policy provision entitled, “Massachusetts Limited Other States Insurance Endorsement” stated: “1. We will pay promptly, when due, the benefits required of you by the workers’ compensation law of any state other than Massachusetts, but only if the claim for such benefits involves work performed by a Massachusetts employee * * * .”', 'Because the Liberty policy did not define “Massachusetts employee” as used in the endorsement, the Appellate Division looked to a bulletin issued by the Massachusetts Workers’ Compensation Rating and Inspection Bureau (WCRIB).', 'The WCRIB was tasked with administering the assigned risk pool in Massachusetts, through which Ajax obtained the Liberty policy. The WCRIB bulletin defined “Massachusetts employees” as “individuals who are hired in Massachusetts to work primarily in Massachusetts, but who are temporarily working in another state in furtherance of their Massachusetts employers.” Based on this definition, the Appellate Division determined that Liberty was required “to pay benefits awarded in another state to an employee who was hired in Massachusetts by a Massachusetts employer and was', '-8- injured while working temporarily in that other state.”', 'Because Furia was not hired in Massachusetts by a Massachusetts employer, the Appellate Division concluded that he was not a “Massachusetts employee” and, thus, Liberty was not responsible for paying benefits awarded to him in another state.', 'The Appellate Division rejected Beacon’s contention that Liberty acted in bad faith, because the Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act stated that it was “not intended to cover claims involving workers’ compensation.”', 'Section 27-9.1-1. 5', 'It deemed Beacon solely responsible for paying Furia’s benefits under the Act. Accordingly, the Appellate Division denied Ajax’s and Beacon’s appeals and granted Liberty’s appeal. The court entered a new decree vacating the trial judge’s decree and ordering Beacon to: pay workers’ compensation benefits to Furia on behalf of Ajax; take a credit for all payments made to Furia up to that point; and reimburse Liberty for any workers’ compensation benefits paid to it under the terms of the trial judge’s decree.', 'Ajax and Beacon filed petitions for certiorari, which this Court granted. Before us, Ajax argues that the Appellate Division erred in: (1) finding Beacon solely responsible for the payment of Furia’s benefits; (2) concluding that the Liberty policy did not cover the benefits awarded to Furia under the act; and (3) not determining that equity rendered Liberty liable to cover the claim.', 'Beacon asserts that the Appellate Division erred in: (1) allowing the location where Furia filed his claim to determine Liberty’s liability under the policy; (2) not interpreting the Liberty 5', 'We acknowledge and reproach some of Liberty’s behavior, most notably, the fact that a Liberty representative visited a hospitalized Furia, told him that his case was a Rhode Island workers’ compensation case, and gave him a Rhode Island workers’ compensation attorney’s business card. Neither party, however, pressed this issue on appeal, and thus, beyond expressing our displeasure, we need not address it further.', '-9- policy in a light most favorable to its insured, Ajax; (3) interpreting § 28-36-5 as requiring Beacon to provide coverage over all benefits awarded to Ajax employees who file a claim for benefits under the act; and (4) holding Beacon responsible for the payment of Furia’s benefits, although the parties had stipulated that Liberty set its premium based on Furia’s Massachusetts wages. Lastly, Liberty argues that Beacon contravened the act by defining “Rhode Island Employee” in its policy more narrowly than the act defined it. 6', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“Upon a petition for certiorari, we review a decree of the Appellate Division for any error of law or equity pursuant to * * * § 28-35-30.” Ellis v.

The phrase and accompanying definition of “Rhode Island Employee” appear within the “Temporary Exposure in Other States” provision in the Beacon policy, which addresses its payment of workers’ compensation benefits awarded in another state. This provision is inapplicable here because benefits were awarded to Furia in Rhode Island, Ajax is not requesting that Beacon pay benefits awarded out-of-state, and further, this provision applies to “Rhode Island Employee[s]” temporarily working in another state, not Furia who primarily worked in Massachusetts.

Second, Ajax and Beacon challenge the Appellate Division’s interpretation of § 28-36-5, namely, the meaning of the phrase “entire liability of the employer.” Ajax and Beacon contend that the phrase does not render Beacon responsible for paying the entire liability.

It maintains that the Appellate Division’s conclusion that an employee who worked predominantly in Massachusetts, such as Furia, did not qualify as a “Massachusetts employee” was “unreasonable and contrary to the plain and ordinary meaning of that term.” Alternatively, Ajax contends that the Appellate Division’s resort to the WCRIB bulletin to define', '- 11 - “Massachusetts employee” renders the term ambiguous causing it to be construed against Liberty.', 'Beacon also asserts that the term is unambiguous because “the ordinary reader and purchaser” of the Liberty policy would have understood the “Massachusetts Limited Other States Insurance Endorsement” to require Liberty to pay benefits awarded in another state.

The Appellate Division failed to construe “Massachusetts employee” in favor of Ajax, the insured, and instead, adopted the WCRIB’s definition that limited Liberty’s liability to pay benefits under its “Massachusetts Limited Other States Insurance Endorsement.”', 'Accordingly, we deem the term “Massachusetts employee” unambiguous; and, under its plain meaning, Furia, who worked primarily in Massachusetts, is a “Massachusetts employee” under Liberty’s policy. As Liberty’s policy states that it will pay the benefits required by the workers’ compensation law of any state other than Massachusetts, if the claim involves work performed by a Massachusetts employee, Liberty must pay Furia’s benefits. Having so found, we must still determine whether Beacon could also be liable for Furia’s claim under § 28-36-5.', 'B', '“[E]ntire liability of the employer”', 'Ajax and Beacon also challenge the Appellate Division’s interpretation of “entire liability of the employer” as used within § 28-36-5, which states, in pertinent part, “[e]very policy shall', '- 14 - cover the entire liability of the employer under chapters 29 -- 38 of this title * * * .” (Emphasis added).', 'Ajax argues that the Appellate Division erroneously broadened the scope of § 28-36-5 and failed to further the statute’s legislative intent of ensuring that an employer covers all of its employees. It asserts that nothing in the statute states that this must be accomplished through one policy. Further, Ajax contends that the interpretation “leads to absurd, unintended and unreasonable results.” It maintains that the Appellate Division’s interpretation would make it necessary for Ajax and similar employers “to obtain expensive, duplicative coverage in multiple states based solely on the employee’s choice of forum.”', 'Similarly, Beacon argues that the phrase “entire liability of the employer” is unclear and ambiguous. It therefore contends that the Appellate Division’s interpretation flouted the statute’s legislative intent because it would prevent employers from obtaining workers’ compensation coverage through different insurers, so long as all employees were covered under the act, and it would limit competition among insurers.', 'Rather, Beacon maintains that a “more logical” interpretation of the phrase is that a policy cannot exclude benefits that the act provides, but there is no requirement that all coverage must be from one policy. Beacon concludes by asserting that Furia’s decision to file his claim in Rhode Island should not determine Liberty’s liability as “Ajax bargained for coverage with Liberty, paid for that coverage, [and] had an expectation of coverage for claims such as Mr. Furia’s * * * .”', 'We review this statutory-construction issue de novo.

Zuckerman, 106 R.I. 534, 541, 261 A.2d 844, 848 (1970). With that purpose in mind, the Legislature enacted § 28-36-5, which provides that “[e]very policy shall cover the entire liability of the employer * * * .”', 'Because “[t]his Court always will strive to adopt a construction of a statute that avoids an absurd or unjust result,” we decline to adopt the Appellate Division’s statutory interpretation. Berman v. Sitrin, 991 A.2d 1038, 1049 (R.I. 2010). Instead, we conclude that the legislative intent of “entire liability of the employer” was to ensure that employers obtain complete coverage for all of their employees. It did not, however, bar them from doing so with more than one policy or insurer. Here, Ajax, through the same insurance agent, purchased policies from Beacon and Liberty to cover the act’s mandate. By its interpretation, the Appellate Division extended the Beacon policy, without the corresponding premiums to cover the added risks, and deflated the Liberty policy, despite its already significant premiums.', '- 16 -', 'Although we have not previously interpreted the phrase “entire liability of the employer” and interpretations from other jurisdictions are scant, we take guidance from an earlier opinion of the Connecticut Supreme Court. In Miller Bros. Const. Co. v. Maryland Casualty Co., 155 A. 709, 713 (Conn. 1931), the Connecticut Supreme Court concluded that “the entire liability of the employer” did “not require coverage for the entire liability of an employer, anywhere and at any time; but such liability of the employer as the insurance company undertakes to assume must be assumed in its entirety.” Rather, it held that “[f]ull coverage of the entire liability of an employer at a given place or places, on specified work, fully meets the intent of the statute in this respect.” Id. The court noted that otherwise “it would be necessary for an employer in all cases to obtain a single policy covering all his liability in every place, and would prevent his taking out several policies in different companies * * * .” Id. While insurance policies cannot exclude benefits provided under the act, § 28-36-5 does not prevent an employer from having more than one insurer for all of its workers, especially if doing so will result in savings to the employer. As Beacon points out, this “would be akin to a requirement that a property owner insure their home, car, and other personal belongings with the same insurer.”', 'We further disagree with the Appellate Division’s interpretation that based an insurer’s responsibility to pay benefits on the place where the claim was filed, rather than the policy’s language, leaving liability to something as arbitrary as the location of the employee’s filing. Indeed, other states have declined to adopt interpretations that would cause liability to hinge on the location of the filing.', 'See Miller Bros. Const.

Beacon is not responsible under § 28-36-5 to pay the benefits on Furia’s claim solely because he filed it in Rhode Island. Accordingly, the Appellate Division erred in its interpretations of “Massachusetts employee” and “entire liability of the employer.” As such, Liberty is liable under the “Massachusetts Limited Other States Insurance Endorsement” for the payment of benefits awarded to Furia in Rhode Island, and Beacon is not liable under § 28-36-5 to pay any benefits on the claim.

At issue in this case is the legal propriety of a decision allowing Todd and Tina Sposato (the Sposatos) to keep four alpacas on their residential property in Hopkinton (the property) as pets.1 The petitioner, Amber Preston, filed a petition for issuance of a writ of certiorari, which this Court granted, seeking review of a Washington County Superior Court judgment, in which the Superior Court justice affirmed the decision of the Zoning Board of Review of the Town of Hopkinton (Zoning Board).', 'The Superior Court justice classified the four alpacas as “pets” and accordingly declared that keeping them on the property located in an R-1 zone was a permitted use. Ms. Preston contends that the Superior Court justice erred when he “suggested the keeping of alpacas as pets [is] an accessory use in an R-1 zone.” With respect to the decision of the Zoning Board, Ms. Preston avers that the Zoning Board 1', 'An alpaca is defined as “[a] domesticated South American ruminant mammal * * * related to the llama and having fine, long wool.” The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 50 (5th ed. 2011).', '-1- “exceeded its authority and abused its discretion when it made a decision personal to the Sposatos.”', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we quash the judgment of the Superior Court.

The Sposatos’ property is located in an R-1 zone, and it is approximately 45,000 square feet in size. Ms. Preston, the petitioner, resided in a single-family house at 131 North Road, which property abuts the Sposatos’ property and is likewise located in an R-1 zone.', 'The Zoning Officer’s notice of violation was predicated on his conclusion that alpacas are “farm animals” or “[l]ivestock” rather than “domestic animals”—the former being prohibited in an R-1 zone in Hopkinton and the latter being permitted in such a zone.', 'In due course, the Sposatos appealed the Zoning Officer’s notice of violation to the Zoning Board, which conducted four hearings late in 2011 and early in 2012. Then, on February 9, 2012, the Zoning Board issued a nine-page decision. By a majority vote, it overturned the Zoning Officer’s ruling and concluded that alpacas are “domestic animals.”', 'Immediately thereafter, however, and by a separate vote, the Zoning Board imposed four “conditions” on the', '-2- Sposatos with respect to the continued presence of alpacas on the property. 2 Those conditions read as follows:', '“1.

In our judgment, the last of the four above-quoted “conditions” imposed upon the Sposatos by the Zoning Board is plainly inconsistent with venerable and settled principles in the law of land use.', 'The fourth condition explicitly provides that “[t]he right to keep alpaca on this property does not run with the land; that is, if the [Sposatos] sell this property the next owners are not permitted to keep alpaca.” However, it is a basic principle that a zoning authority is not free to impose such a condition on the use of land.

See Olevson, 71 R.I. at 307-08, 44 A.2d at 722 (declining to sustain a condition imposed by the zoning board because the condition related to the landowner personally and not to the use of the land). Accordingly, I agree with the majority’s rejection of the fourth condition; the imposition of which was a vast departure from the narrowly tailored authority of the zoning board when hearing an appeal from a decision of the zoning officer.', 'However, I part company with the majority based on its failure to address what I consider to be the central errors in the Superior Court decision—the Superior Court justice’s conclusion that the keeping of alpacas is a permitted accessory use in an R-1 District, and the Superior Court justice’s failure to address the board’s finding that its decision applies only to the Sposato’s alpacas and “does not consider all alpacas as domestic animal[s,] but only the ones in this particular case based on the evidence presented.” By limiting its holding to condition number four, as set forth in the zoning board’s approval, the majority leaves open the real possibility that the zoning board may, in the future, reissue its decision without the offending condition. Thus, this issue is not settled, and the Court’s holding does not serve the parties, who may again be 8', 'To be sure, this principle is often times stated in the context of variances or special-use permits. Such is the case because those forms of zoning relief are the primary platform by which a zoning board imposes conditions—considering that the applicant is requesting a deviation from the applicable zoning ordinance. A permitted use, on the other hand, concerns the literal interpretation of the zoning ordinance. Conditions are often ill-suited in the ambit of permitted uses as the particular use has already been deemed to be permitted, unfettered, and free from restrictions.', '-7- required, at great time and expense, to return to the zoning board and the Superior Court to relitigate the issues that were left unresolved in this case.', 'It is abundantly clear that the zoning board did not find that the keeping of four alpacas was a proper accessory use in an R-1 zone. Because the zoning board made no such finding, the decision of the Superior Court justice is clearly wrong. See Murphy v. Zoning Board of Review of South Kingstown, 959 A.2d 535, 540 (R.I. 2008) (stating that this Court will reverse a decision of the Superior Court when “it can be shown that the justice misapplied the law, misconceived or overlooked material evidence, or made findings that were clearly wrong” (quoting OK Properties v. Zoning Board of Review of Warwick, 601 A.2d 953, 955 (R.I. 1992))). Although the zoning board “did not specifically find that owning a pet is an accessory use,” the Superior Court justice nonetheless concluded that the board’s decision stemmed from the accessory-use clause. This error was further complicated by the Superior Court justice’s conclusion that these particular alpacas, and not the universe of alpacas, fell within the accessory-use definition of the zoning ordinance. It is my opinion that the Superior Court justice compounded the egregious and indeed fatal error committed by the zoning board in issuing an alpaca-specific decision when he declared, in essence, that these alpacas are pets based on the subjective belief of their owner and the manner with which the animals are cared for by this particular family.', 'Turning to the findings of the zoning board, in approving motion 13, a majority of the board voted as follows:', '“To overturn the [z]oning [o]fficial’s decision based on the', 'testimony that was put before us that demonstrates that in this', 'particular case that the Sposato’s alpaca[s] are being housed and', 'kept as domestic animals and treated as such. This [m]otion does', 'not consider all alpaca[s] as domestic animal[s,] but only the ones', '-8-', 'in this particular case based on the evidence presented.”', '(Emphasis added.)', 'This constitutes error as a matter of law. Any motion that rests on the particular animals that are the subject of the hearing—as opposed to the species of animal—cannot form the basis for a proper zoning decision. The decision failed to address whether all alpacas are permitted in an R-1 zone in the Town of Hopkinton (the Town), which was the core function of the board in approving or vacating the decision of the zoning official. Although one can shower an alpaca in love and affection, it is nonetheless an alpaca, a member of the South American camelid species. A permitted use, by its very nature, cannot vary based on particularized circumstances. By limiting its decision to the fourth condition set forth in the approval, the majority fails to address the more egregious error in this case and the glaring fact that the board failed to reach the seminal issue before it: Are alpacas domestic animals permitted in an R-1 zone?', 'I also note that the law is clear that not all flawed or illegal conditions imposed on a grant of approval by a zoning board necessarily mandate that the entire decision be vacated on remand. In the closely related context of variances and special-use exceptions, it is generally recognized that “illegal or unreasonable * * * conditions may be held void and set aside * * * where the condition held invalid is not deemed to be an essential or integral part of the zoning authority’s decision.” 3 Arden H. Rathkopf, The Law of Zoning and Planning, § 60.38 (2005) (emphasis added); see also Matter of Martin v. Brookhaven Zoning Board of Appeals, 825 N.Y.S.2d 244, 246 (N.Y. App. Div. 2006) (mem.) (“[I]f a zoning board imposes unreasonable or improper conditions, those conditions may be annulled although the variance is upheld.” (quoting Matter of Baker v. Brownlie, 705 N.Y.S.2d 611, 614 (N.Y. App. Div. 2000) (mem.))); 8 Patrick J. Rohan, Zoning and Land Use Controls, § 40.03[3] (2015) (“Illegal conditions * * * are sometimes viewed as standing apart from the variance itself so that the variance may stand free', '-9- from the attempted condition. Such a result is correct if the variance would have been granted despite the condition.”). This is problematic in the case at bar. The majority’s decision mandates that the Superior Court remand this case to the board. What happens next?', 'Furthermore, in its findings, the board focused on the present use of the land—the keeping of these particular alpacas by this landowner, that is, the alpacas “in this particular case” are permitted, but no other alpacas. Condition four in the approval vote, on the other hand, relates to future uses of the property and declares that “[t]he right to keep alpaca does not run with the land.” The board, in my opinion, inappropriately addressed future circumstances that may or may not come to pass and failed to decide the central question: Is the keeping of alpacas in an R-1 zone a violation of the Town’s ordinances? I therefore am satisfied that condition four of the board’s decision is neither essential nor integral to the overarching question of whether or not alpaca are domestic animals and, thus, a permitted use.', 'Finally, it should be noted that, because of the procedural posture of this case, the majority’s reliance on Olevson is misplaced. See Olevson, 71 R.I. at 308, 44 A.2d at 722 (vacating a special exception granted by the zoning board because the offending condition placed on the grant was the “chief element and substantial basis” of the decision).', 'This case is before the Court on appeal from a determination of the Hopkinton Zoning Official, declaring that the housing of alpacas is not a lawful use of property in an R-1 zone. The majority’s decision, therefore, serves to reinstate the zoning official’s conclusion that alpacas are not permitted on the Sposato’s property. Because the animals must now be relocated and the respondent landowner may seek another determination by the zoning board, I respectfully dissent.', '- 10 - STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND', 'PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS', 'SUPREME COURT – CLERK’S OFFICE', 'OPINION COVER SHEET', 'Amber Preston v.

64,State : v. : Anthony Moore. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. The defendant, Anthony Moore (Moore or defendant), appeals from a judgment of conviction on three counts: first-degree murder; conspiracy to commit murder; and using a firearm when committing a crime of violence. On appeal, Moore argues that the trial justice erred in: (1) denying his motion for a new trial; (2) refusing to give an “empty chair” jury instruction; and (3) making certain evidentiary rulings. For the reasons outlined below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Before we summarize the relevant testimony adduced at trial, we briefly outline the events that led to the abovementioned charges.', 'This story started and ended because of a gun. On or about January 31, 2014, 1 Seydina Limamou Ndoye wanted a gun for self-protection, so he sought the help of his friend, Alain Bedame. Bedame suggested contacting Johnathan and James Gomez. Ultimately, Bedame and 1', 'Unless otherwise noted, all dates referenced in this opinion occurred in 2014.', '-1- Ndoye were swindled by the Gomez brothers, who stole Bedame’s cell phone and $240. On February 4 Ashner Alexis (nicknamed “Pookie”), 2 a friend of Ndoye, stepped in to help get a gun—although now for the purpose of avenging the Gomez brothers’ scam. Pookie took Ndoye and Bedame to defendant’s home in Woonsocket. Also there was seventeen-year-old Robert Winston. After consulting with Moore, and at his direction, Bedame and Winston set out to pick up a shotgun. With a gun in tow, Bedame, Ndoye, Winston, and Pookie then left to inflict vengeance on the Gomez brothers. They headed to the Gomez household, where Winston knocked on the kitchen window. When someone approached, Pookie fired a shot through the same window. Someone was hit, but it was not their intended targets. Instead, a fatal shot struck an innocent nonparticipant, George Holland, who was visiting his girlfriend, Ebony Gomez, the sister of Johnathan and James.', 'As a result of these events, defendant was charged with first-degree murder (G.L. 1956 § 11-23-1), conspiracy to commit murder (G.L. 1956 § 11-1-6), and using a firearm when committing a crime of violence (G.L. 1956 § 11-47-3.2). A jury trial was held on these counts from October 6 to October 16. At the close of trial, on October 16, the jury returned a verdict finding defendant guilty on each count. On November 19, defendant moved for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. The trial justice denied the motion on December 4. On February 12, 2015, defendant received two consecutive life sentences (for murder and discharging a firearm) and ten years for conspiracy, also to be served consecutively. The defendant timely appealed. 2', 'Because Ashner Alexis was generally referenced by his nickname during trial, we refer to him as Pookie to avoid confusion.', '-2-', 'Miguel Gomez, father of Johnathan, James, and Ebony, testified first. 3 He stated that on February 4, he lived at 145 Colfax Street in Providence with his girlfriend and his three children. On the evening of February 4, Miguel saw “a real bright flash and [heard] a bang.” He found Holland lying on “the ground” between the dining room and the living room.', 'Johnathan Gomez testified next. At the time of trial, Johnathan was nineteen years old. Johnathan indicated that he was familiar with Bedame, whom he knew by his nickname, “West Alan.” He noted that Bedame messaged him on Facebook looking for James because, a few days prior to February 4, he stole “some money and a phone” from Bedame. Johnathan stated that the phone and money were stolen during a meeting between Johnathan, James, Bedame, and Ndoye. Johnathan stated that James never intended to provide a gun; rather, he sought to merely steal the phone and cash.', 'After the fatal event on February 4, Johnathan indicated that he spoke with the police later in the evening and conveyed his belief that Bedame was involved in Holland’s shooting. When asked how he knew Bedame was responsible, he replied, “Some kid hit me up [on Facebook], said this n***a is looking for your brother. * * * When we catch you, I guess, kill him.” He explained that “they” planned to shoot his brother, James.', 'Ebony Gomez testified next. She indicated that she knew Bedame from when he visited her home a few days before February 4 looking for James and Johnathan. She also indicated that others joined Bedame; however, she could see only one of these people, whom she described as “kind of skinnier and he had glasses.” She described Bedame and the skinny kid’s demeanor as “[k]ind of angry, aggressive.” 3', 'To avoid confusion between Miguel, Johnathan, James, and Ebony, we will refer to each by their respective first names. No disrespect is intended.', '-3-', 'Ndoye testified next. He stated that near the end of January, he became interested in buying a gun. He shared this interest with Bedame, his “associate” and former high-school classmate, who, in turn, contacted the Gomez brothers. He recalled that, around January 27 or 28, he and Bedame met up with the Gomez brothers to purchase a gun. 4 During the meeting, he gave James $240 and Bedame’s cell phone, but “[James] exited the vehicle with Johnathan and they never came back.”', 'Ndoye noted that on the day that James and Johnathan stole their possessions, he, Bedame, and two of Bedame’s friends visited the Gomez household, but Johnathan and James were not home. Ndoye recalled that, when he and Bedame located Johnathan at some later point, Johnathan claimed that the money had been stolen. He indicated that “hostility and tension” permeated their conversation. He also explained that, notwithstanding Johnathan’s refusal to turn over the money or phone, they gave him a ride a couple of blocks down the road.', 'Ndoye then detailed the events of February 4. He explained that he and Bedame wanted to visit the Gomez home that night to “have an altercation with them, a fight, or a shoot-out.” Ndoye testified that he and Bedame sought to obtain a gun from Pookie, an associate of Ndoye’s through school, who likewise resented Johnathan and James because they had allegedly stolen scrap metal from him a few months earlier.', 'Bedame and Ndoye then met up with Pookie, who directed them to go to Woonsocket to get a shotgun from one of Pookie’s “boys,” so all three traveled to a house on Rathbun Street in Woonsocket. Upon their arrival, a young man, whom Ndoye later identified as Winston, brought them upstairs. At the time, there was a party in progress at the house with twenty to twenty-five guests. 4', 'The attorneys for both sides stipulated that the day of the meeting with the Gomez brothers for the supposed gun purchase was Friday, January 31.', '-4-', 'Shortly after arriving, Ndoye spoke with defendant for about five to ten minutes. He recalled that Pookie told Moore that they wanted a gun. Ndoye recounted that in response to Pookie’s request, Moore replied, “You come to the right place.” Winston and Bedame then set out to get the gun and returned about five to ten minutes later with a shotgun wrapped in a Cape Verdean flag. He believed that it was a shotgun “[b]ecause they were hoisting it in a cautious manner and it was really long,” and he could see the shotgun’s brown “wooden butt.” Ndoye stated that “[a]fter the gun was put on the table [he] did see red bullets, and it had a clear tip with [approximately eight small] pellets inside of it.” He stated that Moore handed the shotgun and shells to Pookie, who placed it “inside his waistband, where his hip was.”', 'Ndoye recounted that he, Pookie, Winston, and Bedame then left defendant’s house. Moore, however, stayed back. The group traveled to Pookie’s girlfriend’s house, where Pookie and Winston changed clothes. From there, they drove to the Gomez home, where they planned “[t]o commit a shooting.” They parked, and Pookie and Winston left the car while Ndoye and Bedame stayed back and waited. Ndoye saw Pookie “retrieve a long * * * object from the vehicle.” He stated that Pookie and Winston “disappeared into the darkness” for about ten minutes. Ndoye recalled hearing a loud blast; and, shortly after, Pookie and Winston ran down the street and jumped into the car. Ndoye noted that Pookie was “ecstatic,” exclaiming, “I got someone.” Pookie told Ndoye that Winston knocked on the window and Pookie fired a shot when someone approached. After the shooting, all four then returned to Moore’s party where, upon updating guests on what had transpired, Pookie received praise and congratulations. Ndoye also recalled that Moore shook hands with Pookie and Winston.', 'Ndoye confirmed that he pleaded guilty on July 10 to second-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder, and discharge of a firearm. He stated that he received a ten-year sentence to', '-5- be served at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI) for conspiracy to commit murder; however, he had not yet been sentenced for second-degree murder. On the count of discharge of a firearm, Ndoye received a twenty-year suspended sentence, with probation, consecutive to his sentences on the other counts. Ndoye also indicated that he signed a cooperation agreement with the Rhode Island Office of the Attorney General, in which he agreed to testify honestly and exhaustively with respect to the events of February 4. 5', 'On cross-examination, Ndoye described Moore as the leader of “SMG,” 6 which he described as “a group of young men that get together and commit legal acts.” He justified his conclusion, stating, “[the younger males] would salute [Moore] and they followed his instructions. And the aura that certain individuals give off can lead you to suspect certain things.” He recalled that about four people saluted Moore on the evening of February 4.', 'Bedame testified next. He stated that he knew Ndoye from parties and that the two primarily chatted on Facebook. He recalled that on January 31, he and Ndoye met James and Johnathan “[b]ecause they wanted to show [Ndoye] a gun.” When they met, Bedame understood that they needed to drive somewhere to pick up the gun, because James and Johnathan did not bring it to their meeting. When they arrived at the new location, Johnathan asked to use Bedame’s phone because he purportedly needed to call “his uncle” to get the gun. He recalled that he gave Johnathan his phone and its passcode, and Ndoye gave James $240. Although Bedame believed that Johnathan and James were to get the gun from their “uncle” and return to the car, they never returned. In the days following January 31, Bedame informed Johnathan 5', 'In his agreement with the Attorney General, Ndoye agreed to plead guilty to an amended count of second-degree murder (count 1), conspiracy to commit murder (count 2), and an amended count of using a firearm resulting in injury, rather than death (count 3). 6', 'SMG signifies Savage Mob Gangsters.', '-6- through Facebook that he knew that they had the money and phone, which he verified with a Facebook picture of James holding the phone.', 'Bedame testified that a meeting with Pookie occurred on February 4 to obtain a gun. Bedame and Ndoye met Pookie, and the group traveled to Woonsocket to get a shotgun. They arrived at Moore’s apartment in Woonsocket, where he was hosting a party, at which Bedame suggested that more than ten people were present.', 'In Woonsocket, Moore asked Bedame if he could give “his brother” a ride and Bedame then drove the “young kid” (later identified as Winston) to a “house complex to the alleyway.” 7 Winston entered one of the apartments in the complex and returned to the car with a black bag, which he put in the trunk. Bedame stated that, when he returned to Moore’s apartment, Winston removed the item from the trunk. Bedame saw two shotguns and recalled that Ndoye played with one while Winston handled the other. He also observed “one [red] shotgun bullet” on the kitchen table.', 'Bedame testified that Winston addressed Moore “as a leader of his group.” He stated that Winston was standing “like a general talking to a soldier.” He also confirmed that Winston had his hands in front of him, with his back straight, and while in that position, Moore directed, “This is what I prepared you for.” Bedame recalled that Winston replied, “Yes” or “Yes sir.” He recalled Moore telling Pookie, “If [Winston] didn’t do what I told him to do, to blow his f’ing head off.”', 'Pookie told Bedame and Ndoye to get in the car. Joined by Pookie and Winston, they drove to Providence. Bedame confirmed that he observed a gun in Pookie’s pants that resembled 7', 'Bedame indicated during cross-examination that the “younger kid” whom he referenced throughout his testimony matched a photo shown of Winston.', '-7- the short shotgun he saw in Moore’s house. From Woonsocket, they stopped for Pookie and Winston to change clothes. Everyone in the car then agreed to drive to the Gomez household, although Bedame was hesitant in carrying out their plans. When they arrived, Pookie and Winston exited the car and proceeded down the street while Bedame and Ndoye stayed back. Bedame heard a very loud bang, which prompted him to try to leave. While the car moved slowly down the street, Pookie and Winston ran to it and hopped in.', 'Bedame described the situation in the car: “Pookie * * * was talking about it like he was happy. He was talking about how the young kid knocked on the door. He came around, he seen somebody peeking, and he shot him. And he was laughing like it was the funniest thing * * * he ever seen in his life.” He also indicated that after that, Pookie “said he feels like shooting somebody else.” The group headed back to Woonsocket. Bedame indicated that, while he was in the car, James sent him a Facebook message, which read, “They’re coming for you, Bro.” After returning to Moore’s house, Winston was “cheering like they won a football game,” and Pookie was “laughing and stuff.” Bedame didn’t see Moore outside, noting that the last time he saw him was inside when he first visited the apartment.', 'Bedame testified that on February 7, the police visited him at home and took him to the Providence Police Department, where he remained in police custody for three days and gave multiple recorded statements. On June 11, Bedame entered into a cooperation agreement with the Attorney General, which was identical to Ndoye’s. 8', 'Bedame confirmed that he subsequently had seen Moore at the ACI. He recalled a conversation with Moore while in the same prison cell: “[Moore] told me not to testify against him. * * * He will make sure that our family will be safe.” He clarified, “[I]f we [did] testify 8', 'See footnote 5, supra.', '-8- against him, he will make sure his little people will go to my house and shoot my people, meaning my pops.”', 'Detective Kenneth Court of the Providence Police Department was the state’s next witness. He stated that he reported for duty on February 4 in response to a homicide. Detective Court testified that he visited the Gomez home “much later in the evening * * * to get an overview of what [he] was dealing with.” At the Gomez home, Det. Court recalled seeing “[t]racks in the snow and the gunshot hole that was in the window in the closed blind.” Detective Court also testified that on February 5, he, Sgt. William Dwyer, and Det. Daniel O’Connell visited Bedame’s house. Bedame joined them at the police station, and upon arrival, gave a statement. From Bedame’s statement, Det. Court became aware of Ndoye, Pookie, Moore, and Winston. Further, he indicated that the officers allowed Bedame to access Facebook to identify whom he claimed played a part in the homicide. Detective Court stated that he contacted Ndoye, who, accompanied by his father, came to the police station. He noted that Ndoye also gave a statement, which helped shift the officers’ focus to identifying and bringing in Pookie, Winston, and Moore.', 'Detective Court stated that Pookie was eventually apprehended at his girlfriend’s home in South Providence. After both Bedame and Ndoye identified Moore, Moore was apprehended at his home at 107 Rathbun Street in Woonsocket. Officers searched his home but did not uncover a firearm.', 'Detective Court also indicated that on February 9, Winston provided a statement. Winston spoke with police again on March 14, and he testified before the Grand Jury between March 24 and 26. During Winston’s interview, Det. Court learned the name of Winston’s then-', '-9- girlfriend, Brandi Lachance. Detective Court spoke with her on a few occasions and visited Lachance’s home to retrieve a letter she had.', 'Detective James Clift of the Providence Police Department’s Bureau of Criminal Identification testified next. He confirmed that on February 4 at around 9 p.m., he responded to a shooting at 145 Colfax Street with his partner, Det. Paul Renzi. He recalled that, as he entered the kitchen of the home, he immediately observed a shotgun wadding. 9 Detective Clift stated that the wadding appeared to have traveled through the window, and “it was just over six feet away from where the window was.” He recalled that the window was broken into multiple pieces, and he counted nine holes in its exterior screen. He described the holes as significant because “a normal load of a shotgun shell when it’s buckshot is nine.”', 'Detective Clift stated that he attended Holland’s autopsy the next morning, which Dr. Patricia Ogera performed. He identified a photograph of Holland at the medical examiner’s office, which he indicated conformed to Holland’s appearance during the autopsy. He also identified a close-up photograph of Holland’s stomach that showed “the pattern of where the projectiles went into his body.” From this photograph, Det. Clift counted nine wounds, which he confirmed matched “the normal count of projectiles that are usually loaded within a double odd [sic] buck shotgun shell.” He also indicated that Holland’s shirt, which he seized among other items of clothing, had nine holes in it consistent with the victim’s wounds. Detective Clift also seized evidence including “the screen that was on the outside of the house,” footprint impressions from the backyard, and later, two oral DNA swabs taken from defendant. On cross- 9', 'Detective Clift explained that a shotgun wadding has several parts, including the outer casing, “a primer at the base, which causes an explosion from the inside,” gunpowder inside, and projectiles. He explained that projectiles could either be solid (a large-caliber bullet or a slug), or a buckshot, which includes multiple small lead balls.', '- 10 - examination, Det. Clift noted that he did not find a match from the footprint impressions he took at the scene and detectives were unable to locate any shotgun shells at the Gomez home.', 'Next, Lachance, Winston’s ex-girlfriend, testified. She stated that she had known Moore for a couple of years and had seen him often. Lachance indicated that on the evening of February 4, she was at Moore’s girlfriend’s birthday party on Rathbun Street in Woonsocket with Winston. She stated that she saw Pookie, whom she had previously met at another party, arrive at the party with two others whom she described: “One was chubby and one was skinny, with glasses.” She recalled, “I heard Pookie come in and ask [Moore] for a gun, and the chunky kid had got robbed where he was from, I think South Providence.” She noted that Moore said he would help them.', 'Lachance described Winston and Moore’s relationship, stating, “[t]hey knew each other from a while ago.” She testified, “I remember seeing [Moore] telling [Winston] that he had to go on a mission for him. He had to go do something, and that [Moore] wasn’t leaving because it was his girlfriend’s birthday.” She further recalled that “[Moore] had told [Winston] that if he didn’t go do what [Moore] told him to do that [Winston’s] life would be taken.” Lachance also indicated that she had seen people, including Winston and Pookie, salute defendant on the night of February 4.', 'Lachance stated that Pookie, Winston, and the two others left the party for one to two hours. She noted, however, that only Winston and Pookie returned to the house. She also stated, “Pookie, [Winston], and the two other kids” “left again before that,” but she could not recall for how long. She stated, “I just seen [Winston’s] facial expression, and I seen Pookie go up to [Moore] and they gave each other a handshake and hug, and celebrated.” Lachance then recalled that after she left the party, Moore called her phone and asked to speak with Winston. While on', '- 11 - speaker phone, Moore told Winston “that they had shot the wrong kid,” specifically someone named George.', 'Lachance then discussed a letter that Moore wrote, dated May 8, and she identified his handwriting in the letter. 10 She noted that the letter was addressed and sent to her cousin, who brought the letter to her. She noted that Moore signed the letter using his nickname, Bing. Lachance then read the letter into the record.', 'In the letter, Moore stated that Lachance, Winston, Pookie, and others “snitched” on him. He said that Winston told the police that Moore “MADE him go.” Moore wrote, “I’m the only one who didn’t give statements to the police but while everyone is telling on me they all forget I know everything so I’m finna get a deal to testify[.] * * * I was ready to go to trial till I found out EVERYONE was telling on ME.” 11 Moore added, “Don’t say [too] much through the letters the police read these. But I may call you as a witness for trial to flip it on [Winston] with me. * * * Just tell the truth IF I have to call on you but say I was [too] drunk to understand s**t & I didn’t have a clue of what they [were] about to do * * * .” He added, “Go on facebook and put EveryONE of those RATS ON BLAST * * * .” 12', 'Doctor Ogera, an Assistant Medical Examiner at the Rhode Island Office of State Medical Examiners, testified next. Doctor Ogera testified that she performed Holland’s autopsy on February 5. She testified that x-rays taken displayed “nine projectiles in the lower torso,” and she observed nine entrance wounds on Holland’s body but zero exit wounds. She also observed 10', 'Alexandra Brodeur, a forensic scientist for the Rhode Island Department of Health, testified that she tested the letter’s envelope for DNA, which revealed the predominant presence of Moore’s DNA. 11', 'Lachance clarified that “finna” as used in the letter was synonymous with “I’m going.” 12', 'When the state’s attorney asked what “go on Facebook and put every one of those rats on blast” meant, Lachance indicated that it meant, “To put them on the spot. * * * [L]et people know that we’re snitching.”', '- 12 - “nine defects” (or holes) in the victim’s shirt, corresponding to the defects in Holland’s abdomen. She opined that Holland’s death was caused by shot wounds to the torso and the manner of death was a homicide.', 'II', 'Standards of Review', 'A party may base a motion for a new trial “on the grounds that the ‘weight of the evidence was not adequate to convict’ a defendant.” State v.

Fleck, 81 A.3d 1129, 1133 (R.I. 2014)). “When addressing a motion for new trial which posits that the weight of the evidence was inadequate to support a conviction, the trial justice ‘act[s] as a thirteenth juror, exercising independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.’” Id. (quoting Fleck, 81 A.3d at 1133). To this end, a three-step analytical process is required whereby the trial justice must “(1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” Fleck, 81 A.3d at 1134 (quoting State v. Heredia, 10 A.3d 443, 446 (R.I. 2010)). “If, after conducting such a review, the trial justice reaches the same conclusion as the jury, the verdict should be affirmed and the motion for a new trial denied.” Heredia, 10 A.3d at 446.

Lopez, 149 A.3d 459, 463 (R.I. 2016) (quoting State v. Banach, 648 A.2d 1363, 1367 (R.I. 1994)). “This Court employs a deferential standard of review because a trial justice, being present during all phases of the trial, is in an especially good position to evaluate the facts and to judge the credibility of the witnesses.” Id.

The defendant suggests that the depth of inconsistencies in the witnesses’ testimonies cut against the witnesses’ credibility to such an extent that a new trial is warranted. For instance, defendant references discrepancies with respect to the number in attendance at the party, where people were located during the party, and descriptions of the shotguns at the party. Additionally, defendant submits further error in the trial justice’s denial because he failed to discuss: Ndoye’s and Bedame’s plea agreements, which he asserts “created a powerful incentive for them to shape their testimony”; “the documented penchant for lying exhibited in [Ndoye’s and Bedame’s] behavior”; and any impact that alcohol or marijuana may have had on the witnesses’ memories. Further, defendant posits that the trial justice erred in failing to discuss “the critical meeting between Bedame and Ndoye after the murder but before they were in police custody when they discussed what to say to the police.”', 'In deciding the motion for a new trial, the trial justice reasoned, “This case, like so many cases of this nature, typically rises or falls upon the credibility of witnesses.', 'Here[,] the credibility of * * * Ndoye and * * * Bedame was critical to the State’s case. If believed, * * * defendant’s conviction was preordained.” Although the trial justice recognized that the recounts of certain witnesses diverged, he deemed “those * * * of little import when juxtaposed to the', '- 15 - essence of their testimony in this case.” The trial justice noted that the witnesses offered consistent testimony in the following respects: (1) the excursion to Woonsocket to get a firearm from defendant; (2) defendant sending off Pookie to commit a shooting at the Gomez household; (3) defendant enlisting Winston to join Pookie in their endeavor; and (4) defendant instructing Pookie to blow Winston’s head off if he defied instructions. He acknowledged that both Bedame and Ndoye were “reasonably consistent” with respect to their trip back to Providence and their return to Woonsocket following the shooting. While he noted inconsistencies, the trial justice found, “they were not at all sufficient * * * as a front-row observer, to diminish their credibility as far as Moore’s clear criminal involvement in a scheme to murder Gomez.”', 'Finally, the trial justice recalled Lachance’s testimony, which he deemed “instrumental” and “highly incriminating.” He emphasized that Lachance’s testimony also relayed that Moore enlisted Pookie and Winston “on a mission with a firearm” and detailed “Moore as fancying himself as some sort of a leader or general of his group of followers, even to the point of seeing others saluting him.” The trial justice noted that Lachance conveyed that Moore at a later time declared that the wrong person had been killed, noting, “He apparently was simply expressing his disappointment that the wrong person was murdered.” The trial justice highlighted the importance of Lachance’s testimony in pinpointing what he described as “the death knell to * * * defendant’s case: [The] Letter he wrote on May 8th, 2014 * * * while Moore was at the ACI.” Thus, based on his credibility findings in regard to defendant’s letter and the testimony of Bedame, Ndoye, and Lachance, the trial justice found the jury “well justified” in convicting defendant on all counts.', 'Although we, like the state and the trial justice, acknowledge that the testimonies of various witnesses diverged at points during trial, we nonetheless affirm the denial of the motion', '- 16 - for a new trial. In reviewing a trial justice’s decision on a motion for a new trial, this Court has consistently distinguished between “inconsistencies on ‘minor details’” and inconsistencies “on the crucial issues.” See State v.

Whitaker, 79 A.3d 795, 803-05 (R.I. 2013) (affirming trial justice’s denial of motion for a new trial even though “witnesses’ testimony was rife with so many inconsistencies” because inconsistencies concerned subsidiary issues such as size and caliber of defendant’s gun); State v. Jensen, 40 A.3d 771, 781 (R.I. 2012) (acknowledging “that the presence of some inconsistencies between or among utterances of a witness or witnesses at different points in time does not ipso facto render the testimony unworthy of belief”).', 'Here, although the disparities between the various witnesses’ recounts were numerous, they reflect no more than minor details. As the trial justice aptly described, the witnesses’ testimony aligned when discussing crucial issues.', 'At bottom, defendant’s arguments alleging omissions by the trial justice in his evidentiary discussion attack the trial justice’s credibility determinations. In this regard, we view the trial justice’s “credibility determinations ‘through a prism of deference * * * .’” State v. Paola, 59 A.3d 99, 106 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Ferreira, 21 A.3d 355, 367 (R.I. 2011)). Further, “the trial justice was under no obligation to exhaustively analyze the evidence or to explicitly articulate [his] rejection of the testimony of witnesses whom [he] did not find to be credible.” Ferreira, 21 A.3d at 367. The trial justice explicitly recognized, “This case, like so many cases of this nature, typically rises or falls upon the credibility of witnesses.” The trial justice recognized the diverging testimonies yet deemed them insufficient to lessen the witnesses’ believability connected with “Moore’s clear criminal involvement in a scheme to', '- 17 - murder Gomez.”', 'We see no reason to depart from our deference “to trial justices who experience firsthand the delivery and demeanor of a witness’s testimony” and, as such, the denial of the motion for a new trial is affirmed.

Under current Rhode Island law, “an empty-chair instruction is only appropriate in the event that the requesting party first lays a foundation that the witness was available to the party who would be expected to produce that witness.” State v. Rogers, 687 A.2d 1242, 1243 (R.I. 1996); see also State v. Ayotte, 693 A.2d 1032, 1033 (R.I. 1997) (mem.). “We have further stated that ‘if the witness is equally accessible to both parties, no inference can spring from the failure of either party to call [the witness].’” Rogers, 687 A.2d at 1243 (quoting Avarista v. Aloisio, 672 A.2d 887, 892 (R.I. 1996)).', 'The defendant asserted below that, although Winston was available to both parties, the trial justice should have instructed the jury that they “may take an adverse inference with respect to the State’s failure to call Mr. Winston.” In essence, defendant asks this Court to alter our current jurisprudence regarding the appropriateness of such an instruction.', 'Specifically, defendant suggests that an empty-chair instruction is proper even when the pertinent witness is available to both parties. 13', 'We note that other jurisdictions label this instruction a “missing-witness” instruction.', '- 18 -', 'The trial justice declined to give this particular instruction, citing its nonconformity with our current rule.', 'Additionally, the trial justice found, “frankly, the so-called empty chair instruction or missing witness instruction is one that is actually disfavored in other jurisdictions * * * .” Although the trial justice allowed defendant’s attorney to argue to the jury vis-à-vis Winston’s absence at trial, he declined to give an instruction, which he labeled as akin to commenting on evidence or the lack thereof.', 'On appeal, defendant posits “that the fact that * * * defendant has no obligation to call witnesses or produce evidence” supports a rule that authorizes an empty-chair instruction regardless of a witness’s availability to both parties. The defendant avers that current law in this context shifts the burdens of production and proof upon defendants in contravention of his due- process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Further, defendant argues that “[t]he damage from not having the benefit of such an instruction was exacerbated by the state’s response to the Winston issue in its closing argument” because defendant suggests that the state erroneously suggested a lack of evidence with respect to whether Winston had a cooperation agreement.', 'We glean no reversible error in the trial justice’s refusal to provide an empty-chair instruction. 14 First, we subscribe to the view of other jurisdictions that the decision as to whether 14', 'While we acknowledge the creativity in defendant’s argument, we are unaware of any case that deems a trial justice’s discretionary declination to provide an empty-chair (or missing- witness) instruction incompatible with the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. A survey of other jurisdictions is instructive. See, e.g., Miller v. Walker, 413 F. Supp. 2d 251, 260 (W.D.N.Y. 2006) (“Like the failure to give any other jury instruction, the failure to issue a missing witness instruction does not raise a constitutional issue * * * .”); Solis v.

Moreover, the trial justice “permitted defense counsel to argue the inference themselves in summation.” Torres, 845 F.2d at 1170. It remains notable that “[e]minent authority suggests caution in developing ‘elaborate rules of law defining the circumstances when the right [to an empty-chair instruction] exists.’” United States v. Myerson, 18 F.3d 153, 160 (2d Cir. 1994) (quoting Torres, 845 F.2d at 1171). “This is particularly true in light of ‘the usual aura of gamesmanship’ that frequently accompanies requests for [an empty-chair] charge.” Id.; see also Torres, 845 F.2d at 1170 (“[C]ourts have been reluctant to find a witness practically unavailable when it appears that the defense has no real interest in calling the witness to the stand, but merely is engaged in a form of gamesmanship in an effort to obtain [an empty-chair] charge.”).', 'Here, the trial justice’s refusal to give an empty-chair instruction was justified and wholly conformed to our established jurisprudence, which we decline to alter. Because Winston was available to both parties, the trial justice rightfully declined to provide an empty-chair instruction.', 'C', 'Evidentiary Rulings', 'Next, defendant submits that it was error for the trial justice to sustain the state’s objection on cross-examination during Det.

While acknowledging that our present authority cuts against defendant’s argument, Moore nonetheless avers that the circumstances of this particular question justify our review of the issue.', '“When we review a contention that a defendant’s right to cross-examination erroneously was limited by the trial justice, we look to whether the trial justice clearly abused his or her discretion when limiting the scope of the cross-examination.” State v. Alston, 47 A.3d 234, 249 (R.I. 2012). Here, the trial justice was well within his discretion when he sustained the objection because inspection of the record demonstrates that “when the state objected to defendant’s question, defendant did not make any offer of proof that the examination he intended to embark upon could lead to relevant evidence.” Id.', 'Additionally, defendant submits that the trial justice erred in not striking some of Lachance’s answers during her direct examination. Specifically, defendant takes issue with the trial justice allowing Lachance’s answer to stand when she stated that “[Winston] had told [her] that he had the gun in his pants.” Although defendant concedes that defense counsel “did not move to strike the answer nor did he explain the basis of his objection,” defendant suggests that an explanation was unnecessary as “[t]his was clear hearsay.

About a month later, the parties entered into a stipulated judgment. The terms of the stipulation provided that judgment would enter against Bayal in the amount of $16,907.81. The stipulation further specified that “[a]ll other terms and conditions of the lease between the parties [would] remain in full force and effect.”', 'On January 27, 2014, after Bayal failed to make any payments pursuant to the stipulated judgment, plaintiff filed a complaint against defendant for default on the guaranty.

Significantly, the parties entered into a stipulated judgment, under the terms of which Bayal was responsible for $16,907.81.

Furthermore, it has not been argued that there is any ambiguity in either document.

The expiration of the guaranty is a term of the agreement that is unrelated to the statute of limitations for a breach of guaranty claim. 7 Here, the guaranty was to “expire on the last day of the twelfth (12th) full month following the Rent Commencement Date (as defined in the Lease).” Therefore, the expiration date was September 30, 2013.

This does not mean that plaintiff had only until September 30, 2013 to bring an action against defendant; this date signified when the guaranty would “cease[] to exist.” Black’s Law Dictionary 700 (10th ed. 2014) (defining “expiration date”). Therefore, it is our opinion that defendant’s argument is without merit and plaintiff’s claim was not time-barred.', 'The defendant’s next contention is that summary judgment was inappropriate because genuine issues of material fact still remained. Specifically, defendant argues that the hearing justice erred when he refused to allow defendant to argue that plaintiff breached the lease first. 8 As we have explained earlier, Bayal’s liability to plaintiff was decided in the eviction action in the District Court, and defendant has guaranteed that liability. He cannot now raise defenses to that action.

Despite being confronted with a red light, Alston continued into the intersection, striking Ford’s pickup truck, which had entered the intersection under a green light as it was traveling eastbound on Park Avenue. At the time of the collision, it was estimated that Alston was driving thirty-five miles per hour. The force of the impact caused Ford’s vehicle to spin 180 degrees and to careen into plaintiff. The plaintiff was violently knocked against the exterior wall of a building and suffered serious injuries.', 'In November 2013, plaintiff filed suit against Alston 1 and Ford, alleging that each was negligent and that, as a result of their negligence, plaintiff was severely injured. After two years elapsed and discovery had been initiated, Ford moved for summary judgment with respect to the claim against him. In that motion, Ford argued that there was “not one shred of evidence that he was negligent in the operation of his motor vehicle at the time of the accident. As such, there [was] no genuine issue of material fact.” The gravamen of Ford’s argument was that it was undisputed that he entered the intersection with a green light and that Alston proceeded through the intersection against a red light; thus, Alston was the sole tortfeasor. The plaintiff contended that Ford proceeded through the intersection when it was unsafe to do so. She argued that there 1', 'We pause to note that Alston was uninsured at the time of the collision.', '-2- was conflicting testimony as to whether traffic had been backed up from Elmwood Avenue to Wellington Avenue, thereby creating a question as to whether Ford’s automobile could safely enter the intersection.', 'In March 2016, the hearing justice granted Ford’s motion for summary judgment, saying that plaintiff’s argument was “unsupported by anything in the record.” After the hearing justice granted Ford’s motion from the bench, plaintiff’s counsel continued to argue that summary judgment was inappropriate at that time, saying:', '“why wouldn’t a deposition testimony of a witness or a party, it', 'makes no difference who it is, who says that the individual', 'proceeded through the intersection when it wasn’t safe to do so,', 'why wouldn’t that be a question of fact.

67,Louis Paolino et al. : v. : Joseph Ferreira et al.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. This dispute has generated two separate appeals. The first is the appeal of the prevailing plaintiffs, Louis Paolino and Marie Issa (collectively plaintiffs), from adverse rulings made by the trial justice in favor of the defendants, Joseph I. Ferreira, LKQ Corporation, the Joseph I. Ferreira Trust, and J.F. Realty, LLC (collectively defendants). The second is the appeal of Attorney Brian Wagner, who appeals sanctions that were imposed against him by the trial justice.', 'In the first appeal, plaintiffs contend that the trial justice erred when she (1) failed to order injunctive relief sought by plaintiffs; (2) refused to allow plaintiffs to amend their pleadings to conform to the trial evidence regarding a punitive damages claim against defendant, J.F. Realty, LLC; (3) did not permit plaintiffs’ expert to testify that storm water runoff from defendants’ property caused the seepage of oil along a man-made ditch located on plaintiffs’ property; and (4) failed to grant a new trial based upon plaintiffs’ newly discovered evidence. After careful consideration of the record, and for the reasons set forth in this opinion, we', '-1- conclude that the trial justice impermissibly limited the testimony of plaintiffs’ expert. Consequently, we affirm in part, and vacate in part, the judgment of the Superior Court and remand for a new trial on all issues with the exception of the prayer for injunctive relief.', 'I', 'Background', 'This dispute arises from the use of a thirty-five acre parcel of land in Cumberland. Since the 1940s, the property has hosted, from time to time, a pig farm, a gravel pit, a dump, and a salvage yard for motor vehicles.', 'In October 1983, Joseph Ferreira purchased approximately thirty acres of the property for use as an auto salvage yard. 1 Advanced Auto Recycling (AAR), which was an auto salvage company that Ferreira owned, began to operate on the property about five to six months after Ferreira purchased it. The Ferreira property included a stream and two large ponds, one of them man-made, that bordered the land that Paolino would later purchase.', 'When Ferreira purchased the property, it was vacant with the exception of a small trailer, and the property was littered with considerable debris, tires, and scrap metal. Despite the condition of the land, Ferreira did not have any environmental firms inspect the property before he purchased it. He did, however, clean it up right after acquiring it by removing the metal and tires from the property; indeed, he claimed that he removed thousands of tires. Ferreira testified that it took him three to five years to finally get the property to look clean.', 'Soon after Ferreira took ownership, he began to fill in wetlands. He said that, as a result of those alterations, the larger pond was filling with water at a rapid rate; therefore, he needed to enlarge the stream. 1', 'Throughout this opinion, this property will be referred to as the Ferreira property.', '-2-', 'Those alterations did not escape notice.', 'In November 1983, the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) inspected Ferreira’s property in response to a complaint that he was filling a pond. DEM sent Ferreira a notice of violation, ordering him to stop filling in the pond. He did, however, continue to enlarge the stream. At a later date, a DEM employee spoke to Ferreira about alternative ways to alleviate the problems that he had observed on the property. Eventually, Ferreira entered into a consent agreement with DEM that required him to employ erosion controls and to address the ongoing environmental violations.', 'Soon after he purchased the property, Ferreira constructed a building that was used for dismantling cars and as an office. The building was approximately two hundred feet away from the stream. When construction of the building was complete, he began to bring vehicles onto the property. In 1991 he constructed a second building along the border of Paolino’s property. At trial, Ferreira testified that he did not conduct a survey before he built that structure, but that he was told it would be seven to ten feet away from the property line. An addition to the building was completed in 2001; again, no survey was performed. 2 By 2001, the Joseph I. Ferreira Trust (the trust) owned the property. Ferreira was the sole trustee of the trust.', 'By October 2005, Ferreira, as trustee of the trust, had sold his business to LKQ Corporation (LKQ), a national auto-recycling company. The trust then conveyed the land to J.F. Realty, LLC (J.F. Realty), of which Ferreira was the sole member. That entity then leased the property to LKQ. In response to another DEM inspection in 2005, requiring AAR to install temporary drainage controls, a plan was submitted and approved. Pursuant to that plan, Ferreira 2', 'Robert Yabroudy, Ferreira’s controller, later testified that a survey had been conducted in 2003 by Cournoyer Enterprises (the 2003 Cournoyer survey) but that the survey was not used in conjunction with the construction of the storm water pollution prevention system.', '-3- hired Commonwealth Engineers to design and install a storm water pollution prevention plan on his property, which was completed by 2008.', 'AAR Operations', 'During his testimony at trial, Ferreira described the activities conducted on the AAR site, testifying that automotive fluids would be drained and captured inside the building before a car was placed in the yard. The fluids would be deposited into barrels and recycled. Ferreira testified that oil was stored outside next to the addition to the first building, which was about 100 to 150 feet away from Paolino’s property. During his testimony, Ferreira further acknowledged that he had noticed turbid water running off the site even after the installation of the storm water pollution prevention plan, and that he had occasionally seen oil drip from engines on his property. He also testified that he never deposited any scraps of metal, auto parts, tires, or fluids onto Paolino’s property or in any of the ponds.', 'Paolino Purchases', 'In December 1985 LM Nursing Services Inc. (LM Nursing), Paolino’s company, purchased six acres on Curran Road that abutted Ferreira’s property. In 1987 Paolino received a letter from DEM about the potential release of contaminants in the area, notifying him that his land was on the CERCLIS 3 list. Paolino promptly hired Environmental Resource Associates, Inc. (ERA), a company specializing in investigations of environmental contamination, to conduct tests on his land. After ERA’s site assessment was complete, LM Nursing conveyed the property to Paolino and his wife, Marie Issa. Additionally, after all the testing was completed, Paolino’s attorney wrote to the EPA requesting that his property be removed from the CERCLIS list 3', 'CERCLIS (Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Information System) is a database maintained by the EPA as part of the Superfund program. See U.S. Dep’t Health & Human Servs., What is “CERCLIS”?, TOXMAP FAQ, https://toxmap.nlm.nih.gov/tox map/faq/2009/08/what-is-cerclis.html (updated Nov. 2016).', '-4- because no contamination had been revealed by ERA’s testing. As a result, the Paolino property was removed from the CERCLIS list. Paolino claimed that he did not have any further problems with contamination on his property throughout the 1990s. Indeed, he said that the Division of Air and Hazardous Materials of DEM sent a letter indicating that the stream was sampled two times, once in 1987 and once in 1990, and that neither sample found contamination.', 'Despite Paolino’s claims and the DEM letter, contaminants were found in the soil after a potential buyer retained a company called GZA GeoEnvironmental, Inc. (GZA) to evaluate the land.', 'Paolino received a letter of responsibility from DEM asking him to submit a site investigation report as well as naming him as the person “responsible for properly investigating and, if necessary, remediating hazardous materials at the site.” GZA did some remediation, but that process was never completed.', 'In December 2004 DEM sent Paolino a letter of noncompliance representing that he, as the owner of the property, was responsible for the investigation and remediation of hazardous material at the site.', 'On November 16, 2006, plaintiffs filed an action in the Superior Court, asserting that defendants had caused contaminants to flow onto their property. 4 Thereafter, plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint to add a claim for continuing trespass. Subsequently, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint that contained thirty-five counts, including the addition of claims for public and private nuisance and federal and state environmental violations. The second amended complaint added two new defendants: Joseph I. Ferreira Trust and J.F. Realty, LLC. Eventually, 4', 'The plaintiffs’ original complaint contained five counts brought against Mobil Oil Corporation, Mark Diamond, Philip Diamond, Joseph Ferreira d/b/a Advanced Auto Recycling Inc., and LKQ Corporation. The claims against all but four of the various defendants were dismissed prior to trial, leaving only the named defendants. The plaintiffs subsequently filed a separate federal action that was unsuccessful and is currently on appeal before the First Circuit Court of Appeals.', '-5- an eleven day trial was held before a jury. 5 After judgment entered on behalf of plaintiffs, plaintiffs, nonetheless, timely appealed.', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'Before this Court, Paolino and Issa argue that the trial justice erred by failing to order injunctive relief against defendants because of a continuing trespass. The plaintiffs further argue that the trial justice erred when she precluded plaintiffs’ expert from offering his opinion that storm water runoff from defendants’ property was the source of the oil located along the man- made ditch on plaintiffs’ property. The plaintiffs also maintain that the trial justice erred when she denied their motion to amend their complaint to conform to the evidence and when she denied their motion for a new trial based on the discovery of new evidence.', 'Because we are of the opinion that the trial justice erred when she restricted the expert’s trial testimony, and because that is dispositive of this appeal, we need not address the other issues raised in the appeal, with the exception of the denial of injunctive relief.', 'III', 'Failure to Order Injunctive Relief', 'A', 'Facts and Travel', 'At the conclusion of trial testimony, a jury verdict summary sheet was submitted to the jury. The jury found that there had been a continuing trespass on Paolino’s property and it awarded plaintiffs nominal damages of $1,400. The continuing trespasses identified were: a corner of defendants’ metal building, the headwall and riprap for defendants’ storm water 5', 'It does not escape our notice that the complaint in this case was filed in November, 2006, but that the matter was not reached for trial until June, 2012.', '-6- remediation system, and the discharge flowing from defendants’ property onto plaintiffs’ property. Nearly two years after the jury returned a verdict, plaintiffs filed a motion for entry of final judgment. During the hearing on their motion, plaintiffs claimed they were entitled to injunctive relief to remove the continuing trespasses, the traditional remedy in such cases. Subsequently, an evidentiary hearing was held before the trial justice on plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief.', 'During the hearing, Paolino identified three photographs depicting the pre-existing condition of the location where the storm water pollution prevention plan was later installed. The pictures did not include the storm water pollution prevention plan discharge pipes.', 'The defendants’ counsel then called Eugene Jeffers, the director of public works for the Town of Cumberland, as a witness. He testified that, since the installation of the storm water treatment system at Curran Road, the town had not experienced any problems with flooding of the road in that area. He also testified that, if the system were to be eliminated or changed, the town would want to review what was going to be done. Eric Beck, a supervisor for the Rhode Island Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (RIPDES) program in the office of water resources at DEM, testified that maintaining the riprap would not require a permit from DEM, but that any other activities that would have the potential to either alter the stream, or any construction, would require a permit from DEM. When asked about removing the riprap, he deferred to DEM about whether a permit was required or not. When asked whether there had been any flooding problems in the area as the system was currently constructed, he answered in the negative.', 'Richard Bessette, a general contractor, testified that the estimated price of removing the building encroachment on Paolino’s property was $38,204.50. He also testified that the estimated cost of removing the portion of the headwall encroaching on Paolino’s', '-7- property was $18,000. Bessette further testified that removing portions of the storm water remediation system away from Paolino’s property would cost either $52,468 or $65,795, based on estimates obtained from two separate companies.', 'Later that afternoon, the trial justice issued a bench decision, granting plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief in part and denying it in part. She ordered only that the encroachment of defendants’ metal building be removed. With respect to the encroachments of the headwall, riprap, and discharge of the storm water, the trial justice found that there was no bad faith on the part of defendants.', 'After balancing the equities, she concluded that the remaining encroachments were de minimis and that their removal would not benefit plaintiffs, but rather would disproportionately harm defendants.', 'The trial justice stated that the general rule for a continuing trespass is injunctive relief, citing Santilli v. Morelli, 102 R.I. 333, 230 A.2d 860 (1967). She noted, however, that there are exceptions to mandatory injunctive relief, such as when the impact to a defendant is disproportionate to the benefit to the plaintiff, that allow for a balancing of the equities. She also observed that where an encroachment is intentional, the court may refuse to balance the equities, citing Renaissance Development Corp. v. Universal Properties Group, Inc., 821 A.2d 233 (R.I. 2003) (Renaissance).', 'The trial justice found that defendants did not act in bad faith or recklessly. She credited Ferreira’s testimony that he had believed the streambed to be on his property. Furthermore, she noted that Ferreira obtained a building permit to construct a metal storage building close to the stream, evidencing that his understanding of the property boundary was genuine and that he respected what he genuinely believed the boundary to be. She also noted that the survey conducted in 2003 by Cournoyer Enterprises (the 2003 Cournoyer survey) depicted the building', '-8- as butting right up to the property line; it did not depict any encroachments. The trial justice found Robert Yabroudy, Ferreira’s controller, who testified that he thought the building was right on the property line, to be credible. Additionally, the trial justice noted that plaintiffs’ 2009 survey, conducted by Robert Perruzzi, failed to pick up any boundary problem other than the building encroachment, which the survey identified as 0.86 feet over the property line. She stated that “[o]bviously, it was easy to make a mistake about the precise location of the property boundary,” as even Perruzzi seemed to believe that the headwall and riprap were on defendants’ property. Moreover, the trial justice read little into the fact that defendants failed to disclose the 2003 Cournoyer survey to DEM because it was not news to either party that the storm water remediation system lay close to the property boundary. The trial justice concluded that the boundary encroachments were not caused by bad faith or recklessness, and she continued to balance the equities.', 'With regard to the encroachment of the headwall and riprap, the trial justice described it as de minimis. She indicated that the end of the headwall for the storm water remediation system extended only about twelve inches over the property line. She said it was clear from the evidence that there was some benefit to the structures as a containment system and that removing the headwall and riprap could complicate the situation on Curran Road.', 'Therefore, she understood the reluctance of the town to allow tampering with the existing structures. Furthermore, she reasoned that it would cost $18,000 to remove the riprap and that there would ultimately be no benefit to plaintiffs if the riprap and headwall were removed.', 'With respect to the discharge from the storm water remediation system, the trial justice said that the evidence was that redesigning the system and rerouting the discharge to bypass plaintiffs’ property would not “materially benefit” anyone. She remarked that the discharge from', '-9- the storm water remediation system followed the natural drainage pattern and that, given the lay of the land, surface water runoff from defendants’ property would gravitate to plaintiffs’ property even in the absence of the storm water remediation system. She reasoned that the evidence indicated it would cost up to $60,000 to redirect the discharge and that the cost of redesigning and modifying the storm water remediation system outweighed the value of plaintiffs’ property. She concluded that the financial burden to defendants would be “significant and substantial,” especially because the tasks and “associated costs of redesigning and rebuilding * * * would be vastly disproportionate to any benefit [to plaintiffs] * * * if the discharge from that system was to be redirected and the encroaching structures removed.”', 'Regarding the metal building, the trial justice granted plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief. She reasoned that such an encroachment invites more human activity onto the area of plaintiffs’ property because people would be retrieving automobile parts that were stored in the structure. She ordered that the encroachment of the metal building be removed and the building scaled back.', 'B', 'Standard of Review', '“A judgment in a nonjury case will be reversed on appeal when it can be shown that the trial justice misapplied the law, misconceived or overlooked material evidence[,] or made factual findings that were clearly wrong.” Rose Nulman Park Foundation ex rel.

Although this Court in Santilli declined to apply the exception to the general rule of granting injunctive relief for continuing trespasses, we did, however, acknowledge that “the existence of such circumstances may in exceptional cases move the court to withhold the coercive relief contemplated by the general rule.” Id. at 338, 230 A.2d at 863; see also Bentley v. Root, 19 R.I. 205, 208, 32 A. 918, 919 (1895) (“Assuming all the obstruction which the complainant claims, still, as it does not interfere with his use of the way, and relief in equity would be of no real benefit to him, but a cause of great trouble to the respondents, * * * we may properly leave him to his remedy at law.”). We are satisfied that this case involves such exceptional circumstances, warranting a balancing of the equities.', 'It should not be overlooked that the trial justice granted plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief with respect to defendants’ metal building, even though the structure encroached onto plaintiffs’ property by a mere five inches. She reasoned that such an encroachment invites continuous human activity onto plaintiffs’ property because the metal building was used in connection with a business.', 'In Renaissance, 821 A.2d at 239, this Court concluded that the encroachment was more than de minimis. This Court reasoned that “[the plaintiff’s] access to the back portion of its lot', '- 13 - was restricted, the amount of land involved was approximately 250 square feet, and the result of the encroachment was the economic enrichment of [the] defendants at the expense of [the plaintiff].”', 'Id.', 'Similarly, in Rose Nulman, 93 A.3d at 32, this Court stated “that an encroachment of some 13,000 square feet is not a minimal one * * * [and] is not small enough that a balancing of the equities makes the hardship to [the] defendants outweigh the harm to [the] plaintiffs.” Here, unlike in Renaissance and Rose Nulman, the trial justice described the twelve- inch encroachment of the headwall and riprap as de minimis, and it is clearly not the same as the 13,000 square feet encroachment in Rose Nulman or the 250 square feet encroachment in Renaissance.', 'For these reasons, we are of the opinion that the trial justice did not misapply the law, misconceive or overlook material evidence, or make factual findings that were clearly wrong, and, thereby, did not stray beyond the broad discretion she was afforded.', 'IV', 'Preclusion of Opinion Testimony of Expert', 'A', 'Facts and Travel', 'Alvin Snyder, a consulting environmental and chemical engineer at ERA, was offered as an expert witness by plaintiffs to testify about the contaminants on the properties at issue. Snyder offered that he had a Bachelor of Science degree in chemical engineering from Clarkson College of Technology and that he was registered as a professional engineer in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Ohio and as a site professional in Massachusetts. Paolino engaged him to conduct an assessment of his property. In order to prepare for his testimony, Snyder identified and reviewed all the information available to him pertaining to the property;', '- 14 - this included thousands of pages of documents. 6 Snyder testified that those documents were the types of documents that are customarily and reasonably relied upon by site assessment professionals when performing site assessments. As permitted under Rule 703 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, Snyder relied upon those documents to formulate his expert opinion. He also visited the property and analyzed various soil and water samples.', 'Snyder testified that storm water, following the natural topography of the land, runs from Ferreira’s property into the stream on Paolino’s property.', 'He further testified that aerial photographs that had been taken in 1981, 1988, 1996, and 2005 revealed that Ferreira parked a number of vehicles for his auto salvage business on land directly abutting the stream. He noted that one of the stipulations of special conditions in the wetlands alteration permit that was issued to Ferreira in 1986 was that he maintain a twenty-foot buffer between the stream and any activities. From his review of the aerial photographs, Snyder was able to determine that Ferreira had not complied with those buffer zone requirements. Snyder also testified that his review of an EPA-commissioned report dealing with the Ferreira property indicated that there was contamination entering the stream. 6', 'Those voluminous documents included, among others, reports that had been prepared by various consulting firms and included a site assessment in 1987 by ERA, remediation cost data that is commonly used in the environmental field for determining cost in remediation, a 2004 Weston Solutions report on Ferreira’s property that the EPA prepared, a report by Lord Associates provided to DEM in November 2004, and a site investigation report on Paolino’s property from 2005 prepared by Pine River Environmental Consulting. Snyder also reviewed the New England Environmental report on the wetlands permitting and resource areas on Paolino’s property in 2007, a letter report on hydrology in 2008 for Paolino’s property, and a survey completed by Perruzzi for Paolino’s property in 2009. The witness said he had also examined photographs of the property. The witness also undertook the effort to correspond with various agencies, including the Pawtucket Water Supply Board (PWSB) that supplied him with field observations and analytical measurements that they had taken of samples of storm water that was being discharged by the neighboring property over time. He spoke to GZA and obtained certificates of analysis for a remediation that had been done on Paolino’s property. Snyder also conducted a file review at DEM in May 2009 of the site remediation, the hazardous waste, and the water resource files.', '- 15 -', 'Significantly, the witness testified that the tests that had been conducted by ERA in 1987 revealed no contamination on Paolino’s property, but that soil borings from Paolino’s property in 2007 showed the presence of oil contamination. 7 Snyder spoke of the analysis done by the Pawtucket Water Supply Board (PWSB) that determined the presence of other components of gasoline in the sample. He said that a hydrology report from 2008 indicated there was oil sheen at the entry point from the storm water emitting from Ferreira’s property into the stream. Similarly, he said that, during testing done by GZA, oil was found floating on the surface of some of the test pits, along with concentrations of TPH, 8 which he identified as lubrication oil and motor oil.', 'During his many visits to the site, Snyder observed a significant amount of auto parts along the property line as well as on Paolino’s property. He also determined the presence of turbidity9 in the stream water. Snyder testified that he conducted both surface water testing and some soil testing. He testified that there was oil in the stream, and that, generally, the results of the surface water testing revealed that the composition of the upstream water did not change appreciably during storms but that the composition of the discharge in the headwall changed drastically. 10 Snyder also testified that, in general, the metal concentrations increased in the 7', 'The soil borings specifically found solvents, metals, lead, and LNAPL (light non-aqueous phase liquid), which is anything that floats on water, be it oil or gasoline. 8', 'TPH is an acronym for total petroleum hydrocarbons; it is a laboratory procedure using a gas chromatograph, Method 8100M, and it determines the amount of petroleum-based organics in a sample. 9', 'The American Heritage Dictionary defines “turbid” as “[h]aving sediment or foreign particles stirred up or suspended; muddy[.]” The American Heritage Dictionary 1304 (2d ed. 1982). 10', 'The stream turbidity upstream was 1.3 NTU units in the beginning and rose to 2.8 during the end of the storm. Suspended solid was not found in the beginning but raised to 2 afterward. Oil was nondetectable in the beginning but rose to 190 parts per million afterward. Lead was not detectable at the beginning and not detectable in the end. The sample in the channel at the beginning of the storm had an old petroleum septic odor to it, but toward the end of the storm it had no odor. Turbidity was 15 NTUs in the beginning of the storm and jumped to 100 NTUs.', '- 16 - storm water, but “did not increase to any significant degree in the upstream sample.” Snyder added that he took care to take samples from only the storm water coming from the property so that it would not include any runoff from Curran Road. He testified that the oil from the storm water was “fingerprinted” and identified as lube oil or compressor oil. With respect to the soil testing, Snyder testified that the soil samples on the north side of the storm water channel revealed 7,000 parts per million of TPH that was identified as lube or compressor oil. He added that when he dug a trowel four inches into the sediment, a bubble of oil came up in the water.', 'Snyder’s Opinions and the Sustained Objections', 'Snyder opined that the contamination on Paolino’s property “lies in the water”; that “all along the stream,” “along the banks of the pond to the north,” and “the GZA area,” there is contamination. He also testified that there was a considerable amount of automobile parts on Paolino’s property and in the ponds. When plaintiffs’ counsel asked Snyder if he had an opinion as to what caused the contamination at the site of GZA’s testing (the GZA site) on plaintiffs’ property, defendants’ counsel objected. The trial justice allowed the witness to answer yes or no but stated, “I think we’re going to need some more foundation.” The plaintiffs’ counsel then asked Snyder to describe what the documents regarding the location of the filling indicated to him. After having Snyder recount those documents, plaintiffs’ counsel followed up by again asking whether Snyder had an opinion as to the cause of the contamination at the GZA site; defendants’ counsel again objected and the trial justice sustained the objection, based on a lack of foundation. At this point, plaintiffs’ counsel made an offer of proof at sidebar, but the trial justice continued to sustain the objection. The trial justice said that Snyder’s testimony did not seem scientifically based since “[a]ll he’s doing is saying Ferreira was working in the area; Suspended solid, an indication of turbidity, jumped from 12 to 320 parts per million. Oil, TPH, went from 360 parts per billion to 2,200 parts per billion.', '- 17 - Ferreira was putting fill in; and somehow Ferreira must have had obtained contaminated fill and placed it there.” As an offer of proof, plaintiffs’ counsel noted that Snyder would testify that there was no oil spill in the area because of the absence of evidence of an oil spill downstream.', 'After the sidebar, plaintiffs’ counsel asked whether Snyder had an opinion as to whether a significant oil spill had caused the contamination at the GZA site; defendants’ counsel objected, and the trial justice sustained the objection. The plaintiffs’ counsel made an offer of proof that Snyder was prepared to testify that the contamination around the stream banks indicated to him that it was caused in a different manner and it was not caused by a significant oil spill.', 'The plaintiffs’ counsel then asked Snyder if he had reviewed any documents that evidenced in any way that there ever had been a significant oil spill downstream from Paolino’s property, to which he answered no. Following up, plaintiffs’ counsel asked whether there was anything about the pattern of contamination in the GZA site that indicated to Snyder one way or another how that contamination had taken place. In response, Snyder testified that GZA did TPH analyses on the oil in the pond and determined that it was lube oil and motor oil. Snyder further testified that the fact that most of the contaminants were found near the stream indicated to him that that was probably the original location where oil was either spilled or placed and then it spread to other areas of the pond in the soil. His opinion was offered to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty.', 'The witness further testified that he found oil and lead on both sides of the stream at the water line. Then, plaintiffs’ counsel asked whether Snyder reviewed any records indicating that oil or lead was coming from one property or another and going to the stream. The defendants’ counsel objected once again and the trial justice again sustained the objection. When plaintiffs’', '- 18 - counsel asked whether the DEM report, dated March 22, 2005, revealed anything about oil entering the stream, defendants’ counsel repeated his objection and a sidebar followed. At sidebar, plaintiffs’ counsel reassured the trial justice that this question was part of the foundation he was laying. The trial justice said, “there’s a difference between reviewing a bunch of documents and identifying the factual basis for the opinion.” The trial justice continued,', '“he needs to give us the facts upon which he has concluded', 'something about how this entire length of the streambed became', 'contaminated. He needs to articulate them. That’s a little bit more', 'than ‘I looked at a bunch of records.’ Okay? And there’s got to be', 'some science behind it. So however you come at it, fine, but I', 'need the science and I need the facts and data.” The trial justice again sustained the objection.', 'After the sidebar conference was concluded, plaintiffs’ counsel inquired of Snyder how he came to reach his conclusion as to the origin of the contamination along the streambed. Although Snyder was allowed to testify that he found oil and lead to be emanating from the adjoining property, his opinion that storm water flowing into the stream from that property had concentrations higher than had been measured previously was stricken from the record. The plaintiffs’ counsel then asked Snyder about GZA’s testing along the stream, closer to Ferreira’s property, and Snyder testified that GZA found that the soil was contaminated with oil that matched lube oil.', 'The plaintiffs’ counsel asked Snyder if his own soil sample testing, including those along the stream, found any evidence of oil. Snyder answered affirmatively. The witness was then asked if, after reviewing documents and his own samples and GZA samples on both sides of the stream, he had an opinion as to the cause of the TPH found in his test results. The defendants’ counsel objected and the trial justice sustained the objection.', 'After dismissing the jury and Snyder for the day, the trial justice went on the record to express her concern that Snyder had not provided any scientific foundation that would', '- 19 - demonstrate that contaminants flowed from Ferreira’s salvage yard onto Paolino’s property. The defendants’ counsel chimed in that, because there was no baseline study done at any point in time, the jury would not be able to make any kind of a proximate cause determination with respect to the individual defendants. Although the trial justice acknowledged that common sense would indicate that an auto salvage yard could pose a real danger of contaminants migrating to adjacent properties, she nonetheless, observed there had never been a thorough assessment of the Ferreira property such that anyone could pinpoint what the nature and extent of the contaminants were along the streambed over time.', 'The next day, when Snyder resumed the stand, he testified that the GZA test pits did not indicate contamination at the surface, but at about five to six feet in depth, signifying that it was a different mechanism, such as the placement of fill, that caused the contamination in the GZA site versus the contamination that was found in the stream. He also confirmed that he was familiar with the chemical makeup of the materials that would be common to an auto recycling yard, such as oil and lead. He testified that the result of chromatography tests he had run indicated that there was lubricating oil or motor oil in the soil sample. Additionally, Snyder testified that GZA had conducted several analyses on test pits in the area and that several were found to contain motor oil. Snyder further testified that oil will float and travel down a stream until it absorbed into the banks of the stream. He stated that certain types of oil can remain in the ground for decades while others, like gasoline, can biologically degrade over time and dissipate. Motor oil, which he said is slow to degrade, was found in a soil sample taken on plaintiffs’ property near the stream.', 'The plaintiffs’ counsel asked Snyder to explain the process by which oil or sediment would get into surface water runoff in an auto salvage operation. The defendants’ counsel', '- 20 - objected to this question and the trial justice sustained the objection. Snyder was, however, allowed to testify that he reviewed reports indicating the presence of oil on the ground of the AAR site. The plaintiffs’ counsel then inquired if the witness had reviewed any reports that revealed contamination of storm water in the stream. In response, Snyder testified that he reviewed the Rhode Island screening site inspection report from 1989, which indicated that the stream was contaminated by oil and turbidity. The plaintiffs’ counsel then asked Snyder:', '“Do you have an opinion based upon the testing that you did, the', 'testing that GZA did, the chromatography testing that was done,', 'the surface water flow on the Advanced Auto Recycling property,', 'the observations of yourself and others which you’ve testified to,', 'regarding the stormwater discharge from the Advanced Auto', 'Recycling property * * * and your review of the water testing in', 'this case and the aerial photographs and other photographs you', 'reviewed, as to whether or not the Advanced Auto Recycling', 'property is discharging any oil or sediment into the stream on the', 'side of the property?” Again, defendants’ counsel objected and the trial justice sustained the objection.', 'Snyder, however, was permitted to testify that the storm water discharge was emitting turbidity and sediment onto Paolino’s property, but he was not allowed to testify that the discharge was emitting oil. The sustained objections to this line of questioning continued for some time until plaintiffs’ counsel asked:', '“Based upon the reports you reviewed, your testing, and your', 'personal observations at the site in 2009, did you have an opinion', 'as to whether or not the water that was coming out of the', 'stormwater discharge system at the headwall was causing oil to', 'come onto Mr. Paolino’s property?” To no surprise, defendants’ counsel objected. This time, however, the trial justice overruled the objection and Snyder was permitted to opine that the storm water being discharged by the salvage yard from the headwall was polluting Paolino’s property with oil. His opinion was to a', '- 21 - reasonable degree of scientific certainty. Nevertheless, Snyder was precluded from opining that the AAR property was discharging oil into the stream on the property.', 'B', 'Standard of Review', '“It is well settled that ‘[t]he determination of whether to qualify and permit an expert witness to proffer an expert opinion relative to an issue in dispute is left to the discretion of the trial justice and this Court will not disturb that determination absent clear error or an abuse of discretion.’” Foley v.

We are of the opinion that Snyder did, in fact, reach his conclusions in a scientific manner by relying upon the documents that experts in the field commonly rely upon when rendering an opinion and by his own examination of the land in question. The plaintiffs’ counsel meticulously went through each report, each photo, and Snyder’s own observations to lay the foundation that the trial justice continued to require. This is the type of supporting evidence that was lacking in Skene. And nothing about it was “too speculative to logically advance plaintiffs’ theory,” because a jury could very well have found causation based on the evidence that Snyder provided.', 'In Gallucci, 709 A.2d at 1063, this Court held that the expert’s testimony established a foundation that complied with Rule 705 and was sufficient to warrant the admission of his opinion in full at trial.', 'Therefore, the trial justice in Gallucci abused her discretion and committed reversible error when she limited the expert’s testimony.

Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 596 (1993)).

In Morabit, 80 A.3d at 14, this Court determined that, because the trial justice’s decision was predicated upon the plaintiff’s failure to offer proof of damages, the trial justice’s exclusion of the expert’s “testimony was so prejudicial as to constitute reversible error and require a new trial on that count.” We again embrace that rationale and, for these reasons, are of the opinion that the trial justice’s exclusion', '- 29 - of Snyder’s testimony was an unsustainable exercise of her discretion and that plaintiffs are entitled to a new trial on all issues, excluding the issue of injunctive relief.', 'V', 'Additional Issues on Appeal', 'Because we have sustained plaintiffs’ appeal and have held that they are entitled to a new trial on all issues, excluding the issue of injunctive relief, we need not, and shall not, rule on plaintiffs’ remaining two contentions of error: the trial justice’s denial of plaintiffs’ motion to amend their pleadings to conform to the trial evidence regarding the punitive damages claim against defendant, J.F.

After reviewing the case, Attorney Wagner concluded that DEM had not been enforcing a host of regulatory and permit requirements on the Ferreira property. As a result, in May 2013 Attorney Wagner filed a complaint seeking a writ of mandamus to compel DEM to prosecute the regulatory violations (hereinafter mandamus complaint).', 'When he drafted the mandamus complaint, Attorney Wagner had at his disposal the jury verdict summary sheet that had been submitted to the jury after the trial in this case. Attorney 11', 'Our review of the record yields no reason why plaintiffs should be precluded from amending their complaint to include the punitive damage count on remand.', '- 30 - Wagner said that he understood “the jury’s affirmative responses to mean that the jury had found that Ferreira[] had trespassed on Paolino’s property by discharging contaminated water across the boundary between the two properties.” Proceeding on that understanding, Attorney Wagner included an allegation in the mandamus complaint that the jury had found that Ferreira had trespassed onto Paolino’s property by “[f]ailing to remediate contamination deposited on the Paolino property by pond, surface and storm waters diverted from the AAR Property and onto the Paolino Property.” Significantly, to support this allegation, he attached a copy of the jury verdict summary sheet to the mandamus complaint.', 'By March 2014, Attorney Wagner had entered his appearance in this case as well and, as counsel to Paolino, he filed a motion for entry of final judgment. The motion proposed that the final judgment include injunctive relief based on the jury’s findings of trespass. Notably, the motion included the following statement:', '“The jury concluded that the [d]efendants were liable for', 'several trespasses on [p]laintiffs’ property involving the', 'construction of physical structures on and across the boundary line,', 'the discharge of pond or storm water across the boundary line and', 'the deposition of pollutants on [p]laintiffs’ property by', '[d]efendants’ water discharges.” Again, Attorney Wagner said that he based this statement on his reading of the jury’s affirmative responses in the jury verdict summary sheet. In response, Ferreira’s counsel submitted an objection to the proposed final judgment and sought sanctions under Rule 11 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure on the grounds that the motion papers misrepresented the jury’s verdict.', 'Attorney Wagner’s motion for entry of final judgment was heard in April 2014. At that time, the court found that Attorney Wagner’s statement interpreting the jury’s findings was interposed for “improper purposes.” The trial justice further indicated that Attorney Wagner’s', '- 31 - statement was a “mischaracterization” of the jury’s responses to the interrogatories. She went on to say:', '“The jury interrogatories in this case were carefully crafted', 'to respond to the trial evidence. For example, Question Number 1', 'asks ‘Have [p]laintiffs proved by a fair preponderance of the', 'evidence that in 1983 or 1984, Joseph Ferreira both (a) deposited', 'contaminated fill on Lot 362 and (b) committed trespass when he', 'thereafter failed to remove that fill?’ The word ‘and’ was', 'underscored. Question Number 4, on the other hand, asks ‘Have', 'plaintiffs proved by a fair preponderance of the evidence that,', 'during the period 1988 through 1997, Joseph Ferreira trespassed', 'upon their property by (a) diverting surface and pond water from', 'his property into the stream bed or channel located on Lot 362, or', '(b) failing to remove from their property contaminants deposited', 'by that water.’ I very deliberately used the word ‘or’ and not the', 'word ‘and.’ The word ‘or’ was underscored.

Question 13 was substantially the same question but', 'with respect to the stormwater remediation system and the', 'discharge of contaminants from it.” The trial justice added that the jury “may have found as plaintiffs represent but not necessarily so[,]” and that “[a]ccordingly, [j]ury [i]nterrogatories 6, 11 and 13 permitted the jury to find trespass on an ‘either’ or ‘both’ basis.”', 'The court denied the motion for entry of final judgment and directed Attorney Wagner to show cause why Rule 11 sanctions should not be imposed. The trial justice also directed Ferreira’s counsel to file an affidavit of fees. At the subsequent show cause hearing, Attorney Wagner claimed that he “believe[d] that the plaintiffs’ interpretation of [the jury] responses [was] a good faith reading based objectively on the four corners of the [j]ury [v]erdict [s]ummary [s]heet.” He added “that when * * * talking about an interpretation of an answer to a compound question, there is more than sufficient room for multiple opinions as to meaning to avoid taking that long and drastic step to Rule 11 sanctions.” Furthermore, it was “difficult [for him] to see', '- 32 - how Rule 11 sanctions would lie in this case for allegations made in a complaint in another case[,]” i.e., the mandamus complaint. Attorney Wagner argued that “[i]f those allegations in that case are sanction worthy, then defendants should make a motion at the proper time and in the proper place for sanctions in the other case.”', 'At the conclusion of the show cause proceedings, the trial justice remarked, “[w]ell, I think we agree we will never know whether the jury thought that it was trespass just by water or whether it was trespass by water and depositing contaminants.”', 'Nonetheless, after the show cause hearing was concluded, the court issued a decision imposing sanctions in the sum of $6,647 on Attorney Wagner. The trial justice found that Attorney “Wagner attempted to achieve [p]laintiffs’ ultimate goals by improperly editing the jury interrogatory questions, spinning the jury’s answers into something materially different than they were and representing them as fact.” She further indicated that Attorney “Wagner’s behavior was deliberate, could have had a significant impact on the outcome of this case if not discovered, and was in disregard of his duties under Rule 11.” 12 Thereafter, Attorney Wagner timely appealed to this Court.', 'B', 'Standard of Review', '“‘[W]hile a trial justice has discretionary authority to formulate what he or she considers to be an appropriate sanction,’ we will reverse a sanction when it was imposed based on an erroneous view of the law,’ or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.” Manning v.

The respondent father, Kai Jackson, appeals from a decree of the Family Court terminating his parental rights with respect to his two sons, Kyeshon J. and Jarell G. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on September 29, 2016, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties’ arguments (both written and oral), we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this appeal may be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the decree of the Family Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On November 19, 2013, Sandra Armand and Gorvey Armand (petitioners) filed two adoption petitions in Family Court so that Gorvey1 might become the legal father of both Kyeshon (who was born on May 23, 1999) and Jarell (who was born on November 9, 2000). As 1', 'We shall at some points in this opinion employ first names and omit the surnames. In doing so, we intend no disrespect.', '-1- the basis for their petitions, petitioners alleged that respondent had failed to provide for Kyeshon and Jarell pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 15-7-7(a).', '(Those petitions could be granted only if respondent consented to the adoptions—or, alternatively, if his parental rights as to the children were terminated.) The respondent, who was then incarcerated in Massachusetts, refused to consent to the adoptions. As a result, petitioners moved to terminate respondent’s parental rights with respect to Kyeshon and Jarell. Thereafter, a trial was held before a Family Court justice on August 14, September 3, September 10, and December 15 of 2014. We summarize below the salient aspects of that trial.', 'A', 'The Testimony of Sandra', 'Sandra Armand, the mother of Kyeshon and Jarell, testified that respondent had not visited the boys in over two years, the last occasion being when he “picked them up” on Jarell’s eleventh birthday in November of 2011. She testified that respondent had not set up a visitation schedule as to when he would visit the boys; she stated that, instead, he would seek to visit them “out-of-the-blue.” It was her testimony that respondent’s last phone conversation with Kyeshon occurred about one year before trial. She further testified that she had not received child support payments for her sons from respondent in twelve years.', 'She also stated that, although respondent had from time to time purchased sneakers for the boys in past years, he had stopped making such purchases before 2012.', 'Sandra further testified that respondent had not been involved with the care of the children; she added that she and their stepfather (Gorvey) have provided for their daily needs over the years. She stated that, for at least six years, Gorvey has “effectively been [the boys’] father,” providing “stability” in the household by being “a constant father figure” who “[attends]', '-2- their school meetings, helps with [their] homework, feeds them, [and] clothes them.” Sandra testified that, in her judgment, it would be in the best interests of Kyeshon and Jarell to terminate respondent’s parental rights.', 'B', 'The Testimony of Respondent', 'The respondent testified at trial that he was then serving a two-year sentence in Massachusetts for simple assault.2 He further testified that, from the end of 2011 until some point in 2012, he would visit Kyeshon and Jarell. He testified that he had given cell phones to Kyeshon and Jarell when they were six and seven years old, respectively. It was his testimony that he had purchased clothes, sneakers, and headphones for them, the last time being at some point in 2013—although he could not recall in which month of that year. The respondent testified that, in July of 2013, he saw and gave thirty dollars to Kyeshon at a family barbecue. He further testified that, as a result of his incarceration that began in August of 2013, he had since that time not seen Kyeshon or Jarell, nor had he supported them. However, respondent stated on cross-examination that he had visited both his sons whenever he was not incarcerated.', 'C', 'The Testimony of Kyeshon', 'Kyeshon, who was fifteen years old at the time of trial, testified that he wanted his stepfather to become his legal father because of their “positive relationship.” Specifically, he discussed how his stepfather is “reliable” and has “been there for [him] for a very long time” by giving him good advice, going to church with him, taking him to his basketball games, helping 2', 'The respondent testified that, as a result of various convictions, he had been incarcerated for one year over the course of the years 2008 and 2009; seven months in 2010; forty days in 2011; and two years beginning in August of 2013.', '-3- him with his homework, and attending his school functions. He further testified that he had last seen respondent about “two years ago.” When asked on direct examination whether respondent had provided any “benefits” to him, he replied: “Not really.” Kyeshon testified that, in his view, terminating respondent’s parental rights would be best for him and his family.', 'D', 'The Testimony of Jarell', 'Jarell, who was fourteen years old at the time of trial, testified that he “absolutely” wanted his stepfather to become his legal father. According to Jarell, his stepfather “has been in [his] life every single day for eight years,” continuously “support[ing] [him] and [his] family.” Specifically, he discussed how his stepfather is a “good role model,” who helps him with his homework, goes to his football games, and treats his mother well. By contrast, Jarell testified that he was “mad” about respondent’s repeated incarcerations. He stated that he had not “seen [respondent] in years;” he added that he had last seen respondent on his eleventh birthday (November 9, 2011). Jarell testified that he was “fine” with respondent losing his parental rights “[b]ecause [respondent] is barely in [his] life, and [he] barely get[s] to see him.”', 'E', 'The Testimony of Respondent’s Fiancée', 'The respondent’s fiancée testified that she had been in a relationship with respondent for over two years. It was her testimony that, at one point, respondent asked her to contact Sandra; the fiancée stated that she did so in December of 2013 through Facebook and by phone in order to “get in touch with the children.” She stated that, when he was incarcerated, Sandra “would allow [the boys] to speak to [their father] whenever they wanted to, but she would not allow them to go visit him.” When asked whether she had conversed with Sandra after December of', '-4- 2013, she replied: “No.” She also stated that respondent had not thereafter asked her to contact Sandra again.', 'F', 'The Family Court’s Decision', 'On February 25, 2015, the justice of the Family Court who had presided over the trial made several findings of fact, of which we set forth the most important. At the outset, the trial justice indicated that respondent’s lack of contact with and financial support for Kyeshon and Jarell was “painfully evident,” noting that there was such a lack “even when [respondent] was not incarcerated.” Specifically, she found that respondent’s last contact with both children was on November 9, 2011 and that he had “never provided * * * child support * * * and only provided occasional * * * gifts.”', 'The trial justice pointed to respondent’s “long history of incarceration” as well as “[p]etitioners’ and the children’s wishes” as being significant factors for her to weigh in determining whether or not to terminate respondent’s parental rights with respect to his sons. She ultimately found, by clear and convincing evidence, that respondent was unfit as a parent because he had “failed to provide support for these two children, and * * * [had] failed to have any contact with them for a period of more than six months prior to the filing of th[e] Adoption Petition, even when he had resources available to him to see his children.” The trial justice further found that it would be in the best interests of Kyeshon and Jarell to terminate respondent’s parental rights so that their stepfather might adopt them. On the same day, she entered a decree terminating respondent’s parental rights. A timely notice of appeal ensued.', '-5-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'When reviewing a decision to terminate parental rights, this Court “reviews the record to determine whether legal and competent evidence lends support to the [Family Court] justice’s ruling.” In re Jake G., 126 A.3d 450, 456 (R.I. 2015). The findings of fact of a justice of the Family Court are “entitled to great weight and will not be overturned unless we determine that they are clearly wrong or the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence.” Id. (quoting In re Jah-nell B., 116 A.3d 784, 791 (R.I. 2015)). Additionally, we have consistently noted that, “in order to permanently sever the rights of a parent in his or her children, * * * [t]he state must prove parental unfitness by clear and convincing evidence in order to satisfy the parent’s right to due process.” Id. (quoting In re Jah-nell B., 116 A.3d at 791). However, we are ever mindful that the “best interests of the child outweigh all other considerations.” In re Tory S., 988 A.2d 151, 155 (R.I. 2010) (quoting In re Kristen B., 558 A.2d 200, 203 (R.I. 1989)).', 'With respect to the review of adoption petitions, § 15-7-5(b)(2) sets forth that “[t]he standard of proof in these cases shall be by clear and convincing evidence and the court shall give primary consideration to the physical, psychological, mental, and intellectual needs of the child * * *.”', 'III', 'Analysis', 'On appeal, respondent contends that the trial justice erred in finding: (1) that he is unfit “where unfitness had not been alleged as a ground in the [p]etition;” (2) that “[he] had the financial ability to provide proper care, maintenance and support” during his incarceration; and (3) “that termination of [his] parental rights would serve the best interest[s] of the children.”', '-6-', 'As a preliminary matter, respondent’s first argument is unavailing. As this Court has previously noted, we consistently adhere to the venerable “raise or waive rule,” which provides that “an issue that has not been raised and articulated previously at trial is not properly preserved for appellate review.” In re Shy C., 126 A.3d 433, 434, 435 (R.I. 2015) (quoting State v. Gomez, 848 A.2d 221, 237 (R.I. 2004)). Here, respondent never objected to petitioners’ submission of evidence to the Family Court on the issues of unfitness, willful neglect to provide proper care, maintenance and support, or abandonment. Nor did he ever object to petitioners’ purported failure to specify these statutory grounds in the adoption petition. Upon a thorough review of the record, we perceive nothing in the instant case that “would induce us to make an exception to our well-settled raise or waive jurisprudence.”', 'Id. at 435.', 'Accordingly, it is our view that respondent’s first contention on appeal has been waived.', 'The respondent’s remaining arguments are similarly unavailing and need not be addressed at any length—because respondent’s parental rights were properly terminated on the ground of abandonment pursuant to § 15-7-7(a)(4).3 In reliance upon that statute, we have on numerous occasions upheld the termination of parental rights of parents who were incarcerated— 3', 'The authority for the termination of parental rights premised upon abandonment is set forth in G.L. 1956 § 15-7-7(a)(4), which provides the following:', '“The court shall * * * after notice to the parent and a', 'hearing on the petition, terminate any and all legal rights of the', 'parent to the child, including the right to notice of any subsequent', 'adoption proceedings involving the child, if the court finds as a', 'fact by clear and convincing evidence that:', '“* * *', '“The parent has abandoned or deserted the child. A lack of', 'communication or contact with the child for at least a six (6) month', 'period shall constitute prima facie evidence of abandonment or', 'desertion.”', '-7- as respondent had been for a substantial portion of Kyeshon and Jarell’s lives. See, e.g., In re Serenity K., 891 A.2d 881, 884 (R.I. 2006) (stating that the responsibility to maintain substantial and repeated contact with one’s child continues “even when the parent whose rights are at issue was incarcerated for the six-month statutory period”). An incarcerated parent who fails to “actively engag[e] in efforts to contact” his or her child “despite having opportunities to do so” runs the very real risk of it being held that the parent has “abandoned the child.” In re DeKarri P., 787 A.2d 1170, 1171, 1172 (R.I. 2001); see In re Unique T., 822 A.2d 182, 184 (R.I. 2003).', 'Despite respondent having once inquired about his children through his fiancée in December of 2013, he failed to make further attempts to contact Kyeshon and Jarell while he was incarcerated. We consider noteworthy the trial justice’s observation that, even during the points in time when respondent was not incarcerated, it was “painfully evident” that he had “never been [a] consistent source of financial and/or emotional support” with respect to both children. Notably, she found that respondent’s last visit with both of his children was on November 9, 2011. There was ample evidence in the record that respondent had not contacted either son for at least a year—a period in excess of the statutory six months required as a basis for the termination of parental rights. Consequently, he cannot successfully rebut the prima facie evidence of abandonment. As we have repeatedly said in the past, this Court’s reaction is one of “intolerance for a parent * * * who makes halfhearted or no attempts to visit or contact his or her child within the six-month statutory time period constituting prima facie evidence of abandonment.” In re DeKarri P., 787 A.2d at 1172; see In re Serenity K., 891 A.2d at 884-85.', 'At the end of the day, the trial justice found that it would be in Kyeshon and Jarell’s best interests to terminate respondent’s parental rights so that their stepfather might adopt them. She stated, inter alia, that “[b]oth * * * young men have stated their desire to be adopted by their', '-8- stepfather,” who “has been a father and role model for them for over eight years.” In our opinion, there is no basis in the record to question the trial justice’s conclusion that the children’s best interests will be served by the termination of respondent’s parental rights.', 'Having carefully reviewed the record and the findings of fact of the trial justice, we conclude that she did not err in finding, by clear and convincing evidence, that the respondent had abandoned Kyeshon and Jarell for the six-month period referenced in § 15-7-7(a)(4). Her findings of fact, which “are accorded great weight,” were supported by a review of the evidence before her. In re Tory S., 988 A.2d at 155.

69,No. 2014-140-Appeal. (09-421-3) In re Emilee K. : In re Jennifer K. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. These consolidated cases came before the Supreme Court on November 29, 2016,1 on appeal by the respondent, Joseph K.2 (respondent), from a Family Court decree finding that the respondent abused and neglected his daughters, Emilee, who was born on June 25, 2005, and Jennifer, born on March 7, 2007.3 The Family Court justice committed the children to the care, custody, and control of the Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF). For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the decree of the Family Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'The facts of this case are as troubling as any this Court has encountered—a child who has been robbed of her innocence at age four-and-a-half, and apparently subjected to the undue 1', 'These appeals were consolidated by an order of this Court entered on October 27, 2014. 2', 'For the sake of privacy, the family members will be referred to by only their first names. 3', 'Emilee’s name is spelled differently throughout the Family Court record. However, we will refer to her in accordance with the caption on the petition.', '-1- influence of adults. In September of 2011, the Rhode Island Child Abuse Hotline received reports that Jennifer had been sexually abused by her father. The allegations were made by Dawn Grinnell (Grinnell), the director of preschool and prekindergarten programs at All Saints Academy, and Dr. Thomas Finnegan (Dr. Finnegan), the principal of All Saints Academy, where the girls attended school.', 'Jennifer’s statements of abuse began on September 12, 2011. Grinnell was supervising Jennifer’s class when the child seized two undressed Barbie dolls and simulated sexual acts between them. Jennifer explained that, while staying at her mother’s house, she had watched a movie involving two naked women. Although DCYF was not contacted at this time, Dr. Finnegan met with respondent to inform him of Jennifer’s disclosures and to recommend that Jennifer and Emilee attend counseling sessions, a recommendation that had previously been made—in April of 2011—in the midst of respondent’s divorce from the children’s mother, Rachel K. (Rachel). In the weeks following this revelation, Jennifer’s behavior became more erratic.', 'During class one day, Jennifer emulated masturbation while repeatedly screaming “[g]ive it to me, baby.” On more than one occasion, Jennifer pulled her underpants to the side and exposed herself to fellow classmates. Her behavioral problems also included increased incontinence issues and violent outbursts. On September 19, 2011, Jennifer made a second allegation of abuse, telling Grinnell that respondent walks around the house naked and that she “hold[s] his unit” when he goes to the bathroom in the middle of the night. Grinnell conveyed this disclosure to Dr. Finnegan, who contacted DCYF.', 'The DCYF began its investigation of respondent on September 19, 2011, based on the reported abuse. Megan Dunn (Dunn), a child protective investigator for DCYF, was assigned to examine the reported abuse. Dunn went to respondent’s house around 6 p.m. to speak with', '-2- respondent and the girls. Emilee answered the door in her school uniform, but Jennifer came to the door in her underwear. The respondent came down the stairs, not wearing a shirt and buttoning his shorts. Dunn informed respondent that she was investigating allegations of child molestation and needed to speak with Jennifer and Emilee.', 'Dunn spoke with Jennifer for approximately thirty minutes, during which Jennifer asked if Dunn was there to “trap her father.” Jennifer disclosed that she can see respondent’s “unit” when he walks around, when she is in the bathroom with him, and when she gets into bed with him after having a nightmare. Jennifer identified her private parts as her “vajayjay” and “booty,” but she denied being touched by respondent in either area. She also denied having to touch respondent in any way. Dunn asked Jennifer about the movie that she viewed while at her mother’s house. Jennifer seized two female Barbie dolls and placed them on top of each other, stating that “they bend over and smell each other’s vajayjay.” After this statement, Jennifer became distracted and the interview ended.', 'Dunn then spoke with Emilee, who disclosed that her father walks around the house naked and sleeps naked, and that she can see respondent’s “unit” and “booty” when he is naked. She denied ever being abused or touched inappropriately by her father or anyone else. Lastly, Dunn interviewed respondent, who denied having inappropriate contact with his children. Dunn spoke to respondent about Jennifer and Emilee’s most recent disclosure—that he walks around the house naked. The respondent admitted that he sleeps naked but denied being naked in the house when the girls are present. Dunn informed respondent that nudity around Emilee and Jennifer is inappropriate and that he should consider seeking counseling services for the girls. In addition to speaking with respondent and the girls, Dunn contacted the girls’ mother on September 27, 2011. Rachel denied showing Jennifer a pornographic movie while at her home.', '-3- She admitted to showering with Emilee and Jennifer, but she was adamant that neither girl had seen or experienced anything inappropriate while staying with her.', 'The most concerning incident occurred on September 30, 2011, when Jennifer brought a stuffed animal dog to school. Jennifer put the dog on her classmates’ faces and pretended to make the dog “pee.” Grinnell removed Jennifer from class and asked her why she was making the dog “pee” on her classmates’ faces. Jennifer responded, “Well, my Daddy pees on my face.” To demonstrate, Jennifer lay down, pulled her underpants aside, and said, “This is what happens to me.” She pointed to her vagina and stated, “My Daddy puts his unit right here.” She then told Grinnell that her father “takes it out and pees [white] on my face.” Immediately after these disclosures, Jennifer curled up into a fetal position and began to cry. Again, respondent was notified and Grinnell contacted DCYF.', 'Because Dunn was unavailable, a colleague, Robert McMahon (McMahon), assisted in the investigation and responded to the report of abuse on September 30, 2011. He recommended to respondent that Emilee and Jennifer seek medical attention. The children were taken to Newport Hospital for a medical examination; the results of which revealed no injuries or physical signs of sexual abuse. The examination report issued by Newport Hospital authorized detention and removal of the children for seventy-two hours because of Jennifer’s disclosure of sexual abuse by respondent. That same evening, the girls were placed in foster care with respondent’s cousin, Amy Mullen (Mullen). This placement proved to be problematic; several incidents occurred that warrant our attention. Namely, DCYF informed Mullen that the children could not have any contact with their father. Mullen failed to comply with this directive and gave the girls cards and Christmas presents from respondent. Additionally, Mullen engaged in several inappropriate conversations with Jennifer about the circumstances leading up to the', '-4- placement and went so far as to record the child’s comments. During these conversations, Mullen attempted to coax Jennifer into identifying the child’s stepbrother, Ryan, as the source of the abuse, asking, “[Did] he hit you with his penis[?] * * * In your vagina[?] * * * [I]n your mouth?” Although Mullen testified that she considered the child’s statements to be important, she failed to notify DCYF about them.4 Instead, Mullen gave the tapes to respondent because “he had a right to know.” The girls were removed from Mullen’s care and placed elsewhere in December of 2011.', 'In October 2011, Dunn filed petitions in the Family Court alleging abuse and neglect of the children, and DCYF contacted Ann Boutin-Gammon (Boutin-Gammon), an evaluator and counselor at Counseling Services of Rhode Island. Boutin-Gammon was asked to conduct sexual abuse assessments of Jennifer and Emilee. Boutin-Gammon met with Jennifer for the first time on October 14, 2011, and approximately three times thereafter. During these meetings, Jennifer made numerous statements, some of which indicated abuse and others that recanted her statements of abuse. Although at trial Boutin-Gammon testified that her notes from the sessions, memorializing Jennifer’s disclosures and recantations, are not specific as to dates and times, Boutin-Gammon recounted specific statements Jennifer made, including: “Daddy peed white on [me]”; “he laid on top of [me]”; and that “his unit was big.” Jennifer also disclosed to Boutin- Gammon that Emilee had seen respondent do these things and that Emilee told him to stop because Jennifer was too small and that “it hurt her private area.” According to Jennifer, Emilee told respondent to “get off,” and he refused, stating, “when [I’m] done [I’ll] get off.” Additionally, Boutin-Gammon recalled Jennifer stating that respondent would “put his penis up 4', 'The respondent also recorded a conversation with Jennifer that was introduced as an exhibit at trial.', '-5- and down as well as side to side on her head[.]” Jennifer added that this hurt because he was lying on top of her.', 'During one session in January 2012, Boutin-Gammon asked Jennifer about the movie that she said she had viewed at her mother’s house. Jennifer refused to talk about the movie, instead telling Boutin-Gammon “how Daddy had peed white on [me]” and how “[he] lay[s] on top of [me] and spread[s] [my] legs.” In February 2012, Jennifer disclosed that her sister, Emilee, called her a “liar” and said that she made up the stories of abuse. And in March 2012, Jennifer told Boutin-Gammon that she felt “[s]cared, worry, disgust, sorry, sad, confused[,] and guilty.” These feelings were related to respondent.', 'During a session in April 2012, Jennifer initially recanted her statements of abuse and said that she reported the abuse in fear of being made fun of at school. When Boutin-Gammon asked whether Jennifer was referring to any one specific student, Jennifer declared, “Daddy did it.” Boutin-Gammon asked Jennifer to draw a picture of what she was referring to, and Jennifer drew a picture of respondent and his “unit” and herself with breasts. Jennifer told Boutin- Gammon: “[respondent] put his unit on [my] breast but he didn’t do it,” and that, “[I] squeezed his unit.” At the next session, Jennifer told Boutin-Gammon: “Daddy will not do it again.”', 'In May 2012, Jennifer disclosed that respondent “put his unit in my throat * * * [i]t hurts so bad [I] can’t even breathe when he put his unit in my throat.” Boutin-Gammon asked Jennifer what she would say to respondent if she could speak to him. Jennifer said, “Don’t do that again” and, “If you trust me, are you going to do it again[,] Dad?”', 'Despite Jennifer’s statements indicating abuse, the child also told Boutin-Gammon that she had lied on occasion. The recantations occurred at Jennifer’s first meeting with Boutin- Gammon, on October 14, 2011, when the child spontaneously declared “Daddy didn’t do this,”', '-6- and again in April 2012, when she first told Boutin-Gammon that she had made up the reports of abuse but then stated that “Daddy did it.” Emilee also indicated that Jennifer had not been telling the truth and that their father had not abused either of them. Still, Boutin-Gammon determined that it was “[one-hundred] percent unclear” where Jennifer had learned of such mature behavior and the graphic descriptions of sexual conduct. According to respondent, Jennifer had learned of the adult information from the pornographic movie she watched at Rachel’s house.', 'The respondent explained that, at the time, his ex-wife’s visitation rights had recently been reinstated, and he insisted that she showed Jennifer the movie in an attempt to gain full custody of the girls. Mullen reported a similar opinion. Mullen informed Dunn that Jennifer reported that the sexual behavior “was just on TV. It was not my Daddy,” and that Rachel showed her the video “so she would know what it would look like so she wouldn’t have to live with Daddy anymore.” Rachel unequivocally denied asking Jennifer to fabricate a story of sexual abuse. She also did not believe that respondent was capable of sexually abusing his daughters.', 'After a trial that spanned approximately twenty months, the Family Court justice issued a decision on January 24, 2014.', 'The Family Court justice found that, although respondent “attempted to paint a picture that the [m]other, [Rachel], has had a vendetta against him and caused these allegations to be made against him,” the record was completely devoid of “any such evidence that [the] mother in any way contrived these allegations to get back at the [r]espondent or attempt to gain custody of these girls.” The Family Court justice acknowledged that the testimony and procedures of Boutin-Gammon were flawed, but determined that her evaluation did not negate the clear disclosures that Jennifer made to Grinnell and Dunn—revelations that “were done in such a way, in circumstances that made them reliable and trustworthy.” The', '-7- Family Court justice found that the material disclosed “was information that no four year old girl would have but for it having been something that she actually experienced.”', 'Furthermore, the Family Court justice rejected respondent’s argument that the source of the information was a single pornographic movie that Jennifer allegedly viewed while visiting her mother, declaring: “This court does not think for one moment that the pornographic movie depicting lesbian acts as described by [Jennifer] could be misconstrued when [Jennifer] described her father’s unit, holding it, and having him pee white on her. They were two totally different and separate events.” In accordance with G.L. 1956 chapter 1 of title 14, the Family Court justice concluded that respondent,', '“did abuse and neglect Jennifer and Emilee * * * in that he has', 'failed to provide said children with a minimum degree of care,', 'supervision or guardianship; that said children are without proper', 'parental care and supervision; and that the father has committed or', 'allowed to be committed against the children, an act of sexual', 'abuse.” Accordingly, on February 4, 2014, the Family Court justice entered a decree committing the children to the care, custody, and control of DCYF; a decree from which respondent has timely appealed to this Court.', 'Standard of Review', '“When we review an appeal from a decree of the Family Court after a commitment hearing, ‘we examine the record to determine whether legally competent evidence exists in it to support findings made by the trial justice.’” In re Adner G., 925 A.2d 951, 957 (R.I. 2007) (quoting In re Mackenzie C., 877 A.2d 674, 685 (R.I. 2005)). “These findings ‘are entitled to great weight and will not be reversed on appeal unless the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence, or was otherwise clearly wrong.’” Id. (quoting In re Mackenzie C., 877 A.2d at 685). Under this deferential standard of review, this Court “must search the', '-8- record in this case to determine whether legally competent evidence exists to support the trial justice’s finding that there was clear and convincing evidence” that respondent abused and neglected Jennifer and Emilee. Id. (citing In re Veronica T., 700 A.2d 1366, 1368 (R.I. 1997)).', 'Analysis', 'Before this Court, respondent assigns numerous errors to the decision of the Family Court justice. Among the enumerated errors are claims that the Family Court justice erred: (1) in allowing Boutin-Gammon, a nonexpert evaluator, to testify in DCYF’s case in chief; (2) in construing G.L. 1956 § 14-1-69 as permitting the out-of-court statements of Jennifer to be introduced, but not the out-of-court statements of Emilee; (3) in denying respondent’s midtrial motion to undertake a videotaped deposition of an out-of-state expert and then present that in his defense; (4) by overlooking or misconceiving material evidence in making her decision, including Emilee’s statements that Jennifer had lied; and (5) in holding that DCYF had proven by clear and convincing evidence that both Jennifer and Emilee had been abused and neglected. After carefully reviewing the extensive record from the Family Court and the arguments of the parties, we conclude that legally competent evidence exists to support the findings of the Family Court justice.', 'The Testimony of Boutin-Gammon', 'We begin by briefly examining respondent’s contention that the Family Court justice erred in relying on the testimony of Boutin-Gammon, who was not presented as an expert witness by DCYF. After reviewing the voluminous record in this case, it is apparent that the testimony of Boutin-Gammon was, at times, problematic. However, respondent’s suggestion', '-9- that her testimony should have been excluded in its entirety pursuant to Rules 7015 and 803(4)6 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence is not persuasive.', 'Rule 701 limits opinion testimony by witnesses who are not qualified as experts to “those opinions which are * * * rationally based on the perception of the witness” and are “helpful to a clear understanding of the witness’ testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.” “This rule is buttressed by this [C]ourt’s caveat that the lay witness must have ‘had an opportunity to observe the person and to give the concrete details on which the inference or description is founded.’” State v. Gomes, 604 A.2d 1249, 1259 (R.I. 1992) (quoting State v. Fogarty, 433 A.2d 972, 976 (R.I. 1981)). Consistently, this Court has perceived no error when a trial court allows lay-witness opinion testimony that is rationally based on the witness’s own perception and is helpful to a determination of a fact in issue. Id.; see also State v. Tep, 56 A.3d 942, 947 (R.I. 2012) (“It is unnecessary to require an expert to testify about what a lay individual could rationally conclude.”). “The decision to permit opinion testimony by a lay witness is within the sound discretion of the trial court. Review of the trial court’s decision is limited to determining whether the trial court abused its discretion.” State v. Mallett, 600 A.2d 273, 276 (R.I. 1991). 5', 'Rule 701 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence provides:', '“If the witness is not testifying as an expert, the witness’ testimony', 'in the form of opinions is limited to those opinions which are (A)', 'rationally based on the perception of the witness and (B) helpful to', 'a clear understanding of the witness’ testimony or the', 'determination of a fact in issue.” 6', 'Rule 803(4) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence provides:', '“The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule, even though', 'the declarant is available as a witness: * * * [s]tatements made for', 'purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment and describing medical', 'history, or past or present symptoms, pain, or sensations, or the', 'inception or general character of the cause or external source', 'thereof insofar as reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment,', 'but not including statements made to a physician consulted solely', 'for the purposes of preparing for litigation or obtaining testimony', 'for trial.”', '- 10 -', 'At trial, Boutin-Gammon testified as a nonexpert witness about her opinion and the recommendations that she reached after extensively interviewing Jennifer over the course of several months.', 'Boutin-Gammon’s testimony described what she observed during her encounters with the child and her rational opinions drawn from those observations. We cannot conclude that the Family Court justice abused her discretion by admitting Boutin-Gammon’s testimony—especially in view of the fact that the Family Court justice accorded little weight to this evidence, opting to place greater weight on the testimony of Grinnell and Dunn. Because this was a nonjury proceeding, there was little risk that Boutin-Gammon’s opinion might invade the jury’s fact-finding role; accordingly, the Family Court justice did not abuse her discretion in permitting this witness to testify. See In re Corryn B., 914 A.2d 978, 984 (R.I. 2007) (observing that “trial justices presiding over nonjury trials * * * possess the wisdom, training and experience necessary to sort through [evidence] and consider only the aspects that are ‘reliable and probative of the issues relating to the [parent’s] conduct.’” (quoting In re Stephanie, 660 A.2d 260, 261 (R.I. 1995))).', 'In regard to respondent’s argument that Boutin-Gammon’s testimony recounting Jennifer’s disclosures should have been excluded as hearsay under Rule 803(4), again we perceive no error. In In re Jessica C., 690 A.2d 1357 (R.I. 1997), we clearly articulated that statements made for the purposes of medical diagnoses or treatment do not have to be made to a physician but may be made “to any person, such as a hospital attendant, ambulance driver, or even a family member, provided they are made for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment.” Id. at 1363 (quoting Rule 803 Advisory Committee’s note at 1165) (holding that a child’s hearsay statements disclosing abuse, made during counseling sessions, were admissible pursuant to Rule 803(4)). In that case, we concluded that a child’s statements to her therapist were helpful in', '- 11 - determining whether the child had been sexually abused, and, therefore, the therapist’s testimony recounting the child’s statements was properly admitted under Rule 803(4). In re Jessica C., 690 A.2d at 1363; see also In re Jean Marie W., 559 A.2d 625, 630 (R.I. 1989) (holding that a child’s statements to a social worker detailing alleged incidents of sexual assault are admissible as pertinent to diagnosis and treatment). We have never been hypercritical in our interpretation of Rule 803(4), and we decline respondent’s invitation to narrow our prior holdings on this occasion.', 'Evidentiary Rulings', 'The respondent avers that the Family Court justice abused her discretion in construing § 14-1-69 as precluding the out-of-court statements that Emilee made to her former preschool teacher, Elizabeth O’Loughlin (O’Loughlin).7 “It is well established that ‘the admissibility of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial justice, and this Court will not interfere with the trial justice[’]s decision unless a clear abuse of that discretion is apparent.’” Notarantonio v. Notarantonio, 941 A.2d 138, 149 (R.I. 2008) (quoting DiPetrillo v. Dow Chemical Co., 729 A.2d 677, 690 (R.I. 1999)); see also State v. Ruffner, 911 A.2d 680, 689 (R.I. 2006) (“The admission of a statement under an exception to the hearsay rule is within the sound discretion of the trial 7', 'General Laws 1956 § 14-1-69, provides as follows:', '“In any custody and/or termination trial and/or a hearing on a', 'motion or probable cause hearing where a petition has been filed', 'by [DCYF] in accordance with §§ 14-1-11, 40-11-7 and/or 15-7-7', 'in the [F]amily [C]ourt, the court may, in its discretion, permit as', 'evidence any statement by a child under the age of thirteen (13)', 'years old about a prescribed act of abuse, neglect, or misconduct', 'by a parent or guardian, if that statement was made spontaneously', 'within a reasonable time after the act is alleged to have occurred,', 'and if the statement was made to someone the child would', 'normally turn to for sympathy, protection, or advice.”', '- 12 - justice and shall not be overturned unless clearly erroneous.” (quoting State v. Lynch, 854 A.2d 1022, 1038 (R.I. 2004))).', 'It appears that, during a chance meeting, Emilee made a spontaneous disclosure to O’Loughlin, indicating that Rachel had coached her daughter into making accusations by showing her a pornographic movie. The Family Court justice refused to admit the testimony, concluding that it constituted hearsay within hearsay.8 The respondent, however, argues that Jennifer’s statements to Emilee and Emilee’s statements to O’Loughlin both qualified as exceptions to the hearsay rule permitted under § 14-1-69.', 'Section 14-1-69 is “a statutory exception to the hearsay rule that applies to disputes involving custody and/or termination of parental rights.” In re Deborah M., 544 A.2d 572, 574 (R.I. 1988). Although this Court employs a liberal construction of § 14-1-69, we have delineated three criteria necessary to ensure the reliability of such statements: “that the child communicate the statements concerning physical [and sexual] abuse (1) spontaneously, (2) within a reasonable time after the alleged act(s) of abuse occurred, and (3) to a trusted adult.” In re Alexis L., 972 A.2d 159, 166 (R.I. 2009) (citing In re Rocco W., 706 A.2d 1302, 1303 (R.I. 1998); In re Veronica T., 700 A.2d at 1367).', 'In the event that Emilee’s statements to O’Loughlin had been limited to communications concerning physical and sexual abuse, the statements may have fulfilled the reliability prongs of § 14-1-69. However, Emilee’s statements related to the alleged motive underlying Jennifer’s disclosures and were properly stricken by the Family Court justice as inadmissible hearsay, not conforming with § 14-1-69. See Mallett, 600 A.2d at 278 (“When a hearsay statement includes 8', 'Rule 805 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence provides: “Hearsay included within hearsay is not excluded under the hearsay rule if each part of the combined statements conforms with an exception to the hearsay rule provided in these rules.”', '- 13 - within it additional hearsay, each layer of hearsay must conform with an exception-to-the- hearsay rule in order to be admissible at trial.”).', 'Furthermore, Jennifer’s alleged statements, as reported by Emilee to O’Loughlin, fail to comply with the third requirement that the disclosures of abuse be made to a trusted adult. See In re Veronica T., 700 A.2d at 1367 (stating that, to be admissible, a child’s out-of-court statements concerning physical and sexual abuse “must have been communicated spontaneously to a trusted adult”). Because the statements were not statements of abuse made to a trusted adult, they lack the level of reliability necessary to meet the hearsay exception of § 14-1-69. See In re Veronica T., 700 A.3d at 1367. Accordingly, Emilee’s statements to O’Loughlin were properly rejected by the Family Court justice.', 'Nevertheless, Emilee’s statements to O’Loughlin—that Jennifer’s accusations were fabricated—were admitted through Dunn’s testimony, thus rendering O’Loughlin’s testimony “cumulative and of minimal significance.” Mallett, 600 A.2d at 277 (“When the evidence admitted is ‘cumulative and of minimal significance,’ then the error is harmless.” (quoting Clarke v. Ellerthorpe, 552 A.2d 1186, 1188 (R.I. 1989))); see also Notarantonio, 941 A.2d at 149 (declining to disturb the trial justice’s ruling in excluding testimony where “at best the excluded testimony was cumulative”). Thus, any purported error by the Family Court justice undoubtedly was harmless. See State v. Marr, 731 A.2d 690, 693 (R.I. 1999) (concluding that mother’s hearsay testimony about what her son told her about sexual molestation was harmless error when son also testified to those facts).', 'We briefly pass on a separate evidentiary ruling with which respondent takes issue—that the trial justice abused her discretion by denying respondent’s midtrial motion to undertake a videotaped deposition of an out-of-state expert in order to present that testimony at trial. “[A]', '- 14 - trial court has broad discretion in deciding discovery matters, and a decision to allow or deny discovery is reviewable only for abuse of discretion[.]” Cardi v. Medical Homes of Rhode Island, 741 A.2d 278, 278-89 (R.I. 1999) (mem.) (citing Bashforth v. Zampini, 576 A.2d 1197 (R.I. 1990)). Without commenting on the merits of respondent’s request to engage in further discovery six months after the commencement of trial and two months after DCYF had rested its case in chief, we simply conclude that the Family Court justice in no way abused her discretion by denying respondent’s motion to pause the trial in order for respondent to depose an out-of- state witness who was not disclosed beforehand to opposing counsel. See id.; see also Dawkins v. Siwicki, 22 A.3d 1142, 1154 (R.I. 2011) (“When the trial justice’s discretion has been soundly and judicially exercised, in light of the facts and circumstances confronting the court and the parties, the decision will not be disturbed on appeal.” (citing Morra v. Harrop, 791 A.2d 472, 476-77 (R.I. 2002))). Moreover, the trial justice did not wholly reject the proffered testimony of respondent’s witness; she only denied respondent’s request to use a video deposition in lieu of live testimony, citing the benefits of in-court testimony. Accordingly, respondent’s suggestion that this Court remand the case for additional testimony is unavailing where respondent’s failure to timely depose his intended witness, make an offer of proof of the anticipated testimony, or otherwise have the witness testify in person is of no fault other than his own.', 'The Findings of the Family Court', 'The respondent argues that DCYF failed to meet its burden of proof with respect to establishing that Jennifer and Emilee were abused and neglected. Specifically, respondent avers that there is no evidence to support the finding that Emilee was abused and that the evidence in regard to abuse and neglect of Jennifer was “contradictory, compromised, and anything but clear and convincing.” In addition, respondent contends that the Family Court justice overlooked or', '- 15 - misconceived material evidence in making her decision.', 'The respondent’s arguments are unavailing.', 'The burden carried by DCYF in cases involving child abuse is that of clear and convincing evidence. See In re Veronica T., 700 A.2d at 1368 (“A determination that a child has been abused ‘shall be made upon clear and convincing evidence.’” (quoting Rule 17(b) of the Family Court Rules of Juvenile Proceedings)). “The clear-and-convincing standard requires that the factfinder form a ‘clear conviction without hesitancy of the truth of the precise facts.’” Id. (quoting Parker v. Parker, 103 R.I. 435, 442, 238 A.2d 57, 61 (1968)). Although the clear and convincing standard is significant—requiring the truth of the precise facts to be “highly probable”—it is not a burden of insurmountable proportion. Id. (quoting Parker, 103 R.I. at 442, 238 A.2d at 61). It is, however, a higher standard of proof than that of a fair preponderance of the evidence but less than that required for proof beyond a reasonable doubt. See State v. Fuller- Balletta, 996 A.2d 133, 141-42 (R.I. 2010) (“[C]lear and convincing evidence means more than a mere exercise in semantics.', 'It is a degree of proof different from a satisfaction by a preponderance of the evidence which is the recognized burden in civil actions and from proof beyond a reasonable doubt which is the required burden in criminal suits.’” (quoting Parker, 103 R.I. at 442, 238 A.2d at 60-61)).', 'The testimony of a single witness, if believed, is sufficient to sustain a jury verdict in a criminal case and, thus, is certainly capable of supporting a finding of fact by clear and convincing evidence.

We have never recognized a requirement that a court wait until a child is actually harmed before the child is afforded protection. See In re Lester, 417 A.2d at 881. Rather, “[t]he state’s role in protecting children may properly be preventive of harm as well as remedial.” Id.

In the face of the deeply disturbing testimony with which the Family Court justice was confronted, and which she found to be credible, her finding of abuse as to Emilee was appropriate.

The Family Court justice weighed both Jennifer’s recantations and Emilee’s statements that Jennifer had fabricated the stories of abuse; and concluded that “it is * * * not unusual for a victim to recant.” It was within her province to so hold. See In re Veronica T., 700 A.2d at 1368 (affirming a Family Court justice’s findings of abuse where the Family Court justice considered the “possible motive for the child to change her story to keep the father with her family,” yet still found the child’s initial statements of abuse “to be more credible than the child’s belated efforts to blame her uncle for the abuse”).', 'The Family Court justice deliberated over Rachel’s motive and the possibility that the source of Jennifer’s knowledge was a pornographic movie and rejected both prospects, stating “[t]his court does not think for one moment that the pornographic movie depicting lesbian acts as described by [Jennifer] could be misconstrued when [Jennifer] described her father’s unit, holding it, and having him pee white on her.

The Family Court justice determined that the child’s disclosures to Grinnell, a trusted adult and the first person to whom the child turned, were “done in such a way, in circumstances that made them reliable and trustworthy.” Her testimony, recounting the disclosures made to her by four-year-old Jennifer, was “exact as to the crucial elements” and, even unaccompanied by the other corroborative testimony, was sufficient to establish that Jennifer had been sexually abused by respondent.

The voluminous transcripts, exhibits, and memoranda in this case reflect the extensive psychological trauma Jennifer endured while in the care of her father.

On March 7, 2012, a petition for dependency and abuse was filed ex parte against both parents in Rhode Island, where Malachii resided, and respondent was charged in Massachusetts with felony crimes arising from the alleged assault. A no-contact order was issued on March 14, 2012 and entered on April 26, 2012, which prohibited respondent from having any contact with Malachii.2 On September 27, 2013, respondent was convicted in Massachusetts by a jury of reckless endangerment of a child and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. He was sentenced to serve three to five years in prison, followed by a two- and-one-half-year probationary term. A second no-contact order was issued in Massachusetts after respondent’s conviction.

The respondent remained incarcerated in Massachusetts, and the trial was conducted telephonically to afford him the opportunity to participate. At trial, the Family Court justice heard testimony from Barbara Silvia (Silvia), the social caseworker assigned to Malachii’s case. She testified that she did not have any contact with respondent because he was incarcerated outside of Rhode Island from the inception of the case in 2012. Silvia detailed that she planned to prepare and discuss a case plan with respondent once he was released from prison because “he can’t put services in place with providers while', '“(2) The parent is unfit by reason of conduct or conditions', 'seriously detrimental to the child; such as * * *', '“(i) Institutionalization of the parent,', 'including imprisonment, for a duration as to', 'render it improbable for the parent to care', 'for the child for an extended period of time;', '“***', '“(4) The parent has abandoned or deserted the child.

Although she was aware of respondent’s criminal convictions for abusing his son, she did not know when respondent would be released from prison.6', 'She was informed that “upon release he could have no unsupervised contact with children under the age of [fourteen], and could not reside in the house with children under the age of [fourteen].” Due to the circumstances, including respondent’s status as a child abuser, Silvia testified that respondent “was not a parent that [DCYF was] looking to reunify with at the time.” The respondent acknowledged his convictions during his testimony as well,7 citing his incarceration and the no-contact orders as justification for why he failed to provide support for his son.', 'Silvia testified that respondent did write two letters.8 The first letter was sent to the Family Court on August 9, 2012, in which respondent requested a paternity test.9 Silvia stated that she arranged for the test to be conducted; the results, which confirmed respondent’s paternity of Malachii, were received on October 17, 2013.

The respondent asked that Malachii be placed with respondent’s parents, who reside in Massachusetts. Silvia testified that she met briefly with respondent’s mother and his brother, but Malachii already was residing in a preadoptive home and his mother had consented to an open adoption by the foster parents.', 'The Family Court justice issued a written decision on January 5, 2015, and ordered the termination of respondent’s parental rights to Malachii. The Family Court justice summarized the testimony of Silvia and respondent and took judicial notice of the no-contact order issued in Rhode Island. She began by addressing respondent’s procedural arguments relating to service of process and his arraignment, rejecting both. Specifically, the Family Court justice was satisfied after reviewing the summons, hearing the testimony, as well as noting counsel’s presence at trial and his invoice for services rendered, that respondent had notice of the termination petition and was adequately represented by counsel.', 'Turning to the merits of the petition, the Family Court justice found that respondent had been incarcerated continuously from March 2012 for inflicting physical abuse on his child. She explicitly acknowledged that incarceration alone is not grounds for termination of parental rights; however, she concluded that, here, respondent’s incarceration was a “direct result of inflicting physical abuse on the child.” The Family Court justice found that, despite the no-contact orders, respondent did not make any attempt to seek visitation, case plan, or enroll in any services', '-6- offered at the correctional facility where he was housed. These findings, coupled with the length of incarceration and the fact that respondent had not seen his son in more than two years, led the Family Court justice to conclude that respondent would be unable to care for Malachii for an extended period of time. In discussing DCYF’s reasonable efforts, the Family Court justice recognized that Silvia faced multiple hurdles due to respondent’s out-of-state incarceration and the no-contact orders, concluding that “DCYF made what reasonable efforts it could make based on the situation [respondent] put himself in.”', 'Alternatively, the Family Court justice found that respondent’s parental rights could be terminated on the basis that he abandoned Malachii, declaring that the uncontradicted evidence—as well as respondent’s own admission—demonstrated that respondent had had no contact with his son since March 2012. She also recognized that respondent provided no financial or emotional support for Malachii.', 'A decree terminating respondent’s parental rights to Malachii was entered in the Family Court on February 5, 2015.

(quoting In re Jazlyn P., 31 A.3d at 1279).', 'Analysis', 'Before this Court, respondent presents a plethora of arguments, many of which are without merit and can be summarily addressed. The respondent claims that many of the Family Court justice’s factual findings were clearly erroneous. For instance, he points to the finding that the paternity testing was requested because respondent contested paternity; respondent professes that he requested paternity to establish his rights. It is, however, undisputed that this incarcerated parent requested a paternity test to verify the one fact that a paternity test discloses—whether he is the child’s father.', 'The respondent also maintains that he never received these results; however, Silvia testified that she forwarded the results to the Family Court, and the record discloses that respondent wrote to Silvia less than a month later asking that the child be placed with his family. Regardless, respondent’s receipt of the results is immaterial to the Family Court justice’s findings.', 'Additionally, respondent claims that a certified copy of his conviction was not produced at trial. We are satisfied that this circumstance is not material because neither ground for termination required proof of conviction, and the conviction was corroborated by Silvia’s and respondent’s testimony. See §§ 15-7-7(a)(2)(i); 15-7-7(a)(4). The respondent also posits that the', '-8- return of service was neither stamped nor notarized and that he was not arraigned on the petition. However, a careful review of the record reveals that respondent was never found in default; that he was represented by counsel throughout the pendency of the termination petition; and that he was afforded an opportunity to participate at the trial telephonically. See In re Jonathan P., 819 A.2d 198, 201 (R.I. 2003) (“[A]n incarcerated parent defending against a petition for termination of parental rights need only be afforded reasonable participation in that hearing.”). We are satisfied that these arguments are immaterial to the outcome of the case.', 'Of the issues meriting further analysis, respondent argues that the Family Court justice erroneously found that he was unable to care for his son for an extended period of time due to his imprisonment and, alternatively, that he abandoned Malachii. Specifically, respondent claims that he was not advised about Malachii’s status and that his incarceration and the no-contact orders prevented him from providing support to the child. With respect to his incarceration as a ground for termination, respondent contends that DCYF failed to establish that it made reasonable efforts to strengthen the parental relationship between respondent and Malachii, as required by § 15-7-7(b)(1). Because we are of the opinion that the Family Court justice correctly concluded that respondent abandoned his son, we need not address § 15-7-7(a)(2)(i) as an additional basis for termination. See In re Rita F., 64 A.3d 1220, 1231 n.12 (R.I. 2013).', 'Abandonment', 'Section 15-7-7(a)(4) provides for the termination of parental rights if “[t]he parent has abandoned or deserted the child.” “A lack of communication or contact with the child for at least a six (6) month period shall constitute prima facie evidence of abandonment or desertion.” Id. “Such lack of communication does not have to be willful on the part of the parent.” In re Shanelly C., 785 A.2d 1129, 1131 (R.I. 2001) (citing In re Craig G., 765 A.2d 1200, 1202 (R.I.', '-9- 2001)). The trial justice’s findings on abandonment were supported by extensive evidence in the record that respondent had no contact with Malachii for more than two years and minimal contact with DCYF concerning his son.', 'The respondent concedes that he did not have contact with his son for the presumptive six-month period; however, he argues that he was legally prevented from having contact or providing support. It is manifest in this record that respondent made no attempt to contact his son or to seek visitation by moving for a modification of the no-contact orders. We are not persuaded by respondent’s attempt to shift the blame in this case. The fact that respondent was incarcerated and subject to the no-contact orders is solely attributable to respondent’s physical abuse of his son. The trial justice found that respondent had had no contact with Malachii since March 2012, well beyond the six-month statutory period for presumptive abandonment. Although respondent was incarcerated and there were no-contact orders in place, these conditions are not foreign to our analysis. In In re Damien M., 819 A.2d 213 (R.I. 2003) (mem.), a father claimed that he did not have contact with his son because he feared that he would violate a no-contact order with the mother. Id. at 214. This Court nonetheless affirmed the trial justice’s finding that the father abandoned his son as the father never made an attempt to seek visitation, concluding that “the father’s actions spoke louder than his words regarding his intention to develop a relationship with his son.” Id.', 'Likewise, “[t]his Court repeatedly has held that incarceration is not an excuse for failure to maintain contact with one’s child for the statutory period.” In re Brook Ann R., 994 A.2d 1241, 1244 (R.I. 2010) (citing In re Serenity K., 891 A.2d 881, 884 (R.I. 2005)). “[I]t is ‘the parent, not DCYF, whose children are in the care of an authorized agency [who] is responsible to substantially and repeatedly maintain contact with the children.’” In re Amanda D., 918 A.2d', '- 10 - 220, 224 (R.I. 2007) (quoting In re Shaylon J., 782 A.2d 1140, 1143 (R.I. 2001)); see also In re Serenity K., 891 A.2d at 884 (“[A] parent in this jurisdiction, incarcerated though he or she may be, ‘can abandon a child by not actively engaging in efforts to contact that child, despite having opportunities to do so.’” (quoting In re DeKarri P., 787 A.2d 1170, 1172 (R.I. 2001))). Therefore, neither respondent’s incarceration nor the no-contact orders relieved respondent of his obligation to remain in contact with his son.10', 'Furthermore, this Court “has no tolerance for a parent ‘who makes halfhearted or no attempts to visit or contact his or her child within the six-month statutory time period * * *.’” In re Abby D., 839 A.2d 1222, 1225 (R.I. 2004) (quoting In re DeKarri P., 787 A.2d at 1172). Here, in a two-and-one-half-year period, respondent wrote but two letters inquiring about Malachii—the first of which demanded a paternity test.11 That letter, written in August 2012, reveals that respondent was aware of DCYF’s involvement—“This issue got [Malachii] taken away by DC[Y]F.” However, respondent did not contact DCYF again until November 2013, more than a year later. The record is devoid of proof that respondent made any other efforts to 10', 'The dissent suggests that a no-contact order relieves the parent of his responsibility to remain in contact with the child. Imposition of no-contact orders to protect the child after a violent, parent-child attack does not toll the running of the six-month prima facie time period for abandonment. Nor should the fact of incarceration for a violent assault upon one’s child standing alone serve as evidence to rebut the prima facie showing of abandonment. While the dissent likewise takes issue with our description of the incident as a “violent, parent-child attack,” we note that respondent was convicted by a jury in Massachusetts of reckless endangerment of a child and assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon. 11', 'Although the dissent appears to credit respondent’s testimony that he only requested a paternity test “to establish his rights to his son so that he could place Malachii with his family[,]” this single request is insufficient evidence to rebut a prima facie showing of abandonment, especially when the child was already happily living in a preadoptive home. Cf. In re Serenity K., 891 A.2d 881, 885 (R.I. 2006) (affirming that four or five attempts to contact DCYF and arrange visits over a nineteen-month period were insufficient to rebut the prima facie showing of abandonment).', '- 11 - inquire into his son’s welfare.12 Although respondent requested a paternity test, placement with his family, and appointment of his mother as Malachii’s legal guardian, he never sought visitation, modification of the no-contact orders, or other updates, save for the paternity test. A fair reading of respondent’s letters suggests that he cared for the child; however, we have previously held that “§ 15-7-7(a)(4)[] does not include the element of willfulness to show abandonment.” In re Craig G., 765 A.2d at 1202. Moreover, respondent did not support Malachii in any way, either financially or emotionally. Many a birthday and Christmas passed without so much as an inquiry about his child.', 'We recognize that the respondent was faced with minimal options; nonetheless, we cannot ignore the fact that the respondent’s behavior toward his son has placed him in this position. As the Family Court justice explicitly acknowledged, the respondent’s “incarceration was a direct result of inflicting physical abuse on the child.” We decline to lower the threshold required to rebut the prima facie period of abandonment for this particular respondent because of the scarce options available when that situation lies squarely at his feet. DCYF has no obligation to undertake reasonable efforts to strengthen the parental bond or to reunify, when a parent is deemed unfit on the basis of abandonment. Section 15-7-7(b)(1). Accordingly, the lack of contact and communication falls squarely with the respondent. The record clearly indicates that the respondent had the addresses for both the Family Court and DCYF, and he was also represented by counsel in Massachusetts. Yet, despite additional opportunities, the respondent made but two attempts to communicate with DCYF and utterly failed to seek contact with his child. Therefore, we are satisfied that the Family Court justice properly held that the respondent 12', 'The 2012 letter did direct that the recipient forward any questions or updates to an address in New Bedford, Massachusetts. However, this request appeared immediately after the contact information for respondent’s then-attorney and appears to relate to correspondence arising out of the paternity test, not Malachii’s welfare in general.', '- 12 - abandoned Malachii because he had had no meaningful contact with his son since March 2012. See In re Shanelly C., 785 A.2d at 1132 (concluding that sending clothes, books, and candy was “indirect contact indicative of an unwillingness to promote and further the parent-child relationship”).', 'Conclusion', 'For these reasons, the respondent’s appeal is denied and dismissed. The decree of the Family Court terminating the parental rights of the respondent is affirmed. The papers in this case are remanded to the Family Court.', 'Justice Flaherty, dissenting. I respectfully dissent from the holding of the majority in this case. I do so because it is my opinion that the respondent has sufficiently rebutted the prima facie evidence of abandonment, thereby triggering an obligation for the Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) to prove that he abandoned his child by clear and convincing evidence. In my view, this has not been done.', 'There is no doubt that respondent was confronted by substantial obstacles that stood in the way of contacting his son. He was incarcerated in another state and was apparently moved from facility to facility. Indeed, DCYF, with all its impressive resources, found it difficult to locate respondent, even for the purpose of serving him with process after it filed its termination case.', 'The majority holds that respondent abandoned his son because he did not adequately maintain contact with Malachii over the course of roughly two years. While it is true that there was a paucity of contact initiated by respondent, it is extremely significant that he was barred from contacting Malachii, and the state agency that had custody of Malachii never contacted', '- 13 - respondent. Notwithstanding his incarceration and the other legal barriers to communication, respondent did make two efforts, through DCYF, to reunify Malachii with his family. In light of this, and after carefully reviewing the record, I conclude that the trial justice erred, that respondent has rebutted the prima facie inference of abandonment, and that his unfitness by means of abandonment was not proven by clear and convincing evidence.', 'We have long recognized that “[n]atural parents have a fundamental liberty interest in the care, custody, and management of their child that does not evaporate if they are not model parents or have lost temporary custody of their child.” In re Antonio G., 657 A.2d 1052, 1057 (R.I. 1995) (citing Santosky v.

The “rights to the custody, care, and nurturing of a child first reside with the parents, and ‘until the [s]tate proves parental unfitness, the child and his parents share a vital interest in preventing erroneous termination of their natural relationship.’” In re Kristen B., 558 A.2d 200, 203 (R.I. 1989) (quoting Santosky, 455 U.S. at 760). The state has the ultimate burden of proving unfitness by clear and convincing evidence. General Laws 1956 § 15-7-7(a).', 'Although the trial justice terminated respondent’s parental rights on the bases of abandonment and institutionalization, the majority affirms the Family Court’s finding of unfitness solely on the basis of abandonment. As the majority correctly notes, DCYF is not required to make reasonable efforts at reunification before the agency institutes termination proceedings on grounds of abandonment. Section 15-7-7(a)(4), (b)(1). The state may also present prima facie evidence of abandonment by proving that more than six months have passed during which a parent did not contact his or her child. Section 15-7-7(a)(4).', 'Here, respondent did not contest the fact that he had not seen Malachii for a period in excess of six months. Nonetheless, it bears noting that the state bore a heavier burden in proving', '- 14 - the ultimate fact of unfitness than respondent did in producing some evidence to rebut the state’s basic prima facie showing. See § 15-7-7(a).1', 'In my view, respondent rebutted the prima facie evidence of abandonment when he demonstrated that he was legally and practically precluded from contacting his son during the time in which the state claims he abandoned Malachii. It should go without saying that DCYF had a unique ability to increase the prospects for family reunification, slight as they may have been, during the relevant time period because the child was in its custody. Rather than explore those prospects for reunification, however, DCYF foreclosed them. It is my opinion that the events leading up to the Family Court’s termination decree leads to the inevitable conclusion that the agency helped “to shape the historical events that form[ed] the basis for termination.” Santosky, 455 U.S. at 763.', 'The respondent lost custody of Malachii following a violent domestic altercation in March 2012, in which his then ten-month-old son was injured. Shortly thereafter, the Family Court issued a no-contact order, an order that remains in effect to this day.', 'That order unequivocally bars respondent from contacting Malachii.', 'For his part, respondent requested a paternity test in August 2012. The respondent said that he requested the test to establish his rights to his son so that he could place Malachii with his family. In September 2013, respondent was convicted of reckless endangerment of a child and 1', 'It is well settled that “[t]he burden of [proof] never shifts” although “the ‘burden of going forward’ with the evidence * * * shifts from party to party as the case progresses.” Murphy v. O’Neill, 454 A.2d 248, 250 (R.I. 1983). We have defined prima facie evidence as “that amount of evidence that, if unrebutted, is sufficient to satisfy the burden of proof on a particular issue.” Paramount Office Supply Co. v. D.A. MacIsaac, Inc., 524 A.2d 1099, 1101 (R.I. 1987) (citing Nocera v. Lembo, 121 R.I. 216, 397 A.2d 524 (1979)) (emphasis added). Accordingly, while the state’s prima facie evidence of abandonment shifted a burden of production to respondent, he was capable of shifting the ultimate burden of proof back onto the state by producing some rebuttal evidence. Thereafter, the state was required to prove abandonment by clear and convincing evidence in light of all the evidence. See Murphy, 454 A.2d at 250.', '- 15 - assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, for which he received a sentence of three to five years with two-and-a-half years of probation.', 'Armed with the no-contact order, DCYF then unilaterally determined that it would not attempt to reunify respondent with his son. Malachii’s caseworker testified that “[b]ecause there was a no-contact order in place between [respondent] and the child, * * * he was not a parent that we were looking to reunify * * *.”', 'A month after respondent had begun to serve his sentence, his paternity was verified. The respondent then sent a letter to Malachii’s caseworker asking that Malachii be placed with his grandparents and for respondent’s mother to be appointed as Malachii’s legal guardian. Shortly thereafter, DCYF instituted proceedings to terminate respondent’s parental rights.2', 'It is significant that, for some reason, the state opted not to charge respondent with unfitness on the ground of cruelty to a child, even though he had been criminally punished for the child’s injuries. Section 15-7-7(a)(2)(ii).3 Nonetheless, it seems obvious to me that the criminal conviction in Massachusetts plainly influenced the decisions of the majority of this Court and the trial judge, whose finding of abandonment was supported by evidence that “the lack of contact was a direct result of the actions of [respondent] against [Malachii].” It is my opinion that, perhaps as a result of his criminal conviction, the majority placed too high a burden 2', 'Malachii’s caseworker received respondent’s letter in January 2014, after termination proceedings had begun, and the caseworker determined that, in light of Malachii’s mother’s voluntary relinquishment of parental rights, Malachii was better off in preadoptive care. 3', 'Respectfully, it is my opinion that the majority takes a liberal, even expansive, view of the record when it describes respondent’s actions toward Malachii as a “violent, parent-child attack.” No witness testimony justifies such a description. The respondent contended that the abuse conviction was based on his having dropped the child during the course of a physical confrontation with the mother. In any event, what actually happened during the incident leading up to respondent’s conviction is completely irrelevant to the finding of abandonment.', '- 16 - of production on respondent to demonstrate that he did not abandon his child and allowed the state to sustain its burden of proving abandonment by less than clear and convincing evidence.', 'This is so because the majority implicitly turns respondent’s rebuttal evidence against him by treating his conviction, the time he served for his crime, and his compliance with no- contact orders as indications that he abandoned Malachii.', 'The majority then categorizes respondent as an absentee, holding him to the general rule that an incarcerated parent must maintain substantial contact with his child in order to avoid termination of parental rights. See In re Amanda D., 918 A.2d 220, 224 (R.I. 2007).', 'There is ample support in our case law for the proposition that an incarcerated parent “can abandon a child by not actively engaging in efforts to contact that child, despite having opportunities to do so.” In re DeKarri P., 787 A.2d 1170, 1172 (R.I. 2001) (emphasis added). I am, however, unable to discover a single case in which we have affirmed a judgment for termination on grounds of abandonment where an incarcerated parent’s opportunities for contact were so palpably limited.', 'The abandonment cases upon which the majority relies almost invariably hinge on the fact that an incarcerated father missed parenting opportunities by “turn[ing] a deaf ear on DCYF’s efforts to help facilitate contact” or failing to coordinate prison visitations. In re DeKarri P., 787 A.2d at 1172; see, e.g., In re Amanda D., 918 A.2d at 224; In re Serenity K., 891 A.2d 881, 884 (R.I. 2006); In re Cody F., 766 A.2d 937, 938 (R.I. 2001). Addressing the no- contact order at issue in this case, the majority reasons that blind compliance with a no-contact order cannot overcome the prima facie evidence of abandonment. However, the case upon which the majority relies involves a no-contact order between a father and mother and it does not establish a sweeping categorical rule. In re Damien M., 819 A.2d 213, 214 (R.I. 2003) (mem.).', '- 17 - There, the father was legally barred from contacting his wife but not his son and, despite having opportunities to coordinate prison visitations, he saw his son only once over the course of a six- year period. Id. Therefore, I cannot accept that In re Damien M. provides a rational foundation for the majority’s opinion.', 'Perhaps another parent may have been wise enough to seek modifications of the no- contact orders and may have written more letters to DCYF and the Family Court. In using respondent’s failure to do so as evidence of abandonment, however, the majority imposes a requirement of assiduousness and sophistication that goes beyond what our precedent demands. See In re Angelina T., 996 A.2d 623, 627 (R.I. 2010); In re DeKarri P., 787 A.2d at 1172. Further, the majority’s seizure of respondent’s failure to form a case plan as evidence of abandonment is both absent from the trial judge’s decision and utterly unfounded. Case planning is a statutory responsibility of DCYF, and is an endeavor about which respondent was likely unaware. See In re Natalya C., 946 A.2d 198, 204 (R.I. 2008) (“As we expect a doctor, not his patient, to prescribe medicine to treat the patient’s illnesses, we also expect DCYF to fashion effective case plans to enable reunification between parents and children.”).', 'It is undeniably troubling that respondent made but two attempts over the course of two years to connect Malachii with his family, but I believe that his efforts were sufficient to rebut the presumption of abandonment. Accordingly, it is my view that the majority should have given more weight to the fact that any possibility of repeated contact was severely hindered. Notably, in declining to adopt a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard for parental termination cases, the United States Supreme Court said that “[a] standard of proof that by its very terms demands consideration of the quantity, rather than the quality, of the evidence may misdirect the factfinder in the marginal case.” Santosky, 455 U.S. at 764.', '- 18 -', 'It also bears noting that, in affirming the Family Court’s termination decree on the basis of abandonment, the majority did not deem it necessary to address the court’s finding of unfitness on the basis of institutionalization under § 15-7-7(a)(2)(i). To terminate respondent’s parental rights on that ground, the Family Court was required to find as a fact that DCYF made reasonable efforts to reunify respondent with his son.', 'Section 15-7-7(a)(2)(i), (b)(1). Specifically, DCYF was required to “encourage and strengthen the parental relationship so that the child [could] safely return to the family.” Section 15-7-7(b)(1). Moreover, the agency was required to prove that it made reasonable efforts at reunification “[r]egardless of the unlikelihood for success” until it filed a termination petition. In re Christopher B., 823 A.2d 301, 315 (R.I. 2003) (quoting In re Joseph S., 788 A.2d 475, 477-78 (R.I. 2002)).', 'With respect to the second ground for termination, it is my opinion that DCYF failed to prove unfitness on the basis of institutionalization because it cannot be disputed that the agency plainly and by design made no efforts to reunite Malachii with his incarcerated father. See In re Natalya C., 946 A.2d at 203. Because the only caseworker assigned to Malachii conceded in her testimony that she eschewed any efforts at reunification, a finding of unfitness on grounds of institutionalization cannot be supported.', 'The fact that the respondent was incarcerated in Massachusetts, in my opinion, does not justify a lack of effort on the part of DCYF to fulfill its statutory duty. See In re Alvia K., 909 A.2d 498, 504 (R.I. 2006).', 'For the above reasons I respectfully dissent from the holding of the majority in this case.', '- 19 - STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND', 'PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS', 'SUPREME COURT – CLERK’S OFFICE', 'OPINION COVER SHEET Title of Case', 'In re Malachii O.', 'No. 2015-179-Appeal.

71,"Anne duPont Corbin : v. : Richard Beverley Corbin, III.",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. This case came before the Supreme Court on appeal by the defendant, Richard Beverley Corbin, III (Bev), from an order of the Family Court on two post-final-judgment motions filed by the plaintiff, Anne duPont Corbin. 1', 'The defendant contends that the trial justice erred when she determined that the post-employment compensation that he received from his employer was marital property and therefore her award of 50 percent of it to Anne was also error. Alternatively, the defendant maintains that, should this Court affirm the trial justice’s findings with regard to the post-employment compensation, then in that case the fee that he paid to an attorney for negotiating that compensation should be considered marital debt, of which Anne should pay half. Additionally, the defendant argues that the trial justice erred when she awarded counsel fees to Anne for her prosecution of a motion to modify child support, after she made a specific finding that the defendant did not adequately notify Anne when he regained employment. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Family Court. 1', 'To avoid confusion, we will refer to the parties by their first names. No disrespect is intended.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The parties were married on September 27, 1997. Two children and a decade later, Anne filed for divorce.', 'While divorce proceedings progressed, the parties pursued settlement negotiations that resulted in the signing of a property settlement agreement (PSA) 2 on January 9, 2009. The PSA was incorporated by reference, but not merged, into the Family Court final judgment dated April 9, 2009. Thereafter, both parties filed several post-judgment motions, two of which are the subject of this appeal. After numerous hearings on the various motions were conducted over an extended period of time, the trial justice issued her decision on April 16, 2013, and entered her final order on February 17, 2014. In her seventy-page decision, among other grants and denials, the trial justice granted Anne’s motion to modify child support, awarded her counsel fees, and granted her motion to compel specific performance and/or to adjudge Bev in contempt regarding paragraph 7(E) of the PSA, awarding Anne 50 percent of the $138,937.29 3 amount Bev received from his former employer, Wells Fargo, upon his termination.', 'PSA Negotiations', 'In December 2008, while Bev was bargaining with his employer, he also was negotiating the terms and conditions of a PSA with Anne. On December 30, 2008, after Anne’s counsel provided Bev’s divorce counsel with a draft PSA, Bev’s divorce counsel responded, proposing various changes. Significantly, counsel proposed a change to paragraph 7(E) explaining: 2', 'The parties often refer to this agreement as the marriage settlement agreement, i.e., the MSA. For purposes of accuracy and consistency, we shall refer to this agreement as the property settlement agreement, i.e., the PSA. 3', 'This was the sum after deductions for taxes.', '-2-', '“This paragraph was not discussed and is unacceptable; as you are', 'aware, Kirk v. Kirk has specifically excluded from division in a', 'divorce the recovery of damages for future earnings which exceed', 'the duration of the marriage; any claim which Bev may receive', '(which is apparently highly speculative at this point) is in lieu of', 'future earnings, and will be counted as income for child support', 'purposes but is not divisible as a marital asset. This is', 'distinguishable from the economic benefits earned by Anne at', 'Square Mile, all of which were earned during the marriage, but are', 'deferred in terms of payment. Therefore, subparagraph (e) should', 'be excluded.” Paragraph 7(E) of the final PSA, which was executed on January 9, 2009, articulated:', '“E. Husband’s Wells Fargo Claim.

In addition, he signed a two year nonsolicitation agreement with Acordia. A week later, he signed another document; this one contained a one-year nonsolicitation clause. 4 4', 'Paragraph VIII of the subsequent agreement articulated that “[t]his Agreement supersedes any prior written or verbal agreements pertaining to the subject matter herein.” Effectively, this statement nullified the prior two year noncompete agreement.', '-3-', 'By June 2008 problems began to develop between Bev and Wells Fargo, and as of July 2008, his initial two year employment agreement with Acordia was over. By this time, Bev had engaged the services of an employment attorney to advise him on his rights as an employee.', 'In August 2008 Bev was assigned to work under a new supervisor in another Wells Fargo affiliate. Bev testified that his new supervisor was very hostile to him and made it clear to him that his job was in jeopardy due to his poor performance. Despite those admonitions, Bev received an offer of continued employment in a letter dated August 19, 2008. Nonetheless, conversations regarding the offer of continued employment did not go very well and by September 2008, the parties were unable to come to any sort of agreement as to Bev’s continued employment at Wells Fargo. Consequently, Bev engaged in the Wells Fargo dispute resolution process.', 'To begin that process, Bev sent an email to a Wells Fargo department head on September 17, 2008, requesting a review of his performance and inquiry of the department head about his “fair compensation” for, significantly, 2007 and 2008. In a follow-up email sent to a Wells Fargo human resources employee on September 26, 2008, Bev maintained that he was seeking to be compensated “fairly” for his work. Shortly thereafter, Bev was placed on administrative leave with pay. About a month later, Bev was terminated via a phone call received from the human resources department.', 'Bev then emailed another Wells Fargo human resources employee, again inquiring about the dispute resolution process determination of his compensation for 2007 and 2008. In her response, the human resources employee indicated that the results of the dispute resolution process had already been communicated on the telephone to him, that the inquiry did not substantiate his claims, and that he had been paid what was owed to him in compensation for', '-4- 2007 and 2008. Shortly thereafter, the same human resources employee sent Bev a copy of a departure agreement and release of claims. As part of the agreement, Bev would receive the sum of $175,000.', 'Bev testified that his main concern with the departure agreement was how many nonsolicitation agreements would be incorporated as part of the departure agreement.', 'He maintained that one nonsolicitation agreement provided for a one-year term while another provided for two years. He claimed that he was concerned because the firm, in return for his promise not to compete against it for two years, would be compensating him with only one year’s salary.', 'In response to the receipt of the departure agreement, Bev’s employment attorney sent Wells Fargo’s senior counsel a letter on December 22, 2008. The letter summarized Bev’s tumultuous discharge from Wells Fargo and demanded that Wells Fargo provide Bev with the opportunity to understand the departure agreement. If not provided with that opportunity, then Bev would have “no choice but to bring suit for the full amount he is owed.” The senior counsel sent Bev’s employment attorney a response letter rejecting his claims and extending the deadline for the execution of the departure agreement until January 16, 2009. Through counsel, Bev later corresponded that he was “willing to resolve this matter on terms very similar to those that Wells Fargo ha[d] proposed.” Attached to the email were suggested changes to paragraphs 4(a), 9, and 10 of the departure agreement.', 'On January 21, 2009, after the amount to be paid to Bev in the departure agreement had been negotiated from $175,000 to $218,000, and after it was specified that the one-year nonsolicitation agreement would be incorporated, Bev signed the departure agreement. On February 4, 2009, Wells Fargo sent Bev’s employment attorney the fully executed departure', '-5- agreement, along with a check in the amount of $138,937.29. The check and the departure agreement were mailed by the attorney to Bev on March 4, 2009. Bev testified that he did not deposit the check when he received it because he “did not know what [he] wanted to do with the money at the time” and that “[a]ll the banks * * * were failing.” It is significant, however, that between January 2009 and May 2009, he did deposit a considerable sum of money, $175,000, in his bank account. Those funds came from Anne, who remitted that sum representing his share of the proceeds derived from the sale of their home.', 'Bev’s Employment with EquiSales Associates', 'In April 2009, Bev began working for EquiSales. He received his first paycheck from that company the following month. Anne contended that Bev failed to inform her of his securing new employment, but Bev testified that Anne had received adequate notice of his new employment through the report of the guardian ad litem, through the children’s therapist, and through his own divorce counsel. Specifically, the guardian ad litem’s report indicated that “[d]efendant informed the [g]uardian that he was now working for a consulting company * * *.”', 'Family Court Decision', 'After several days and many hours of hearings, the Family Court rendered its decision in April 2013. In her seventy-page decision, the trial justice made a number of findings of fact. Significantly, the trial justice found that Bev', '“believed that he was entitled to additional compensation for work', 'performed during 2007 and 2008; [Bev’s] Post Final Judgment', 'protests that his dispute with Wells Fargo was not about', 'compensation [was] not credible; Wells Fargo’s offer to settle the', 'employment dispute was for a lump sum of $175,000 and a', 'complete Departure Agreement and not for compensation for', 'future earnings.”', '-6- By finding that the lump sum of $175,000 was not for compensation for future earnings, the trial justice dispelled Bev’s heavy reliance on Kirk v. Kirk, 577 A.2d 976 (R.I. 1990). Indeed, she indicated that the court’s “result [was actually] consistent with the Supreme Court’s holding in Kirk.”', 'Furthermore, the trial justice found that Bev, “his divorce attorney[,] and his employment attorney were in contact prior to the execution of the [P]SA regarding the relationship between the Departure Agreement and divorce issues.” Although she had found that all parties on Bev’s side had been well informed, the trial justice concluded that Bev’s divorce attorney had not advised Anne’s attorney that Bev had indeed received a settlement offer prior to the divorce trial. She said, “[t]here is a limit to what can be considered sharp and shrewd lawyering, especially during negotiations leading to a [property] settlement agreement. In this case, the limit has been exceeded and pushed too far.”', 'With that said, the trial justice held “that the concerted contrivance of language to avoid [p]laintiff’s claim to equitable distribution [was] a distorted and contrived breach of * * * [d]efendant’s fiduciary duty.”', 'With respect to Anne’s motion to modify child support, the trial justice ruled that “[i]n the [P]SA it [was] clear that the parties had agreed that when [Bev] obtained new employment he would notify [Anne] so they could calculate the appropriate child support in accordance with the Child Support Guidelines based on their increased income.” She added “that no other person was named as an intermediary to advise [Anne] of [Bev’s] employment.”', 'Moreover, when Bev was asked when he gave notice to Anne of his new employment, he dodged the question by responding, “[T]hat was done in the process in April when I met with [the guardian ad litem] and [the children’s therapist].” The trial justice found “that the so-called ‘process’ [was] not proper or adequate notice to [Anne] that [Bev] was employed.” Accordingly,', '-7- the trial justice granted both of Anne’s motions. Significantly, in her order, the trial justice specified that Bev was “entitled to a credit of $22,211.25 for his litigation expenses for negotiating the settlement.” However, she concluded that “given the sharp dealing and trickery of prior counsel and [Bev], [Bev] shall not profit therefrom and shall be solely responsible for said expense.” After final judgment was entered, Bev timely appealed.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'It is well established that this Court “will not disturb findings of fact made by a trial justice or magistrate in a divorce action unless he or she has misconceived the relevant evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.”', 'Palin v. Palin, 41 A.3d 248, 253 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Cardinale v. Cardinale, 889 A.2d 210, 217 (R.I. 2006)). Accordingly, “[U]nless it is shown that the trial justice either improperly exercised his or her discretion or that there was an abuse thereof, this Court will not disturb the trial justice’s findings.” Id.

Curry, 987 A.2d 233, 238 (R.I. 2010)).', 'III', 'Analysis', 'On appeal, Bev argues that the trial justice erred when she determined that his post- employment compensation was marital property. He contends that, under prevailing law, the post-employment compensation was nonmarital because Wells Fargo paid it to him as future compensation. Alternatively, Bev maintains that, should this Court affirm the trial justice’s findings, then in that event, the attorney fee that he incurred for negotiating the departure agreement should be considered marital debt, of which Anne should pay half. Additionally, Bev', '-8- claims that the trial justice erred when she awarded counsel fees to Anne for his failure to notify her of his new job because she received timely notice of his new position from the guardian ad litem.', 'The Post-Employment Compensation', 'Black’s Law Dictionary defines “severance pay” as “[m]oney (apart from back wages or salary) that an employer pays to a dismissed employee.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1583 (10th ed. 2014). The definition includes that “[t]he payment may be made in exchange for a release of any claims that the employee might have against the employer.” Id. Here, based on the trial justice’s extensive review of the record, as evidenced by her lengthy decision, she made a finding of fact that the amount Wells Fargo paid Bev was to settle his claims for compensation for 2007 and 2008, i.e., “back wages,” and not for future payments. Because the trial justice found the amount paid to be for compensation from 2007 and 2008, she determined that it was not severance pay.', 'It is undisputed that Bev was an at-will employee at Wells Fargo. Because no reason is required to terminate an at-will employee, an employer has no obligation to pay an at-will employee severance pay if the parties have not created a valid contractual provision for it. See D’Oliveira v. Rare Hospitality International, Inc., 840 A.2d 538, 541 (R.I. 2004) (“[W]e are satisfied that the plaintiff has failed to provide any evidence to establish that [the employer] intended to promise or be bound by an offer to provide severance * * *.”). After reviewing the record, we are satisfied that it is indeed silent about the presence of any Wells Fargo severance policy with respect to Bev’s at-will employment with the company.', 'Furthermore, it is significant to us that the trial justice, after hearing Bev’s testimony and reviewing the documentary evidence, concluded that his testimony was not credible. Weighing a witness’s credibility is within the province of the trial justice. See Zaino v. Zaino, 818 A.2d 630,', '-9- 638 (R.I. 2003) (“We will not disturb a trial justice’s * * * credibility determinations unless he or she overlooked or misconceived material evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.”).', 'Nonetheless, Bev has consistently argued that “a review of the documentary evidence in its entirety show[ed] that [his] separation pay under the departure agreement was precisely that – traditional severance pay which was to serve as a salary substitute for Bev while he searched for a new job and was subject to the one year noncompete clause.” In his brief, Bev cited to numerous cases from other jurisdictions holding that severance pay was nonmarital property. However, the trial justice’s extensive review of the documentary evidence led her to conclude that the post-employment compensation was not severance pay. As a result of the trial justice’s finding that this amount was not severance pay, we need not, and shall not, address whether severance pay is marital property or not, as it is superfluous to our analysis of this appeal. Therefore, we need not discuss the myriad cases cited to in Bev’s brief. After a thorough review of the record, we cannot say that the trial justice overlooked the evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong, and we perceive no error in the trial justice’s reasoning.', 'Because we are affirming the trial justice’s finding that the amount Bev received was marital property, we must briefly address Bev’s alternate argument that the attorney fees he paid for negotiating the departure agreement should be considered marital debt, and that Anne should pay half of it. We do not agree. Although not addressed in any detail in her decision, the trial justice did conclude that Bev should have been “entitled to a credit of $22,211.25 for his litigation expenses for negotiating the settlement.” However, the trial justice also pointed out that, “given the sharp dealing and trickery of prior counsel and [Bev], [Bev] shall not profit therefrom and shall be solely responsible for said expense.” In other words, she correctly considered the amount expended to secure the settlement to be a marital debt but nonetheless', '- 10 - deemed Bev to be undeserving of reimbursement. Given the finding of the trial justice in this case, and her credibility determination, we perceive no error in the trial justice’s decision to withhold the credit claimed by Bev.', 'The Award of Counsel Fees', 'Lastly, it is well settled that “[t]he Family Courts have jurisdiction to award attorney’s fees with respect to petitions for divorce.” Centazzo v.

After considering the record and the arguments raised by the parties, we hold that the trial justice was not clearly wrong, nor did she overlook or misconceive the evidence, when she held that the PSA required Bev to notify his wife personally and directly when he obtained new employment and that he failed to do so.

The plaintiffs subsequently brought suit against defendant for the injuries Deborah sustained from her fall. After a trial in the Kent County Superior Court, a jury rendered a verdict for defendant. Following the unfavorable verdict, plaintiffs moved for a new trial and additur, pursuant to Rule 59 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. After hearing the parties, the trial justice denied the motion, concluding that he would not have reached a different result from that reached by the jury. 1', 'To avoid confusion between Deborah Bates-Bridgmon and Jackie Bridgmon, we will refer to them as Deborah and Jackie, respectively. No disrespect is intended.', '-1-', 'On April 13, 2015, plaintiffs appealed and argued that the trial justice erred by denying their motion for a new trial and not instructing the jury on the “mode of operation” theory. Alternatively, plaintiffs ask this Court to adopt that theory for “the adjudication of premises liability claims brought by business invitees seeking compensation for injuries arising out of a business owner’s self-service mode of operation.” For the reasons set forth, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The event underlying this appeal is Deborah’s fall that occurred on March 23, 2009, at Roch’s Market.', 'On January 9, 2012, plaintiffs filed a complaint alleging that defendant negligently maintained the market’s premises; that defendant breached a contractual duty owed to Deborah, a business invitee, by failing to maintain the property in a reasonable and safe manner; and that Jackie suffered a loss of consortium. On October 6, 2014, plaintiffs moved to amend their complaint so as to add an additional count based on the theory of mode of operation. 2 This motion was granted on November 3, 2014. With respect to this theory, plaintiffs alleged that “by its mode of operation, [defendant] is responsible for such negligence 2', 'In their papers before us, plaintiffs describe the theory of mode of operation as “allow[ing] for a shifting in the burden of proof onto the party who was in the best position to identify the loss and cause of an injury sustained by an invitee, particularly in self-service retail establishments.” They cite to Sheehan v. Roche Brothers Supermarkets, Inc., 863 N.E.2d 1276 (Mass. 2007), where the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts explained the theory:', '“Courts adopting this approach have concluded that where an', ""owner's chosen mode of operation makes it reasonably foreseeable"", 'that a dangerous condition will occur, a store owner could be held', 'liable for injuries to an invitee if the plaintiff proves that the store', 'owner failed to take all reasonable precautions necessary to protect', 'invitees from these foreseeable dangerous conditions.” Id. at 1283.', '-2- and foreseen conditions on its premises.” A trial was held from February 24 through February 26, 2015.', 'Deborah testified first. She stated that, on March 23, 2009, between 2:00 p.m. and 3:30 p.m., she entered Roch’s Market, a grocery store she frequented, to purchase meat. After leaving the meat department, Deborah turned a corner, took a few steps, and slipped on what she later discovered was “cucumber and oil and debris” from the nearby salad bar. When asked whether she saw a warning sign near the salad bar, Deborah responded, “No.” She testified that she yelled for help to an employee “a few feet” away from her, but was not acknowledged because that person was assisting another customer.', 'When asked whether there were any other employees in the area, Deborah replied, “No, other than people behind, like, the meat counter and the deli counter.” Deborah said that she then crawled to the prepared foods department and used a rail to lift herself up. She eventually got the aforementioned employee’s attention and told her that she fell and needed help. Deborah said that the employee offered assistance and wiped the floor. She testified that the manager of the meat department came over and spoke with her. Deborah said that he told her that there was no one available, at that time, to complete an incident report.', 'Deborah said that she experienced pain “[i]mmediately after the fall” because she landed in a contorted position. She testified that she had discomfort in her lower back, right upper back, right arm, right side, knee, ankle, and foot. The next morning, after a poor night’s sleep, Deborah went to the emergency room. There, x-rays were taken that revealed no fractures. Deborah testified that she was told she had soft-tissue injuries. MRIs taken later, however, revealed that she had bulging and degenerative disks and multiple tears in her meniscus.', '-3-', 'Deborah noted that she was collecting disability benefits from the state for fibromyalgia, anxiety, depression, and circulatory issues. She distinguished the pain from her fall from the fibromyalgia pain, stating, “It’s a constant pain or like an ache or a throb. It’s different from fibromyalgia, that sharp twitchy electrical current pain.” She testified that she had experienced the pain from her fall daily.', 'Her husband, Jackie, testified next. He described his wife’s health before her fall as “good” and stated that they were able to do everything that they wanted to do. Jackie testified that, prior to Deborah’s fall, he required her help because of his own health issues. Discussing the effect that Deborah’s injuries had on their life, Jackie said, “[O]ur life’s just done. We do nothing.” He testified that, after his wife’s fall, he called Roch’s Market and spoke with the meat-department manager. He recounted the incident and told the manager that Deborah was taken to the emergency room. Jackie testified that he wanted to fill out an incident report; however, the manager whom he spoke with told him to call an attorney.', 'Next, Ting Chan, the owner of Roch’s Market, testified. 3 She said that she purchased the market in January 2008. Chan testified that she was not at the store on the day of Deborah’s fall, however, the “general manager,” Carl R. Masiello, told her that a customer fell. She noted that, at that time, they did not have the customer’s name or any other information about her. She said that Deborah had not filed an incident report. She testified that Masiello, whom she described as a reliable and credible employee, never told her whether the customer was injured and also did not mention Jackie’s phone call. When asked about Jackie’s testimony that a Roch’s Market manager told him to call an attorney, Chan testified that “I don’t think any of our employee[s] would say things like that. Any kind of call like this, it will be directed to the manager or to me 3', 'Chan was first called by plaintiffs as an adverse witness and was subsequently called by defendant as its witness.', '-4- * * * .” Chan described Roch’s Market’s policy for accidents involving customers. She said that a manager would fill out an injury report based on the customer’s responses, so that Roch’s Market would have the customer’s name, contact information, and a description of what happened.', 'Chan testified that there was no salad bar in Roch’s Market when she purchased the store. It was installed in mid- to late 2008 and was continuously used in that capacity until the end of 2010 or the beginning of 2011. Chan said that, although the structure still remained, self-serve salad items were no longer available. Instead, it contained wrapped sandwiches. Chan testified that Roch’s Market stopped selling salad at the salad bar because it was not sufficiently profitable. When asked whether Deborah’s injury influenced this decision, Chan replied, “It just didn’t generate enough business for us.” Chan was also asked if any changes had been made to the area near the salad bar after Deborah’s incident, to which she replied, “No.”', 'She testified that Roch’s Market did not put mats around the salad bar area because that would be a hazard as customers could trip on them.', 'The testimony of Masiello was introduced. 4 He said that he was working the day of Deborah’s incident; however, he did not speak with her himself. Masiello testified that he verbally reported the incident to his superior. He said that he knew that Deborah sustained injuries from her fall, but he did not know the nature of her injuries. He also confirmed that there was “something on the floor.”', 'Masiello was asked whether spills occurred often at the salad bar, to which he replied, “Not to my knowledge, no, I wouldn’t say so.” He did state, however, that he occasionally saw spills at the salad bar. When questioned about the policies of Roch’s Market concerning the 4', 'Because Masiello was unavailable to testify, plaintiffs’ attorney read the transcript of his December 17, 2014, deposition into the record.', '-5- salad bar, Masiello stated that there was not a particular employee assigned to monitor customers at that site. He noted, however, that the deli employees could view it from their station to see if it needed tending to, and a chef at Roch’s Market periodically checked the salad bar to ensure that it was full. When asked whether there were mats or other protective materials near the salad bar to absorb possible spills, Masiello replied in the negative. He was also asked whether there were any warnings cautioning customers to be careful of spills and to notify a Roch’s Market employee in case of a spill, to which he again replied in the negative.', 'Both parties then rested, and defendant moved under Rule 50 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure for a judgment as a matter of law. The defendant argued that, although it was undisputed that Deborah fell on oil and cucumber, “[t]here’s no evidence there was actual notice to the store or anybody employed by the store * * * concerning the presence of something on the floor.” The defendant also asserted that there was no evidence to support the conclusion that a Roch’s Market employee had constructive notice of the spill, giving defendant a reasonable opportunity to clean it up before Deborah fell.', 'The plaintiffs also moved for a judgment as a matter of law. On the issue of notice, they argued that the “salad bar is equivalent to a leaky drainpipe where * * * it’s a constant danger.” They noted that Roch’s Market lacked policies with respect to maintaining safety near the salad bar, and argued that “[t]he defect is already in existence in the nature of the product and the business in which they’re selling it.” They further contended that “even without mode of operation, without breach of contract, without any of those theories[,] * * * [t]here is still under the normal traditional concepts of negligence, due care obligation and causation, enough there to find for the [p]laintiff as a matter of law.” After hearing each party on their respective motions,', '-6- the trial justice denied plaintiffs’ motion for a judgment as a matter of law and reserved deciding defendant’s motion. 5', 'The trial justice then instructed the jury on the law. On the issue of duty, the trial justice said, “[d]efendant owed a duty to * * * [p]laintiff to exercise reasonable care to keep and maintain [its] premises in a reasonably safe condition for * * * food and grocery shopping * * * taking into account the nature of the operations and activities being conducted on * * * [d]efendant’s premises at the time.” After completing his instructions, the trial justice invited the parties’ counsel to approach at sidebar, and plaintiffs’ attorney requested instructions on the collateral-source rule, subsequent remedial measures pursuant to Rule 407 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, and aggravation of pre-existing injuries. In response to these requests, the trial justice said that he did not think that those issues were raised in plaintiffs’ papers. The trial justice stated that counsel did not provide him with written jury instructions and said, “[i]t may have made it to the clerk, but not to me.” The plaintiffs’ attorney, however, maintained that he did provide them, stating, “I have in my jury instructions, you know, the count of mode of operation and breach of contract and as part of my complaint.” 6', 'With respect to an instruction on the collateral-source rule, the trial justice determined that he did not “see any reason for it given the exhibit that’s in the record. I don’t see any 5', 'Although before us plaintiffs broadly asserted that, “The [t]rial [j]ustice committed reversible error in failing to grant [p]laintiff’s * * * [r]equest for directed verdict as to negligence * * *,” they failed to develop an argument. “Generally, we will consider an issue to be waived when a party ‘[s]imply stat[es] an issue for appellate review, without a meaningful discussion thereof or legal briefing of the issues * * * .’” Bucci v. Hurd Buick Pontiac GMC Truck, LLC, 85 A.3d 1160, 1170 (R.I. 2014) (quoting State v. Chase, 9 A.3d 1248, 1256 (R.I. 2010)). Accordingly, we will not address this issue on appeal. 6', 'We note that the above-referenced document does not appear within the lower court’s file. Although plaintiffs provided this Court with a document entitled “Jury Instructions,” there is no indication that the Superior Court had this document, as it is not time-stamped as received by that court, or signed by plaintiffs’ counsel.', '-7- mention of insurance or other mention of insurance. I don’t even want to raise the likelihood of the jury thinking about something they shouldn’t be thinking about.” Additionally, the trial justice determined that the evidence did not warrant an instruction on subsequent remedial measures. The trial justice did, however, instruct the jury on the issue of aggravation, stating, “The defendant in a personal injury case takes his plaintiff as he finds the plaintiff, and cannot defend based on the fact that the accident merely aggravated a pre-existing condition.” The trial justice then asked the parties’ counsel if they wanted to discuss anything else regarding the jury instructions, to which plaintiffs’ attorney responded, “No, your Honor.”', 'The jury then deliberated; and, on February 26, 2015, it found that plaintiffs had not proved “by a fair preponderance of the evidence that [d]efendant was negligent and said negligence was the proximate cause of any injury sustained by [p]laintiff[.]”', 'On March 1, 2015, plaintiffs moved for a new trial and additur, pursuant to Rule 59. A hearing on the motion was held on April 2, 2015. On the issue of notice, plaintiffs argued that “notice is implied if there were employees in the area that recognize[d] the defect and [had] an opportunity to address it.” They argued that Deborah’s fall was foreseeable because the products that Roch’s Market sold at its salad bar had the potential to spill onto the floor. The plaintiffs contended that Roch’s Market’s removal of salad items from the salad bar was a subsequent remedial measure. Additionally, plaintiffs addressed a point that they vigorously focused on during trial: that defendant lacked notice after Deborah’s incident. They argued that, “[T]here was a lot of suggestion by [Chan], * * * that she didn’t know about the incident in question. * * * But it was clear that her own manager/supervisor [Masiello] indicated right from the onset that they were aware of it.”', '-8-', 'The defendant objected to plaintiffs’ motion and argued that there was no evidence from which the jury could find that Roch’s Market had reasonable notice of the spillage and an opportunity to correct it. The defendant discussed the theory of mode of operation, noting that it was not the law in Rhode Island, and that the jury rendered a verdict consistent with Rhode Island law.', 'In deciding plaintiffs’ motion for a new trial, the trial justice first summarized the evidence adduced at trial. He addressed the issue of whether defendant was aware of Deborah’s fall after it occurred, and he concluded that this issue was a “red herring” because the relevant notice inquiry is whether defendant had notice of the condition that caused Deborah to slip and fall, not defendant’s after-the-fact notice of the fall. He also noted the numerous health issues that Deborah suffered from prior to her fall and stated that he—and presumably the jurors—had difficulty distinguishing Deborah’s pre-existing ailments from those caused by the fall.', 'The trial justice noted that, in instructing the jury, he “made some revisions to the general instructions that [he] felt were necessary to tailor the instructions on general duties to the facts of this particular case * * * .” In doing so, the trial justice “focused the jury’s attention to the fact that in considering this reasonable care, you take into account that there was a salad bar here, a self-service salad bar.” The trial justice agreed with the jury’s conclusion because plaintiffs’ “presentation was unpersuasive, not only to the issue of negligence, but also with respect to her attempt to establish that her complaints and medical treatment were proximately caused by the accident.” Accordingly, the trial justice denied plaintiffs’ motion for a new trial.', '-9-', 'On April 13, 2015, plaintiffs appealed. 7 They argue that the trial justice erred by denying plaintiffs’ motion for a new trial and failing to charge the jury on the mode of operation theory. Further, plaintiffs ask this Court to adopt that theory “as the standard in which slip and fall cases are analyzed in Rhode Island * * * .”', 'II', 'Standards of Review', ""As plaintiffs raise multiple issues on appeal, our standard of review differs with respect to each issue. “With regard to the motion for a new trial, it is well settled that our review of a trial justice's decision is deferential.” Pawtucket Redevelopment Agency v.

In support of this assertion, plaintiffs discuss and dispute various findings that the trial justice made in deciding the motion. Specifically, they assert that the trial justice ignored the fact that defendant repeatedly denied having knowledge of Deborah’s fall. The plaintiffs also fault the trial justice for his “contradiction” because he summarized Deborah’s testimony about the fall, yet found that she never explained the details of the fall. Additionally, they dispute the trial justice’s finding about Deborah’s injuries, stating, “The [t]rial [j]ustice attempted to make light of * * * [p]laintiff’s damages indicating that her testimony did not reflect injuries related to the incident.”', 'We are satisfied that the trial justice properly conducted the new-trial analysis.

On the issue of Deborah’s fall, the trial justice found that “the evidence was scant in terms of details” as “[s]he didn’t say how she fell, whether she fell backwards, forwards, sideways.” With respect to the issue of notice, the trial justice concluded that there was no evidence about how long the spillage was on the floor. He also addressed defendant’s notice of Deborah’s fall after it occurred and concluded that the pertinent question of notice was “what notice [defendants] had of the defect, or, if you want to call it, the condition that caused the fall, not what they knew afterwards.” Lastly, on the causation issue, the trial justice found it difficult to distinguish between Deborah’s pre-existing health problems and those caused by the fall, and he concluded that the evidence concerning her health was “murky at best.”', 'As the record reveals, there is nothing to indicate that “the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material and relevant evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong” and therefore, we will not disturb his decision.

On September 4, 2013, Nappa terminated the contract due to nonpayment.', 'The Flynns then filed an action in Superior Court alleging that Nappa had wrongfully terminated the contract.2 In accordance with § 6.2 of the contract, which required that all disputes be resolved through arbitration, Nappa filed a demand for arbitration. In that demand, Nappa also named Service Insurance as a party to the arbitration pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 10-3-21.3 The demand for arbitration specified the nature of the dispute as “[b]reach of [c]ontract, [i]mproper stoppage of work by owner, failure to make payment, [and] resolution of 2', 'The complaint filed by the Flynns also named Malloy Properties, LLC, the owner of the property, as a plaintiff and the following parties as defendants: Service Insurance, the bonding company; Mohamed H.

Nappa and Service Insurance then filed a petition in Superior Court to confirm the arbitrator’s award. The Flynns countered by filing a motion to vacate the arbitration award, asserting that the arbitrator exceeded the scope of his powers and manifestly disregarded a contractual provision by holding that the contract was terminated for convenience pursuant to § 14.4 of the contract. In response, Nappa argued that the arbitrator did not exceed his powers or manifestly disregard a contractual provision because the contract included a broad arbitration provision and because a court can judicially convert a “termination for cause” into a “termination for convenience” when both clauses appear in the contract.', 'On May 8, 2015, the hearing justice denied the Flynns’ motion to vacate and granted Nappa’s petition to confirm the arbitration award. She reasoned, “the arbitrator unmistakably attempted to ground his analysis in the contract itself citing various provisions of the contract,” which showed that the arbitrator “administered his duties as an arbitrator with all due regard to the contract and the ability to terminate the contract under its terms.” The hearing justice also held that the arbitrator did not exceed his power in “determining that it was a termination for * * * convenience as opposed to [a] termination for cause * * *.”', 'The hearing justice also held that the Flynns had not met their burden in demonstrating a manifest disregard for the law as no evidence had been put forth establishing “that the arbitrator knew what the law was and purposefully disregarded it.” The Superior Court concluded by explaining that there is a strong policy in favor of the finality of an arbitrator’s award and determined that the Flynns’ negligence claim was sufficiently addressed by the arbitrator in the catchall statement at the end of the arbitrator’s award, which stated, “[a]ll claims not expressly', '-5- granted are hereby denied.”', 'Final judgment entered on May 29, 2015, and the Flynns filed a timely notice of appeal.5', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“In this jurisdiction, the authority of the Courts ‘to review an arbitral award is statutorily prescribed and is limited in nature.’” Buttie v.

In the case now before us, we conclude that the arbitrator exceeded his authority.', '-8-', 'The arbitrator began his decision by reciting the history of the relationship between the parties, concluding that “[t]here [was] considerable fault to be found with both [p]arties.” Although he found that there were indeed problems with the cement floor that would require a substantial remediation, he characterized the stop-work order issued by the Flynns as “not a satisfactory way to address these problems,” and he said that it “practically guaranteed the project would end in acrimony.” He did not find that it constituted a breach of contract, however, nor could he, in light of § 14.3.1 of the contract, which provides that “[t]he [o]wner may, without cause, order the [c]ontractor in writing to suspend, delay or interrupt the [w]ork in whole or in part for such period of time as the [o]wner may determine.”', 'The arbitrator then determined that “Nappa was not justified in declaring [the] Flynn[s] in breach of contract, and terminating the [c]ontract for failure to pay Nappa’s [p]ayment [a]pplication No. 4.” Having found that Nappa had improperly terminated the contract, however, he took it upon himself to end the parties’ “combative, contentious, dysfunctional relationship” by employing the fiction that the Flynns had terminated the contract “for convenience” under § 14.4 of the agreement. As the arbitrator noted, under this interpretation, neither party was deemed to be in breach of the contract.', 'Section 14.4.1 of the parties’ contract provided that “[t]he [o]wner may, at any time, terminate the [c]ontract for the [o]wner’s convenience and without cause.” Under § 14.4.2, the owner must provide written notice of such termination to the contractor, at which point the contractor shall “cease operations as directed by the [o]wner in the notice.”', 'In the case under review, there is no evidence that the Flynns ever notified Nappa in writing that they wished to terminate the contract nor did the arbitrator so find. Indeed, the letter of June 24, 2013, to Nappa’s counsel states that Nappa was “to immediately cease from any further work on [the]', '-9- project” “until the [specified] issues [were] resolved.” This was followed by a letter dated June 27, 2013, directing that “[u]nder no circumstances [was] Nappa * * * authorized to proceed with pouring the final flooring until the design engineer * * * certifie[d] that the existing flooring [was] in compliance with his plans.” This language speaks to an ongoing relationship between the parties, albeit one in which Nappa must address an alleged deficiency in its performance. It does not, however, indicate a desire by the Flynns to terminate the contract for convenience.', 'Under the parties’ agreement, a termination for convenience may be exercised only by the Flynns and completely in their discretion. By employing this contractual provision to resolve the parties’ contractual dispute, the arbitrator has interpreted the contract in a manner that fails to draw its essence from the parties’ agreement and manifestly disregards a provision of the agreement. Indeed, the arbitrator’s interpretation is in direct contravention of the contractual language.', 'Where an arbitrator’s decision conflicts with the express terms of the agreement, it fails to draw from the essence of the agreement. See, e.g., Wyandot, Inc. v. Local 227, United Food and Commercial Workers Union, 205 F.3d 922, 929 (6th Cir. 2000) (although an arbitrator “may construe ambiguous contract language, he is without authority to disregard or modify plain and unambiguous provisions”) (quoting Dobbs, Inc. v.

Enterprise Wheel & Car Corp., 363 U.S. 593, 597 (1960)).', 'Moreover, the arbitral award in this case reaches an irrational result in that it contradicts the arbitrator’s factual findings. The arbitrator specifically found that the issuance of the “stop- work order” by the Flynns “was not a satisfactory way to address [their] problems” with the concrete flooring. He did not find, however, that the Flynns had breached the contract. Also, the arbitrator found that Nappa was not justified in terminating the contract; yet his ultimate award was predicated upon an interpretation under which Nappa was not considered to be in breach of contract. Having effectively found Nappa to be in breach of contract, rather than determining damages, the arbitrator essentially converted Nappa’s wrongful termination into a termination for convenience, which under the contract was a right exercisable only by the Flynns. The arbitrator never made a finding, nor was there any evidence submitted, that the Flynns had ever sought to terminate the contract; clearly they had never provided Nappa with written notice of a termination for convenience as required by the contract. The arbitrator’s conclusions, therefore, are in discord with his factual findings.', 'Judicial review of an arbitration award is extremely limited. This is so because we recognize that the parties to a contract with an arbitration clause have bargained for an arbitrator to resolve their disputes rather than the courts. See Purvis Systems, Inc., 788 A.2d at 1118. An arbitrator’s authority, however, is not unfettered; it is rather circumscribed by the plain language of the parties’ contract. See Council 94, 714 A.2d at 588. As we have noted before, “[w]e do not by this opinion endeavor to replace the arbitrator’s interpretation of the [contract] with our own. Rather we are constrained to recognize those instances in which an arbitrator reaches beyond the', '- 11 - terms of the parties’ [contract] for the purpose of rendering what he or she believes is a more desirable result.” Id. at 594.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court and reverse the order granting the joint application of Nappa and Service Insurance to confirm the arbitration award and denying the Flynns’ motion to vacate. We remand the record to the Superior Court with directions to grant the Flynns’ motion to vacate and for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.', 'Justice Indeglia, with whom Justice Flaherty joins, dissenting. While we agree with much of the majority’s analysis of the matter, we nevertheless respectfully voice our dissent to its ultimate conclusion that the arbitrator manifestly disregarded the law in interpreting the contract. The jurisprudence in this area is firmly settled. We have continuously afforded great deference to an arbitrator’s decision.

Here, the arbitrator was faced with a situation where “[t]here [was] considerable fault to be found with both [p]arties” and he recognized that “the combative, contentious, dysfunctional relationship between Flynn and Nappa had to be brought to a conclusion.” In the arbitrator’s effort to issue a fair and reasonable award, he determined that neither party breached the contract, but that the contract had been terminated through the provision allowing for termination by the owner for convenience. The arbitrator issued an award that he believed to be fair, within his authority under the contract, and', '- 13 - consistent with this Court’s prior holdings. In our opinion, under no circumstances can the arbitrator’s award be considered in excess of the terms of the parties’ contract, a manifest disregard of the law in its interpretation, or an irrational result.', 'The majority relies on Rhode Island Council 94, AFSCME, AFL-CIO v. State, 714 A.2d 584, 588 (R.I. 1998), for the propositions that an arbitrator’s authority “is contractual in nature and is limited to the powers conferred in the parties’ [contract]” and that “[an] arbitrator is confined to interpret the terms of the agreement so as to effectuate the intentions of the parties to the contract.” Here, however, a review of the contract as a whole reveals that the arbitrator’s award did not exceed the language of the agreement because, although the arbitrator could not find a termination for cause, a termination for convenience effectively had taken place. This Court has repeatedly recognized that “[a]n arbitrator has a duty to resolve a dispute based on the relevant provisions in the [contract].”', 'State Department of Corrections, 115 A.3d at 931 (quoting Woonsocket Teachers’ Guild, Local 951, AFT, 770 A.2d at 839).

Boren (Attorney Boren), from 2005 through 2009 and in 2013, while he was employed at the defendant law firm, Visconti, Boren & Campbell, Ltd. (VBC), (collectively, defendants). Before this Court, the defendants contend that the documents sought exceed the scope of permissible discovery, as provided by Rule 26 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, and are protected under the attorney-client privilege, the marital privilege, and the work product doctrine. For the reasons discussed herein, we affirm the discovery order in its entirety.', 'Facts and Travel', 'In 2000, plaintiff, Sergio A.

The marriage nonetheless failed.', 'In June 2010, Tondreault again filed for divorce, based on irreconcilable differences that led to the irretrievable breakdown of the marriage.1 The record reveals that the marital estate was valued at several million dollars, “the vast majority of that having been acquired during the period of coverture.” On June 21, 2011, a pretrial conference was held in the Family Court. The Family Court justice explained that, after reviewing the relevant case law, statutes, and the Uniform Premarital Agreement Act, he was satisfied that the antenuptial and postnuptial agreements did not exclude any income or appreciation of assets derived by DeCurtis during the marriage from the marital estate. Thereafter, DeCurtis exhibited confusion when he was asked to articulate his understanding of this issue: “It means that my prenuptial and the post-nuptial agreement allowed me to take my income, and whatever portion of it was going to be kept separate could be kept in a separate account so it was protected.” The Family Court justice explained that his finding was just the opposite. The Family Court justice continued by warning the litigants:', '“[I]f you attempted to convince the Supreme Court or this', 'particular jurist that your income derived during the period of', 'marriage is excluded, * * * I don’t think you’re going to be', 'successful before this particular jurist; nor, is it the Court’s', 'interpretation based upon its dealings with the Supreme Court', 'which it has over the last [thirty-seven] years, would they entertain', 'that thought either.” 1', 'Attorney Boren also represented DeCurtis in the divorce proceedings.', '-2- The Family Court justice’s statements, coupled with the extent of DeCurtis’s pecuniary exposure, and the advice of counsel, led DeCurtis to settle his dispute with his wife and enter into a property settlement agreement with Tondreault on June 23, 2011. Tondreault was awarded $2,750,000 based on the equitable distribution of the assets and $1,500,000 in alimony payable over fifteen years.', 'On August 8, 2012, plaintiff instituted an action in Superior Court alleging attorney malpractice against defendants, contending, inter alia, that Attorney Boren negligently drafted the antenuptial and postnuptial agreements and failed to advise him that he should refrain from commingling his premarital assets with the marital estate, causing him significant loss. On October 23, 2012, plaintiff propounded the following requests for production of documents upon defendants:', '“Request No. 49:', '“Any and all prenuptial or premarital agreements drafted,', 'prepared and/or negotiated by Attorney Boren from 1999 to the', 'present and continuing up to the time of trial, with all client', 'identifying information redacted.', '“Request No. 50:', '“Any and all postnuptial agreements drafted, prepared', 'and/or negotiated by Attorney Boren from 1999 to the present and', 'continuing up to the time of trial, with all client identifying', 'information redacted.” The defendants objected, arguing that the requests sought “or could be interpreted to seek attorney work product or information related to other clients of Attorney Boren or [the law firm] not related to the plaintiff as being privileged, and subject to Rule of Professional Conduct 1.6, and beyond the scope of Rule 26.” The plaintiff moved to strike defendants’ objection and', '-3- compel further responses; the motion was heard before a Superior Court justice on November 18, 2013.', 'The plaintiff argued that evidence of subsequent remedial measures is admissible to prove negligence in Rhode Island, in accordance with Rule 407 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, and that he was entitled to explore whether the language used in plaintiff’s antenuptial and postnuptial agreements was altered in subsequent agreements drafted by Attorney Boren. The plaintiff anticipated that changes in those documents would have been made sometime in 2011, after Attorney Boren learned that the agreements he drafted for plaintiff failed to provide the protection his client allegedly was promised. Based upon the fact that the Family Court pronouncement did not occur until 2011, the trial justice granted plaintiff’s motion in part, limiting production to the years 2010 through 2012. The trial justice also issued a protective order and required comprehensive redaction of the documents.', 'The defendants produced a single postnuptial agreement from 2010.', 'The plaintiff renewed his motion to compel as it related to Request Nos. 49 and 50, contending that “[i]t [was] crucial [for him to] ascertain the language used by Attorney Boren in prenuptial and postnuptial agreements [designed] to protect [the] earnings and assets [of a spouse] acquired during the marriage before and after [the Family Court justice’s] ruling on June 21, 2011 * * *.” On September 26, 2014, the Superior Court justice acknowledged that defendants had conducted a survey as to the number of antenuptial and postnuptial agreements drafted by Attorney Boren from 2005 to 2009 and in 2013. Four antenuptial agreements and one postnuptial agreement from 2005 to 2009 and one antenuptial agreement in 2013 were produced. The Superior Court justice ordered defendants to provide these documents to plaintiffs, duly redacted and subject to', '-4- a protective order. The defendants sought review in this Court by way of a petition for writ of certiorari. We granted the petition on June 15, 2015.', 'Issues on Appeal', 'We note at the outset that this case is before the Supreme Court on an interlocutory review of a discovery order. The petition for certiorari posed the following narrow question:', '“May a former client in a legal malpractice action against', 'his former attorney properly compel discovery from his former', 'attorney and law firm related to documents the attorney prepared', 'for the attorney’s other clients in order to gain evidence to prove', 'subsequent remedial measures in the legal malpractice action?” A thorough review of the memoranda filed by the parties reveals that both sides have devoted substantial efforts discussing the admissibility and weight of the documents at issue—as well as the effect of our holding in Marsocci v. Marsocci, 911 A.2d 690 (R.I. 2006), none of which directly is on point. To be sure, the admissibility of evidence is not wholly irrelevant when determining discoverability; however, Rule 26(b)(1) requires only that the materials sought be “reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” (Emphasis added.) “The provisions of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure pertaining to discovery generally are liberal, and are designed to promote broad discovery among parties during the pretrial phase of litigation.” Henderson v. Newport County Regional Young Men’s Christian Association, 966 A.2d 1242, 1246 (R.I. 2009). Accordingly, while some of the arguments presented to us may be viable in the Superior Court, they are of no consequence to the precise question before us.', 'Against that background, defendants nonetheless argue that the subject agreements are outside the scope of Rule 26. More pointedly, defendants contend that plaintiff seeks the agreements to prove that Attorney Boren took remedial measures after the Family Court’s ruling in 2011; therefore, any agreements drafted before 2011 are irrelevant as they were not prepared', '-5- during that time period. The defendants also maintain that all of the agreements are protected under the attorney-client privilege, the marital privilege, and the work product doctrine, and that these privileges have not been waived. Furthermore, defendants urge this Court to recognize the sensitivity and widespread implication of the matter at hand.', 'Standard of Review', '“Our review of a case on certiorari is limited to an examination of ‘the record to determine if an error of law has been committed.’” State v.

Arruda, 556 A.2d 47, 48 (R.I. 1989). Critically, our discovery rules are liberal and have been construed to “promote broad discovery.” Henderson, 966 A.2d at 1246.', 'The plaintiff claims that the six antenuptial and postnuptial agreements drafted by', '-6- Attorney Boren are discoverable under Rule 26(b)(1) because they are relevant to demonstrate if and when Attorney Boren undertook subsequent remedial measures in the drafting of antenuptial and postnuptial agreements. Unlike many other jurisdictions, subsequent remedial measures are admissible in Rhode Island to prove negligence “[w]hen, after an event, measures are taken which, if taken previously, would have made the event less likely to occur * * *.” Rule 407; contra Thomas M. Fleming, Annotation, Admissibility of evidence of repairs, change of conditions, or precautions taken after accident—modern state cases, 15 A.L.R. 5th 119 (1993) (“Almost all American jurisdictions adhere to the rule that evidence of repairs, precautions, or like remedial measures taken after an accident may not be admitted as proof of antecedent negligence * * *.”). The plaintiff has sought production of agreements drafted from 2005 through 2009 and in 2013. The defendants place emphasis on the 2005 through 2009 period, contending that these agreements are irrelevant to any subsequent remedial measures possibly taken by Attorney Boren because they antedate the 2011 Family Court ruling. The defendants claim that the 2011 Family Court decision is the triggering “event” under Rule 407 and that any agreements drafted before then, by their very nature, cannot be “subsequent.” We disagree.', 'We have yet to define the term “event” in this context; however, the task before us is a simple one. “Event,” for the purposes of proving a subsequent remedial measure, is the liability- causing conduct, not the eventual litigation itself. See Raymond v. Raymond Corp., 938 F.2d 1518, 1523 (1st Cir. 1991) (discussing Rule 407 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which excludes evidence of subsequent remedial measures to prove negligence or culpability and stating: “Under 407, only measures which take place after the ‘event’ are excluded. The term ‘event’ refers to the accident that precipitated the suit.”); see also Ranches v. City and County of Honolulu, 168 P.3d 592, 597 (Haw. 2007) (defining “event” in the context of subsequent', '-7- remedial measures as “the occurrence that caused the death or injury cited in the current complaint” (quoting Addison M. Bowman, Hawai’i: Rules of Evidence Manual § 407-1 (3d ed. 2006))). Rule 407 states that remedial measures are relevant if they “would have made the event less likely to occur.” This phrase indicates that the “event” is the liability-causing conduct. Cf. Tucker v. Caterpillar, Inc., 564 N.W.2d 410, 413 (Iowa 1997) (“The phrase ‘would have made the event less likely to occur’ indicates that ‘event’ refers to the accident or injury rather than the manufacture or sale of the product.”).', 'To hold that remedial measures are not to be characterized as subsequent remedial measures under Rule 407 until there has been a judicial determination of liability would be an absurd result and ignores the fact that liability arises, if at all, when the injury-causing conduct occurs. We recognize that the case at bar is unique in that it involves two causes of action, the divorce proceeding and the pending legal malpractice claim that arose out of that proceeding. Because most cases do not involve this particular legal landscape, Rule 407 would essentially be rendered superfluous were we to hold that subsequent remedial measures occur after the litigation is well on its way toward resolution. A remedial measure that follows closely on the heels of a judicial ruling would have no evidentiary value.', 'Additionally, we decline to hold that the controlling “event” for Rule 407 is predicated on the actual knowledge of the tortfeasor. See Doe v. Johnston, 476 N.W.2d 28, 34 (Iowa 1991) (contrasting malpractice cases with “accident” cases and holding, “[Rule 407] makes the triggering event the same as the act giving rise to negligence * * * the blood transfusion * * * was the event triggering the protection of [R]ule 407, not the doctor’s later knowledge of his patient’s injury”). Furthermore, any indicia of a knowledge requirement notably are absent from the plain reading of Rule 407, leaving us to ponder which party would carry the burden of', '-8- satisfying this requirement. As one of the few jurisdictions that permit subsequent remedial measures to prove liability, we decline to construe the rule in this manner. See Rule 102 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence (“These rules shall be construed to secure fairness in administration, elimination of unjustifiable expense and delay, and promotion of growth and development of the law of evidence to the end that the truth may be ascertained and proceedings justly determined.” (emphasis added)); Rule 407 Advisory Committee’s Note (“The proposed rule is consistent with * * * the central notion of relevancy in the rules and is based on a more realistic assessment of the policy considerations underlying the current approach.”).', 'In the case before us, plaintiff initially retained Attorney Boren in 2000, and the antenuptial agreement between plaintiff and Tondreault was drafted in that same year. In 2005, Attorney Boren drafted a postnuptial agreement, which affirmed the terms stated in the prior agreement.', 'The instant malpractice suit arises out of language that was included in both documents. As a result, we are of the opinion that the triggering “event” for purposes of Rule 407 is the drafting of the later document, the 2005 postnuptial agreement. Accordingly, any measures taken after 2005 would be relevant under Rule 407 and, therefore, discoverable under Rule 26(b)(1).2', 'Privileges', 'Having decided that the subject agreements meet the threshold test for discovery under Rule 26(b)(1), we now turn to the issue of whether the agreements are privileged. “Although generally favoring the reciprocal disclosure of relevant information, the rules of discovery are 2', 'To be sure, our holding does not weigh in on whether any language changes, to the extent that they exist, are actually admissible as subsequent remedial measures in this case. The defendants have raised multiple arguments, including why language might have been changed.

As Rule 26(b)(1) indicates, all relevant information is discoverable unless such information is privileged. See Cabral, 556 A.2d at 48. The defendants argue that the attorney-client privilege, the marital privilege, and the work product doctrine apply to these documents and preclude production.', 'We acknowledge that very few jurisdictions have considered these issues in general, let alone in this precise context.', 'Attorney-Client Privilege', 'In order “to encourage full and frank communications between attorneys and their clients,” we have long recognized that “communications made by a client to his attorney for the purpose of seeking professional advice, as well as the responses by the attorney to such inquiries, are privileged communications not subject to disclosure.” Mortgage Guarantee & Title Co. v. Cunha, 745 A.2d 156, 158-59 (R.I. 2000) (quoting Callahan v. Nystedt, 641 A.2d 58, 61 (R.I. 1994)). Genuine attorney-client communications are afforded the highest level of protection by our courts. See State v. von Bulow, 475 A.2d 995, 1005-06 (R.I. 1984) (explaining that the attorney-client privilege is “a narrow exception” that “limits * * * full disclosure”). However, “[t]he attorney-client privilege protects from disclosure only the confidential communications between a client and his or her attorney.” Id. at 1004 (emphasis added) (quoting DeFusco v. Giorgio, 440 A.2d 727, 731 (R.I. 1982)).', 'Furthermore, “[t]he privilege must be narrowly construed because it limits the full disclosure of the truth.” Callahan, 641 A.2d at 61. The party asserting the privilege has the burden to set forth the following elements:', '“(1) the asserted holder of the privilege is or sought to become a', 'client; (2) the person to whom the communication was made (a) is', '[the] member of a bar of a court, or his subordinate and (b) in', 'connection with this communication is acting as a lawyer; (3) the', 'communication relates to a fact of which the attorney was', 'informed (a) by his client (b) without the presence of strangers (c)', '- 10 -', 'for the purpose of securing primarily either (i) an opinion on law or', '(ii) legal services or (iii) assistance in some legal proceeding, and', 'not (d) for the purpose of committing a crime or tort; and (4) the', 'privilege has been (a) claimed and (b) not waived by the client.”', 'von Bulow, 475 A.2d at 1004-05 (quoting United States v. Kelly,', '569 F.2d 928, 938 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 829 (1978)).', 'The attorney-client privilege is a personal privilege, see Lapan v. Lapan, 100 R.I. 498, 503, 217 A.2d 242, 246 (1966); therefore, only the client can implicitly or explicitly assert or waive the privilege. See Mortgage Guarantee & Title Co., 745 A.2d at 159. In Callahan, 641 A.2d at 61, we recognized that “an attorney may assert the privilege on behalf of a client in some situations.” That alternative is not available, however, when the client is not a party to the subject lawsuit and the only interests at stake are those of the attorney. In Callahan, a law firm sued its former attorney-employee for monies owed on cases that were generated while the attorney was employed at the firm but closed after the attorney terminated his employment. Id. at 59-60. The law firm sought production of the case files and any retainer or contingency fee agreements, and the attorney objected on the basis of, inter alia, the attorney-client privilege. Id. at 60. When production was ordered by the Superior Court, the attorney sought a writ of certiorari in this Court. Id. We quashed the writ because the attorney did not have standing to assert the privilege on behalf of his clients, the true privilege holders. Id. at 61. Although the attorney had submitted an affidavit in which he attested that the clients wished to assert the attorney-client privilege, we deemed this insufficient. Id. Instead, we declared that “[i]f the clients wished to assert the privilege, then each client should have personally signed and submitted an affidavit declaring his or her intent.” Id. Furthermore, the Court recognized that, had the privilege properly been invoked, the entire case file would not be protected; “[o]nly those documents containing confidential communications could have been properly withheld.” Id.', 'In this case, defendants likewise lack standing to assert the attorney-client privilege.', '- 11 - Similar to the attorney in Callahan, defendants represented the privilege-holding clients. Nevertheless, those clients—the signatories to the antenuptial and postnuptial agreements—are not privy to this lawsuit. In fact, we have been advised that these clients are not aware of this controversy. While it may be accurate that a portion of the subject agreements contains sensitive and identifying information, defendants essentially are asserting the privilege in defense of their own alleged negligence, since both plaintiff’s request and the Superior Court justice’s order require comprehensive redaction of all identifying information. See Callahan, 641 A.2d at 61 (recognizing that “[o]nly [the attorney’s] financial interests [were] at stake”); cf. von Bulow, 475 A.2d at 1007 (“Consistent with these principles of fairness, it has been held that the attorney- client privilege properly serves as a shield and not as an offensive tool of litigation.”). We are of the opinion that information that may qualify under Rule 407 will remain if the agreements are produced in redacted form.', 'Even assuming that defendants had standing to assert the attorney-client privilege, it would not apply to the entirety of the subject agreements. It is well established that a fact does not become privileged simply because it is communicated to an attorney.3 See Upjohn Co. v. 3', 'The defendants direct our attention to an article published by the American Bar. However, the excerpt actually undercuts their argument:', '“This means a client can never protect facts simply by', 'incorporating them into a communication with the attorney. For', 'instance, a client might provide the attorney with details of its', 'transactions with another business over the past 10 years, including', 'dates and costs, to help the attorney draft a new contract with the', 'business. In future litigation, the client would not have to answer', 'any questions about what was said to the attorney or what language', 'the attorney recommended, but the client could not refuse to give', 'the date of a prior transaction simply because the fact was', 'discussed with the attorney.” Jackie Unger, Maintaining the', 'Privilege: A Refresher on Important Aspects of the Attorney-Client', 'Privilege (Oct. 2013), http://www.americanbar.org/publications/', '- 12 - United States, 449 U.S. 383, 395 (1981) (“The privilege only protects disclosure of communications; it does not protect disclosure of the underlying facts by those who communicated with the attorney[.]”). It is also illogical to categorize the drafting and review of stock language in a final and executed contract as a privileged communication between an attorney and client. These documents represent the end product that arose from communications between the attorney and his or her client. The intimate nature of an agreement and potentially confidential information contained therein do not render the entire agreement a privileged communication. By its nature, the agreement stands as an arm’s-length contract between two adults anticipating marriage.', 'Certainly, this Court recognizes that the attorney-client privilege “should not be whittled away by fine distinctions,” Williams v. Rhode Island Hospital Trust Co., 88 R.I. 23, 47, 143 A.2d 324, 337 (1958); however, the privilege when applicable and properly raised protects the confidential communications between the attorney and client, see von Bulow, 475 A.2d at 1004, and not the end product, the written agreement. In Callahan, 641 A.2d at 61, we acknowledged that “[i]t [was] highly [unlikely] that the disclosure of the three closed files would * * * involve the continuing interests of the clients.” With adequate redaction of client-specific data, the same holds true here.', 'Redaction may also quell any concern about the forthright disclosure of sensitive information. See Upjohn Co., 449 U.S. at 389 (explaining that the privilege “promote[s] broader public interests in the observance of law and administration of justice” and “recognizes that sound legal advice or advocacy serves public ends and that such advice or advocacy depends upon the lawyer’s being fully informed by the client”).', 'blt/2013/10/01_unger.html (emphasis added). Consequently, while the discussion surrounding the confidential material would be protected under the privilege, it is not clear that the confidential information itself, which is eventually memorialized into an agreement, would be protected.', '- 13 -', 'Additionally and significantly, it is well established that the attorney-client privilege can be waived “when there has been disclosure of a confidential communication to a third party.” von Bulow, 475 A.2d at 1005. According to the Restatement (Third) Law Governing Lawyers § 76(1) at 584 (2000), “[i]f two or more clients with a common interest in a litigated or nonlitigated matter are represented by separate lawyers and they agree to exchange information concerning the matter,” the privilege is not waived. However, we are not convinced that a soon- to-be husband and wife executing an antenuptial agreement (or a husband and wife executing a postnuptial agreement) share a common interest with respect to the matter at hand. Although the parties intend to reach an accord regarding the disposition of their property should their union dissolve, the core function of antenuptial and postnuptial agreements is to protect the assets of each spouse from claims by the other spouse. The interest of each spouse is not in common with the other, but is adverse—even in the face of a commitment to love and cherish until death do them part. In this context, because the interests of the contracting parties are adverse, one attorney cannot ethically represent both parties in drafting and executing an antenuptial or postnuptial agreement.4 See Article V, Rule 1.7(a) of the Supreme Court Rules of Professional Conduct (“[A] lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation involves a concurrent conflict of interest. A concurrent conflict of interest exists if: (1) the representation of one client will be directly adverse to another client * * *.”); In re City of Warwick, 97 R.I. 294, 297, 197 A.2d 287, 289 (1964) (“[I]t being fundamental that an attorney cannot in such circumstances represent parties having adverse interests.”); Nelson v. Streeter, 65 R.I. 13, 19, 13 A.2d 256, 258 4', 'The Uniform Premarital Agreement Act does not “require[] parties to a premarital agreement to be represented by counsel.” Marsocci v. Marsocci, 911 A.2d 690, 697 (R.I. 2006); see also Penhallow v. Penhallow, 649 A.2d 1016, 1022 (R.I. 1994). However, the absence of independent representation “is a significant consideration in evaluating” whether a spouse knowingly and voluntarily consented to the agreement. Marsocci, 911 A.2d at 697 n.3.', '- 14 - (1940) (“Counsel undertook * * * to represent the heirs of both decedents and he had a right to do so as long as their interests were common[.] * * * [I]t is of the utmost importance that conflicting interests shall be independently represented.”). See also Ware v. Ware, 687 S.E.2d 382, 389 (W. Va. 2009) (“Like divorce actions, the nature of prenuptial agreements is such that the parties’ interests are fundamentally antagonistic to one another. Indeed, the purpose of a prenuptial agreement is to preserve the property of one spouse, thereby preventing the other from obtaining that to which he or she might otherwise be legally entitled. * * * [O]ne attorney may not represent, nor purport to counsel, both parties to a prenuptial agreement.”). Thus, to the extent that Tondreault and her attorney were present during the preparation of the agreements and engaged in negotiations, the resulting contract is not protected from disclosure by the attorney-client privilege.', 'In summary, we are of the opinion that defendants do not have standing to assert the attorney-client privilege on behalf of their clients in this context. In this case, the documents are not confidential communications such that third parties were privy to the discussions surrounding the documents and their execution, thus vitiating the privilege. We conclude that the Superior Court justice amply placed safeguards on the order by requiring redaction and limiting the purpose for which the documents could be used. Adequate redaction will eliminate any sensitive or identifying information and prevent the disclosure of any confidential interests contained in the documents.', 'Marital Privilege', 'The defendants contend that they have asserted the marital privilege as an individual basis, as well as “in conjunction with the attorney-client privilege to show the joint interests at stake for the parties who were to be married.” General Laws 1956 § 9-17-13 codified the', '- 15 - common law marital privilege:', '“In the trial of every civil cause, the husband or wife of', 'either party shall be deemed a competent witness; provided, that', 'neither shall be permitted to give any testimony tending to', 'criminate the other or to disclose any communication made to him', 'or her, by the other, during their marriage, except on trials of', 'petitions for divorce between them, trials between them involving', 'their respective property rights, and under the provisions of [G.L.', '1956] § 11-34.1-9.” The defendants’ argument that the marital privilege applies in this context is unavailing. The parties to the six agreements are not testifying, and the production of executed contracts is not testimonial in any way. Furthermore, the parties were not married at the time the antenuptial agreements were executed. The marital privilege focuses on communications between a husband and wife, such that the communications must occur “during [the] marriage.” Section 9-17-13. As applied to the postnuptial agreement, we are satisfied that adequate redaction should eliminate any communications between husband and wife that bear on confidentiality. See Bradley v. Quinn, 53 R.I. 349, 351, 166 A. 814, 815 (1933) (“[S]tatements of husband and wife to each other, when not of a confidential nature or likely to provoke marital discord, are admissible * * *.”). Finally, we decline to expand the marital privilege based on its underlying policy “to encourage, protect, and perpetuate” the intimacy of marital relations. Campbell v. Chace, 12 R.I. 333, 334 (1879). See also State v. Diamante, 83 A.3d 546, 551 (R.I. 2014) (“[W]e have repeatedly held that a Court may not ‘broaden statutory provisions by judicial interpretation unless such interpretation is necessary and appropriate in carrying out the clear intent or defining the terms of the statute.’” (quoting State v.

Taylor, 329 U.S. 495, 511 (1947)). Rule 26(b)(3) delineates:', '“Subject to the provisions of subdivision (b)(4) of this rule, a party', 'may obtain discovery of documents and tangible things otherwise', 'discoverable under subdivisions (b)(1) of this rule and prepared in', 'anticipation of litigation or for trial by or for another party or by or', 'for that other party’s representative (including the other party’s', 'attorney, consultant, surety, indemnitor, insurer, or agent) only', 'upon a showing that the party seeking discovery has substantial', 'need of the materials in the preparation of the party’s case and that', 'the party is unable without undue hardship to obtain the substantial', 'equivalent of the materials by other means.

As a result, the filing of a lawsuit is not a prerequisite for the successful invocation of the work product doctrine, which embraces material that is prepared “when litigation is merely a contingency.” Fireman’s Fund Insurance Co. v.

It is clear that the subject agreements do not contain any of Attorney Boren’s mental impressions or legal theories. Thus, our review is limited to whether the six antenuptial and postnuptial agreements qualify as factual work product.', 'The defendants contend that the subject agreements are work product because they were prepared in anticipation of litigation—a divorce proceeding between the contracting parties. Although these documents were prepared in an attempt to simplify an unfortunate end to the client’s marriage, an event that may or may not occur, we are not convinced that they rise to the level of a document prepared in anticipation of litigation. Contracts of this nature are prepared during an arm’s-length transaction, by two parties with the hope that the documents collect dust in the home of a happily married couple. A potential dissolution of the marriage is far too attenuated from the creation of an antenuptial agreement to qualify as having been prepared in anticipation of litigation. Furthermore, these agreements are entered into in an effort to avoid protracted litigation by setting forth each spouse’s respective rights and expectations regarding the disposition of his or her property in the event of divorce. This purpose is echoed in the underlying policy of all contracts, which are binding agreements between the parties, including the procedure and remedies available in the event of a dispute. Were this Court to declare that', '- 18 - these contracts constitute attorney work product, this interpretation would apply to the universe of agreements, shielding many contracts from disclosure.', 'The policy that underlies the work product doctrine does not lend itself to shielding these agreements. Factual work product is granted qualified immunity “to prevent an attorney from ‘freeloading’ on his or her adversary’s work.” Cabral, 556 A.2d at 48. The production of completed and executed contracts does not provide the requesting party with an unfair advantage in the litigation. We also note that, once the agreement is finalized and executed, the agreement belongs to the parties, not to the attorney who drafted it. For these reasons, we are of the opinion that final and executed antenuptial and postnuptial agreements are not work product.5', 'Even assuming, arguendo, that the antenuptial and postnuptial agreements can be categorized as factual work product, the privilege is qualified. The party seeking to overcome the document’s qualified immunity has the burden to prove “(1) a substantial need of the document and (2) a resulting injustice or undue hardship from immunizing the document * * *.” Henderson, 966 A.2d at 1249.', 'The defendants argue that plaintiff cannot demonstrate a “substantial need” for two reasons—first, because plaintiff has been provided with a 2010 postnuptial agreement with language that differs from plaintiff’s agreements, and second, although the documents are relevant and may lead to admissible evidence, they are not crucial to the merits of plaintiff’s claim such that he can establish substantiality. We are not persuaded.', 'Allegedly, the 2010 postnuptial agreement that has been produced contains language that differs from plaintiff’s 2001 and 2005 agreements. Nevertheless, plaintiff is unable to decipher 5', 'That is not to say that an earlier or incomplete draft of an agreement may not be protected by the work product doctrine; by their very nature, pre-drafts may contain both mental impressions and legal strategy. Cf. Cashman Equipment Corp., Inc. v. Cardi Corp., Inc., 139 A.3d 379, 383 (R.I. 2016) (affirming the denial of a motion to compel production when the request sought production of drafts considered by the opposing expert).', '- 19 - if the 2010 agreement contains the first alteration of language or whether the change occurred earlier in time. The plaintiff posits that he is trying to determine the cause behind the change in language—be it our holding in Marsocci or some other event which led defendants to conclude that language they formerly employed should be altered. Although plaintiff’s case may not rise or fall on Rule 407, evidence of subsequent remedial measures is “highly probative[.]” Rule 407 Advisory Committee’s Note. Accordingly, we are satisfied that plaintiff has met his burden by demonstrating a substantial need for the subject agreements.', 'It is also clear that the plaintiff will be unable to discover this evidence through alternative channels. Certainly, the plaintiff does not know of the identity of the parties to these agreements, nor should he know. And even if he were aware, it would be overly burdensome to require the plaintiff to obtain the same agreements that are already in the defendants’ possession via third-party subpoenas for documents. As a result, the work product doctrine is of no avail to the defendants. We are of the opinion that legally competent evidence in the record supports the Superior Court justice’s determination on this issue.', 'Conclusion', 'In complying with this discovery order, the defendants are directed to adequately redact all confidential information and take any additional steps they deem reasonably necessary to ensure confidentiality, including contacting their clients should that be deemed necessary. To the extent that the clients wish to assert the attorney-client privilege, the Superior Court should welcome those motions and use our discussion herein as guidance in rendering a decision.', 'Finally, we anticipate that the trial justice will act as an additional gatekeeper and conduct an in camera review of the documents after adequate redaction by the defendants, in order to ensure that all confidential and identifying information has been removed.', '- 20 -', 'For the reasons stated in this opinion, we quash the writ and affirm the discovery order of the Superior Court.

75,"High Steel Structures, Inc. : v. : Cardi Corporation et al. : v. : State of Rhode Island and Providence : Plantations, Department of Administration, : Division of Purchases. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. This matter comes before the Court on appeal from the Superior Court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of the State of Rhode Island (the state) in a third-party action for breach of contract brought by Cardi Corporation (Cardi) in response to a suit by High Steel Structures, Inc. (High Steel). At issue was Cardi’s contract with the state to construct a portion of a prodigious highway construction project dealing with Interstate 195 in Rhode Island (I-Way Project). Specifically, this case arises from Cardi’s subcontract with High Steel to supply steel for this project and High Steel’s assertion that it was never paid for 182,873 pounds of temporary steel bracing. 1 For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'For purposes of this opinion, the phrase “temporary steel bracing” is used interchangeably with “temporary cross braces,” “temporary cross frames,” “temporary steel,” “temporary bracing,” and “Grade 36 Steel.”', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The I-Way Project is a multiyear, multi-faceted highway construction endeavor for various parts of Interstate 195. In 2004, the state released details regarding Contract 6, one of fifteen I-Way Project contracts, which provided for “the construction of a series of new tub- girder bridges and ramps, along with associated public way and utility relocations and improvements.” In this regard, the state retained Maguire Group, Inc. (Maguire) as the project’s managing consultant and engineer of record. 2 Contract 6, the contract from which this dispute emanates, detailed plans to construct I-Way ramps labeled “NE, WS, WES and SE.” Completion of Contract 6 required the use of various materials, including temporary cross braces. The temporary bracing in question, Grade 36 steel, was used for work identified as Item No. 312, 3 Item Code 824.9921, in the “Distribution of Quantities.” 4 Item No. 312 was the item for Grade 50 structural steel. There was no separate line item listing the weight for the Grade 36 temporary bracing steel.', 'The bid-submission deadline was set for July 30, 2004. 5 Prior to the bid deadline, on June 29, 2004, the state held a conference to address potential bidders’ questions or concerns relative to Contract 6. 2', 'Maguire was responsible for overseeing project design, reviewing bid packages and contractor- submitted shop drawings, and responding to contractors’ information requests. Further, Maguire maintained responsibility for evaluating issues that arose throughout the construction process. 3', 'As a bid-item contract, Contract 6 broke down materials to be supplied into distinct work items. The work item pertinent to this dispute, as referenced in the Distribution of Quantities, is Item No. 312. 4', 'Contract 6’s Distribution of Quantities listed work items and set forth their project station and location. Item No. 312, Item Code 824.9921, in the Distribution of Quantities, was described as “AASHTO M270 Grade 50 Steel Furnish Fab. & Erect.” 5', 'The state originally set the bid-submission date for July 16, 2004, but it was extended.', '-2-', 'On July 22, 2004, the state received a question from a prospective bidder concerning payment for temporary cross braces. Specifically, the contractor inquired, “What is the pay item for the temporary A36 steel braces between the tub beams?” In light of this question, on July 27, 2004, the state, in collaboration with Maguire, prepared and released Addendum No. 7 to Contract 6. This addendum issued a “Clarification,” which provided:', '“[T]emporary bracing between girders on Bridges NE, WS and SE is not', 'measured separately for payment. All costs associated with the temporary braces,', 'filler bolts and field touch up are considered as incidental and shall be included in', 'the structural steel items of work. For further clarification see changes to notes on', 'sheets NE 45, WS 51, SE 21 found elsewhere in this Contract Addendum.” Additionally, the state modified the field notes associated with each Contract 6 ramp to track the language of Addendum No. 7. 6', 'At the conclusion of bidding, the state selected Cardi as the general contractor for Contract 6.', 'Cardi was the lowest bidder, with a contract price of $63,991,186.42, nearly $900,000 less than the next lowest bidder. On September 10, 2004, Cardi subcontracted with High Steel for the latter to provide—among other items—temporary cross frames. High Steel bid $2.343 per pound on Item No. 312; and, using this bid price, Cardi bid $2.58 per pound for that item. High Steel’s contract with Cardi specifically excluded certain items, namely “field measurements or surveys, stud shear connectors, scuppers or any other bridge drainage, scupper supports, bearings, bearing pads, anchor bolts, field touch up paint, stenciling or painting.” High Steel’s contract, however, included temporary cross frames. The state entered into a written contract with Cardi on October 29, 2004. 6', 'The revised field notes reiterated, “All costs associated with the temporary bracing, filler bolts and field touchup shall be considered as incidental and shall be included in the structural steel items of work.”', '-3-', 'In preparing its subcontract bid with Cardi, High Steel confirmed “receipt of Addenda #1 through #7” and acknowledged that the state issued Addendum No. 7 to Contract 6 before it subcontracted with Cardi. Further, High Steel indicated that it reviewed Addendum No. 7 and understood it as conforming to the manner in which it prepared its bid. Neither Cardi nor High Steel changed its bid as a result of Addendum No. 7, nor did they request further clarification.', 'On July 31, 2008, in a letter addressed to the state, High Steel, by way of Cardi, claimed that it had not been paid for the temporary cross frames. The state consulted Maguire, which agreed that the temporary cross frames weighed 182,873 pounds, but nevertheless recommended against payment. It did so citing Addendum No. 7, the Distribution of Quantities, and the Rhode Island Department of Transportation Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction (Blue Book). 7 As a result, the state did not pay Cardi (or High Steel) any additional amount.', 'On September 11, 2009, seeking payment for the temporary bracing, High Steel filed suit against Cardi and its surety, Safeco Insurance Company of America. On October 28, 2009, Cardi filed a third-party complaint seeking declaratory relief and indemnification from the state for any payment that High Steel might receive from Cardi. Cardi’s complaint against the state further alleged breach of contract and quantum meruit/unjust enrichment.', 'Thereafter, the state and High Steel filed separate motions for summary judgment against Cardi. 8 High Steel argued that its “bid and invoices [were] consistent with Contract 6 and 7', 'The Blue Book sets forth the state’s standard specifications for road and bridge construction. It “control[s] the work on all Rhode Island Department of Transportation construction contracts except where modified by Supplemental Specifications or the contract Special Provisions. In the event of conflict between the contract provisions and [the Blue Book], the contract provisions shall govern.” 8', 'Cardi, in a pleading filed with the Superior Court, opposed the state’s summary-judgment motion, and, in a somewhat unusual move, it joined in High Steel’s cross-motion for summary judgment against itself. From this point forward, High Steel and Cardi aligned themselves, uniting under the argument that the state breached its contract with Cardi.', '-4- Addendum No. 7,” and that “[t]he [s]tate [was] not being asked to pay more than High Steel’s original bid amount.” High Steel also averred that its contract interpretation was corroborated by its significant industry experience and general industry practice. In support of its motion for summary judgment, the state argued that High Steel’s interpretation as to how it bid other projects and general industry practice were not relevant in reviewing this contract. The state submitted that the specific and clear language of Contract 6, and the documents it incorporated by reference, supported its reading of the contract. After hearings on January 8 and April 9, 2013, the motion justice granted the state’s motion for summary judgment against Cardi with respect to the breach-of-contract claim and denied High Steel’s motion for summary judgment against Cardi.', 'The motion justice found, “based upon [his] review of the contract language and [his] review of the contract documents as a whole, primarily as outlined by the [s]tate, that the [s]tate should prevail on its motion for summary judgment.” Further, the motion justice found that:', '“[T]he clear language of the contract indicates that the structural steel is supposed', 'to be included in the price that High Steel should have accounted for, that the', 'temporary bracing should have been included in the price because that’s what the', 'item is, Grade 50 structural steel. Temporary bracing, as the evidence has', 'submitted, is not the same kind of structural steel, and the [s]tate clarified that to', 'the bidders.” He determined that, based on the clear contract language, “The word ‘incidental’ and the way that it’s interpreted would indicate that the cost of those items, and there are three items identified:', 'Temporary braces, filler bolts, and field touchup, come within the same categorization.”', '-5-', 'Judgment was entered on November 8, 2013; 9 and, on November 15, 2013, Cardi and High Steel jointly filed a notice of appeal to this Court.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“This Court reviews a trial justice’s decision to grant summary judgment de novo.” Boucher v. Sweet, 147 A.3d 71, 73 (R.I. 2016) (quoting Hyde v. Roman Catholic Bishop of Providence, 139 A.3d 452, 460 (R.I. 2016)). “We will affirm a [trial] court’s decision only if, after reviewing the admissible evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, we conclude that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Id.

Questions of law are reviewed de novo. Id. 9', 'Both High Steel and Cardi consented to a final judgment with respect to any remaining counts. Cardi consented to an adverse judgment on its surviving claims against the state, and High Steel similarly consented to an adverse judgment on its remaining claims against Cardi.', '-6-', 'III', 'Discussion', 'In their principal argument to us, appellants aver that Contract 6 and Addendum No. 7 are unambiguous and clearly require payment for temporary bracing steel.', 'Nevertheless, they alternatively argue that, if ambiguity exists, it should be construed against the state as the drafter of these documents. The state also submits that the contract is unambiguous. It reads the contract, however, to support a different interpretation: that the bracing steel was an incidental component of the structural steel. Furthermore, the state suggests that this case is procedurally deficient because Cardi did not pay a separate filing fee as required by Article I, Rule 5(a) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure and, therefore, failed to perfect its appeal. In addition, the state asserts that this Court need not reach the merits of this appeal because High Steel lacks standing to enforce its interests against the state.', 'A', 'Contract Interpretation', 'Although both parties read Contract 6 and Addendum No. 7 as clear and unambiguous, each party, in its readings, gleans divergent meanings from them. The appellants assert that the contract language “require[d] that Cardi and High Steel be paid for the weight of the temporary bracing supplied to the state.” On the other hand, the state contends that the trial justice correctly found that Contract 6 and Addendum No. 7 unambiguously required “that the weight of temporary cross braces was not to be measured separately and that all costs associated with them were incidental.”', '-7-', 'Both parties’ contract interpretations stem from the formulas that they used to calculate and interpret the bid price for Item No. 312. 10 The appellants maintain that, in accord with its experience and industry practice, 11 it “built the costs of the temporary bracing into its bid by adding the costs of the bracing to the costs of the associated structural steel and dividing that number by the sum of the weight of the temporary steel and the weight of the structural steel.”12 The state contends that “Addendum No. 7 was clear that it required the bidder to adjust its price per pound upwards to reflect that all costs associated with the temporary cross braces were included in the structural steel item of work for bid Item 312.” 13', 'Here, because we perceive no ambiguity in the relevant contract language, “our judicial role becomes quite straightforward: the plain language of the [contract] is to be applied.” Papudesu v. Medical Malpractice Joint Underwriting Association of Rhode Island, 18 A.3d 495, 498 (R.I. 2011). 14 To this end, we begin our analysis with Addendum No. 7’s plain language. 10', 'We note that use of each formula results in a different price per pound of structural steel. The state’s formula, which builds the cost (and, by implication, the weight) of temporary bracing into the cost of structural steel, produces a higher price per pound than the formula that appellants proffer. 11', 'Although we acknowledge High Steel’s vast “experience and expertise,” which includes production of “approximately 250 bridges per year, nearly all in the United States and mostly public contracts,” such experience and practice is not dispositive to interpretation of the specific language of Contract 6 and Addendum No. 7. 12', 'The appellants’ formula can be presented as:', 'Cost of Temporary Steel + Cost of Structural Steel', '------------------------------------------------------------------ = Structural Steel Price Per Pound', 'Weight of Temporary Steel + Weight of Structural Steel 13', 'This formula can be displayed as:', 'Cost of Temporary Steel + Cost of Structural Steel', '------------------------------------------------------------------ = Structural Steel Price Per Pound', 'Weight of Structural Steel 14', 'We recognize that we are first tasked with discerning whether Contract 6 and Addendum No. 7 are ambiguous. In this instance, this task is a simple one. Although “[i]t is true that there are times when a court must engage in what a poet called ‘the intolerable wrestle [w]ith words and', '-8- Without “mak[ing] a fortress out of the dictionary[,]” dictionaries aid us in discerning a word’s ordinary meaning. Garden City Treatment Center, Inc. v. Coordinated Health Partners, Inc., 852 A.2d 535, 543 (R.I. 2004) (quoting Cabell v. Markham, 148 F.2d 737, 739 (2d Cir. 1945)). Germane here, Addendum No. 7 states, “[T]emporary bracing * * * is not measured separately for payment. All costs associated with the temporary braces, filler bolts and field touch up are considered as incidental and shall be included in the structural steel items of work.” “Separate” means “[t]o set or keep apart; disunite.” The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 1587 (4th ed. 2009). “Incidental” is defined as “[o]f a minor, casual, or subordinate nature” and “[a] minor accompanying item or expense.” Id. at 886. “Include” is defined as “[t]o take in as a part, element, or member.” Id. at 887. With these definitions in mind, Addendum No. 7 instructs bidders to include all costs relative to temporary braces, filler bolts, and field touch up in the cost of structural steel, rather than individually measuring temporary bracing.', 'In addition to the definitions of the addendum language, the state’s placement of the term “temporary braces” in relation to other words in Addendum No. 7 is instructive. Importantly, Addendum No. 7 groups its treatment of “costs associated with the temporary braces” with related items, “filler bolts and field touch up.” These other items, notably, are not types of steel. Accordingly, a reading of Addendum No. 7 reveals that a contractor should treat the costs of temporary bracing the same way that it would account for costs associated with filler bolts and field touch up. Just as it would be illogical to group the weight of the filler bolts and field touch meanings[,]’ * * * this is no such time.” Papudesu v. Medical Malpractice Joint Underwriting Association of Rhode Island, 18 A.3d 495, 498 (R.I. 2011) (quoting T.S. Eliot, Four Quartets, “East Coker” pt. 2). “In fact, we do not actually construe an unambiguous contract; we simply consider the dictates of the plain language in the contract.” Id.; see also Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. v. Sullivan, 633 A.2d 684, 686 (R.I. 1993) (highlighting that when contracts are “clear and unambiguous, judicial construction is eclipsed and the contract must be applied as written”).', '-9- up with the weight of structural steel in calculating the structural steel price per pound, it would likewise be unreasonable to combine the weight of the temporary bracing—Grade 36 steel—with the weight of an entirely different steel, Grade 50 structural steel. 15', 'This Court reads the plain language of the contract in the same manner as the state and the motion justice. The contract clearly articulated that, as with the other costs associated with, but incidental to, Work Item No. 312, all costs essential to temporary bracing were to be built into the price per pound of Grade 50 structural steel. As such, because we deem the contract clear and unambiguous, we need not address appellants’ alternative arguments that flow from a determination of contract ambiguity.', 'B', 'Remaining Claims', 'Because the contract interpretation issue disposes of this instant appeal, it is not necessary to consider the state’s additional arguments regarding the failure to pay a separate filing fee or lack of standing.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the Superior Court’s judgment.

76,In re Kurt H.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The respondent, Eric H. (father or respondent), appeals from a decree of neglect as to his son, Kurt H. (the child), entered in the Family Court. The child came under the state’s care on October 6, 2014, after an alleged alcohol relapse by the child’s mother; at the time the respondent was incarcerated at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI). This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the decree of the Family Court.', 'I', 'Facts1 and Travel', 'At some point after the child’s birth in 2012 in Massachusetts, the family became involved with the Massachusetts Department of Social Services (DSS) for reasons that are not 1', 'The following facts are set forth in the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth, and Families’ statement of facts to substantiate allegations of abuse, neglect, and/or dependency and are not disputed.', '-1- germane to the issues currently on appeal. In June 2014, the family moved to an apartment in Pawtucket. Shortly thereafter, DSS contacted the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) to report that the family had relocated. In late July 2014, respondent was arrested and held on a charge of conspiracy to violate the controlled substances law; he subsequently pled to the charge and was sentenced to eighteen months at the ACI.', 'After respondent’s arrest and detention, the mother “began working” with the Family Care Community Partnership (FCCP). On October 6, 2014, the mother admitted to a FCCP agent that she had relapsed and had been drinking for several days, and that she would be evicted on October 18, 2014. Consequently, a DCYF Child Protective Investigator (CPI) “responded to the home.” In an affidavit, the CPI attested that the mother, when interviewed at her home, began “screaming and swearing[,] saying [that] she was going to drink a bottle of alcohol and kill herself.” The CPI described the mother as “belligerent” and “erratic” during this visit. The child was placed in the temporary custody of DCYF, and, on the following day, DCYF filed an ex parte petition alleging that the child was neglected. On January 22, 2015, the petition was amended to include an allegation of dependency, an allegation to which the mother pled.', 'The petition came before the Family Court for trial as to father on May 12, 2015. Before trial commenced, respondent stated that he did not “feel” he could admit to neglect because, although he was incarcerated when the child was removed, it was the mother’s relapse that caused the child to come into the state’s care. The respondent indicated that, in light of the fact that the mother had pled to dependency, he should be permitted to do so as well. The trial justice disagreed, and reminded respondent that someone incarcerated at the ACI is “not in a position to take care of [a] child.” Accordingly, the trial began and respondent was the only witness to testify.', '-2-', 'At trial, respondent testified that he had supported his family financially. Specifically, respondent testified that, at the time he was incarcerated, he left the apartment “paid for, food and pantry * * * fully stocked, diapers * * * [and] had money coming in that [he] allowed [the mother] to spend on herself and the child.”2 The respondent testified that the “money coming in” was from jobs he had completed before being incarcerated and money owed to him, and that he cashed in an IRA worth $6,000 to ensure that the mother and child “had everything they needed.”', 'At the conclusion of the testimony, the trial justice rendered a bench decision, in which she found by clear and convincing evidence that respondent was unable to care for the child due to his confinement in the ACI, and that respondent knew that the mother had alcohol problems when he left the child in her custody. The trial justice also found that respondent neglected the child by failing “to provide the child with a minimum degree of care, supervision or guardianship, and [that] the child [was] without proper parental care and supervision.” The Family Court therefore ordered the child “committed to the care, custody and control of [DCYF]” and ordered the appointment of an educational advocate for the child. A decree entered on June 1, 2015, from which respondent timely appealed.3', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'In adjudicating “allegations of dependency and neglect, the Family Court is required to make its findings by clear and convincing evidence, in accordance with Rule 17(b) of the Family Court Rules of Juvenile Proceedings.” In re Jermaine H., 9 A.3d 1227, 1231 (R.I. 2010). “The 2', 'The respondent clarified that he paid the security deposit plus first and last months’ rent on the apartment. 3', 'A subsequent decree was entered on June 8, 2015, summarizing the trial justice’s findings of fact.', '-3- clear and convincing standard of proof requires the trial justice to have a ‘clear conviction without hesitancy of the truth of the precise facts in issue.’” Id. (quoting In re Adner G., 925 A.2d 951, 957 (R.I. 2007)). Accordingly, “[t]his Court’s standard of review requires that ‘we examine the record to determine whether legally competent evidence exists in it to support findings made by the trial justice.’” Id. (quoting Adner G., 925 A.2d at 957).', 'Moreover, “the trial justice’s findings ‘are entitled to great weight and will not be reversed on appeal unless the justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence, or was otherwise clearly wrong.’” Jermaine H., 9 A.3d at 1231 (quoting In re Isabella C., 852 A.2d 550, 555 (R.I. 2004)). Therefore, “[i]n accordance with this deferential standard, it is our function to determine whether legally competent evidence exists in the record before us to support the finding, by clear and convincing evidence, that the children were dependent and that [the] respondent neglected his children.” Id.', 'III', 'A', 'Dependency Plea', 'We first address respondent’s contention that the trial justice erred in not allowing him to admit to allegations of dependency. Before the commencement of trial, respondent offered to plead to dependency, noting that the mother, whose relapse had occasioned the child’s removal from her home, had been permitted to enter such a plea. Furthermore, DCYF indicated that it was “willing to accept a dependency plea,” and that the child’s guardian ad litem, although opposing the plea, stated “if the [c]ourt [was] going to accept it, [he was] not going to vehemently object.” The trial justice nevertheless declined to accept respondent’s offered plea “because the fact that he’s incarcerated means he’s not in a position to take the child, and that', '-4- would not be dependency.” On appeal, respondent characterizes the trial justice’s refusal to accept his dependency plea as “a waste of time and judicial resources” and “supremely unfair” under the circumstances of this case.', 'A dependent child is defined under G.L. 1956 § 14-1-3(6) as:', '“any child who requires the protection and assistance of the court', 'when his or her physical or mental health or welfare is harmed, or', 'threatened with harm, due to the inability of the parent or guardian,', 'through no fault of the parent or guardian, to provide the child with', 'a minimum degree of care or proper supervision because of:', '“(i) The death or illness of a parent; or', '“(ii) The special medical, educational, or social-service', 'needs of the child which the parent is unable to provide.”', 'Dependency, therefore, is by definition a condition involving harm or potential harm to a child that arises without fault by the parent. If the parent’s inability to provide the child with a minimum degree of care or proper supervision is a result of the parent’s incarceration, it can hardly be argued that the parent is without fault. In the case under review, the reason for respondent’s incarceration was his decision to engage in criminal activity. We recognize that prior to his incarceration, respondent made admirable efforts to provide for his family as best he could. He was well aware, however, of the mother’s history of alcoholism and the fact that she had prior involvement with DCYF and that she has two other children who were currently being cared for by her parents. When her relapse occurred, only nine weeks after his initial detention, respondent was not in a position to care for the child. Clearly, the decision to accept or reject a plea is discretionary with a trial justice. Here, we cannot say that the trial justice abused her discretion in this regard.', '-5-', 'B', 'Parental Neglect', 'On appeal, respondent argues that the trial justice clearly erred in finding that the child had been neglected by him. The respondent contends that he did not neglect his child because “[h]e worked hard,” kept the “household * * * in good order,” and “did all he could do to financially support [the child] * * * for as long as possible.” At trial, respondent testified that the home was furnished, there was adequate food, toys, and clothing for the child, and the rent was paid before his incarceration. The trial justice, however, found by clear and convincing evidence that respondent was not able to care for the child due to his eighteen-month sentence at the ACI. Significantly, the trial justice also found that respondent was aware of the mother’s alcohol issues.', 'Based upon our review of the record, we are of the opinion that legally competent evidence exists to support the trial justice’s findings of neglect. At the outset, we note that DCYF brought a neglect petition under the provisions of two discrete chapters of the general laws—chapter 1 of title 14 and G.L. 1956 chapter 11 of title 40. Section 14-1-3(8) provides:', '“‘Neglect’ means a child who requires the protection and', 'assistance of the court when his or her physical or mental health or', 'welfare is harmed, or threatened with harm, when the parents or', 'guardian:', '“(i) Fails to supply the child with adequate food, clothing,', 'shelter, or medical care, though financially able to do so or offered', 'financial or other reasonable means to do so;', '“(ii) Fails to provide the child proper education as required', 'by law; or', '“(iii) Abandons and/or deserts the child.” Section 40-11-2(1)(v), moreover, provides that an:', '“‘Abused and/or neglected child’ means a child whose', 'physical or mental health or welfare is harmed, or threatened with', '-6-', 'harm, when his or her parent or other person responsible for his or', 'her welfare:', '“* * *', '“Fails to provide the child with a minimum degree of care', 'or proper supervision or guardianship because of his or her', 'unwillingness or inability to do so by situations or conditions such', 'as, but not limited to: social problems, mental incompetency, or the', 'use of a drug, drugs, or alcohol to the extent that the parent or other', 'person responsible for the child’s welfare loses his or her ability or', 'is unwilling to properly care for the child[.]”', 'The fact that an individual in prison lacks the ability to provide personally for a child’s physical needs is perhaps a tautology. That is not to say, however, that the individual is necessarily unable to make suitable arrangements for the care and supervision of his or her child. The welfare of an incarcerated individual’s child may not even be at issue in situations where the child remains in the care of the other parent or a guardian, as long as the other parent or guardian is capable of providing appropriate care. In this case, respondent’s family was seemingly in a relatively stable situation when he was initially detained, and the child’s mother was by all accounts sober. Yet respondent had made no provisions for the child’s welfare in the event that the mother experienced a relapse. The respondent was well aware of the mother’s history of alcohol and substance abuse, as well as the fact that two of her children were in the care of the mother’s parents.', 'Notwithstanding his good intentions, the respondent was unable to protect the child precisely because of his incarceration. “It is quite clear on [the] record that when events did unfold that put the child[ ] at risk”—here, the mother’s relapse—the respondent failed to provide the child with a minimum degree of care or proper supervision or guardianship “because he was incarcerated and no other individual was legally authorized to act on his behalf in assuming care of the child[ ].” In re T.T.C., 855 A.2d 1117, 1121 (D.C. 2004). The respondent testified that, when he was first incarcerated, the mother was “clean, sober, and with her family[;] she was', '-7- doing fine.” Nevertheless, he called her “two, three times a day” and “also had friends and family checking in.” When the child was removed from his mother’s care on October 6, 2014, and when DCYF filed the neglect petition on October 7, 2014, and the child was placed in the temporary custody of DCYF, the respondent was unable to provide for the child because of his incarceration. When the case was tried and a decision rendered on May 12, 2015, the respondent had made no arrangements for the child’s well-being and was unable himself to care for the child because of his incarceration. We are well satisfied that more than sufficient competent evidence exists on the record to support the finding of neglect.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the decree of the Family Court finding the child neglected as to the father and committing the child to the care, custody, and control of DCYF.

77,:,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. The respondent, Anthony Bucci (respondent or Bucci), appeals from an order terminating his parental rights based on the abandonment of his daughter, Livia, and from the granting of Derek Gray’s petition to adopt her. This matter came before the Supreme Court on November 30, 2016, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why this Court should not summarily decide the issues raised by this appeal. After hearing the arguments of counsel and reviewing the memoranda of the parties, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown. Thus, we shall decide the matter without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the order of the Family Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Livia was born to Marissa Levesque 1 and respondent, Bucci, on April 28, 2004. At the time of Livia’s birth, Levesque was seventeen years of age and respondent was twenty years of age. They were not married and lived in separate households. On March 15, 2013, Levesque and Gray filed a joint Family Court petition for the termination of respondent’s parental rights and for the adoption of Livia by Gray. A trial on the matter took place on March 25, April 15, and April 22, 2014. 1', 'Although Marissa Levesque’s married name is now Marissa Gray, we shall refer to her by her maiden name to avoid confusion.', '-1-', 'Gray testified first. He stated that he lives with Levesque, Livia, and another daughter that he had with Levesque. He stated that he began dating Levesque in late 2008, he met Livia in early 2009, and they began living together in the spring of 2010. Gray testified that he married Levesque in September 2012. He testified that he played a significant positive role in Livia’s life as a father figure and that, since 2010, Livia has called him “Dad.” Further, Gray stated that he supported Livia financially, which included setting up a college fund for her. He believed the last time respondent saw Livia was in the spring of 2009. For all of these reasons, Gray and Levesque jointly filed a petition for Gray to adopt Livia pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 15-7-5(b). 2', 'Levesque testified next. She confirmed that, from Livia’s birth until she was five years old, Levesque’s relationship with respondent was “on and off and when it was good for him.” She stated that they would “get involved a bit, fall off, and [he would] do whatever was best for him and let [Livia] down and start over and repeat.” Levesque also testified that, during Livia’s life, respondent was incarcerated “[m]ore often than not,” which impacted their relationship.', 'Levesque confirmed that significant Family Court activity occurred between her and respondent, including a restraining order she obtained against him, and visitation and child- support issues. Levesque testified that respondent did not partake in usual visitation, and it depended on “if [Levesque and respondent] were good.” She stated that she always supervised visits because she felt it was necessary. She recalled a period in 2010 where a justice of the Family Court granted respondent supervised visitation, but she noted that only one such visit 2', 'General Laws 1956 § 15-7-5(b) permits the filing of an adoption petition “when the petitioners are one of the natural parents of the child and his or her spouse * * * and the child is residing, at the time the petition is filed, with the petitioners * * * .” The purpose of this statute is to permit a stepparent to jointly “file an adoption petition and become a co-parent along with a natural, custodial parent.” In re Abby D., 839 A.2d 1222, 1223 n.3 (R.I. 2004). “To do this, the stepparent * * * must obtain the consent of that natural, custodial parent. Pursuant to the statute, the custodial parent expresses this consent by joining the petition.” Id. Thus, in filing an adoption petition with Gray, Levesque consented and supported Gray’s desire to adopt Livia.', '-2- occurred. She described this visit as “[p]robably one of the worst days of my life as a parent to see my child literally attached to my neck and my waist and would not get off me.” 3', 'Prior to the 2010 visit, Levesque stated that respondent’s last visit with Livia was shortly after Christmas in 2009, during which visit respondent spent very little time with the child. She described Livia’s relationship with respondent at this point as “kind of awkward for her, but she knew who he was and * * * I always covered for him.” When asked whether respondent maintained regular contact with Livia prior to the 2009 visit, Levesque responded, “No.”', 'Levesque also discussed child support. She stated that although a child-support order was entered against respondent, he filed multiple motions to reduce it. Moreover, she testified that neither respondent nor anyone on his behalf paid child support from 2005 until the day of her testimony in 2014. She stated that, since the supervised visit in 2010, respondent had not moved for further visitation; however, he did move to modify the child support order in 2013.', 'On cross-examination, she testified that she periodically brought Livia to respondent’s mother’s house, where respondent resided in 2009. She testified that respondent and Livia did not have a set visitation schedule, and she confirmed that she controlled whether or not to permit visitation. When asked whether respondent ever gave Livia gifts, she stated, “At some point in Livia’s life [respondent] has gotten her some clothing here and there when she was very little.” Levesque further testified that respondent’s mother bought Livia gifts but “never gave [her] money or support in any way.”', 'Further, Levesque testified that, although one supervised visit occurred, she could not recall how many were scheduled. She testified about a letter that she sent to respondent in prison 3', 'At oral argument, petitioners’ attorney indicated that, after this visit, he filed an emergency motion to terminate or modify visitation; however, in light of the fact that respondent was incarcerated before the hearing date, the motion passed.', '-3- and his response to it. She stated that in the letter, she requested that he give up his rights to Livia, but she stated that respondent refused.', 'Next, respondent testified.', 'He indicated that, at the time of his testimony, he was incarcerated at the Adult Correctional Institutions, serving an eight-year sentence as a result of a plea bargain for a robbery charge. 4 With respect to supervised visitation, respondent stated that he should have had ten visits, but only one occurred. He indicated that, since his incarceration, he unsuccessfully filed one visitation motion. Yet, he confirmed that he successfully filed a motion to suspend his child support, which was denied.', 'The respondent indicated that he was under a child-support order.', 'When he was employed up until his incarceration in December of 2010, he stated, he paid support through the State of Rhode Island, which he said was deducted directly from his paychecks. The respondent indicated that, because he lacked funds since he was incarcerated, he had a support arrearage of approximately $18,000 and had an order to pay “$50 a week and arrears.” 5 He also testified that he had a prison bank account, to which his mother added about $30 to $40 each week. He stated that he asked his mother to send Livia funds on his behalf; however, he stated, “[Levesque] would not accept it.”', 'The respondent testified regarding his last visitation with Livia at the courthouse in 2010, and acknowledged that she did not want to see him. He stated that Levesque arrived at the visit with her father. He also noted that Livia initially was crying and appeared shy, but, “[S]he got back to normal, coloring, laughing, joking around.” He stated that, during the visit, Livia called 4', 'Although incarcerated at the time of trial, in his prebriefing statement filed with this Court, respondent indicated that he was paroled on July 26, 2015. 5', 'The respondent’s testimony regarding child support was far from a model of clarity. In earlier testimony, he indicated that he was not under a child-support order—just an agreement with Levesque to pay support. He also fluctuated as to the amount owed, stating at one point during trial that he owed “$40 a week.”', '-4- him “Daddy.” He testified that Levesque was court-ordered to provide him with ten visitations;6 but he claimed that, despite showing up nine out of ten times, Levesque showed up only once.', 'The respondent testified that, since his incarceration on December 14, 2010, he had sent no more than five cards to Livia and two or three letters to Levesque inquiring about Livia. He stated that “[Levesque] responded to me with a letter speaking about [how she] wants me to sign my rights off to my daughter and now my daughter has a new father.” He testified that he wrote to Levesque again eighteen months after he was incarcerated to “tell her [he] would be coming home soon and [he] would like to get the relationship back with [his] daughter * * * .” When asked to whom he addressed the cards, he stated that he sent them to Levesque’s father’s house. On cross-examination, he acknowledged that he did not make copies of the cards he purportedly sent to Livia.', 'He testified that, when he dated Levesque, he saw his daughter daily and “paid for everything.” The respondent stated that, before he went to jail, he had a “very good” relationship with Livia. He introduced several photographs of Livia, his family, and himself, which depicted “good times.” Importantly, however, respondent’s attorney stipulated that all of the photographs were taken no later than 2009.', 'He testified that, before his most recent incarceration, he was sentenced once for sixty days and once for thirty days. He disagreed with Levesque’s testimony that he had been incarcerated more often than not during Livia’s childhood. In response to a question posed on direct examination, respondent testified that he made two or three motions for visitation during Livia’s lifetime. 6', 'At oral argument, respondent’s attorney indicated that out of the ten visits ordered, five were scheduled prior to respondent’s incarceration. In his prebriefing statement, respondent suggests that these visits were scheduled throughout November and December of 2010.', '-5-', 'The respondent’s mother (Livia’s grandmother), Jean Bucci, testified next. She indicated that, at some point in the spring of 2010, her relationship with Livia ceased. She noted that before that point she could see Livia if her son and Levesque were together; otherwise, her access was limited.', 'She testified that, although in 2009 she could bring Livia Christmas presents, Levesque would not allow visits with or presents from respondent. She also stated that she repeatedly inquired whether Levesque needed anything for Livia.', 'On April 22, 2014, the trial justice issued a bench decision terminating respondent’s parental rights. The trial justice deemed respondent unfit based on abandonment grounds. 7 Further, the trial justice granted Gray’s adoption petition, finding it in Livia’s best interests. An order was entered terminating respondent’s parental rights on March 31, 2015. The respondent timely appealed.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'On review of “a decree terminating parental rights, ‘we remain keenly mindful that natural parents have a fundamental liberty interest in the care, custody, and management of their children.’” In re Jake G., 126 A.3d 450, 456 (R.I. 2015) (quoting In re Jah-nell B., 116 A.3d 784, 791 (R.I. 2015)). “This Court reviews the record to determine whether legal and competent evidence lends support to the trial justice’s ruling.” Id. To this end, we assign great weight to a trial justice’s findings, which we will not overturn unless “clearly wrong or the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence.” Id. (quoting In re Jah-nell B., 116 A.3d at 791). Permanent severance of parental rights must be grounded in the trial justice’s parental-unfitness 7', 'Although the trial justice heard testimony for termination of parental rights on two grounds— failure to pay child support and abandonment—he deemed the abandonment issue determinative and therefore did not consider the failure to pay child support.', '-6- determination, which requires proof “by clear and convincing evidence in order to satisfy the parent’s right to due process.” Id. (quoting In re Jah-nell B., 116 A.3d at 791). Nevertheless, “upon a determination of parental unfitness, the best interests of the child outweigh all other considerations.” Id. (quoting In re Jah-nell B., 116 A.3d at 791). With respect to the review of adoption petitions, § 15-7-5(b)(2) sets forth that “[t]he standard of proof in these cases shall be by clear and convincing evidence and the court shall give primary consideration to the physical, psychological, mental, and intellectual needs of the child * * * .”', 'III', 'Discussion', 'In determining whether the trial justice erred in finding that respondent abandoned his daughter, Livia, we are guided by § 15-7-7(a)(4), which provides for termination of parental rights where “[t]he parent has abandoned or deserted the child. A lack of communication or contact with the child for at least a six (6) month period shall constitute prima facie evidence of abandonment or desertion.”', 'The respondent contends that because, in his view, he overcame the abandonment presumption, the trial justice erred in his finding. 8 Specifically, respondent argues that the trial justice based his determination “solely on proof of [respondent’s] incarceration.”', 'The respondent further asserts that the trial justice ignored evidence of “[respondent’s] pre- incarceration attempts to seek visitation with his daughter,” “that [respondent] sent cards to Livia 8', 'At the outset, we note that the trial justice also granted petitioners’ adoption petition in his bench decision. Based on his review of the evidence, the trial justice was satisfied that granting the petition aligned with Livia’s best interests. Specifically, he found that “petitioners [were] able to furnish [Livia] with suitable nurture, care and education having reference to the degree and condition of these parents * * * ” and, therefore, deemed Livia “for all legal intents and purposes the child of” Gray and Levesque. Importantly, however, respondent does not press this issue on appeal, and thus we limit our discussion to the abandonment determination.', '-7- during his incarceration and that he made attempts to communicate with Livia through her mother,” and of Levesque’s lack of cooperation in facilitating visits. The respondent contends that the trial justice “completely overlooked [the aforementioned] testimony in reaching his decision.”', 'We deem respondent’s arguments unavailing.', 'While we agree that more than incarceration is necessary to prove abandonment, here we are satisfied that legally competent evidence supported the trial justice’s determination to the requisite clear and convincing evidence standard. He based his decision on “[his] assessment of the credibility of the witnesses, [his] weighing of the exhibits, and * * * the [c]ourt’s belief of what is the most pertinent and relevant evidence * * * .” The trial justice found that “[t]he evidence [was] clear * * * that [respondent] has had no contact with Livia since November of 2010” and “[t]he only efforts [respondent has] made to have contact since that time is a motion [seeking visitation] filed in February of 2013.”', 'Additionally, the trial justice noted that the Family Court clerk’s office rejected that motion, after which respondent did not attempt to refile it. The trial justice noted that while the clerk’s office rejected this single motion for visitation, respondent successfully filed at least two motions for relief from child support. He stated, “It’s really a mystery to me why the visitation motion couldn’t get on [the calendar] if the motion for relief could have gotten on, but it was not and [respondent] never tried again to have his motion for visitation heard.” He also recalled pictures introduced of respondent, his family, the Levesque family, and Livia, which “look[ed] like there were a lot of good times.” However, he emphasized that each picture related back to 2009 or earlier. The trial justice noted that respondent did not provide anything of “recent vintage.” As such, the trial justice found that “[r]espondent has had no contact with the child', '-8- Livia since November of 2010 and that more than six months have elapsed since that time.” Accordingly, the trial justice found that respondent abandoned Livia, and therefore, he terminated respondent’s parental rights and granted the adoption petition.', 'This Court is not insensitive to “the ‘drastic and irreversible’ nature of a decree terminating parental rights * * * .” In re Max M., 116 A.3d 185, 193 (R.I. 2015) (quoting In re Steven D., 23 A.3d 1138, 1154 (R.I. 2011)). “[D]ue process requires that, before * * * a parent’s rights in his or her children” are terminated, clear and convincing evidence must support the termination allegations. Id. (quoting In re Steven D., 23 A.3d at 1155).

Our standard of great deference to the trial justice confines our determination to “whether any legally competent evidence exists to support the trial justice’s findings.” Id. (quoting In re Robert S., 840 A.2d 1146, 1149 (R.I. 2004)).', 'Although respondent correctly notes that the trial justice did not explicitly reference his testimony that he mailed Livia “no more than five” cards and sent Levesque letters, this is not akin to misconception or oversight, or otherwise clear error in the trial justice’s decision. Indeed, “[w]e reject the suggestion that a trial justice must resolve every disputed factual contention that may arise during a trial.” Notarantonio v. Notarantonio, 941 A.2d 138, 147 (R.I. 2008). “A trial justice need not ‘categorically accept or reject each piece of evidence in his decision for this Court to uphold it because implicit in the trial justice[’]s decision are sufficient findings of fact to support his rulings.’” Id. (quoting Narragansett Electric Co. v. Carbone, 898 A.2d 87, 102 (R.I. 2006)).

(quoting Mattera v. Mattera, 669 A.2d 538, 541 (R.I. 1996)). Here, respondent’s argument is belied by the trial justice’s factual finding in his order that respondent “has not made any reasonable effort to see or contact the child Livia since November of the year 2010.” This finding suggests that, rather than misconception or oversight, the trial justice heard and disbelieved respondent, or otherwise found respondent’s attempts at contact insufficient.', 'Further, this decision falls squarely within this Court’s recognition that a parent’s sporadic attempts to contact his or her child are inadequate to rebut a prima facie case of abandonment. See In re Serenity K., 891 A.2d 881, 884 (R.I. 2006) (characterizing evidence of the respondent’s telephone calls as “meager attempts to maintain contact” insufficient to overcome abandonment finding); In re Ariel N., 892 A.2d 80, 86-87 (R.I. 2006) (affirming trial justice’s abandonment finding despite testimony that the respondent mailed children infrequent cards and letters).

The plaintiff, Bellevue-Ochre Point Neighborhood Association (BOPNA or plaintiff), appeals from the Superior Court’s dismissal of its declaratory judgment action in favor of the defendant, the Preservation Society of Newport County (the society or defendant). This appeal arises from the society’s application for the construction of a Welcome Center (Welcome Center) near the entrance of the Newport mansion, the Breakers. The proposed Welcome Center would be approximately 3,650 square feet and would contain areas for ticket sales, refreshment sales, and restrooms.', 'BOPNA initiated a declaratory judgment action in the Superior Court, pursuant to the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (UDJA), G.L. 1956 chapter 30 of title 9, seeking various declarations that the Welcome Center is prohibited under the City of Newport Zoning Ordinance (the zoning ordinance). The society moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), (6) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure and § 9-30-6, and plaintiff objected.', 'A justice of the Superior Court heard the matter and found for the society. He concluded that the issues raised in BOPNA’s complaint were “within the jurisdiction and authority of the Newport zoning officials to determine * * * and inappropriate for resolution in an action seeking', '-1- declaratory judgment.”', 'Accordingly, the hearing justice declined BOPNA’s request for declaratory judgment and dismissed the action.

In 1972, the society purchased the Breakers from Gladys Vanderbilt’s heirs. At present, it continues to operate the Breakers as a museum, attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors each year.', 'When the society first began operating the Breakers as a museum, its use was permitted by right pursuant to the zoning ordinance. In 1977, however, the zoning ordinance was amended to permit museums in the R-60 zone where the Breakers is located through a “special exception” granted by the City of Newport Zoning Board of Review (the zoning board). 1 In 1997, the society applied for a special use permit to construct a twelve-foot-by-twelve-foot shed on the Breakers to house a vending machine for patrons awaiting entrance. The shed was to “be located in existing natural screening and * * * not be visible off the premises.” The zoning board granted the special use permit.', 'In May 2013, the society initiated the administrative process for the construction of the Welcome Center by applying to the Newport Historic District Commission (HDC) for a 1', 'While the 1977 zoning ordinance used the term “special exception,” the current zoning ordinance employs the term “special use permit.”', '-2- certificate of appropriateness. 2 After the HDC denied its application, the Society appealed to the zoning board. In a decision dated March 1, 2014, the zoning board reversed the HDC’s decision and found that the proposed Welcome Center complied with Newport’s historic zoning provisions. 3', 'On March 7, 2014, BOPNA, a nonprofit corporation comprised of property owners and residents in Newport’s Bellevue-Ochre Point Neighborhood, brought this declaratory judgment action in the Superior Court. 4 In its action, BOPNA sought the following declarations: the Breakers is a lawful nonconforming use, and the Welcome Center’s construction would be a prohibited movement or change in the land’s nonconforming use; the Welcome Center will house a restaurant, and the zoning ordinance prohibits restaurant operation on museum property; and, lastly, the Welcome Center is an unpermitted accessory use on the Breakers property.', 'The society moved to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), (6), and § 9-30-6.

Rather, “[BOPNA] place[d] the ‘cart’ well before the ‘horse’” by “speculat[ing] and assum[ing] that the [z]oning [b]oard” will not consider their concerns about the Welcome Center. BOPNA opposed the motion, arguing that its complaint presented “a justiciable controversy ripe for judicial determination.” It further asserted that a civil action in the Superior Court was “the only avenue” to resolve the issues raised in its complaint.', 'A justice of the Superior Court heard the parties on the society’s motion to dismiss on June 2, 2014, and, on July 18, 2014, he granted the motion. 5 In his written decision, the hearing justice found it unnecessary to address the issue of BOPNA’s standing because he determined that the issues raised in its complaint were inappropriate for a declaratory judgment action, as the zoning board could and should resolve them.', 'The hearing justice also discussed BOPNA’s failure to exhaust its administrative remedies. He noted the exceptions to the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies: when a complaint seeks a declaration that an ordinance or rule is unconstitutional or exceeds statutory powers or that the agency lacks jurisdiction. The hearing justice concluded that neither of the exceptions applied because the zoning board possessed the jurisdiction to determine the complaint’s issues. He noted that both the Zoning Enabling Act, G.L. 1956 § 45-24-57, and the zoning ordinance grant local zoning officials the authority to interpret zoning ordinances, and, therefore, BOPNA’s claims seeking interpretations of the zoning ordinance fell squarely within 5', 'On August 25, 2014, the decision was amended.', '-4- the zoning board’s authority. The hearing justice found that “[a]ll the declarations that BOPNA requests this [c]ourt to make are part and parcel of an everyday review of a building application by municipal zoning officials: in the first instance by the zoning officer, then on review by the [z]oning [b]oard.” Accordingly, he declined BOPNA’s request for declaratory judgment and granted the society’s motion to dismiss. On September 9, 2014, BOPNA filed this appeal.', 'While this appeal was pending, the society filed an application with the zoning board for a modification of its 1997 special use permit.', 'After conducting evidentiary hearings and considering testimony, exhibits, arguments, and written submissions, the zoning board issued a written decision granting the society’s special use permit application.', 'The zoning board discussed the seven factors 6 it considered in reaching its decision, and ultimately concluded that the Welcome Center was “in accord with the public convenience and welfare.”', 'In its decision, the zoning board also addressed—and rejected—many of the arguments raised in BOPNA’s complaint.', 'It rejected BOPNA’s contention that the Breakers is a nonconforming use that cannot be altered or moved, noting that the Breakers was granted a special use permit in 1997 and, thus, is not a nonconforming use. It addressed BOPNA’s argument that the zoning ordinance prohibited “restaurants” in the R-60 district, noting that neither the Breakers nor the Welcome Center would be “an establishment whose principal business is the sale of foods.” Rather, “[t]he refreshment service aspect is, by all metrics, not the principal activity of the [W]elcome [C]enter.” Specifically, the zoning board noted that the 6', 'The factors include: “the nature of the proposed site, including its size and shape and the proposed size, shape, and arrangement of the proposed structure”; “the resulting traffic patterns and adequacy of proposed off street parking and loading”; “the nature of the surrounding area and the extent to which the proposed use or feature will be in harmony with the surrounding area”; “the proximity of dwellings, churches, schools, public buildings and other places of public gathering”; “the fire hazard resulting from the nature of the proposed buildings and uses and the proximity of existing buildings and uses”; “all standards contained in this Zoning Code”; and “the comprehensive plan for the City.”', '-5- Welcome Center would sell only prepackaged items, would not serve alcohol, and would not contain a kitchen, food preparation facilities, a stove, a microwave, or a dishwasher. Additionally, it would sell refreshments only to ticketed guests during normal museum hours and would not have special events, functions, live music, or entertainment. Further, the Welcome Center would be “concealed in a grove of trees and will not be seen – or heard – from Ochre Point Avenue or any surrounding properties.”', 'Accordingly, the zoning board granted the society’s special use permit application. 7', 'On appeal, BOPNA argues that the hearing justice was required to hear and decide its request for declaratory judgment because an interpretation of the zoning ordinance is “to be determined exclusively by the courts.” BOPNA also argues that the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies does not apply. Lastly, BOPNA asks this Court to “go beyond the immediate issues of the [S]uperior [C]ourt’s error in dismissing BOPNA’s complaint, and determine the underlying issues of the interpretation of the Ordinance.” Specifically, it asks us to determine whether the zoning ordinance prohibits the Welcome Center because: the Breakers is a nonconforming use within the R-60 zone and construction of the Welcome Center would constitute a prohibited movement or change in a non-confirming use; the Welcome Center would house a restaurant that the zoning ordinance prohibits on museum property; and the Welcome Center is a prohibited accessory use under the zoning ordinance. 7', 'BOPNA, as one of the named plaintiffs, appealed the zoning board’s decision to the Superior Court, Kahn v. Kirwin, CA No. NC 2015-56, but it was dismissed for lack of standing under the zoning ordinance and zoning enabling act. BOPNA’s petition for a writ of certiorari before this Court, Kahn v.

The defendant argues that the hearing justice “reached the essential merits of the case in a manner tantamount to summary judgment.” Therefore, the society submits that we should review the converted motion for summary judgment de novo.

In Olean, a local zoning board upheld the denial of the property owner’s application because the property’s use was never established as legal.

Specifically, BOPNA references the case arising from its appeal of the zoning board’s decision: Kahn v. Kirwin, CA No. NC 2015-56.

Construction Corp., exhausting administrative remedies was not futile because, at the time of the hearing justice’s decision in this case, the zoning board had the authority to consider the issues raised in BOPNA’s complaint. The zoning board had not yet rendered a decision on the proposed Welcome Center; and, at that time, BOPNA had a mechanism, through the zoning board, to pursue the issues asserted in its complaint. Importantly, BOPNA did in fact utilize the available administrative remedies by participating in the proceedings before the zoning board and appealing its decision to the Superior Court in Kahn.

When Salvati received notice of Pariseault’s withdrawal from the project, he had signed lien waivers for all payments received up to that point.', 'Thomas Rezendes, Pariseault’s general manager, testified next.

He described it as a “cost-plus project,” which meant that the Andreozzis were to complete outstanding work independently.', 'When asked whether “Pariseault Builders ever pa[id] A Salvati Masonry for the patio in the rear of the building?” Rezendes responded, “[a]ll we paid Salvati Masonry for what would have been * * * the cultured stone on the walls, steps and columns which surround the patio, but not the patio pavers itself.” He confirmed that he understood that Salvati never submitted a bid for the home’s rear patio; and, when asked whether Pariseault paid Salvati for the patio or the blocks themselves, he stated that he did not think so. Rezendes also testified that he was aware that Mr. Andreozzi was responsible for paying Salvati for all work after March 2013, regardless of whether or not the work was a part of the original Pariseault subcontract.', 'A bench trial was held on June 1 through June 3, 2015.

Salvati cites testimony to assert that “Salvati never bid on the patio, * * * never was paid by Pariseault, nor did Pariseault ever bill Andreozzi.” Further, Salvati states, “It seems that the [c]ourt felt that Salvati bid on the total project, including the patio, and was paid in full when in fact those facts are incorrect.” Yet, the trial justice found, “there was no testimony or exhibit which set forth with specificity any new items, outside the bid/subcontract for which Mr. Andreozzi was responsible, nor any price or scope of work for such items.” The trial justice determined that “Salvati failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence what masonry work was completed outside the original project scope, and the amount that remained unpaid as to that work.” Further, he found “insufficient credible evidence from which the Court could distinguish which items involved completion of the original subcontract, and which items were completed by Salvati at the direct request of Mr. Andreozzi.” Based on the evidence at trial, or lack thereof, the trial justice was not convinced that the Andreozzis owed Salvati money for the patio outside of the original Pariseault subcontract.', '“It is well-established that we ‘accord a great deal of respect to the factual determinations and credibility assessments made by the judicial officer * * * who has had an opportunity to appraise witness demeanor and to take into account other realities that cannot be grasped from a', '-6- reading of a cold record.’” State v.

A careful review of the record reveals that the trial justice neither overlooked nor misconceived material evidence.

The defendant, Michael Ciresi (Ciresi or defendant), appeals the denial of his motion to reduce his sentence. This case came before the Supreme Court on November 30, 2016, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided.', 'After hearing the arguments of counsel and reviewing the parties’ memoranda, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown. Accordingly, we shall decide the appeal at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The facts underlying this case are set forth in State v. Ciresi, 45 A.3d 1201, 1210 (R.I. 2012), where this Court affirmed defendant’s nine-count criminal conviction. Those counts included: burglary, conspiracy to commit burglary, use of a firearm when committing a crime of violence, attempted larceny, receiving stolen goods, harboring a criminal, and obstructing justice. Id. The aggregate sentences for all of Ciresi’s convictions totaled thirty-five years, with twenty', '-1- years to serve and fifteen years suspended with probation, to run concurrently, and a ten-year suspended sentence to run consecutively. 1', 'On October 31, 2012, subsequent to our opinion, defendant moved to reduce his sentence pursuant to Rule 35 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. In his motion, Ciresi asserted that, since beginning his sentence, he has accepted responsibility for his decisions. He noted the numerous programs he has participated in and completed while incarcerated, including one leading to his receipt of a college degree. Ciresi maintained that his efforts to better himself while in prison “are demonstrative of the tenor and extent of his sincerity, his acceptance of responsibility, remorse and resolution to be an honest, useful member of society.” The defendant also referenced the hardship of parenting his two sons while in prison.', 'Ciresi then argued that his sentence violated the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution because it exceeded the guidelines set forth in the Superior Court Sentencing Benchmarks (the benchmarks). Specifically, he asserted that the sentence for one count of burglary (thirty-five years, with twenty to serve and fifteen suspended) exceeded benchmark 5’s 1', 'For each of defendant’s nine convictions, the trial justice imposed the following sentences:', '“(1) one year to serve for misdemeanor receipt of stolen goods; (2)', 'ten years to serve for attempted larceny from the ATM machine;', '(3) five years to serve for the harboring of Darryl Streeper; (4) one', 'year to serve for obstruction of justice; (5) thirty-five years, twenty', 'years to serve and fifteen suspended, with probation, for the East', 'Avenue burglary; (6) ten years to serve for conspiracy to commit', 'the East Avenue burglary; (7) ten years to serve, consecutive to the', 'East Avenue burglary sentence, but suspended, for the firearm', 'charge; (8) ten years to serve for the Charles Street burglary; and', '(9) ten years to serve for conspiring to commit the Charles Street', 'burglary.

Ciresi,', '45 A.3d 1201, 1210 (R.I. 2012).', '-2- sentencing range. 2 The defendant contended that his one-year sentence for receiving stolen goods and his ten-year sentence for attempted larceny also surpassed the guidelines set forth in benchmark 19 3 and benchmark 15, 4 respectively. He argued that “a large departure [from the recommended guidelines] may be viewed as a ‘cruel and unusual’ [sic] in violation of the Eighth Amendment * * * .” The Defendant also cited to State v. Hall, 940 A.2d 645 (R.I. 2008), for the proposition “that all facts that increased the maximum sentence of a defendant, except for prior convictions, must be found by a jury.” Id. at 657 (citing Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296, 301 (2004)). In this regard, Ciresi argued that his severe sentence was based on the fact that he was a police officer when the crimes were planned and carried out, which was not proved to a jury.', 'On May 12, 2014, a justice of the Superior Court heard the parties on Ciresi’s motion. 5 His attorney first noted defendant’s involvement and participation in various programs while incarcerated. He also asked the court to consider defendant’s sons, arguing that “it’s a very meaningful part of his life and one that he would very much like to connect with.” Before defendant spoke, the hearing justice noted defendant’s decision not to allocute at his sentencing because he intended to appeal the decision. Ciresi, appearing via video from prison, expressed regret and shame for his conduct, and said that he accepted responsibility for his actions. 2', 'Benchmark 5 recommends a sentence of seven to ten years for breaking and entering an occupied dwelling without consent of the owner or tenant, at night, with or without a weapon. 3', 'Benchmark 19 suggests a sentence of “[l]ess than jail,” for a first offense of receiving stolen goods over $500. 4', 'Benchmark 15 recommends a sentence of three to five years for a repeat offense of larceny over $500. Ciresi’s conviction for attempted larceny provides for “the same punishment which might have been inflicted if the attempted offense had been committed.” G.L. 1956 § 11-41-6. 5', 'This Court notes that the hearing justice who heard defendant’s motion to reduce his sentence is the same justice of the Superior Court who presided over defendant’s original trial.', '-3-', 'In a decision dated May 30, 2014, the hearing justice denied Ciresi’s motion. He rejected defendant’s “rehabilitative advancement while an inmate” as a basis to reduce sentence, because “[p]roper inmate deportment * * * is expected” and also irrelevant in determining a motion to reduce a sentence. The hearing justice also rejected Ciresi’s argument concerning the hardship that his incarceration had on his sons, finding that “parenthood is simply not a justifiable excuse for dispensing with meaningful punishment for the commission of serious criminal offenses.”', 'The hearing justice rejected defendant’s contention that his sentence was impermissibly long in comparison to the benchmarks because the guidelines’ recommendations are not mandatory.', 'He noted that the benchmarks provide examples where guideline departure is appropriate, and he singled out three as applicable: (1) “circumstances of the commission of the crime,” (2) whether the crime was an “isolated offense,” and (3) “other substantial grounds” that might mitigate or aggravate culpability. With these in mind, the hearing justice noted that defendant did not merely commit an “isolated offense.” Rather, Ciresi committed five of the nine offenses on different occasions, planned two burglaries, and provided “tools of violence” for the commission of both. Citing to Ciresi, 45 A.3d at 1214, 1216, he found that defendant’s other convictions, coupled with additional bad acts, 6 “demonstrated Ciresi’s pattern of cultivating and protecting criminal informants in his role as a police officer for his own financial and professional gain * * * [and] were segments of a common scheme or plan * * * .” The hearing justice rejected defendant’s assertion that his sentence was impermissibly long and found it “commensurate with the gravity of the crimes he committed.” Accordingly, he denied the motion to reduce sentence. 6', 'The additional bad acts that the hearing justice referenced included thirty-seven acts of defendant’s misconduct, which were brought out at the original trial. The hearing justice appended a list of those acts to his order.', '-4-', 'On June 12, 2014, Ciresi appealed the denial of his motion. He is challenging the constitutionality of the benchmarks, and raises two specific constitutional violations. First, he argues that his sentence violates the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, section 15 of the Rhode Island Constitution because it relies on factual findings not proved to the jury. Second, Ciresi contends that the sentence constitutes cruel and unusual punishment, in contravention of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, section 8 of the Rhode Island Constitution.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', ""“A motion to reduce sentence under Rule 35 is essentially a plea for leniency.” State v.

Ruffner, 5 A.3d 864, 867 (R.I. 2010)). “The motion is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial justice, who may grant it if he or she decides ‘on reflection or on the basis of changed circumstances that the sentence originally imposed was, for any reason, unduly severe.’” State v. Mlyniec, 78 A.3d 769, 771 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Mendoza, 958 A.2d 1159, 1161 (R.I. 2008)). We have a “strong policy against interfering with a trial justice's discretion in sentencing matters,” and thus “our review of a trial justice's ruling on a Rule 35 motion is extremely limited.” State v. Rivera, 64 A.3d 742, 745 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Snell, 11 A.3d 97, 101 (R.I. 2011)). Accordingly, “we only will interfere with that discretion in rare instances when the trial justice has imposed a sentence that is without justification and is grossly disparate from other sentences generally imposed for similar offenses.” Farooq, 115 A.3d at 964 (quoting Ruffner, 5 A.3d at 867)."", '-5-', 'III', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Denial of Defendant’s Rule 35 Motion', 'On appeal, defendant challenges the hearing justice’s denial of his motion to reduce his sentence.

Ciresi notes that he “presented information [at the Rule 35 proceeding] to inform the [hearing] justice’s understanding of potential for rehabilitation,” however, the hearing justice rejected his “proffer of post incarceration rehabilitation.”', 'In the present case, “[g]iven the vast discretion we afford to the trial justice’s sentencing judgment, we cannot reasonably conclude that the sentences here were ‘without justification and * * * grossly disparate from other sentences.’” Snell, 11 A.3d at 102 (quoting Ruffner, 5 A.3d at 867). The hearing justice noted defendant’s arguments, including “his recent expressions of remorse along with his rehabilitative advancement while an inmate, as well as a desire to attend to his two children.”', ""He rejected these arguments, noting that proper inmate behavior is expected and “not relevant to the determination of a motion to reduce sentence.” “[W]e cannot say that the trial justice abused his discretion when he left consideration of the defendant's good behavior and rehabilitative efforts while in prison to the parole board.” Ruffner, 5 A.3d at 868."", 'Further, the hearing justice found defendant’s argument concerning family hardship “unavailing.” He acknowledged the negative impact of Ciresi’s incarceration on his children, but held that it did not justify reducing the sentence imposed for his commission of serious crimes. Addressing defendant’s constitutional arguments, the hearing justice determined that the', '-6- sentence “is commensurate with the gravity of the crimes he committed.” Finally, the hearing justice articulated the reasons for defendant’s harsh punishment and concluded that “[t]he enormity of the crimes, the blatant nature of the misconduct, [and] * * * defendant’s callous disregard of his oath * * * all counsel toward reaffirmation of the sanctions originally levied.” Accordingly, we conclude that the hearing justice “was well within his discretion to give and then confirm the instant punishment for [defendant] * * * .” Snell, 11 A.3d at 102.', 'B', 'Constitutional Challenges under Rule 35', 'The defendant also challenges the constitutionality of the benchmarks. He relies on Blakely, for its proposition that “any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.” Blakely, 542 U.S. at 301 (quoting Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 490 (2000)). Ciresi maintains that “this state’s system,” with regard to the benchmarks, “runs afoul of Blakely,” because facts underlying a departure from them should be submitted to a jury.', 'Specifically, defendant raises two constitutional challenges. First, he maintains that “the Sentencing Court did not comply with the Sixth Amendment when it imposed a sentence exceeding the maximum Benchmark * * * .” He references the hearing justice’s consideration of facts not proved to the jury, including thirty-seven uncharged bad acts. Second, Ciresi argues that his sentence’s departure from the benchmarks constitutes cruel and unusual punishment, in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, section 8 of the Rhode Island Constitution.', 'This Court, however, has never “countenanced a challenge to the constitutionality of a penal statute in the context of a Rule 35 motion * * * .” State v. Linde, 965 A.2d 415, 417 (R.I.', '-7- 2009), as amended (Mar. 27, 2009). In Linde, the defendant argued, in part, that his mandatory and consecutive life sentence given under the anti-gun-violence statute violated the Eighth Amendment. Id. at 416. There, we held that the defendant’s challenge could not be raised through a Rule 35 motion, and we declined to reach the merits of his constitutional arguments. Id. at 417.', 'Similarly, here, Ciresi challenges the constitutionality of departures from the benchmarks. Accordingly, we need not reach the merits of Ciresi’s constitutional challenges because they are “not cognizable in the context of a motion to correct an illegal sentence under Rule 35 * * * .” Linde, 965 A.2d at 416.', '1', 'Sixth Amendment', 'Nonetheless, even if defendant could raise constitutional challenges under Rule 35, his arguments lack merit. Ciresi’s Sixth Amendment challenge hinges on his assertion that the departure from the benchmarks violates the holding set forth in Blakely. Ciresi contends that the lower court’s consideration of facts not proved to the jury—including, thirty-seven uncharged bad acts—violated the Sixth Amendment.', 'However, Blakely is inapplicable here because Ciresi’s sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum. With respect to the burglary sentence challenged on appeal, G.L. 1956 § 11-8-1 sets forth a maximum sentence of life in prison. Here, the sentence only exceeded the benchmark, and this Court has long held “that the benchmarks are not mandatory” and departures are allowed under certain circumstances. Snell, 11 A.3d at 102. In his order denying defendant’s motion, the hearing justice articulated three of those circumstances justifying departure from the guidelines. Accordingly, defendant’s sentence does not violate the Sixth Amendment.', '-8-', '2', 'Eighth Amendment', 'Ciresi’s Eighth Amendment argument rests on his assertion that the sentences fall outside of those set forth in the benchmarks. The defendant cites to McKinney v. State, 843 A.2d 463, 470 (R.I. 2004), to support his argument that “too large of an upward departure [from the sentencing guidelines] may be viewed as ‘cruel and unusual’ * * * .” In McKinney, this Court recognized a “narrow proportionality principle” with respect to the Eighth Amendment, “such that a criminal sentence is excessive and unconstitutional if, inter alia, it ‘is grossly out of proportion to the severity of the crime.’” State v. Monteiro, 924 A.2d 784, 794 (R.I. 2007) (quoting McKinney, 843 A.2d at 467). “The overriding inquiry for determining ‘proportionality’ is whether the sentence is commensurate with the gravity of the crime.” Id. at 795 (quoting McKinney, 843 A.2d at 469).', 'Ciresi argues that his sentence is cruel and unusual punishment because it departed from the benchmarks. However, since the benchmarks are not mandatory, the hearing justice was “bound only by the statutory limits.” Rivera, 64 A.3d at 746 (quoting Snell, 11 A.3d at 102). Here, the trial justice did comply with the statutory limits. Thus, although Ciresi’s sentence departed from the guidelines, it was well within the statutory mandate.', 'Ciresi, as “[t]he party seeking reduction,” has not shown that his sentence is “grossly disproportionate” to the crimes charged. Monteiro, 924 A.2d at 794 (quoting McKinney, 843 A.2d at 473). “The gross disproportionality principle reserves a constitutional violation for only the extraordinary case,” and this is not such a case. Monteiro, 924 A.2d at 795 (quoting Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U.S. 63, 77 (2003)).

Duvere 1 (Duvere or applicant), appeals from the denial of his postconviction-relief application. Duvere contends that this Court should vacate his 2009 plea of nolo contendere to the offense of possession of between one to five kilograms of a controlled substance classified as marijuana, with knowledge and intent, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 21-28-4.01.1, 2 because his plea was not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary as he lacked the assistance of a Haitian-Creole-speaking interpreter. This matter came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on November 3, 2016, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After carefully considering the parties’ written and oral submissions, we are satisfied that this appeal may be resolved without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'The applicant’s real name is John Sergo Noaelus. The applicant testified, however, that he began using the name Jean Duvere after his taxi driver license was canceled. For purposes of the postconviction-relief hearing, he was referred to as Jean Duvere. Consequently, we refer to applicant as Duvere. 2', 'Violation of G.L. 1956 § 21-28-4.01.1 carries a maximum sentence of fifty years.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On June 13, 1997, Duvere, a native of Haiti and a permanent resident of the United States, was traveling on I-95 South in Rhode Island when the Rhode Island State Police stopped him for speeding. At that time, Duvere was working as a taxi driver and was returning to New York after he dropped off a passenger in Boston, Massachusetts. He consented to a search of his vehicle, and the officers found two “bricks” of marijuana in its trunk. When the officers confronted Duvere, he claimed that he had no knowledge of the marijuana’s presence and informed the officers that he had just dropped off a fare in Boston. Duvere was arrested and charged with one count of possession of between one to five kilograms of marijuana, with knowledge and intent, in violation of § 21-28-4.01.1.', 'Private counsel represented Duvere with respect to this charge. In August 1997, at his bail hearing at the Kent County District Court, bail was set at $25,000 with surety. Duvere posted bail and was subsequently released. In October 1997, Duvere was arraigned on a criminal information in the Kent County Superior Court. At the arraignment, the hearing justice kept bail in the original amount but allowed Duvere to maintain his residence in New York. After his arraignment, however, Duvere failed to attend his subsequent court hearings; and, on February 3, 1998, the Superior Court issued a warrant for his failure to appear.', 'In 2009, upon his return to the United States after a trip to Haiti, Duvere was arrested in New York on the warrant. Duvere was brought to Rhode Island and presented to the Superior Court on June 4, 2009. His bail was reset at $250,000 with surety. At this time, Duvere was represented by his original counsel.', '-2-', 'On July 15, 2009, Duvere pled nolo contendere to one count of possession of between one to five kilograms of marijuana, with knowledge and intent, in violation of § 21-28-4.01.1, and he was sentenced to ten years, with eighteen months to serve, and eight-and-a-half years suspended with probation. A Haitian-Creole interpreter was not present at the plea colloquy, and neither Duvere nor his counsel requested an interpreter’s assistance. When asked by the hearing justice, Duvere stated that he could understand and speak English. Duvere’s counsel, prior to the plea colloquy, did note Duvere’s inability to read English; counsel stated, however, that he verbally explained the plea form to Duvere. Upon request, Duvere provided his name, date of birth, and address. Duvere also stated that he understood that, by pleading nolo contendere, he forfeited several constitutional rights.', 'Duvere accepted the state’s articulation of facts supporting the charge.', 'At the conclusion of the colloquy, the hearing justice found that “defendant ha[d] the capacity to understand the nature and consequences of his plea” and that there was a factual basis for his nolo contendere plea. The hearing justice found that Duvere pleaded “voluntarily, intelligently, [and] with knowledge and understanding of all matters contained in the request to enter a plea * * * .” Consequently, he accepted Duvere’s plea and imposed the agreed-upon sentence.', 'After his plea, Duvere appeared multiple times without counsel before the same hearing justice, seeking to correct his sentence, to clarify his sentence, and to receive credit for time served. 3 The hearing justice granted all three motions. At no point during these hearings did Duvere state that he could not understand the court nor did he request an interpreter.', 'On June 11, 2013, with the assistance of new counsel, Duvere filed an application for postconviction relief, seeking to vacate his 2009 nolo contendere plea.

The application also set forth several allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. 4 In September 2014, the same hearing justice presided over the hearing on Duvere’s application for postconviction relief. A Haitian-Creole interpreter was present for the hearing.', 'On December 15, 2014, the hearing justice issued a decision denying Duvere’s postconviction-relief application, finding his testimony and allegations incredible. Moreover, the hearing justice found Duvere’s original counsel, who testified and asserted that he could effectively communicate with Duvere in English, to be credible. In regard to the claim that he could not speak or understand English, the hearing justice cited Duvere’s thirty-year residence in the United States and his pro se court appearances, over which the hearing justice presided. Specifically, the hearing justice stated that there was no evidence during the plea colloquy, or any of Duvere’s subsequent pro se motions, showing that he had difficulty understanding or speaking to the court.

Although the record reflects that Duvere said “[e]xcuse me again” on one occasion during the colloquy, this is insufficient to establish that he could not comprehend English.', 'Further, a review of the evidence reveals that Duvere understood the questions asked during the colloquy. Throughout the hearing, he answered all questions presented, without apparent difficulty. On numerous occasions prior to entering the plea, the Court asked Duvere if he could understand and speak English, to which he responded affirmatively, stating, “Yes, I speak English. Yeah, I understand.” There is nothing in the record to demonstrate that the hearing justice’s decision not to appoint an interpreter prejudiced Duvere. Thus, the hearing justice did not err in finding that Duvere understood the plea colloquy.', 'We note, in particular, one portion of the record, which occurred prior to the colloquy, when Duvere told the hearing justice why he proceeded with the plea. Duvere stated, “[Counsel] told me, but I suppose for 18--I got eight years probation. I say that’s okay.” From this statement, it would be reasonable for the hearing justice to find that Duvere understood that, by pleading nolo contendere, he received the benefit of a lesser sentence, thereby demonstrating that he understood the charges and the consequences of the plea, without an interpreter’s assistance. Finally, it was not erroneous for the hearing justice to find that Duvere understood English based on his residence and employment in the United States for thirty years. Our deference to this finding is well supported by this Court’s holding in Ibrahim, where we held that the hearing justice made no clear error in determining that the defendant did not need an interpreter as he was a longtime resident and had been employed in the United States for approximately eight years.

82,"Progressive Casualty Insurance Co. : v. : James S. Dias et al. : Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty, Robinson, and Indeglia, JJ. OPINION Justice Flaherty, for the Court. We are called upon to determine the meaning of the term “same insurance company” under G.L. 1956 § 27-7-2.1(i). The defendants, James S. Dias and Sarina M. Dunham, appeal from the Superior Court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff, Progressive Casualty Insurance Co. Dias suffered serious injuries in a motorcycle accident and sought to recover underinsured-motorist benefits from the plaintiff, asserting that he was entitled to those benefits pursuant to § 27-7-2.1(i). On appeal, the defendants argue that summary judgment was granted in error because material issues of fact remained in dispute. Moreover, the defendants contend that the hearing justice incorrectly determined that the plaintiff and another company, Progressive Northern Insurance Co., are not the same insurance company for the purposes of applying § 27-7-2.1(i). -1- This case came before us for oral argument on November 30, 2016. After carefully considering the record, the parties’ written and oral arguments, as well as the thoughtful brief of the amicus, 1 we affirm the Superior Court’s ruling. I Facts and Travel On September 22, 2012, Dias was seriously injured when a car struck him while he was operating a motorcycle that was registered to his wife, Dunham. At the time of the accident, defendants were insured under two policies issued by companies bearing the “Progressive” label. One policy, which Progressive Northern underwrote, covered the motorcycle that defendant was operating when he was injured. The second policy, underwritten by plaintiff, Progressive Casualty, covered defendants’ automobiles. After the accident, Dias settled a bodily injury claim for the tortfeasor’s automobile insurance policy limit. Because the amount of that settlement was less than the reasonable amount required to compensate him for his injuries, Dias then made and settled an uninsured-motorist claim against Progressive Northern, also for the policy limit. However, believing himself to be entitled to further compensation because of the extent of his injuries, Dias then filed a claim with plaintiff for underinsured-motorist benefits under the terms of their automobile policy. 2 The plaintiff denied coverage, asserting that the automobile policy did not provide coverage for the injuries Dias sustained while he was riding the 1 The Rhode Island Association for Justice submitted a brief of amicus curiae. 2 “The process of obtaining benefits from a second [insurance] policy on the same claim when recovery from the first [insurance] policy alone would be inadequate” is commonly referred to as “stacking.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1623 (10th ed. 2014). Many jurisdictions specifically bar stacking of uninsured/underinsured-motorist policies. Rhode Island explicitly allows it in certain circumstances, including under G.L. 1956 § 27-7-2.1(i). -2- motorcycle because the insurance contract contained an “owned-but-not-insured clause” 3 that barred recovery. The defendants do not contest the clarity of this exclusion. Instead, they argue that, because they had two separate policies with Progressive labeled insurance companies, plaintiff must cover Dias’ injuries and that the owned-but-not-insured clause is preempted by § 27-7-2.1(i). That statute mandates that, when an insured has multiple uninsured/underinsured policies “with the same insurance company, the insured shall be permitted to collect up to the aggregate amount of coverage for all the vehicles insured, regardless of any language in the policy to the contrary.” Id. The defendants maintain that plaintiff, Progressive Casualty, and Progressive Northern are each part of the same company: The Progressive Corporation. In response to the claim that Dias brought against it under the policy, plaintiff filed a declaratory-judgment action, requesting that the Superior Court declare that § 27-7-2.1(i) is not applicable because “Progressive Northern Insurance Co. is a completely separate and distinct corporation and business entity from [plaintiff,] Progressive Casualty Insurance Co.,” and that, consequently, plaintiff may disclaim coverage with respect to Dias’ claim for underinsured- motorist benefits. 4 After nearly one year had elapsed, and after discovery had been initiated, plaintiff moved for summary judgment. After considering each party’s written and oral arguments, the hearing justice ruled that plaintiff and Progressive Northern “are distinct entities,” and he granted plaintiff’s motion. The defendants timely appealed to this Court. 3 An “owned-but-not-insured” provision of an automobile insurance policy excludes from coverage vehicles that the insured owns but which are not specified in the insurance contract. 4 In its brief, plaintiff says that it did not deny Dias’ claim for underinsured-motorist benefits. The record is unclear as to whether Dias’ claim was ever formally denied. That said, plaintiff initiated the declaratory-judgment action that is presently being appealed, the outcome of which is dispositive of whether plaintiff must compensate Dias for his injuries. -3- II Discussion A Issue on Appeal The only issue on appeal before this Court is whether Progressive Northern Insurance Co., which insured defendants’ motorcycle, and plaintiff, Progressive Casualty Insurance Co., which insured defendants’ cars, are, for the purpose of § 27-7-2.1(i), the same company. B Standard of Review This Court reviews a trial justice’s decision to grant summary judgment de novo. Woodruff v. Gitlow, 91 A.3d 805, 809 (R.I. 2014). “We will affirm a [trial] court’s decision only if, after reviewing the admissible evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, we conclude that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Daniels v. Fluette, 64 A.3d 302, 304 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Great American E & S Insurance Co. v. End Zone Pub & Grill of Narragansett Inc., 45 A.3d 571, 574 (R.I. 2012)). Furthermore, “the nonmoving party bears the burden of proving by competent evidence the existence of a disputed issue of material fact and cannot rest upon mere allegations or denials in the pleadings, mere conclusions or mere legal opinions.” Id. (quoting Great American E & S Insurance Co., 45 A.3d at 574). Likewise, “[w]e review questions of statutory interpretation de novo.” State v. Brown, 140 A.3d 768, 775 (R.I. 2016) (quoting State v. Hazard, 68 A.3d 479, 485 (R.I. 2013)). “[I]t is well settled that when the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, this Court must interpret the statute literally and must give the words of the statute their plain and ordinary -4- meanings.” Whittemore v. Thompson, 139 A.3d 530, 540 (R.I. 2016) (quoting Cummings v. Shorey, 761 A.2d 680, 684 (R.I. 2000)). “In matters of statutory interpretation our ultimate goal is to give effect to the purpose of the act as intended by the Legislature.” Id. (quoting GSM Industrial Inc. v. Grinnell Fire Protection Systems Co., 47 A.3d 264, 268 (R.I. 2012)). C Analysis i Relying on the “reasonable expectations” doctrine, defendants set forth a number of undisputed facts that undergird their argument that plaintiff and Progressive Northern are, for the purposes of the statute, one and the same company. Specifically, defendants argue that, among other things, plaintiff and Progressive Northern use the same claims manual, advertise under the “Progressive” brand, employ the same individuals as Deputy General Counsel and Litigation Underwriting Specialist, and list the same telephone number and website on the declarations page of their policies. Additionally, defendants point out that they purchased both policies from the same agent, who was not instructed to inform them that their insurance policies were issued by separate corporations. According to defendants, the sum of all those facts would lead an ordinary person to the reasonable expectation that plaintiff and Progressive Northern are, indeed, the same company. Whether or not that is true, however, our focus is not on the policies but on the wording of the statute. In our opinion, defendants’ reliance on the reasonable expectations doctrine is misplaced, because the doctrine applies to interpreting the language of insurance policies, and not to statutory interpretation. The long-recognized doctrine of reasonable expectations instructs “that in situations in which the language of an insurance policy is susceptible to more than one reasonable -5- interpretation, it is strictly construed against the insurer.” Pressman v. Aetna Casualty and Surety Co., 574 A.2d 757, 759 (R.I. 1990). Moreover, “[t]he test to be applied is not what the insurer intended * * *, but what the ordinary reader and purchaser would have understood [the language] to mean.” Allstate Insurance Co. v. Ahlquist, 59 A.3d 95, 98 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Pressman, 574 A.2d at 760). Here, however, defendants do not allege that the policy is ambiguous; indeed, they concede that “[t]his is not a case that requires the Court to interpret the language of an insurance policy.” Rather, they maintain that, for the purpose of § 27-7-2.1(i), plaintiff and Progressive Northern should be considered as one and the same company. Thus, the issue before us is one of statutory interpretation. We have consistently said that “[i]n matters of statutory interpretation our ultimate goal is to give effect to the purpose of the act as intended by the Legislature.” Whittemore, 139 A.3d at 540 (quoting GSM Industrial Inc., 47 A.3d at 268). Therefore, it is the intent of the Legislature, and not that of the ordinary reader and purchaser, that must inform our analysis. ii In an unrebutted affidavit provided by its general counsel, plaintiff asserts that “Progressive Casualty Insurance Company and Progressive Northern Insurance Company are completely separate and distinct corporate entities.” 5 Nonetheless, plaintiff and Progressive Northern are wholly owned subsidiaries of The Progressive Corporation. This brings into focus 5 The affidavit goes on to say that plaintiff, “Progressive Casualty Insurance Company, is an Ohio domiciled private company incorporated on November 17, 1956,” while “Progressive Northern Insurance Company is a Wisconsin domiciled private company incorporated on August 19, 1980.” -6- the question of whether, for the purpose of § 27-7-2.1(i), plaintiff and Progressive Northern are “the same insurance company.” 6 Section 27-7-2.1(i) provides that: “Whenever an insured has paid two (2) or more separate premiums for uninsured motorists’ coverage in a single policy of insurance or under several policies with the same insurance company, the insured shall be permitted to collect up to the aggregate amount of coverage for all of the vehicles insured, regardless of any language in the policy to the contrary.” It is our opinion that the language “same insurance company,” as set forth at § 27-7- 2.1(i), is clear and unambiguous. Significantly, this Court has previously determined that the statute, as a whole, “is clear and unambiguous.” Cardoso v. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., 659 A.2d 1097, 1099 (R.I. 1995). 7 Thus, we “must interpret the statute literally and must give the words of the statute their plain and ordinary meanings.” Whittemore, 139 A.3d at 540 (quoting Cummings, 761 A.2d at 684). In crafting the statute, the Legislature chose the term “same insurance company.” We ascribe to the word “same” its plain and ordinary meaning: “identical; not different.” The Oxford Dictionary and Thesaurus 1334 (1996). “Insurance company” is defined as “[a] corporation or association that issues insurance policies.” Black’s Law Dictionary 925 (10th ed. 6 The defendants contend that whether or not plaintiff and Progressive Northern are the same company is a material question of fact, thus making summary judgment inappropriate at this time. However, it is our opinion that the determinative issue before us is squarely a question of law regarding statutory interpretation, and therefore ripe for summary judgment. Assuming without deciding that defendants’ contention is correct, it would not change our opinion. This is so because if an issue of material fact “admits of only one reasonable answer, then the court should intervene and resolve the matter as a question of law.” Parker v. Byrne, 996 A.2d 627, 632 (R.I. 2010) (quoting Women’s Development Corp. v. City of Central Falls, 764 A.2d 151, 158 (R.I. 2001)). Here, it is our conclusion that there is only one reasonable answer to the question of whether plaintiff and Progressive Northern are the same company; they are not. 7 In Cardoso v. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., 659 A.2d 1097, 1099 (R.I. 1995), this Court was called upon to determine whether the statute required that an insured pay two or more separate premiums, as opposed to a single but higher premium, to stack coverage. -7- 2014). And a corporation is “[a]n entity ([usually] a business) having authority under law to act as a single person distinct from the shareholders who own it * * *.” Id. at 415. We are drawn to the inevitable conclusion that the two wholly owned subsidiaries, each of which is a different corporate entity, are legally distinct from one another and from their parent corporation for the purpose of § 27-7-2.1(i). It follows, then, that because “same” and “different” are antonyms, and if the subsidiaries are different entities, they cannot also be the same entity. Accordingly, we hold that, with regard to § 27-7-2.1(i), plaintiff and Progressive Northern are separate and distinct companies, each of which is also distinct from its common sole shareholder, The Progressive Corporation. 8 Our opinion comports with well-settled law regarding respect for the corporate structure. We have long held that “the corporation itself is, as a legal person, distinct from the shareholders as natural persons.” Arnold v. Ruggles, 1 R.I. 165, 167 (1837); see also Doe v. Gelineau, 732 A.2d 43, 44 (R.I. 1999) (a corporation is “distinct and separate from its individual and often changing stockholders”) (quoting Vennerbeck & Clase Co. v. Juergens Jewelry Co., 53 R.I. 135, 138, 164 A. 509, 510 (1933)). 8 Had the Legislature intended to allow stacking of policies issued by subsidiary corporations, it could have employed language similar to verbiage that our sister states used when including subsidiary insurance corporations within a statute. Indiana uses the phrase, “same insurer or a subsidiary or an affiliate.” Ind. Code Ann. § 27-7-5-2(b) (West 2013). Meanwhile, Delaware’s statute says, “the same insurer or affiliated insurers.” Del. Code Ann. tit. 18, § 3902(c) (West 2013). Furthermore, it is clear that our Legislature understands how to draw out the distinction between a parent and subsidiary when it desires to do so. See, e.g., G.L. 1956 § 17-27-3(c) (“[p]arent, affiliate, or subsidiary entities of a state vendor”); G.L. 1956 § 27-43-1(1) (“‘Affiliated company’ means any corporation controlled by or an affiliate of a parent * * *.”); G.L. 1956 § 28-7-16(c) (“same labor organization or between labor organizations affiliated with the same parent labor organization”). -8- III Conclusion For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. The record is remanded to the Superior Court. -9- RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE: Progressive Casualty Insurance Co. v. James S.

Moreover, “[t]he test to be applied is not what the insurer intended * * *, but what the ordinary reader and purchaser would have understood [the language] to mean.” Allstate Insurance Co. v. Ahlquist, 59 A.3d 95, 98 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Pressman, 574 A.2d at 760).', 'Here, however, defendants do not allege that the policy is ambiguous; indeed, they concede that “[t]his is not a case that requires the Court to interpret the language of an insurance policy.” Rather, they maintain that, for the purpose of § 27-7-2.1(i), plaintiff and Progressive Northern should be considered as one and the same company. Thus, the issue before us is one of statutory interpretation. We have consistently said that “[i]n matters of statutory interpretation our ultimate goal is to give effect to the purpose of the act as intended by the Legislature.” Whittemore, 139 A.3d at 540 (quoting GSM Industrial Inc., 47 A.3d at 268).

However, it is our opinion that the determinative issue before us is squarely a question of law regarding statutory interpretation, and therefore ripe for summary judgment. Assuming without deciding that defendants’ contention is correct, it would not change our opinion. This is so because if an issue of material fact “admits of only one reasonable answer, then the court should intervene and resolve the matter as a question of law.” Parker v. Byrne, 996 A.2d 627, 632 (R.I. 2010) (quoting Women’s Development Corp. v. City of Central Falls, 764 A.2d 151, 158 (R.I. 2001)).

Accordingly, we hold that, with regard to § 27-7-2.1(i), plaintiff and Progressive Northern are separate and distinct companies, each of which is also distinct from its common sole shareholder, The Progressive Corporation. 8', 'Our opinion comports with well-settled law regarding respect for the corporate structure.

Pontarelli, appeals from a Superior Court judgment in favor of the defendants, the Rhode Island Board Council on Elementary and Secondary Education (the council) and the Rhode Island Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (RIDE) (collectively, defendants).', 'The plaintiff, an attorney who is employed as a hearing officer for RIDE, alleged that the defendants violated the Open Meetings Act (OMA), as set forth in G.L. 1956 chapter 46 of title 42, by failing to provide adequate notice of a September 8, 2014, council meeting and for its failure to provide any notice of meetings held by the Compensation Review Committee. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we reverse in part and affirm in part the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'A', 'The Compensation Review Committee', 'The pertinent facts in this case are not in dispute. In 2011 or 2012 the council created a Compensation Review Committee (CRC), which was to convene to review requested and proposed salary adjustments for RIDE employees.', 'The CRC is composed of six RIDE employees: the three division chiefs, the chief of staff, the human resources coordinator, and the deputy commissioner. David Abbott, the deputy commissioner of RIDE and a CRC member, serves as the CRC chairperson. Abbott explained at deposition that membership on the CRC is not by appointment; instead, serving on the CRC is “just an additional task for people that are on the leadership team.” He described the CRC as an “informal, ad hoc working group with a strictly advisory role” and with no legal status or authority. Abbott also explained that the CRC does not have regular meetings; rather, it schedules meetings when a CRC member requests one. He attested that notice of the CRC meetings is not provided to the public nor are written minutes kept or taken at CRC meetings. In 2013, the CRC created a charter to set up procedures on how it would operate as a committee.', 'According to Abbott, the CRC is a working group formed to provide “balance” or consistency in compensation for RIDE positions and to keep the three RIDE division chiefs informed about compensation requests.', 'Instead of individual division chiefs making compensation recommendations for their employees directly to the commissioner, the requests', '-2- go to the CRC, which then passes the request on to the commissioner.1 Although the CRC initially discussed compensation for RIDE’s 146 public employees and new hires, it eventually “broaden[ed] the scope of what [they] were talking about” to also include organization. The CRC began reviewing the creation of new positions in RIDE and the work each division or office should oversee. Because only the commissioner has the actual authority to take personnel actions, the CRC is “strictly advisory” and handles all personnel matters outside the scope of the human resources department.2', 'B', 'Notice of the September 8, 2014 Council Meeting', 'The council posted notice of a September 8, 2014, council meeting on the Rhode Island Secretary of State’s website (the council meeting). As required by G.L. 1956 § 16-60-7(b), RIDE’s table of organization, together with pay ranges, needed to be approved by the council. 3 Under the “Action Items” subheading of the agenda notice, item “7.b.” stated: “Approval of RIDE’s Executive Pay Plan and Organizational Chart.” Several spaces to the right of this item description, “Enclosure 7b” was noted. However, the 7b enclosure was not accessible from the Secretary of State’s website.', 'The 7b enclosure was a memorandum containing a recommendation from the commissioner of RIDE to the council that the council “approve[] the attached Executive Pay Plan for [fiscal years] 2012, * * * 2013, * * * 2014, * * * 2015 and the Organizational Chart.”', 'Attached to the recommendation were the proposed retrospective 1', 'In October 2012, the CRC deferred action on a pay-grade salary adjustment submitted by plaintiff. 2', 'For example, matters relating to disciplinary action, termination, and medical leave would not go to the CRC. 3', 'General Laws 1956 § 16-60-7(b) provides that “The table of organization, as submitted by the commissioner of elementary and secondary education, together with the pay ranges, shall be subject to approval by the board of regents [now the council].”', '-3- executive pay plans. The agenda notice for the council meeting was also posted on RIDE’s website, where the 7b enclosure was accessible. The plaintiff acknowledged that approximately two weeks prior to the September 8, 2014 meeting, he received a copy of the 7b enclosure.', 'The council meeting was held on September 8, 2014, at which time the council considered and approved the four executive pay plans for fiscal years 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 that had been proposed by RIDE.', 'C', 'Superior Court Proceedings', 'On March 6, 2015, plaintiff filed a two-count complaint against defendants. The plaintiff alleged in his complaint that the agenda notice “posted by the [c]ouncil for its September 8, 2014 meeting did not provide adequate and proper notice of its action with regard to executive pay plans” and that its consideration and approval of the pay plans violated the OMA (count 1). The plaintiff also alleged that, because the CRC, as a designated committee of RIDE, was a “public body” pursuant to the OMA, RIDE violated the OMA by failing to provide notice or keep and file written minutes of CRC meetings (count 2). In response, on April 7, 2015, defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.', 'The plaintiff objected to the motion to dismiss and filed a motion for summary judgment. The Superior Court treated both parties’ motions as cross-motions for summary judgment, and a hearing was held on June 5, 2015. At the hearing, defendants argued that plaintiff did not have standing to raise his claims. The defendants argued that, because plaintiff had received the 7b enclosure two weeks prior to the council hearing, plaintiff could not be an “aggrieved party” under count 1, and because plaintiff failed to allege how he was injured by the CRC’s meetings, he also did not have standing to pursue count 2. In response, and in addition to contending that', '-4- he did in fact have standing, plaintiff argued that the agenda notice provided by the council was not sufficient because it did not inform the public that more than one pay plan year would be discussed at the meeting. Moreover, plaintiff argued that the OMA covers advisory groups like the CRC and that, consequently, the CRC was required to give notice of its meetings and publish minutes pursuant to the OMA.', 'At the close of the parties’ arguments, the hearing justice issued a bench decision granting defendants’ motion for summary judgment. In doing so, the hearing justice did not decide the issue of standing, although he found that “clearly * * * plaintiff had adequate notice because [plaintiff] actually had the [7b] attachment.” Instead, the hearing justice found, “in reviewing the totality of the circumstances in this case,” that the notice of the September 8, 2014 meeting complied with the OMA because it sufficiently “specifie[d] the nature of the business to be discussed” at the council meeting. The hearing justice also found that the CRC was not a public body and, accordingly, was not subject to the OMA.', 'Final judgment entered for defendants on June 23, 2015.

The OMA provides that supplemental “notice shall include the date the notice was posted, the date, time and place of the meeting, and a statement specifying the nature of the business to be discussed.” Section 42-46-6(b). The OMA requires that all notices of a public meeting be “electronically transmitted to the [S]ecretary of [S]tate in accordance with rules and regulations which shall be promulgated by the [S]ecretary of [S]tate.” Section 42-46-6(f). Rule 5A.2.b. of the Rules and Regulations Adopted by the Secretary of State provides in relevant part that “[s]upplemental written public notices and all addenda and amendments must be filed with the Secretary of State electronically at least forty-eight (48) hours in advance of [a] meeting.”', 'Determining whether there was a violation of the OMA is a mixed question of fact and law as to which this Court normally gives deference to the factual findings of the trial justice.

Anolik, 64 A.3d at 1175. We have explicitly declined to set “specific guidelines, or ‘magic words,’” necessary to meet the notice requirement set forth in § 42-46-6(a). Anolik, 64 A.3d at 1175 (quoting Tanner v. Town Council of East Greenwich, 880 A.2d 784, 797 (R.I. 2005)). Instead, we have held that the public body, here the council, must provide “fair notice” of what will be discussed at a meeting. Anolik, 64 A.3d at 1175. Accordingly, this Court’s “task is to determine whether the notice provided by the * * * council fairly informed the public, under the totality of the circumstances, of the nature of the business to be conducted” at the September 8, 2014 council meeting. See Tanner, 880 A.2d at 797.', 'After a careful review of the record and consideration of the undisputed facts before us, it is this Court’s opinion that the agenda provided by defendants, as it relates to the September 8, 2014 meeting, falls short of satisfying the statutory requirements of notice set forth in § 42-46- 6(a). Although the notice placed on the Secretary of State’s website undeniably informed the public that “[a]pproval of RIDE’s Executive Pay Plan” was on the agenda for the council meeting, there was no indication that more than one pay plan would be considered. Moreover, there was also no indication that the additional pay plans (ultimately considered and decided by the council at the meeting) would relate to retrospective fiscal years dating back to 2012. Additionally, while the 7b enclosure that should have been attached would have informed the public that the meeting would involve pay plans from fiscal year 2012 and forward, it is undisputed that the enclosure was not available on the Secretary of State’s website as required by § 42-46-6.4 4', 'The “Enclosure 7b” being accessible on RIDE’s website is irrelevant to our analysis, as G.L. 1956 § 42-46-6 requires that it be placed on the Secretary of State’s website, and there is no duty placed upon the public to search elsewhere.', '-8-', 'It is our opinion that based on the totality of the circumstances of this case—including that the term “plan” was in the singular and that the stated “Enclosure 7b” was not actually available on the Secretary of State’s website—adequate public notice was lacking. The public had the statutory right to receive a more complete notice of what would be discussed and decided at the council meeting; this is especially true where the matters relate to expenditures of tax- payer monies. The agenda did not provide the public with fair notice “of the nature of the business to be discussed” where it completely omitted any information that one could construe to mean that more than one pay plan would be discussed. See Anolik, 64 A.3d at 1175 (holding that the term “[c]ommunications” in an agenda “could quite rationally cause a member of the public to infer simply that the zoning board was informing the citizenry that it had ‘received’ a request * * * but the text provide[d] no basis for any further inference as to what might happen with respect to the request that had been ‘received’”).', 'Accordingly, we conclude that defendants violated the OMA by their failure to provide adequate notice of the September 8, 2014 meeting.5 This Court reverses summary judgment in defendants’ favor on count 1 and remands this case to the Superior Court with instructions to 5', 'We note that defendants’ argument that plaintiff lacked standing to bring these claims forward was raised before the Superior Court but was not ultimately decided by the hearing justice. Before this Court, defendants sought to argue standing at oral argument and expressed an understanding that the issue had been raised in their written submissions. After a careful review of their filings, it is clear that defendants have not properly raised their standing argument to this Court. The only mention of standing is found in a footnote, which states that the Superior Court “did not need to reach defendants’ claims * * * that plaintiff lacked standing.” There is no further discussion or argument regarding the issue. Accordingly, such argument is deemed waived. See Duffy v. Milder, 896 A.2d 27, 39-40 (R.I. 2006) (this Court considered waived the issue of whether the plaintiff had standing where there was no indication in the record that the issue was decided by the hearing justice and where the defendant did not raise the issue of standing on appeal).', '-9- enter judgment in plaintiff’s favor and for a hearing to be held to determine the proper remedy pursuant to § 42-46-8.6', 'B', 'CRC as “Public Body”', 'Next, plaintiff argues that the Superior Court erred in determining that the CRC is not a “public body” as defined by the OMA and, as a result, is not subject to the provisions of notice set forth in the OMA.

The EHC had been created by executive order of the governor, and the EHC had supervisory and advisory authority. Id. at 823-24. The EHC controlled the state’s hiring practices and its fiscal resources, and it was required to make suggestions to the governor relating to the state’s personnel system. Id. at 823, 824. The EHC also “was required to meet at least biweekly” and was composed of a group of high-level state officials. Id. at 824, 825. This Court noted that the EHC’s advisory power over the matter to be discussed at a meeting alone required that the meeting be open to the public. Id. at 825.', 'Here, it is our opinion that the CRC does not constitute a public body and is not therefore subject to the regulations of the OMA. Unlike the EHC in Solas, the CRC in this case does not meet on a regular basis, nor was the CRC created by an executive order. Instead, the undisputed evidence in this case is that the CRC acted as an informal, strictly advisory committee. Although the CRC was composed of a group of high-level state officials and operated under a charter, these two factors alone are insufficient to place them into the “public body” umbrella. Importantly, the CRC’s sole function is to advise the commissioner of RIDE, who in turn has to make a recommendation to the council. At this point in the process, if the commissioner decided to present any proposal to the council for the council’s required approval, the public would have an opportunity to be informed of and object to such proposal.', 'Based on the specific facts before this Court, it is our opinion that the CRC is not a “public body” and, consequently, is not subject to (nor was it in violation of) the OMA.

Preliminarily, a temporary order was issued granting plaintiff supervised visitation with his children on Tuesday and Thursday evenings and Sundays from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. In addition, plaintiff was ordered to continue paying the mortgage, insurance, and taxes on both the North Providence and Johnston properties, and defendant was allowed to collect the rent from the second-floor unit of the Johnston property “for child support purposes.”', 'From the outset, the parties have had a contentious divorce.

The plaintiff pled nolo contendere to the violations and was briefly incarcerated on both occasions, resulting in the termination of his employment. On September 3, 2014, the parties stipulated to unsupervised visitation on Wednesdays from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. and Sundays from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m., with pickups and drop-offs to be at the North Providence police department.', 'A trial in the Family Court commenced on December 5, 2014. In his testimony, plaintiff averred that he had been unable to find work to comply with the temporary order because his criminal convictions for violating the restraining order prevented him from passing a background check; thus, he was forced to start his own business, in which he earned about $1,200 a month. The plaintiff acknowledged that he did not see his children for a period of 287 days because he “felt [he] didn’t need” the supervision.', 'The defendant testified that she was employed throughout the marriage except when she gave birth to the children, and that she had acquired $50,350 of debt as a result of the marriage.1', 'On May 19, 2015, the trial justice filed a written decision. The trial justice found that plaintiff’s trial testimony was “convenient, incredulous at times, and for the most part, unworthy of belief.” The trial justice further found that plaintiff’s explanation or lack of knowledge of the marital debt was “absolutely incredulous.” The trial justice also noted that “[p]laintiff’s actions exhibited conduct of concern to the [c]ourt and may provide an obstacle to him to facilitate a relationship between the parties in the future.” The defendant’s testimony, however, was found to be credible. 1', 'The defendant testified that this debt of “almost $50,000” was a result of repairs to the Johnston property after a fire destroyed part of the house.', '-3-', 'The trial justice found that plaintiff had, on several occasions, violated the temporary order. For instance, he found that plaintiff failed to pay the bills on both the Johnston and North Providence properties, causing defendant to utilize the rents to pay the mortgage. In addition, the trial justice found that plaintiff, during the pendency of the divorce, withdrew more than $7,000 from his ADP2 account and Tiffany & Co. pension account, and that he had no “reasonable explanation” as to the whereabouts of this money when examined at trial.', 'In addition, the trial justice found that joint custody was in the best interest of the children but awarded physical possession to defendant. Specifically, the trial justice found that “[d]efendant presented evidence that the children [were] doing quite well in their current environment and ha[d] adjusted and that they are involved. On the other hand, [p]laintiff ha[d] provided no evidence as to any stability other than the fact that he is currently living with his girlfriend in a one bedroom apartment.” At the time the written decision was issued, the then- current visitation schedule was continued until such time as the trial justice would have an opportunity to evaluate “any and all” reports from the therapists treating the children. The transfers of the children were to take place at the home of defendant’s mother.', 'The trial justice further determined that plaintiff had the ability to earn at least $30,000, and he ordered plaintiff to pay defendant $646 monthly for the support of the children, plus $125 per month towards medical insurance. Furthermore, the trial justice found that plaintiff had “dissipated marital assets during the pendency of this divorce case in the amount of approximately $7,000,” and ordered him to transfer one-half of the remaining balance in his retirement accounts to defendant.

The trial justice found that “[p]laintiff did not visit with the minor children for a period of 287 days” during the pendency of the divorce, “although he had been offered visitation during that period, which he refused, without explanation.”3 The trial justice further found that plaintiff had been offered additional visits by defendant approximately two months before trial, but that he had refused, and that the children had “consistently lived with * * * [d]efendant since the separation of the parties and that * * * [p]laintiff ha[d] paid little, if any, child support during the same time frame.”', 'Moreover, the trial justice carefully enumerated and analyzed each factor concerning the best interests of the children set forth in Pettinato, 582 A.2d at 913-14.', 'In light of the deference that we afford to a trial justice in assessing the best interests of children, we are satisfied that the trial justice in this case acted well within his discretionary authority.', 'He considered the evidence concerning such factors as the children’s home environment, adjustment to their community, defendant’s mental health, and the willingness of each parent to facilitate a close relationship between the children and the other parent. Significantly, the trial justice’s decision provided for the further review of “any and all prior or recent reports from therapists involving the minor children” as it pertains to visitation. It is clear, 3', 'The trial justice also noted that, during this time, plaintiff never once attempted to contact the children.', '-7- therefore, that the trial justice intended to fashion a visitation schedule in accordance with the continuing best interests of the children. We perceive no error in his ruling.', 'B', 'Child Support', 'Next, plaintiff maintains that the trial justice erred in ordering him to pay child support in the amount of $646 per month plus $125 for medical insurance for the minor children. The plaintiff argues “that the [t]rial [j]ustice gave improper and undue weight to his testimony” regarding his previous employment and earning ability, as the evidence “clearly established that he no longer makes [and can no longer earn] $30,000 per year.” Although acknowledging that he at one time earned as much as $60,000 per year as a maintenance worker, plaintiff contends that, due to the numerous complaints for restraining orders filed by defendant and “his subsequent unjust imprisonment,” he is unable to pass a background check and thus is unable to find employment as a maintenance worker. The plaintiff claims that he “credibly testified” that at the time of trial he was earning an average of $1,200 per month doing construction and handyman jobs.', 'It is well recognized that an absent parent’s ability to pay a child-support order “does not rest solely on his or her present earning capacity.” Sullivan v. Sullivan, 460 A.2d 1248, 1250 (R.I. 1983). “It ‘includes other available means of compliance, as well as [the] capacity to acquire these means by the exercise of reasonable efforts.’” Id. (quoting Brierley v. Brierley, 431 A.2d 410, 415 (R.I. 1981)). In the case on appeal, the trial justice stated that he based his finding that plaintiff had an ability to earn at least $30,000 per year upon plaintiff’s prior job experiences. We also note that the trial justice found plaintiff’s testimony and his memory “to be convenient, incredulous at times, and for the most part unworthy of belief.” Specifically, the', '-8- trial justice found that, after plaintiff’s dismissal from Tiffany & Co., he never applied for a lesser-paying job, and that he had leased a new 2014 Toyota truck with a monthly payment of approximately $440 subsequent to the separation of the parties. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial justice’s finding concerning plaintiff’s earning capacity was a sustainable exercise of his discretionary authority.', 'The plaintiff also contends that the trial justice erred by not considering the child-support guidelines in establishing the child-support order because an appropriate worksheet was not filed during the divorce proceedings. “General Laws 1956 § 15-5-16.2(a) provides that the Family Court ‘shall order either or both parents owing a duty of support to a child to pay an amount based upon a formula and guidelines adopted by an administrative order of the [F]amily [C]ourt.’” Waters v. Magee, 877 A.2d 658, 665 (R.I. 2005) (quoting § 15-5-16.2(a)). Moreover, “[w]e consistently have held that § 15-5-16.2, in conjunction with the support guidelines, requires the trial justice to review the worksheet to determine the base level of child support that the noncustodial parent is required to pay.” Cardinale, 889 A.2d at 221. A trial justice may then deviate from the worksheet guidelines “[o]nly if [he or she] finds that the recommended child support order would be inequitable to the child or to either parent * * *.” Id. “This Court will not disturb such a determination on review absent a clear abuse of discretion.” Hogan v. Hogan, 822 A.2d 925, 927 (R.I. 2003).', 'Here, the trial justice predicated the child-support order upon plaintiff’s earning capacity of $30,000 per year and defendant’s current earnings of approximately $520 per week. It does not appear, however, from either his decision or the record, that he considered the child-support guidelines in accordance with the dictates of § 15-5-16.2 and the Family Court administrative order. The record is devoid of any child-support guidelines worksheet, as is required. In a', '-9- similar situation, we have held that it is necessary “to remand the matter to the Family Court to consider the information contained in the parties’ completed worksheet submitted pursuant to the Family Court’s administrative order.” Lembo v. Lembo, 677 A.2d 414, 419 (R.I. 1996). In that case, the trial justice referenced the child-support guidelines in his bench decision, but it was unclear whether he utilized a child-support guidelines worksheet when determining the amount of child support. Consequently, we consider it necessary to remand the case to the Family Court for a determination of an appropriate order of child support pursuant to the Family Court administrative order.', 'C', 'Equitable Assignment of Property', 'Finally, plaintiff contends that the distribution of property was erroneous because the trial justice erred in: (1) granting defendant 100 percent of her pension; (2) finding that he dissipated $7,000 of marital assets; (3) awarding defendant exclusive possession of the Johnston property; and (4) calculating the joint marital debt.', '“The equitable distribution of marital assets is [also] within the discretion of the trial justice.” Chiappone, 984 A.2d at 36 (quoting Koziol v. Koziol, 720 A.2d 230, 233 (R.I. 1998)). Accordingly, “[t]his Court will not disturb a trial justice’s findings unless it can be shown that the justice was clearly wrong or has overlooked or misconceived material evidence.” Id. at 37 (quoting Mattera v. Mattera, 669 A.2d 538, 543 (R.I. 1996)).', '“The justices of the Family Court are vested with broad discretion as they seek to fairly divide marital property between the parties in divorce proceedings.” Horton v. Horton, 891 A.2d 885, 889 (R.I. 2006). “It is well established that the equitable distribution of property is a three- step process.” Koutroumanos v. Tzeremes, 865 A.2d 1091, 1096 (R.I. 2005). “The trial justice', '- 10 - first must determine which assets are marital property, then must consider the factors set forth in § 15-5-16.1(a),[4] and finally, he or she must distribute the property.” Id.', '1. Pension Benefits', 'The plaintiff argues that the trial justice erred in awarding defendant 100 percent of her pension benefits. Particularly, he asserts that defendant hid her personal pension throughout discovery and that the Family Court erroneously found her testimony to be credible. With respect to the trial justice’s award to defendant of “any and all retirement benefits from her recent employment or previous employment,” there simply is no evidence that such retirement benefits exist, nor did the trial justice make any such finding. Indeed, defendant denied that she had any retirement plan whatsoever. If in the future it should be discovered that defendant in fact had been entitled to any retirement accounts or pension benefits, plaintiff would not be left without remedies. 4', 'The complete list of factors that the court shall consider under G.L. 1956 § 15-5-16.1(a) are:', '“(1) The length of the marriage;', '“(2) The conduct of the parties during the marriage;', '“(3) The contribution of each of the parties during the marriage in', 'the acquisition, preservation, or appreciation in value of their', 'respective estates;', '“(4) The contribution and services of either party as a homemaker;', '“(5) The health and age of the parties;', '“(6) The amount and sources of income of each of the parties;', '“(7) The occupation and employability of each of the parties;', '“(8) The opportunity of each party for future acquisition of capital', 'assets and income;', '“(9) The contribution by one party to the education, training,', 'licensure, business, or increased earning power of the other;', '“(10) The need of the custodial parent to occupy or own the marital', 'residence and to use or own its household effects taking into', 'account the best interest of the children of the marriage;', '“(11) Either party’s wasteful dissipation of assets or any transfer or', 'encumbrance of assets made in contemplation of divorce without', 'fair consideration; and', '“(12) Any factor which the court shall expressly find to be just and', 'proper.”', '- 11 -', '2. Dissipation of Assets', 'The plaintiff also avers that there was no evidence in the record to support a finding that he dissipated $7,000 of marital assets. At trial, he testified that at one time he was informed that there was an approximate balance of $4,000 in the ADP account, but that there were no longer any funds in the account. The plaintiff said that he took some funds out “to set up the house in Johnston for the children, and the rest was lost because [he] did[ ] [not] claim it in time.” He also testified that there was a current balance of $400 in his pension account; defendant introduced a statement showing a “vested balance” of $3,131.66 as of September 30, 2013. In light of the trial justice’s credibility determinations, we discern no cause to disturb his factual finding that plaintiff dissipated “in excess of $7,000” from these two accounts.', '3. Real Estate Properties', 'The plaintiff further argues that the trial justice erred in awarding defendant exclusive possession of the Johnston property, as well as its rental income, as contrary to law and the evidence in this case. In accordance with the temporary order, plaintiff was required to pay the mortgage, insurance, and taxes with respect to the properties, and defendant was allowed to collect the rental income “for child support purposes.” In his written decision, the trial justice made findings of fact to the effect that plaintiff had failed to comply with the temporary order concerning payment of bills with respect to the properties, and that defendant had been required to utilize the rental income to make mortgage payments. The plaintiff now argues that the trial justice did not properly weigh his testimony which, he claims, establishes that: (1) because of his criminal record, his income was significantly reduced, “(2) [defendant] refused to cooperate to save the property, and (3) all funds were going to [defendant].” The plaintiff, however, does not direct our attention to any specific parts of the record to support his contentions.', '- 12 -', 'Our review of the record, on the other hand, leads us to conclude that the trial justice’s factual findings are supported by the evidence and that he conducted an appropriate analysis under § 15-5-16.1 in distributing the marital assets.5 We reiterate the trial justice’s assessment that plaintiff’s testimony was “for the most part unworthy of belief,” noting that credibility determinations are uniquely entrusted to a trial justice. See In re Estate of Ross, 131 A.3d 158, 167 (R.I. 2016) (“[W]e ‘accord a substantial amount of deference to th[e] [credibility] determinations, due to the fact that the trial justice * * * has had an opportunity to appraise witness demeanor and to take into account other realities that cannot be grasped from a reading of a cold record.’”) (quoting D’Ellena v. Town of East Greenwich, 21 A.3d 389, 392 (R.I. 2011)). Moreover, the trial justice found that the Johnston property had no equity, both parties having testified that the outstanding mortgage balance exceeded the fair market value of the property. The trial justice was not clearly wrong, therefore, nor did he misconceive or overlook evidence in awarding the Johnston property to defendant.', '4. Marital Debt', 'Finally, plaintiff avers that the trial justice miscalculated the parties’ marital debt by not accounting for his testimony concerning said debt. At trial, he testified owing between $5,000 and $6,000 in credit-card debt.', 'The record, however, lacks any documentary evidence to substantiate these amounts. The plaintiff also argues that the trial justice failed to factor into his decision the new debt from the foreclosed North Providence property which was solely in his name. The trial justice’s findings with respect to marital debt are as follows: 5', 'In pertinent part, § 15-5-16.1(a) indicates that the court “shall consider * * * [t]he length of the marriage; * * * [t]he conduct of the parties during the marriage; * * * [t]he need of the custodial parent to occupy or own the marital residence and to use or own its household effects taking into account the best interests of the children of the marriage; * * * and * * * [a]ny factor which the court shall expressly find to be just and proper.”', '- 13 -', '“45.

The [p]laintiff’s explanation and/or lack of knowledge as to', 'said debt, is absolutely incredulous.”', 'Again, the issue of marital debt is a matter of credibility in which the trial justice accepted the defendant’s testimony and rejected the plaintiff’s testimony. After reviewing the record and the parties’ submissions, we conclude that the trial justice did not misconceive the relevant evidence nor was he otherwise clearly wrong, and therefore we do not disturb his findings.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, the plaintiff’s appeal is sustained in regard to the issue of child support.

The plaintiff, Lisa Garant, appeals from a Superior Court decision granting summary judgment in favor of the defendant, The 18-20 Woodland Court Condominium Association. On appeal, Ms. Garant argues that the statute of limitations relative to her claim should have been tolled due to the fact that her original complaint, filed before the statutory period expired, named as the defendant “XYZ Company,” i.e., a fictitious name. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on September 29, 2016, pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties’ arguments (both written and oral), we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this appeal may be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'According to the allegations in the complaint, on August 11, 2010, Ms. Garant suffered injuries as the result of a trip and fall accident on an outdoor walkway at 18-20 Woodland Court in Lincoln (the Woodland property). The Woodland property consisted of two units, which were individually owned by Michael E. Winchester and Suzy O. Barcelos-Winchester (Unit 18), and Carolyn S.

The letter identified the insured as “Woodland Court Condo Assoc.” Quincy responded to this letter on February 7, 2011, advising Ms. Garant’s counsel of the policy limits. Quincy sent follow-up correspondence to Ms. Garant’s counsel on five subsequent occasions: July 14, 2011, August 3, 2011, September 26, 2011, October 19, 2011, and January 4, 2012. In the letters sent by Quincy, it sought personal information, medical documentation, and a statement from Ms. Garant. In each of those letters, Quincy referred to its insured as “Woodland Court Condo Assoc.” It was not until July 30, 2012 that Ms. Garant’s counsel replied to Quincy with a demand letter.', 'In an attempt to confirm the identity of defendant, a title examiner was engaged to conduct research at the Lincoln Registry of Deeds concerning the Woodland property.2 Both the 1', 'We note that the condominium owners were named as defendants in plaintiff’s original complaint. However, they were dismissed with prejudice on February 25, 2015 and March 5, 2015, respectively.

That search did not reveal any entity listed under “18-20 Woodland” or “Woodland Court Condominium Association.” Ms. Garant did find in that database an entity listed as “The Woodland Estates Condominium Association;” however, the Secretary of State’s database indicated that that particular entity had a principal office in Johnston and not Lincoln, where defendant’s Woodland property is located.', 'Ms. Garant alleges that, based on the information received from Quincy, the Registry of Deeds, and the Secretary of State’s corporate database, she was unable to determine defendant’s true identity. Accordingly, on July 25, 2013, just prior to the expiration of the three-year statute of limitations (August 11, 2013), Ms. Garant filed a complaint against the individual unit owners, as well as an entity referred to as “XYZ Company,” claiming that these defendants’ negligent maintenance of the walkway on the Woodland property caused her to fall and injure herself. On November 19, 2013, in their responses to interrogatories propounded by Ms. Garant, the unit owners identified their condominium association as “18-20 Woodland Court Condominium Association.”', 'Despite possessing the interrogatory responses from the unit owners, it was not until August 4, 2014—nearly a full year after the expiration of the statute of limitations—that Ms. Garant sought leave to file an amended complaint in order to add “18-20 Woodland Court Condominium Association” as a defendant. Ms. Garant’s motion to amend her complaint was granted on October 9, 2014. The defendant filed its answer to the amended complaint on', '-3- October 28, 2014. On March 13, 2015, defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the statute of limitations had run because more than three years had passed between the date of the alleged accident and the date of the filing of the amended complaint. The defendant asserted that Ms. Garant’s original complaint had not tolled the statute of limitations because, at the time when she filed that complaint, Ms. Garant knew defendant’s identity.', 'At a hearing on May 19, 2015, the hearing justice granted defendant’s motion for summary judgment. The hearing justice determined that G.L. 1956 § 9-5-20, which permits a plaintiff who does not know a defendant’s name to use a fictitious name for purposes of filing a complaint, could not properly be invoked by Ms. Garant because she knew 18-20 Woodland Condominium’s identity prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations.3 The hearing justice found that Ms. Garant was in possession of the land record evidence from the Registry of Deeds before filing her original complaint and, consequently, had knowledge of defendant’s identity at that time.

86,Portsmouth Water and Fire District : v. : Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. This case came before the Supreme Court for argument on November 3, 2016, pursuant to a statutory petition for a writ of certiorari filed in accordance with G.L. 1956 § 39-5-1. The petitioner, Portsmouth Water and Fire District (Portsmouth), seeks review of a Public Utilities Commission (PUC) order issued in response to this Court’s remand order that required the PUC to make more specific findings of fact in a rate case involving the City of Newport’s Utility Department, Water Division (Newport Water or utility).', 'After carefully considering the record in this case, we affirm in part and vacate in part the PUC’s order.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'A', 'Background and Prior Litigation', 'Like immiscible liquids, Portsmouth and Newport Water have not mixed well in the arena of rate filings. The origins of this case date back more than thirteen years and stem from Newport Water’s November 2003 application with the PUC—designated by that body as docket No. 3578—requesting a revenue increase. The filing precipitated a dispute between Newport Water and its wholesale customers 1 concerning several issues, including $2.5 million for services that the City of Newport had provided to Newport Water that the utility claimed it owed to the city. The case was resolved through a PUC-approved settlement in which the utility was allowed to repay $2.5 million in debt that it owed to the city. Also, as part of that agreement, the utility agreed “that it will not seek to recover in rates any additional monies that it may borrow from the City of Newport up through and including June 30, 2005.” Newport Water further agreed that, if it borrowed any money from the city subsequent to that date, such a “loan shall be reflected by appropriate documentation and Newport Water shall have the duty to monitor and track its costs and properly account for how the loan proceeds are applied.”', 'On January 29, 2007, Newport Water filed another rate application with the PUC— designated docket No. 3818—again requesting a revenue increase. 2 During that proceeding, evidence surfaced that Newport Water owed $1,584,171 to the city for payroll, city service 1', 'Additional parties to this docket were the Division of Public Utilities and Carriers (Division), Portsmouth, and the United States Navy (Navy). Portsmouth and the Navy purchase water on a wholesale basis from Newport Water. 2', 'The parties to this docket were the same as in docket No. 3578.', '-2- charges, sewer bills, and other items. 3 On March 24, 2008, the PUC issued an order in docket No. 3818 that said in part:', '“The [PUC] finds that the $1,584,171 should be paid back to the', 'City. The [PUC] will not include this repayment to the City in', 'Newport Water’s revenue requirement, but if Newport Water', 'realizes savings from efficiencies, and such funds are not required', 'for expenses included in the revenue requirement, it may use such', 'savings to pay down the accounts payable balance owed to the', 'City.”', 'On December 9, 2008, Newport Water filed yet another application for a rate increase— docket No. 4025—and it is that filing that has spawned the litigation in this case. 4 During the litigation surrounding docket No. 4025, an issue that became contentious was whether Newport Water had violated the dictates of the above quoted language from the order in docket No. 3818. Specifically, the parties addressed the following prebriefing question that the PUC issued: “Whether the issue of repayment to the City * * * in the amount of $1,584,171 has been decided by [the order in docket No. 3818]. If so, can and should the [PUC] revisit this issue in the instant docket[?]”', 'The PUC held an open meeting on June 25, 2009, during which it attempted to resolve the issue at hand. Portsmouth argued that Newport Water should be allowed to repay the city using only savings from efficiencies that were not required for expenses included in the revenue requirement. The PUC, however, did not agree; it ruled that Portsmouth’s interpretation of the order in docket No. 3818 was incorrect. The PUC held that it “did not clearly require” savings to 3', 'Although not germane to resolving this case, it is worth understanding that at the root of Newport Water’s debt to the city is the fact that, unlike other municipal water utilities, Newport Water is required to fund certain restricted receipt accounts before paying any amount that might be due to the city. This results in less money being available to pay operations and maintenance expenses. When it faces a cash deficit, Newport Water opts to pay outside vendors first and city service expenses last. This policy has, from time to time, resulted in a series of payroll and city service expenses unpaid. 4', 'The additional parties to this docket were again the Division, Portsmouth, and the Navy.', '-3- be created through efficiencies as a condition precedent to the utility’s repayment to the city. Rather, the order merely “set forth * * * the amount which was to be repaid to the City at the time of the hearing in Docket No. 3818, but not included in Newport Water’s Revenue Requirement.” Additionally, the PUC determined that Newport Water had, in fact, realized “savings,” had not violated the PUC’s previous order, and that “none of the disputed repayments should be disallowed.”', 'On March 29, 2010, the PUC issued a report and order in docket No. 4025 that encompassed the June 25, 2009, open meeting (hereinafter report and order). Within that report and order, the PUC detailed Newport Water’s “net cost savings,” relying heavily on the testimony of Ms. Julia Forgue, director of utilities for the city. Specifically, the PUC noted that Newport Water’s net cost savings arose from the following: “employee turn-over and the lack of a new labor contract”; “a City policy change regarding the payment of landline telecommunications costs”; reduced use of heavy equipment “due to a lack of any large main breaks”; “a change in Dam Safety Regulations and a decision to limit raw material purchases for dam repairs and tree removals”; “management decisions * * * regarding the hiring of temporary employees”; reduced spending on conferences and training; a “reduction of inventory and office supply purchases”; and other budgeted costs that were lower than anticipated in the revenue requirement. The PUC found that all funds that had been realized through the above mentioned savings were available to Newport Water “to reduce its payables to all vendors, including the City.” Additionally, the PUC also recognized that Newport Water realized savings through “the specific types of efficiencies discussed * * * in Docket No. 3818.” In particular, the PUC', '-4- identified Newport Water’s transition to quarterly billing and its implementation of radio reads 5 as “efficiencies.”', 'The PUC held that the aforementioned efficiencies were “a means to commence the required repayment” of Newport Water’s $1,584,171 debt owed to the city.', 'Portsmouth, feeling aggrieved by the PUC’s report and order of March 29, timely petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari under § 39-5-1, which we issued on April 21, 2010. When the case was argued before this Court, Portsmouth asserted that the PUC’s order in docket No. 3818 clearly prohibited Newport Water from repaying the city with funds that had been included in the revenue requirement. The gravamen of Portsmouth’s argument was that Newport Water violated the PUC’s repayment order because, in Portsmouth’s view, it did not realize any “savings from efficiencies.” Instead, Portsmouth averred that Newport Water took money from items that had been included in its revenue requirement and diverted it to the city.', 'This Court addressed those issues in Portsmouth Water and Fire District v. Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission, 37 A.3d 114 (R.I. 2012) (mem.) (Portsmouth Water I). We rejected the PUC’s argument that “the production of ‘efficiencies’ was * * * merely a means to commence the required repayment at the time of the Order without increasing rates.” Id. at 117. Ultimately, it was our “opinion that the PUC did not make sufficient findings of fact to support its conclusion that Newport Water complied with the order in docket No. 3818.” Id. We were troubled by the fact that the PUC “did not specifically identify the sources of [the] ‘net cost savings,’ or quantify them, such that we can determine whether the utility realized $1,584,171 of ‘savings from efficiencies’ that were ‘not required for expenses included in the revenue 5', 'The term “radio reads” refers to a meter-reading system in which the utility can read customers’ meters remotely, as opposed to physically entering the premises, thereby “minimizing unaccounted for water, estimated billings, and customer inconveniences.” See City of Newport: Water Meters, http://www.cityofnewport.com/departments/utilities/water/water-meters (last visited October 18, 2016).', '-5- requirement.’” Id. Consequently, we vacated the PUC’s order in docket No. 4025 to the extent that it failed to enforce the order in docket No. 3818, and we issued a remand order to the PUC “with directions that it make more specific findings of fact to support its conclusion that Newport Water complied with the order in docket No. 3818.” Id. at 118.', 'B', 'The PUC’s Order on Remand', 'On remand, the PUC determined that further hearings were not required, 6 and it considered the matter at an open meeting on August 8, 2012. Then, on August 10, 2012, the PUC issued a written order in response to this Court’s remand order (hereinafter order on remand). Using the records already available in docket No. 4025, the PUC identified areas of savings and reductions that it believed “were the types of things the Commission anticipated when referencing efficiencies.” Specifically, the PUC found savings and reductions “relate[d] to items that unexpectedly came in below budgeted levels” as follows:', '“(1) employee retirements; (2) absenteeism due to disability leave;', '(3) a reduction in overtime based on a reduction in water main', 'breaks; (4) opt-outs for family health care; (5) reduced', 'participation in the tuition reimbursement benefit; (6) change in', 'City policy regarding payment for phone service; (7) reduced need', 'for heavy equipment rental due to reduction in water main breaks,', 'reservoir maintenance not needed because of new DEM', 'regulations; (8) delay in sewer startup reducing the payments owed', 'by NWD; (9) less than anticipated regulatory fees from RIDOH,', 'anticipated service contract not required in FY 2008; (10) no self', 'insurance needed in FY 2008; (11) no layoffs requiring no', 'unemployment claims; and (12) other reductions related to drawing', 'down on inventory or reducing dues and subscriptions, temporary 6', 'According to the PUC’s order on remand, counsel for both Portsmouth and Newport Water said that not only was a hearing not required, but that it would be inappropriate. PUC’s counsel was not in complete agreement, but deferred to Portsmouth and Newport Water. Accordingly, no further hearings were conducted, and the order on remand was based solely on evidence already within the record.', '-6-', 'labor or conferences and training, but not putting off repairs or', 'maintenance as a result.” The PUC went on to highlight that it “cannot accept Newport Water’s position that savings should include deferred costs such as things like maintenance items [that] were simply held off until after the rate year.” Ultimately, the PUC concluded “that Newport Water realized $557,499 in the type of net cost savings that would fall within the language of the Docket No. 3818 Order.”', 'Additionally, the PUC identified $191,997 in “excess revenues in Order No. 3818” that was available to Newport Water to reduce its “payables to the City in Fiscal Year 2008.” The PUC reasoned that, although this money did not strictly qualify as an “efficiency,” the use of excess revenues is “normally a management decision,” and “not an area into which the Commission is entitled to delve.” Accordingly, the PUC determined that Newport Water could use the $191,997 to repay its debt to the city.', 'It is worth noting that, despite the references to radio reads and the switch to quarterly billing as efficiencies in Portsmouth Water I, the PUC ultimately concluded that any savings from these two items were not available to Newport to pay down its debt to the city. Regarding the radio reads, the PUC found that the switch did result in cost savings, but, “[u]nfortunately, a further review of the docket [did] not result in an adequate quantification of those savings.” Consequently, those savings could not be applied to the debt that Newport Water owed to the city. As for the transition to quarterly billing, the PUC was able to identify $128,182 in savings, but found that these savings were, likewise, not available to pay down the $1,584,171 balance because the PUC had previously ordered Newport Water to “restrict those funds through the end of Fiscal Year 2009.”', '-7-', 'Finally, the PUC articulated “that there is no evidence in the Record in Docket No. 4025 that Newport Water repaid $1,584,171 to the City of Newport in Fiscal Year 2008.” The only reference to the amount that Portsmouth alleges Newport Water repaid to the city was in a footnote in Portsmouth’s prehearing brief. According to Portsmouth, Newport Water repaid $952,252 to the city. The PUC, however, did not rely on the footnote “because it was not part of the Record.” Nevertheless, the PUC did analyze cash flow reports that showed that “Newport Water had never reduced its payables to zero and further, that as of June 30, 2008, * * * Newport Water’s outstanding balance to the City was $1,005,417.”', 'Portsmouth, again feeling aggrieved by the PUC, exercised its statutory right under § 39- 5-1 and timely filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with this Court on August 17, 2012. We issued the writ on August 20, 2012.', 'II', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Issues on Appeal', 'On appeal, Portsmouth raises four related issues. First, Portsmouth argues that the PUC failed to make the factual findings that this Court required in its Portsmouth Water I order. Specifically, Portsmouth contends that the PUC failed to identify any efficiencies that resulted in savings not necessary for Newport Water’s revenue requirement. Portsmouth also claims that the PUC’s definition of “efficiency” is incorrect. Second, Portsmouth maintains that the PUC erred when it held that Newport Water could use $191,997 in excess revenues to repay the city. Third, Portsmouth asserts that the PUC erred when it concluded that there was no evidence in the record to show that Newport Water repaid $1,584,171 to the city. And fourth, Portsmouth', '-8- maintains that in order for the PUC to be in compliance with Portsmouth Water I, it should have ordered the city to repay to the utility any portions of the $1,584,171 that it found were not the result of savings from efficiencies.', 'B', 'Standard of Review', 'It is undisputed that this Court affords great deference to the PUC’s decisions.

Portsmouth contends that this Court, in Portsmouth Water I, required the PUC on remand “to make three separate findings: (1) identify the source of any savings from efficiencies; (2) quantify the amount of savings from that source; and (3) explain why the savings were not required for expenses in the revenue requirement.” However, Portsmouth’s interpretation of our order in Portsmouth Water I overstates, to some extent, our actual mandate to the PUC. It is true that in our order we said that the PUC “did not specifically identify the sources of [the] ‘net cost savings,’ or quantify them, such that we can determine whether the utility realized $1,584,171 of ‘savings from efficiencies’ that were ‘not required for expenses included in the revenue requirement.’” Portsmouth Water I, 37 A.3d at 117. Indeed, we noted this lack of specificity to explain why it was impossible for us to determine if “the PUC ruled in a reasonable manner and whether or not its findings of fact [were] fairly and substantially supported by legal evidence.” Id. at 117-18. Our actual mandate, however, simply directed the PUC to “make more specific findings of fact to support its conclusion that Newport Water complied with the order in docket No. 3818.” Id. at 118.', 'It is our opinion that the PUC satisfied the strictures of our order in Portsmouth Water I. In its order on remand, the PUC clearly identified twelve areas in which Newport Water realized savings through efficiencies. The PUC then quantified the total amount saved. Surely it would', '- 11 - have been preferable if the PUC had provided a more detailed itemization of the savings that Newport Water achieved. And it would have been better if the PUC had created a line item that corresponded to each efficiency identified. This Court did not, however, require that degree of specificity from the PUC. We merely asked for the fact-finding on remand to be more specific than it was in the report and order that preceded Portsmouth’s first appeal, and the PUC met that burden. 7', 'b', 'In addition to arguing that the PUC simply did not make the factual findings that we required, Portsmouth contends that the twelve areas that the PUC identified as efficiencies are actually not efficiencies at all, and any savings that Newport Water realized were mere happenstance. In this regard, Portsmouth argues that the term “efficiencies” has a narrow definition that would require Newport Water “to take affirmative steps to operate at a reduced cost.”', 'The PUC, however, has taken a more expansive view of “efficiencies.” In its report and order from docket No. 4025, the PUC gave examples of what it deemed to be efficiencies, including savings from “sound fiscal management * * *, shortening the billing cycle, more aggressive collection of accounts receivable, higher than anticipated revenues in a given year due to unanticipated consumption increases, and implementation of automated meter reading.” The PUC went on to say that, instead of looking only at specific items that create savings, the PUC 7', 'In the report and order from docket No. 4025, the PUC mentioned eight areas where Newport Water realized cost savings, and also credited Newport Water for having created efficiencies through its transition to radio reads and quarterly billing. The March 29 report and order did not, however, attach any dollar amount to these savings, which left us unable to determine if the PUC had ruled reasonably. In contrast, the order on remand after our opinion in Portsmouth Water I highlighted twelve areas of efficiencies and specifically excluded the radio reads and quarterly billing. Furthermore, the PUC’s order on remand included a specific dollar amount that Newport Water saved as a result of the efficiencies.', '- 12 - will consider the totality of a regulated agency’s operations when assessing efficiencies. The PUC acknowledged that, although Portsmouth “may define efficiency differently,” the PUC “finds that its interpretation of [the order in docket No. 3818] is consistent with both the dictionary definition provided by [Portsmouth] and with prior [PUC] decisions.” Furthermore, in its order on remand, the PUC held that the “savings and reductions” that Newport Water achieved “were the types of things the [PUC] anticipated when referencing efficiencies.”', 'In essence, Portsmouth argues that we should weigh its definition of “efficiency” against the PUC’s definition and determine whose is correct. However, our role in a case such as this one is not to balance competing definitions.', 'Rather, our review is limited to determining whether the PUC ruled in a “lawful and reasonable manner.” Portsmouth Water I, 37 A.3d at 117 (quoting Kent County Water Authority, 996 A.2d at 128). We have repeatedly said that there is a “presumption that the [PUC’s] conclusions are reasonable unless shown otherwise by clear and convincing evidence.” Providence Water Supply Board v. Malachowski, 624 A.2d 305, 309 (R.I. 1993). Furthermore, we have held that G.L. 1956 § 39-1-1 vests the PUC with the power to “address the myriad of complex problems associated with regulatory proceedings, and render intelligent decisions. We honor that legislative intent and refuse to substitute our judgment for the judgment of the [PUC].” South County Gas Co. v. Burke, 551 A.2d 22, 25 (R.I. 1988). Accordingly, because we find nothing unreasonable or unlawful in the PUC’s definition of “efficiencies,” we must uphold it as correct within the context of this case.', 'In sum, it is our opinion that the PUC has lawfully and reasonably defined, identified, and quantified “efficiencies” as it relates to the order in docket No. 3818.', '- 13 -', 'ii', 'Excess Revenues', 'Portsmouth’s next argument on appeal is that the PUC impermissibly ruled that Newport Water may use $191,997 in “excess revenues in [docket] No. 3818” to reduce its “payables to the City in Fiscal Year 2008.” Portsmouth contends that the order in docket No. 3818 (quoted supra) allowed repayment only from savings achieved through efficiencies. Portsmouth asserts that the PUC “did not have leeway to identify other sources of funds to supplement any savings from efficiencies * * *.” The PUC, however, disagrees with Portsmouth. In its order on remand, the PUC said that “[t]here was no discussion of the use of excess revenues in Order No. 3818[,] which is silent with regard to Newport Water’s usage of any excess revenues it may realize * * *.”', 'This Court affords great deference to the PUC “because the Legislature has mandated that we cannot reverse an order of the commission unless it exceeded its authority or acted illegally, arbitrarily, or unreasonably.” Providence Water Supply Board v. Malachowski, 624 A.2d at 309 (citing § 39-5-3). It is our opinion, however, that the PUC went beyond the scope of our remand order, thereby exceeding its authority. Our order limited the PUC to “make more specific findings of fact to support its conclusion that Newport Water complied with the order in docket No. 3818.” Portsmouth Water I, 37 A.3d at 118. By the PUC’s own admission, the order in docket No. 3818 was “silent” on whether excess revenues could be used to repay the $1,584,171 debt. Accordingly, it was inappropriate for the PUC to make a ruling on the use of excess revenues in its order on remand. Consequently, the PUC’s ruling is vacated to the extent that it allows Newport Water to use the $191,997 in excess revenues to pay down the $1,584,171', '- 14 - debt that it owes to the city. Only if the PUC takes action independent from its order in docket No. 3818 may Newport Water use these funds to repay its debt. 8', 'iii', 'Repayment of $1,584,171', 'Portsmouth also argues that the PUC erred when it found that there was no evidence showing that Newport Water had repaid the city the sum of $1,584,171. First, Portsmouth contends that that issue was not before the PUC on remand. And second, Portsmouth asserts that, assuming the issue was properly before the PUC, the PUC incorrectly held that there was no evidence that $1,584,171 had been repaid. Portsmouth asserts that the full $1,584,171 has been repaid, but it appears to base that conclusion on a single sentence from Newport Water’s June 2009 brief to the PUC regarding its rate-change application in docket No. 4025. In that brief, Newport Water wrote that “[i]t is [our] position that these specific expenses have been paid.” Portsmouth asserts that this shows that Newport Water repaid the debt.', 'Newport Water, however, disagrees with Portsmouth, and instead says that it has not repaid the debt and that the quoted language indicates only that the city has advanced those expenses on behalf of the utility. Furthermore, at oral argument, the parties were not able to agree on how much, if any, of the debt had been repaid. 8', 'It is pertinent to note that typically the PUC does not regulate how excess revenues are used because such decisions fall within the managerial discretion of the utility. “We have stated consistently that the broad regulatory powers of the [PUC] ordinarily do not include the authority to dictate managerial policy. * * * It is not the function of the [PUC] to manage the utility or to exercise the prerogatives of ownership.” In re Narragansett Bay Commission General Rate Filing, 808 A.2d 631, 636, 637 (R.I. 2002). In this same vein, the PUC observed in its order on remand that “[t]he usage of such funds is normally a management decision by the utility based on a reasonable determination of where the funds are needed the most. This is normally not an area into which the [PUC] is entitled to delve * * *.” However, as stated above, the use of excess revenues was not part of our remand.', '- 15 -', 'The PUC, for its part, agrees with Portsmouth that the issue was not before it on remand, maintaining that, because this Court did “not specifically request[] the [PUC] to make a determination on this issue in its Order, the [PUC] declined to do so at Open Meeting.” Although the PUC did not affirmatively rule on the issue, it did note “that there is no evidence in the Record in Docket No. 4025 that Newport Water repaid $1,584,171 to the City of Newport in Fiscal Year 2008.” The PUC went on to add that “[t]he Cash Flow Reports showed that Newport Water had never reduced its payables to zero and further, that as of June 30, 2008, one year after the Cash Flow Report used in Docket No. 3818, Newport Water’s outstanding balance to the City was $1,005,417.”', '“The findings of the [PUC] on questions of fact shall be held to be prima facie true, and * * * [this Court], shall not exercise its independent judgment nor weigh conflicting evidence.” Section 39-5-3. If this Court cannot determine the facts based upon the PUC’s written order, we will not speculate as to the facts, nor will we search the record in our own fact-finding mission. Rather, we will remand the case to the PUC for further fact-finding. See Narragansett Electric Co., 35 A.3d at 931.', 'Here, the only fact that the PUC has documented regarding the repayment of the $1,584,171 debt is that Newport Water never reduced its payables to zero. Given this limited fact-finding and the fact that Portsmouth and Newport Water disagree as to how much has been repaid, it is our opinion that the record is simply unclear, and we are therefore unable to address Portsmouth’s contention that the PUC erred by not ordering the city to repay portions of the $1,584,171 debt to the utility. We therefore direct the PUC to certify to this Court how much Newport Water has repaid to the city as a result of the report and order in docket No. 3818.', '- 16 -', 'III', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated in this opinion, we quash the writ previously issued and affirm the Public Utilities Commission’s order on remand in regard to its definition, identification, and quantification of “efficiencies” as it relates to the order in docket No. 3818. However, we vacate the PUC’s order on remand to the extent that it allows Newport Water to use $191,997 in excess revenues to pay down its $1,584,171 debt to the city. We note that Newport Water may not access the $191,997 for the purpose of paying the $1,584,171 debt absent further action by the PUC. The PUC is directed to expeditiously certify to this Court how much of the $1,584,171 debt has been remitted to the city.

87,State : v. : Jose Lopez.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court.', 'This case came before the Supreme Court on October 26, 2016, on appeal by the defendant, Jose Lopez (defendant or Lopez), from judgments of conviction entered in the Superior Court, following a jury trial. Lopez was convicted of murder in the first degree, discharging a firearm during a crime of violence, and conspiracy to commit murder. Lopez, who was a juvenile at the time of the murder, was acquitted of one count of carrying a firearm without a license.1', 'Before this Court, Lopez contends that the trial justice erred by denying his motion for a new trial. Specifically, he argues that the trial justice overlooked and misconstrued material evidence and that the weight of the evidence did not support the verdicts in this case in light of the bias and interests of the state’s witnesses. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgments of conviction. 1', 'Lopez turned seventeen years old four days after the murder and was waived out of Family Court following a hearing.', '-1-', 'Facts and Travel', 'On Christmas Eve 2013, twenty-one-year-old Ryan Almeida (Almeida) was murdered outside his mother’s home at The Galego Court housing project (the Manor) in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. The facts and circumstances leading up to this homicide portray a vengeful and violent gang feud between the “Chad Brown” and the “East Side” street gangs. Jason “Heavy” Gonzalez (Gonzalez), Daquan Watts (Watts), and Lopez are members of the Chad Brown gang, and the decedent was an alleged member of the rival East Side gang. Although the intense antagonism between the two gangs is deeply rooted, the animosity escalated in June 2013 when Lopez’s cousin, Jose “Hova” Sanchez, was murdered, allegedly by members of the East Side gang.', 'The facts of this case are chilling. In the early morning hours of December 24, 2013, Gonzalez, Watts, and Lopez “went for a ride” to the East Side of Providence “[t]o see if [they could] see anybody from that side of town.” They drove up Pleasant Street, down Camp Street, and down Doyle Avenue, looking for enemies to shoot, to no avail, when Watts suggested that they go to the Manor and look for Almeida. After driving past the guard shack at the Manor, Watts directed them to the back of the Manor, where he knew Almeida lived with his mother. Gonzalez and Watts noticed a black car with its engine running and its lights on. Although the vehicle appeared to be unoccupied, there were two occupants in the car—Janelle Lewis (Lewis) and her boyfriend.', 'Lewis, an eyewitness to the murder, testified at trial.', 'Her testimony corroborated the testimony of Gonzalez and Watts and supported their accounts that Lopez was the shooter. After noticing Lewis’s vehicle, the Chad Brown gang proceeded out of the Manor and parked on a side street across from the complex.', '-2-', 'According to both Gonzalez and Watts, Gonzalez got out of the car and asked for the gun but Lopez objected, declaring that he “wanted to do it.” Watts and Gonzalez watched as Lopez pulled a gun out of his shoe and put it in the pocket of his gray hooded sweatshirt. Lopez asked Watts to accompany him because Watts knew his way around the Manor; Gonzalez remained in the car. Watts and Lopez tightened the hoods of their sweatshirts and proceeded into the Manor toward Almeida’s apartment. According to Watts, Almeida was coming out of his home when Lopez pulled out the gun, aimed, and fired. Watts heard a total of five gunshots. As Almeida fell to the ground, Lopez and Watts ran back to the car where Watts told Gonzalez that it was Almeida who was coming out of the house, and that “[Lopez] had got him.” Watts added, “I heard [Almeida] scream. I think he got hit five times.” Lopez agreed, stating, “I think I hit him.”', 'The gunshots awakened Almeida’s mother, who ran to the door and saw her son lying on the ground outside, bleeding from his abdomen. In his final moments, Almeida worried for his mother, stating, “Ma, don’t run out here. I think they’re still out here.” Almeida died of a gunshot wound to the torso; the manner of death was homicide. It was Christmas Eve morning.', 'The defendant testified at trial and contested this version of events. According to Lopez, it was he who was driving the car that evening, a white Toyota Solara that he had borrowed from his friend, Nathaniel Robinson (Robinson). After Lopez picked up Watts, Gonzalez, and Tyron Wilcox (Wilcox), Watts suggested that they drive to the East Side to look for rival gang members. Lopez agreed because it was the East Side gang that had killed his cousin, but he stated: “I’m not shooting nobody or nothing.” Lopez testified that he did not want to “put [Robinson’s] car in a situation.” As they were driving to the East Side, Wilcox asked to be taken home to his house in the Manor to “get something.” When they reached the Manor, Lopez drove past the guard shack, circled around, and exited the complex. He parked across the street, as', '-3- instructed by Watts. Notably, Lopez claimed that he did not notice a black car with its lights on parked in the back of the Manor because he “wasn’t paying attention.”', 'Lopez testified that Watts and Wilcox got out of the Solara, donned their hoodies, and walked toward the Manor without speaking a word. Lopez testified that he did not see a gun, and did not know where Watts and Wilcox were going because he “wasn’t paying attention.” When the men returned to the vehicle, about five minutes later, Lopez asked, “What the hell. What’s going on?” Lopez claimed that neither man responded, but that he saw Watts hand something to Gonzalez. He could not identify the item because he “wasn’t paying attention.” Also, he did not learn of the shooting until the next day, when he watched the news. Lopez averred that he later spoke with Watts, who confirmed that he was the shooter.', 'Although the events leading up to the shooting were disputed by the witnesses at trial, it was uncontested that Lopez was the first member of the group to speak with the police in the aftermath of the shooting. However, defendant’s version of the events did not support the facts uncovered by the detectives during their investigation, including the facts disclosed by Lewis, whose physical description of the shooter matched that of Lopez. Lopez was arrested on April 4, 2014, after the detectives secured an arrest warrant based on surveillance images captured by a camera on the guard shack of the Manor. The images depict the Toyota Solara entering into the complex in the early morning hours of December 24, 2013; based on the images, the police traced the vehicle to Lopez. After an initial denial, Lopez eventually admitted that he had been the driver of the Solara, but that Watts was the shooter. Subsequently, the detectives secured warrants for Watts and Wilcox, and then arrested Gonzalez.', 'When Watts and Gonzalez learned that Lopez “gave up everybody” and “point[ed] the finger at [them],” the tables turned. Watts and Gonzalez agreed to cooperate with the state and', '-4- testify against Lopez.2 At trial, both Watts and Gonzalez declared that Lopez was the shooter. Their testimony and that of the other witnesses for the state convinced the jury of Lopez’s guilt. He was convicted of murder, discharging a firearm during a crime of violence, and conspiracy to commit murder.', 'After the trial justice denied Lopez’s motion for a new trial, he was sentenced to two mandatory consecutive sentences of life imprisonment for first-degree murder and for discharging a firearm resulting in death. He also was sentenced to a consecutive ten-year term of suspension and probation for conspiracy to commit murder. Lopez filed a timely notice of appeal to this Court; he was eighteen years old at the time.', 'Standard of Review', 'When passing on a motion for a new trial in a criminal case, “the trial justice must determine ‘whether the evidence adduced at trial is sufficient for the jury to conclude guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.’” State v. Staffier, 21 A.3d 287, 290 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Peoples, 996 A.2d 660, 664 (R.I. 2010)). “When making this determination, ‘the trial justice acts as a thirteenth juror, exercising independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.’” Id. (quoting State v. Heredia, 10 A.3d 443, 446 (R.I. 2010)). “Specifically, ‘the trial justice must (1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.’” Id. (quoting Heredia, 10 A.3d at 446). “If the trial justice agrees with the jury’s verdict, 2', 'Watts pleaded guilty to first-degree murder, conspiracy, and carrying a firearm without a license; he was sentenced to serve a single life sentence for first-degree murder and ten years concurrently for conspiracy and carrying a firearm without a license. Gonzalez pleaded guilty to conspiracy and carrying a firearm without a license; he was sentenced to two concurrent terms of ten years, three years to serve with seven years suspended and probation.', '-5- the inquiry is complete and the motion for a new trial should be denied.”3 Id. (citing State v. Morales, 895 A.2d 114, 121 (R.I. 2006)).', 'Furthermore, “[i]n cases in which the trial justice has articulated a sufficient rationale for denying a motion for a new trial, the decision will be given great weight. Such a judgment will be disturbed only if the trial justice has overlooked or misconceived material evidence relating to a critical issue or if the justice was otherwise clearly wrong.” State v. Banach, 648 A.2d 1363, 1367 (R.I. 1994) (citing State v. Robbio, 526 A.2d 509, 513 (R.I. 1987)). “This Court employs a ‘deferential standard of review because a trial justice, being present during all phases of the trial, is in an especially good position to evaluate the facts and to judge the credibility of the witnesses.’” State v. Baptista, 79 A.3d 24, 29-30 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Paola, 59 A.3d 99, 104 (R.I. 2013)).', 'Analysis', 'The sole issue before this Court is whether the trial justice erred in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial. Specifically, we are tasked with considering whether the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence and clearly erred when he credited the testimony of two biased cohorts—Watts and Gonzalez. We perceive no error.', 'After carefully reviewing the record before us, we are satisfied that the trial justice properly weighed the evidence presented at trial and independently assessed the credibility of the witnesses when he concluded that he agreed with the jury’s verdict. See Banach, 648 A.2d at 1367 (holding that the trial justice did not err in denying a motion for a new trial where he 3', 'See State v. Staffier, 21 A.3d 287, 290-91 (R.I. 2011) (“If, however, the trial justice does not agree with the jury verdict, he or she is required to proceed to a fourth step in the new trial analysis to ‘determine whether the verdict is against the fair preponderance of the evidence and fails to do substantial justice.

Guerra, 12 A.3d 759, 765-66 (R.I. 2011))).', '-6- reviewed the physical evidence presented at trial, independently assessed the credibility of the witnesses, and articulated his reasons for the denial). The trial justice prefaced his reasoning for denying the motion by quoting from this Court’s decision in State v. Mattatall, 603 A.2d 1098 (R.I. 1992), stating:', '“[W]hen a defendant elects to testify, he runs the very real risk that', 'if disbelieved, the trier of fact may conclude that the opposite of', 'his testimony is the truth. * * * As long as there exists some other', 'evidence of the defendant’s guilt, disbelief of a defendant’s sworn', 'testimony is sufficient to sustain a finding of guilt. * * * ‘A trier of', 'fact is not compelled to accept and believe the self-serving stories', 'of vitally interested defendants. Their evidence may not only be', 'disbelieved, but from the totality of the circumstances, including', 'the manner in which they testify, a contrary conclusion may be', 'properly drawn.’” Id. at 1109 (quoting United States v. Cisneros,', '448 F.2d 298, 305 (9th Cir. 1971)).', 'We consider this passage befitting for the issue at hand. This case was a straightforward credibility contest between defendant and his co-conspirators, Watts and Gonzalez.', 'The defendant elected to testify, and the jury rejected his testimony, a repudiation that the trial justice found to be “not at all surprising.”', 'The trial justice assessed defendant’s credibility by recounting portions of his testimony, honing in on the myriad of untruths that he offered to the jury. The inconsistencies began with defendant’s claim “that he was not a member of the Chad Brown gang” despite his appearance in Facebook photographs flaunting the iconic Chad Brown “C” hand sign and his repeated Facebook references to his friends as “fellow gang members.” The defendant testified that he “didn’t know there was a gun in the car” even though the nearly identical testimony of Watts and Gonzalez named him as the gunman. The trial justice found that, in further conflict with defendant’s apparent ignorance of the gun, is the sad reality of gang life—that “one never enter[s] into enemy territory without a gun”—and that there is “no reason to go into enemy', '-7- territory unless [intending] to shoot somebody.” The trial justice concluded that defendant’s testimony, in addition to his disclaimer that he would drive to the East Side but not shoot at anyone, was “simply not credible. At the very least, [defendant] knew full well that this car ride was bent on violence and, as well, revenge and retaliation for [his cousin’s] death.” The defendant’s version of the moments after the shooting, when he stated that Watts and Gonzalez returned to the car and neglected to mention the shooting, also was categorized by the trial justice as “simply ridiculous.”', 'In contrast to defendant’s testimony, the trial justice credited that of Watts and Gonzalez and found “[a]t the very least, the evidence demonstrated that all three of them were involved in a conspiracy to commit murder. * * * Gonzalez last saw the gun in Lopez[’s] hands, and Watts said he saw Lopez actually shoot Almeida.” The trial justice concluded, based on the evidence adduced at trial, that the jury was warranted in accepting that testimony. We are inclined to agree. When a defendant in a criminal case elects to testify on his own behalf, he can expect rigorous cross-examination from the prosecution that may well serve as the final persuasive factor convincing the jury of his guilt.', 'In the context of a motion for a new trial, this Court has articulated that, even if “the evidence and the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom are so nearly balanced that reasonable individuals could arrive at different results * * * the new trial motion must be denied.” Connors v. Gasbarro, 448 A.2d 756, 759 (R.I. 1982). Here, however, the approximately one hundred and fifty pages of the record devoted to defendant’s testimony yields little room for a near balance of the evidence or the potential for reasonable minds to arrive at different results. Rather, after a fair reading of defendant’s testimony, any doubt that existed in the minds of the jurors after the testimony of Watts and Gonzalez evaporated. See State v. Cacchiotti, 568 A.2d', '-8- 1026, 1029 (R.I. 1990) (affirming the denial of a motion for a new trial where the defendant’s own testimony, when viewed in the context of other highly credible testimony, in all likelihood caused the jury to convict the defendant of involuntary manslaughter).', 'Thus, when the credible testimony of Watts and Gonzalez is considered in light of defendant’s inconsistent, self-serving offering, a rational factfinder could fairly find defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. See Mattatall, 603 A.2d at 1109 (considering the independent evidence adduced at trial in light of the defendant’s “patently incredible testimony—testimony full of inconsistencies and contradictions” to conclude that “neither the trial justice nor any rational juror could have entertained any reasonable doubt about [the defendant’s] guilt”). Consequently, we are satisfied that the trial justice neither overlooked nor misconceived material evidence nor was the trial justice otherwise clearly wrong in reaching the same result as the jury.', 'We note that the main thrust of defendant’s appeal—that the trial justice should have believed defendant’s testimony and not that of the state’s witnesses, who he alleges were biased and were driven by motives to lie—is but an attempt to have this Court reassess the credibility of the witnesses, an exercise in which we decline to engage. See Banach, 648 A.2d at 1368 (noting that, credibility determinations belong in a trial court but not in this Court).', 'At the motion for a new trial stage in a criminal prosecution, credibility assessments are exclusively within the province of the trial justice who “is under no obligation to sift through a witness’s testimony and discard only those portions that are patently unbelievable.” Banach, 648 A.2d at 1368. Rather, the trial justice may “believe[] one set of facts and disbelieve[] the other.” Id. (quoting Fontaine v. State, 602 A.2d 521, 526 (R.I. 1992)); see also Mattatall, 603 A.2d at 1108 (“[The trial justice] may accept or reject conflicting testimony and draw all reasonable inferences therefrom.”). In the case before us, the jury and the trial justice were presented with', '-9- the possibility that defendant may have been framed by his cohorts; yet, it was their version of the events that was accepted as true and the testimony of defendant was rejected.', 'The defendant points us to discrepancies between Watts’s testimony and Gonzalez’s testimony in arguing that the two gang members colluded against him. However, “the presence of some inconsistencies between or among [the statements] of a witness or witnesses at different points in time does not ipso facto render the testimony unworthy of belief.” State v. Jensen, 40 A.3d 771, 781 (R.I. 2012). Of course, crediting the testimony of Watts and Gonzalez, and rejecting that of defendant, was within the discretion of the trial justice in passing on a motion for a new trial. We defer to that discretion. See Fontaine, 602 A.2d at 526 (“This court will not act as the arbiter of credibility * * * because that remains a determination that is expressly entrusted to the trial justice.”); see also Paola, 59 A.3d at 106 (“[W]e ‘defer to trial justices who experience firsthand the delivery and demeanor of a witness’s testimony.’” (quoting State v. Ferreira, 21 A.3d 355, 366 (R.I. 2011))).', 'The trial justice determined that, based on the evidence at trial, the jury was warranted in finding defendant guilty.', 'The weight of the evidence, namely the independent eyewitness testimony of Lewis, coupled with that of Watts and Gonzalez, clearly established that defendant was the shooter rather than an unsuspecting getaway driver who “wasn’t paying attention.” See State v. Vanasse, 593 A.2d 58, 67 (R.I. 1991) (“If in [the trial justice’s] independent assessment the trial justice determines that the evidence adduced at trial is sufficient for the jury, as factfinders, to conclude that it proves guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the motion for a new trial must be denied.” (citing State v.

88,"Michael F. Rose, Jr. et al. : v. : Stephen M. Brusini et al.",non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. This case came before the Supreme Court on appeal by the plaintiffs, Michael F. Rose, Jr. and RC&D, Inc. (collectively plaintiffs), from a decision of the Superior Court granting the defendants’ motion for summary judgment in favor of Attorney Stephen M. Brusini and the law firm Orson & Brusini Ltd. (collectively defendants). The plaintiffs argue that the hearing justice erred when he concluded that there was no evidence of proximate cause linking the defendants’ alleged negligence and any damages the plaintiffs may have suffered, and that Rose’s own conduct was the proximate cause of his damages. The matter came before this Court for oral argument on November 2, 2016, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised by this appeal should not summarily be decided. After considering the oral and written arguments of the parties, and after a thorough review of the record, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that this case should be decided at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On January 7, 2004, Rose and David Egan formed a closely held corporation, RC&D, Inc.', 'RC&D provided specialized construction services, equipment, and personnel for environmental restoration and related land development in the New England region. At first, Rose and Egan were equal owners of the corporation. The ownership percentages later changed, however, and Egan acquired 51 percent of the issued shares of RC&D stock and Rose held the remaining 49 percent.', 'Egan was responsible for office administration and keeping and maintaining the financial records while Rose supervised field construction operations. Rose had very little personal involvement in managing or overseeing RC&D’s finances and he did not have access to the company’s books and records, which Egan kept password-protected through a software program called Quickbooks. In 2007 the two began discussing Rose’s buyout of Egan’s 51 percent interest in RC&D. In August 2008, after negotiations became contentious, Rose engaged defendants to represent him in connection with the buyout.', 'By December 14, 2008, negotiations had progressed to a point where defendants were able to prepare a draft purchase and sale agreement (P&S) and circulate it to the parties. One component of the P&S involved Rose’s purchase of Egan’s shares of stock in RC&D and the second component involved a distribution from RC&D to Egan of the company’s profits earned through December 31, 2008. On December 16, 2008, Egan’s counsel sent a “redlined” version of the first draft of the P&S to defendants. Two days later, Egan finally sent an email to Rose containing some information about RC&D’s finances, including balance sheets, a projection as of December 31 of assets and liabilities, and a schedule of accounts receivable.', '-2-', 'On December 19, 2008, Brusini advised Rose not to sign the P&S because Egan was refusing to provide critical financial information regarding RC&D. Later that day, during a conference call with the parties, Brusini reiterated his advice that Rose should not execute the P&S. And again, on December 22, 2008, Brusini called Rose to tell him the same thing, but Rose was intent on going forward.', 'By email, on December 23, 2008 at 9:55 a.m., Brusini sent a marked-up draft of the P&S to, among others, Egan’s counsel and Rose. At 10:06 a.m. the same day, Brusini sent a letter to Rose by email. The letter recounted their telephone conversations from December 19 and December 22 and specified, “I cannot recommend and do not recommend that you [Rose] sign the agreement as revised by [Egan’s counsel]” because Rose had not been involved in the finances of the company and did not know what the finances of the company were. The letter continued:', '“That said, I am aware that you are willing to take the risks outlined', 'above and the risks generally posed by [Egan’s counsel’s] revisions,', 'and that you are anxious to close these transactions as soon as', 'possible. With that in mind, in the red-lined version that I sent to', 'you earlier this morning I have attempted to make at least a few', 'changes to [Egan’s counsel’s] version to provide you with some', 'basic protections.” The amended version of the P&S referred to in the letter included a “True-up Clause” to protect Rose in order “to capture post-closing any amount paid to Mr. Egan in connection with the buyout that, for any reason, [was] improper or incorrect.”', 'The closing on the buyout took place on January 6, 2009, and the distribution amount ($1,204,695.75) was paid in full to Egan. After the closing, Rose finally gained full access to RC&D’s financial books and records, including Quickbooks. The financial books and records revealed that Egan, in the very limited information he had provided to Rose preclosing, had', '-3- overstated the accounts receivable and assets and had understated the accounts payable, thereby resulting in a considerably higher 2008 year-end distribution to Egan.', 'According to the company’s books and records, the distribution paid by RC&D to Egan was approximately $584,695.70 more than what Egan was entitled to under the terms and conditions of the P&S.', 'Rose and Egan Litigation', 'In January 2010, Egan filed a complaint against plaintiffs after Rose declined to satisfy the remaining balance from the buyout. Rose and RC&D answered and filed counterclaims against Egan, arguing that Egan was required to return the overpayment to RC&D, based upon the True-up Clause that Brusini had assured Rose he could rely upon should the distribution paid to Egan be found to exceed his entitlement. However, that litigation encountered some rough sailing; a justice of the Superior Court declared that “there [was] an ambiguity under the language of the agreement,” and granted partial summary judgment in favor of Egan with respect to at least two counts of his complaint. After Rose incurred over $300,000 in litigation fees and expenses, the parties entered into a settlement agreement on November 3, 2011.', 'The Malpractice Action', 'On December 30, 2011, plaintiffs filed suit against defendants, alleging professional negligence and breach of contract. Rose’s primary argument was that defendants breached a duty that they owed to Rose when they failed to advise him to invoke the statutorily enforceable rights and remedies available to shareholders pursuant to G.L. 1956 chapter 1.2 of title 7 of the Rhode Island Business Corporations Act (Disclosure Act), which would have provided access to RC&D’s books and records. 1 The plaintiffs further argued that defendants negligently drafted 1', 'General Laws 1956 § 7-1.2-1502 reads in pertinent part as follows:', '-4- the True-up Clause, thus resulting in their inability to recover the overpaid amount in the Egan litigation.', 'In time, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that Rose could not demonstrate that they were liable to Rose because he had failed to follow Brusini’s clear and documented advice, which explicitly warned against signing the P&S. In that correspondence, Brusini outlined his concerns about the deal and specifically identified that “due to these concerns, I [Brusini] cannot recommend and do not recommend that you [Rose] sign the [P&S].” Nevertheless, Rose went forward with the buyout despite the letter and in the face of Egan’s', '“(a) Each corporation shall keep correct and complete', 'books and records of account * * *. Any books, records, * * * may', 'be in written form or any other form capable of being converted', 'into written form within a reasonable time.', '“(b) Any * * * shareholder * * *, upon written demand', 'stating the purpose for the demand, has the right to examine, in', 'person, or by agent or attorney, at any reasonable time or times, for', 'any proper purpose, its relevant books and records of account * * *', 'and to make extracts from those books and records of account * *', '*.', '“(c) Any officer or agent who, or a corporation which,', 'refuses to allow any shareholder * * * to examine and make', 'extracts from its books and records of account * * * for any proper', 'purpose, is liable to the shareholder * * * in a penalty of ten', 'percent (10%) of the value of the shares owned by the shareholder,', '* * * in addition to any other damages or remedy afforded him or', 'her by law.', '“(d) Nothing contained in these provisions impairs the', 'power of any court of competent jurisdiction, upon proof by a * * *', 'shareholder * * * to compel the production for examination * * *', 'of the books and records of account * * *.', '“(e) Upon the written request of any * * * shareholder * * *', 'the corporation shall mail to the * * * shareholder * ** its most', 'recent financial statements showing in reasonable detail its assets', 'and liabilities and the results of its operations.”', '-5- continued refusal to provide financial information. As a result, defendants asserted that the proximate cause for any alleged damages was Rose’s own decision to proceed with the buyout against his counsel’s advice.', 'The hearing justice, in a bench decision, granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment. The hearing justice found that defendants had a duty to plaintiffs, and, based on the affidavit of Attorney Karen A. Pelczarski, that there was a genuine issue of fact as to whether there was a breach of that duty.', 'However, when determining whether there was a genuine issue of material fact as to proximate cause, the hearing justice focused on two documents—Brusini’s December 23, 2008, letter and Attorney Pelczarski’s affidavit, which had been offered in opposition to the motion for summary judgment. The hearing justice indicated that, while Attorney Pelczarski’s affidavit repeatedly referred to lack of care, skill, diligence, and knowledge, she never used the words “proximate cause” in her affidavit. He further specified that there were many possibilities for what might have occurred had defendants advised Rose of the Disclosure Act, concluding that it would require “pure conjecture” to determine what the outcome of the transaction would have been had defendants notified Rose of the Disclosure Act. The hearing justice went on to say, “but what is not conjecture is that if Mr. Rose had taken defendants’ recommendation and refused to sign the agreement, he would not have incurred the loss of which he now complains.” As for the ambiguity that was noted by the trial justice in the Egan litigation about the True-up Clause, the hearing justice specified that ambiguity in a document does not equate to legal malpractice. Moreover, the hearing justice indicated that the case was settled before the efficacy of the True-up Clause was litigated; therefore, there was no basis to conclude whether the language employed was effective or ineffective.', '-6-', 'The hearing justice concluded that plaintiffs had not produced any evidence to suggest that their legal position was somehow compromised as a result of Brusini’s advice and that the undisputed evidence demonstrated that Rose disregarded Brusini’s counsel and went forward with the buyout without having access to the financial information. He further noted that, had Rose simply followed Brusini’s instructions, the alleged damages would not have occurred. He avowed that, in order to find a causal connection between Brusini’s alleged breach and Rose’s overpayment in the buyout, a factfinder would be forced to speculate about what would have happened had Rose been advised of his statutory rights. The hearing justice concluded that the undisputed facts before the court were susceptible to just one inference: that Rose’s decision to go forward with the buyout despite Brusini’s advice recommending that he not sign the P&S was the cause of Rose’s harm. Significantly, however, the hearing justice did not refer to a separate affidavit that Rose himself had submitted in opposition to the motion for summary judgment.

89,State : v. : Erwin Grantley. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. On May 3, 2012, a Providence County Superior Court jury found the defendant, Erwin Grantley (Grantley or defendant) guilty of one count of assault with a dangerous weapon in a dwelling house (domestic), in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-4 and G.L. 1956 § 12-29-2(a)(2); guilty of one count of breaking and entering of a dwelling house (domestic), in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-8-2 and § 12-29-2(a) and (b); 1 not guilty of one count of driving a motor vehicle without the consent of the owner, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 31-9-1; and not guilty of larceny under $500 in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-41-1.', 'On September 6, 2013, the trial justice sentenced Grantley. With respect to the assault with a dangerous weapon conviction, defendant was sentenced to thirty-two years, with sixteen years to serve and sixteen years suspended with probation. For the breaking and entering conviction, Grantley was sentenced to fifteen years to serve, to be served consecutive to the assault sentence. The trial justice also sentenced Grantley as an habitual criminal, per G.L. 1956 § 12-19-21, to an additional eight years, to run consecutively to these two sentences. 1', 'The phrase “domestic” after the first two counts denotes that the state characterized the relationship between the complaining witness and defendant as “domestic” pursuant to the Domestic Violence Prevention Act. See G.L. 1956 § 12-29-2.', '-1-', 'On appeal, defendant raises three issues. With respect to the breaking and entering count, Grantley argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal brought pursuant to Rule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure and his motion for a new trial brought pursuant to Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. Specifically, he asserts that the state failed to meet its burden of proving lack of consent because he had implied consent to enter the complaining witness’s home. The defendant also contends that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial on the first count, assault with a dangerous weapon in a dwelling house. He maintains that the verdict on that count was against the weight of the evidence. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The defendant’s conviction arose out of an incident between defendant and the complaining witness, Crystal Bruce (Bruce), on the morning of May 28, 2009. The defendant was subsequently charged with the aforementioned counts, and a jury trial was held in the Providence County Superior Court on April 24 through May 3, 2012. Below, we summarize the relevant testimony adduced at trial.', 'Bruce, the first witness to testify, discussed her relationship with defendant that began in 2004. She described it as “on again, off again,” noting that “it was good, but then it was bad, it was like a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde relationship.” Bruce testified that she and Grantley often fought; and, when asked if any of the fights were physical, she replied “yes.” During the course of their association, Bruce noted, she moved to 134 Houston Street in Providence in December 2007 and Grantley lived with her for about eight months. Grantley’s name was placed on the', '-2- mailbox when they moved in together, and his name remained there through the date of the incident. Around the summer of 2008, Bruce ended her relationship with defendant. She stated that she returned the engagement ring Grantley gave her to the store and kept the money. However, Bruce and Grantley remained friends and attempted to improve their relationship.', 'In her testimony, Bruce discussed the days leading up to the incident. She said that she saw Grantley two days before, when she gave him a ride to fill out a job application. That day, Grantley wanted to go back to her house to see her dogs, but she refused. Also during the week before the incident, Bruce stayed overnight at defendant’s home. She acknowledged that she slept with Grantley, but she stated that it was because she “didn’t want to hate him or be enemies with him.”', 'At the time of the incident, Bruce still resided at 134 Houston Street with her four children. She testified that she arrived home at 8:30 a.m., after spending the night at a male friend’s house in Connecticut. Upon entering her bedroom, Bruce saw Grantley come in and shut the door behind him. She said that she did not know Grantley was at her house, she did not invite him there, and he did not have a set of keys to the house. After closing her bedroom door, Grantley questioned Bruce about her whereabouts the night before, and “[h]e just said if I was going to be a whore, it wasn’t going to be while he was around.” Bruce testified that defendant then punched her and she fell towards the bed. Grantley began choking Bruce and told her, “[I]f he couldn’t have [her], wasn’t nobody else going to have [her].” Before passing out, Bruce asked, “You’re going to kill me with my kids upstairs?” She testified that she awoke to find Grantley holding a wire around her neck, which she managed to remove. She said that defendant then took her keys and cell phone and left.', '-3-', 'Bruce testified that two of her children, Christopher and Jonathan, were home at the time of the incident. 2 She screamed for her sons and made her way toward their rooms. After she told them what had happened, Christopher called 9-1-1. She was taken to Rhode Island Hospital, where she stayed for four days. Bruce said that she suffered from a collapsed lung, a stab wound, bleeding in her brain, and bruised ribs.', 'On cross-examination, Bruce was asked about an IRS check addressed to Grantley that she received while he was in prison. Bruce testified that she sent the check to defendant in prison, he signed it, sent it back to her, and after cashing it, she ultimately used the check’s proceeds. When Bruce talked with an investigator working for defendant’s attorney, however, she told him that she deposited the check into Grantley’s account. In her testimony, Bruce acknowledged lying to the investigator because she “was tired of speaking to [him].”', 'Bruce was also questioned about other letters she had written to Grantley while he was in prison. In the letters, she called herself defendant’s “wife,” and said, “I want you home with me where you belong,” “I want to be your wife more than anything in this world,” and “I just really wish I could have your baby, our baby.” Bruce testified that she and Grantley were still trying to work on their relationship at the time she wrote the letters.', 'The state also presented Paul Casey, an EMT for the City of Cranston who responded to Bruce’s home after the incident. 3 Casey testified that, upon arrival, Bruce was conscious and alert and appeared panicked and anxious. He stated that Bruce informed him that she had been 2', 'To avoid confusion with Crystal Bruce, we will refer to Christopher Bruce and Jonathan Bruce by their first names. No disrespect is intended. 3', 'Under a “statewide mutual aid pact,” Casey, although an EMT for the City of Cranston, was dispatched to the City of Providence to “mutually aid the City of Providence.”', '-4- assaulted and stabbed. 4 Casey testified that Bruce’s left eye was swollen shut, she had a laceration on her cheek, multiple ligature marks, and signs of blunt trauma on her arm and torso.', 'Bruce’s sons, Christopher and Jonathan, each testified. At the time of the incident, both were at home sleeping. They testified that they were awakened by their mother. Christopher helped his mother onto the bed and called 9-1-1. After his mother told him what happened, Jonathan said, he looked outside of his bedroom window and saw Grantley driving away in Bruce’s vehicle.', 'Jonathan also testified that on the day of the incident, he found a knife blade wrapped in a bloody towel underneath his mother’s bed. After finding it, he called the investigating detective. Jonathan testified that the detective came “right over”; however, on cross-examination, he said that the police did not retrieve the towel and the knife until June 1, 2009. He acknowledged that he was originally mistaken about the date. When asked whether he recalled defendant being at his house the day before the incident and whether defendant left that day, Jonathan responded affirmatively. Both Christopher and Jonathan were also asked if they invited Grantley to the house, if he had permission to be at the house the day of the incident, and if they knew he was in the house on that date. They testified in the negative to each.', 'Jay Baruch, M.D., an emergency room physician at Rhode Island Hospital, testified next. 5 Doctor Baruch was working when Bruce came in and was part of her treatment team. He testified that, when he initially saw her on May 28, 2009, there was concern that Bruce’s condition was life-threatening. Doctor Baruch testified that Bruce had a “potential stab wound to the chest.” After reviewing the medical records, Dr. Baruch stated that Bruce had abrasions and 4', 'At trial, Bruce responded “No,” when asked if she saw Grantley stab her. 5', 'Doctor Baruch acknowledged that he was testifying from the medical records, not from his own memory.', '-5- tenderness on her face, redness around her neck, a penetrating wound in her left chest, a collapsed lung, and bleeding in her brain. He testified that she was discharged on May 31, 2009.', 'Three members of the Providence Police Department also testified: Det. Robert Firth, Det. Ralph Constantino, and Officer Jose Deschamps. Detective Firth and Officer Deschamps arrived at the scene around 9:30 a.m. on May 28, 2009. Detective Firth said that he walked around the residence, searched its interior, and photographed “any items of interest.” Detective Firth noted that the search was limited because there was uncertainty about whether the residence could be searched without a warrant. 6 In his search, Det. Firth did not look under Bruce’s bed and did not locate a weapon. Detective Firth was asked about the towel seen in one of his photographs, and if he noticed a weapon in it, to which he replied, “no.” Detective Firth also responded in the negative when asked whether he disturbed the towel and whether he would have seen the knife in it without moving the towel. In his testimony, Det. Firth said that he did not fingerprint any area of the bedroom, the doors, or the windows.', 'Both Det. Firth and Officer Deschamps then went to Rhode Island Hospital. Upon arrival, Det. Firth testified that he photographed Bruce and seized the clothing she was wearing when she arrived. In Officer Deschamps’s testimony, he said that he took Bruce’s statement and completed a domestic violence form based on what Bruce told him. Officer Deschamps stated that Bruce told him Grantley stabbed her.', 'Detective Constantino testified that on June 1, 2009, he was called to respond to 134 Houston Street because a knife had been discovered. He testified that the knife blade was located in a towel when he seized it, but the knife’s handle was not located.', 'Detective 6', 'Specifically, the scope of the search was initially limited to “inspection of the rooms and any places where a person may be hiding.” The scope was limited because, at the time, it was unknown whether defendant had constitutional standing to contest a warrantless search.', '-6- Constantino stated that there was a substance on the blade consistent with blood, but that he did not test the substance or fingerprint the knife.', 'At the close of the state’s case, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on all counts pursuant to Rule 29. The defendant argued that the state had introduced insufficient evidence to sustain a conviction on each count. With respect to count 1, assault with a dangerous weapon in a dwelling house, defendant asserted that Bruce and her sons were not credible witnesses. He also argued that the knife blade and towel may have been tampered with and had been subject to a “bad chain of custody.” Regarding count 2, breaking and entering of a dwelling house, defendant contended that there was no evidence of forced entry or physical evidence showing that he was in Bruce’s home during the incident. Additionally, defendant argued that he had permission to be in Bruce’s home based on her testimony that “she had sex with him two days earlier” and Jonathan’s testimony that defendant was at the house the day before the incident.', 'After reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, the trial justice found sufficient evidence for a jury to find defendant guilty and denied his motion for a judgment of acquittal. The trial justice noted that “[t]he credibility of the witnesses or the weight of the evidence is not before the Court at this point in time.”', 'The defendant then called one witness, Robert Clancy, a deputy warden at the Department of Corrections. He testified about the policies and procedures when a check is sent to an inmate at the Adult Correctional Institutions. Deputy Clancy said that inmates were not allowed to receive checks. If a check were sent to an inmate, however, the inmate would be asked to sign it, and it would be deposited into the inmate’s account. Despite this procedure, Deputy Clancy acknowledged that a check could get past authorities and to an inmate. At the', '-7- conclusion of his case, defendant renewed his motion for a judgment of acquittal on all counts pursuant to Rule 29. The trial justice reserved deciding the motion.', 'On May 30, 2012, after the jury verdict of guilty on two counts, the trial justice heard the parties on defendant’s renewed motion for a judgment of acquittal and his motion for a new trial, which was filed on May 11, 2012. The defendant contended that the only evidence supporting the breaking and entering charge was that he did not have verbal permission to be at Bruce’s home. He argued that a verbal invitation is not needed in certain relationships, such as in Grantley and Bruce’s case; rather, consent is implied.', 'The defendant then challenged the credibility of Bruce and her sons, Christopher and Jonathan, and he noted inconsistencies in their testimony.', 'In deciding the motion for a judgment of acquittal, the trial justice summarized the testimony presented at trial. She concluded that the testimony showed defendant lacked Bruce’s permission to enter her home.', 'The trial justice did not find that Grantley and Bruce’s relationship effectively gave him permission to enter her household. With respect to the charge of assault with a dangerous weapon in a dwelling house, the trial justice found that there was sufficient evidence showing defendant’s intent to kill Bruce. Specifically, she considered the testimony as to the severity of Bruce’s injuries and Bruce’s testimony that defendant told her, “[I]f he couldn’t have [her], wasn’t nobody else going to have [her].” Accordingly, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a judgment of acquittal with respect to both convictions.', 'The trial justice then analyzed defendant’s motion for a new trial. 7 She considered the witnesses’ credibility and found Bruce credible. The trial justice noted that “[Bruce] did not try to embellish anything with respect to what happened with her * * * .” She concluded that, based 7', 'Having reviewed all of the facts in her judgment of acquittal ruling, the trial justice did not summarize the testimony again in deciding defendant’s motion for a new trial.', '-8- on the medical evidence concerning Bruce’s injuries and the credible testimony of the state’s witnesses, the court would have reached the same result as the jury. The trial justice found that the jury carefully deliberated, as illustrated by the verdicts of not guilty on two counts. Accordingly, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial. 8', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal and motion for a new trial with respect to the count of breaking and entering of a dwelling house. Both arguments relating to the breaking and entering count rest on the same ground: defendant had implied consent to be in Bruce’s household. The defendant also contends that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial on the count of assault with a dangerous weapon in a dwelling house. He argues that the state failed to establish essential elements, namely that he was the perpetrator of Bruce’s stab wound and that he acted with the intent to kill Bruce.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“When faced, as here, with both Rule 29 and Rule 33 motions, ‘this Court first conducts a review of the new-trial motion.’” State v.

This is due to the different standards with which the 8', 'Subsequently, defendant filed a second motion for a new trial, based on newly discovered evidence. He argued that over twenty newly discovered romantic letters written to him by Bruce in 2008, would have impeached her credibility because, at trial, Bruce stated that the two introduced letters were isolated and taken out of context. On July 30, 2013, the trial justice heard the parties and denied Grantley’s motion. She determined that the letters were not newly discovered evidence because: (1) they existed at the time of the trial and defendant knew of their existence and location; (2) they were discoverable prior to the trial in the exercise of due diligence, yet defendant did not discuss the letters with his attorney or investigator until posttrial; (3) even if newly discovered, the letters were cumulative to the issue of Bruce’s credibility; and (4) the letters would not have changed the verdict because the convictions were for “a vicious assault,” in which the letters played no part.', ""-9- trial justice decides each motion. When considering a Rule 29 motion for a judgment of acquittal, the trial justice “must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, * * * giving full credibility to the state's witnesses, and draw[ing] therefrom all reasonable inferences consistent with guilt.” State v. Cardin, 987 A.2d 248, 250 (R.I. 2010) (quoting State v. Caba, 887 A.2d 370, 372 (R.I. 2005)). In deciding a Rule 33 motion for a new trial, however, “the trial justice places himself or herself in the role of a ‘thirteenth juror’ and then exercises his or her independent judgment as to the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence.” State v. Matthews, 111 A.3d 390, 398 (R.I. 2015). Under a Rule 33 analysis, “the trial justice must (1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” Matthews, 111 A.3d at 398 (quoting State v. Hie, 93 A.3d 963, 974 (R.I. 2014))."", 'Consequently, “a defendant has a higher hurdle to overcome when arguing a Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal than when he seeks to prevail on a Rule 33 motion for new trial * * * .” Fleck, 81 A.3d at 1133. “[U]nless a defendant can show that the presented evidence failed to support his or her conviction upon the motion-for-a-new-trial standard, a defendant necessarily will be unable to establish he or she was entitled to a judgment of acquittal.” Id.

Specifically, defendant argues that he had implied consent to enter Bruce’s home because “consent to enter the dwelling of another can be implied by a close and continuing familial relationship in circumstances where the parties’ practice reveals permission to enter.” To support his proposition that he and Bruce shared such a relationship, defendant notes that he once lived at 134 Houston Street with Bruce, his name was still on the mailbox on the incident date, Bruce wrote to him “exclaiming her love,” and she slept at his residence a few days before the incident.', 'The defendant asks this Court to recognize implied consent in this case and references two states that have adopted such a defense. 9 We decline his request. Rather, we agree with the 9', 'The defendant references Indiana and North Carolina as two states recognizing implied consent. See McKinney v. State, 653 N.E.2d 115, 118 (Ind. Ct. App. 1995) (“Lack of consent is not an element of the offense the State is required to prove. Rather, it is the defendant who must claim and prove the defense of consent.”); State v. Tolley, 226 S.E.2d 672, 674 (N.C. Ct. App. 1976) (“A person entering a residence with the good faith belief that he has the consent of the owner or occupant or his authorized agent is not chargeable with the offense of breaking and entering.”).', '- 11 - state that it is unnecessary to recognize such a defense because, under Rhode Island’s breaking and entering statute, a defendant is free to argue that he had consent to enter the household. The statute, § 11-8-2(a), states, in relevant part, “Every person who shall break and enter at any time of the day or night any dwelling house or apartment * * * without the consent of the owner or tenant of the dwelling house, apartment, building, or garage, shall be imprisoned * * *.” In this regard, we held in State v. Ranieri, 560 A.2d 350, 352 (R.I. 1989), that the state meets its burden by establishing a prima facie case that the defendant entered the dwelling without consent. The burden of production then shifts to the defendant to show that his entrance was with permission. Id. Ultimately, as with all elements of the offense, the state must prove lack of consent beyond a reasonable doubt. Id.', ""While proof of verbal permission to enter may be one way to show consent, this Court has not explicitly stated that it is the only way to do so. In State v. Dyer, 813 A.2d 71, 75 (R.I. 2003), we concluded that “the evidence was sufficient to support beyond a reasonable doubt a finding that [the] defendant did not have permission to enter complainant's apartment * * *.” In reaching this conclusion, this Court looked at the entirety of the case’s facts, not solely whether the defendant had verbal permission to enter. Id. at 75-76. For example, we considered that the defendant maintained his own apartment, had not lived with the complaining witness for about one year, kept no toiletries or clothes at her apartment, and did not have an “unlimited right of entry” because his key was restricted to when he babysat. Id. at 76; see State v. Karngar, 29 A.3d 1232, 1234-36 (R.I. 2011) (concluding that sufficient evidence supported the verdict that the defendant broke and entered into the apartment of his on-again, off-again girlfriend, despite their three-year relationship, the defendant’s assertion that he had a key to her apartment, and the defendant’s testimony that she invited him over that night). Similarly here, we are satisfied that"", '- 12 - sufficient evidence exists showing that Grantley lacked consent to enter Bruce’s home. In addition to Bruce and her sons’ testimony that defendant did not have permission, other evidence supports this finding. As in Dyer, defendant had his own apartment at the time of the incident, did not live with Bruce, and did not have keys to her home.', 'We are satisfied that the trial justice properly decided defendant’s motion for a new trial with respect to all of the elements of the breaking and entering count. She set out the standard for deciding a Rule 33 motion and summarized the testimony adduced at trial. The trial justice then reviewed the breaking and entering charge, noting, “there was no question * * * under the instructions that this Court gave the jury that no violent break has to be proven by the State.” 10 She considered that all three witnesses who lived at the house testified that defendant did not have permission to be there at the time of the incident, and no one invited him into the house. The trial justice addressed defendant and Bruce’s relationship, including their recent encounter a few nights before the incident, and determined, “I don’t think that gives anybody permission to go in your house without any permission at the time.” She then evaluated the witnesses’ credibility and deemed Bruce to be a credible witness. She found that Bruce did not exaggerate or embellish in many instances where she could have. The judge considered the credibility issues raised by the IRS check and the ongoing nature of Bruce’s relationship with defendant, but she determined that it did not significantly impact her credibility. The judge also found the testimony of Christopher, Jonathan, and the police officers credible. Thus, we conclude that the 10', 'On the issue of consent, the trial justice, without objection, instructed the jury, “In order to satisfy the [lack of consent] element, the State must prove the defendant did so without the consent of the owner of the premises in this case. That would be Crystal Bruce. You must determine from the evidence you received whether this has been proven to you from all the facts and circumstances that have been presented to you.”', '- 13 - trial justice properly denied defendant’s motion for a new trial with respect to the breaking and entering count.', '“[H]aving concluded that the evidence ‘was sufficient to withstand the more stringent review applicable to a motion for a new trial, it follows that the evidence was also sufficient to withstand a motion for a judgment of acquittal.’” State v. Cardona, 969 A.2d 667, 674 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. Hesford, 900 A.2d 1194, 1200 (R.I. 2006)). Accordingly, we affirm the trial justice’s denial of defendant’s motion for a judgment of acquittal as to the breaking and entering count.', 'B', 'New Trial on the Assault with a Dangerous Weapon Count', 'The defendant appeals the trial justice’s denial of his motion for a new trial with respect to the count of assault with a dangerous weapon in a dwelling house. 11 He argues that the state failed to establish key elements of the offense—specifically, that he was the cause of Bruce’s stab wound and that he acted with the intent to kill her. 12 The defendant challenges Bruce’s credibility by noting the IRS check and inconsistencies in her testimony. He asserts that, after Bruce’s credibility was weakened, the state failed to produce evidence responding to the credibility challenges. The defendant argues that, because the two inferences made in finding him guilty—that he was the perpetrator of Bruce’s stab wound and that he possessed the intent to kill her—were based on Bruce’s incredible testimony, the state had to put forth corroborating evidence.', 'The defendant also contends that the state failed to meet its burden because of the 11', 'On appeal, defendant did not challenge the denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal with respect to this count. 12', 'The assault with a dangerous weapon in a dwelling house statute reads, in pertinent part, “Whoever, being armed with a dangerous weapon, assaults another with intent to rob or murder, shall, if the assault is committed within a dwelling house, be punished by imprisonment * * * .” G.L. 1956 § 11-5-4.', '- 14 - lack of forensic evidence, noting “[t]he police did not attempt to develop fingerprints from the knife they collected days later, nor did they have DNA analysis of the blood on various articles of clothing and the knife.”', ""The defendant’s arguments hinge on his disagreement with the trial justice’s credibility determinations. 13 However, this Court has long held that “[t]he mere fact that [a] defendant disagrees with the trial justice's conclusions about credibility is not a sufficient basis to warrant the granting of a motion for [a] new trial.” State v. Virola, 115 A.3d 980, 993 (R.I. 2015) (quoting State v. Silva, 84 A.3d 411, 418 (R.I. 2014))."", 'Because “[t]his Court affords a ‘substantial amount of deference to [the] determinations’ of the trial justice with respect to credibility of the witnesses,” we will not overturn a trial justice’s decision unless she was clearly wrong or overlooked or misconceived material evidence.', 'Silva, 84 A.3d at 417 (quoting DeCiantis v. State, 24 A.3d 557, 572 (R.I. 2011)).', 'Here, we are convinced that the trial justice properly analyzed the motion for a new trial and did not overlook or misconceive material evidence. As discussed above, the trial justice assessed and made conclusions as to the witnesses’ credibility. She found Bruce credible and did not find the attacks against her credibility, namely the IRS check incident and the “on again, off again” nature of her relationship with Grantley, to “significantly impact[] her credibility.” The trial justice also addressed the lack of forensic evidence and expressed her disappointment with the police’s investigation, stating, “I don’t care whether they had somebody identify this [d]efendant or not; they had many opportunities to properly seize and observe the crime scene.” 13', 'In his brief, defendant discusses, at length, presumptions, inferences, the burden of proof, and the burden of persuasion to support his argument that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. The crux of defendant’s assertion that the “conviction should not stand” because “the credibility of [the state’s] crucial complaining witness was undermined” is really a disagreement with the trial justice’s credibility determination.', '- 15 - Although a better police investigation “would have made the case stronger,” the trial justice did not find that it affected the case because “[o]ne witness * * * is enough to convict a [d]efendant if there’s belief.”', 'In deciding defendant’s motion, the trial justice determined that there was no question whether Bruce was assaulted; however, the issue “was whether * * * [d]efendant was the one that actually did it.” She addressed defendant’s argument that there was insufficient evidence proving he was the cause of Bruce’s stab wound, finding: “There was no one else in the house to assault her and no mysterious one-armed man that is being accused of doing this. He was the only one in the house doing this. He was assaulting her. He was there when she woke up stabbed and bleeding.” The trial justice also found sufficient evidence showing defendant’s intent to murder Bruce. In arriving at this conclusion, she discussed the severity of Bruce’s injuries, including the stab wound in her chest, ligature marks, a collapsed lung, and bleeding in her brain. The trial justice also considered Bruce’s testimony that defendant told her, “if he couldn’t have [her], wasn’t nobody else going to have [her].” In light of her analysis, the trial justice determined that she would not have reached a different verdict than the jury and denied defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'After reviewing the record, this Court concludes that the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive material evidence and was not clearly wrong. In conducting her analysis, she considered the evidence, assessed the witnesses’ credibility, and determined that she would not have reached a different result than the jury.

For the reasons set forth herein, the judgment of the Superior Court is vacated.', 'Facts and Travel', 'The allegations set forth in the complaint and the materials disclosed in discovery, all of which we are bound to accept as true, are as follows: Plaintiff is a resident of Fort Lauderdale, Florida. At the time of the contract in dispute, plaintiff was a resident of Newport, Rhode Island. The defendant is a resident of New York. In August of 2006, plaintiff and defendant met in New York and orally negotiated a contract of employment for plaintiff to serve as the Captain of defendant’s sailboat, the S/Y Atlanta (the Atlanta). The defendant suggested that the contract be', '-1- made for three years and that it be terminable only for good cause. The defendant also offered that, were plaintiff to serve for the entire three-year contract term, he would be entitled to a bonus of $150,000, amounting to one year’s salary. The plaintiff accepted the terms of the contract and set sail in September of 2006.', 'The plaintiff encountered rough seas about one month before the end of the employment contract when, on August 1, 2009, plaintiff was terminated without cause, explanation, or payment of the $150,000 bonus.', 'In a subsequent conversation, defendant agreed that the outstanding balance of $150,000 would be paid to plaintiff at the rate of $10,000 per month. The defendant reneged on this promise as well.', 'On April 22, 2011, plaintiff filed suit in the Superior Court of Newport County, Rhode Island, alleging breach of contract and seeking to recover the money owed to him.', 'The defendant filed an answer in which he averred that Rhode Island did not have personal jurisdiction over him. However, for more than three years, the case proceeded in the Superior Court, as the parties engaged in discovery and court-annexed arbitration.', 'The defendant propounded interrogatories of plaintiff, took plaintiff’s deposition, and filed motions to compel the production of documents.', 'On December 4, 2013, the case advanced to court-annexed arbitration with defendant’s full participation, concluding with an arbitration award for plaintiff. The defendant rejected the arbitration award, and plaintiff moved to assign the case to trial. On November 14, 2014, almost a year after the arbitration, defendant filed a motion requesting that the matter be assigned to the continuous jury trial calendar. A hearing was held on the motion, and the case was set for trial.', 'On December 9, 2014, after the case was set for trial, defendant filed a motion for summary judgment for lack of in personam jurisdiction, arguing that he did not have sufficient', '-2- minimum contacts with Rhode Island to warrant this state’s exercise of personal jurisdiction over him. At a Superior Court proceeding held on the motion, defendant claimed that he did not own the Atlanta and did not personally employ plaintiff. Rather, defendant averred that a corporation named Helios Yachting Services Ltd. (Helios) owned the Atlanta and that plaintiff was hired, paid, and employed by Helios. The defendant conceded that he was an officer of Helios, but insisted that the proper party to plaintiff’s lawsuit was the corporate entity. The defendant acknowledged that Helios may have availed itself of the privilege of conducting business in Rhode Island, but that he had no contact with this state in his personal capacity. The plaintiff responded that Rhode Island’s exercise of personal jurisdiction over defendant was proper, and added that defendant had waived the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction by participating in the litigation and failing to raise the jurisdictional defense for almost four years.', 'The trial justice determined that defendant had not waived the defense because he had asserted it in his answer. Additionally, the trial justice noted that, although Helios had contact with this state, that contact could not be imputed to defendant because the complaint was devoid of a claim or facts alleging alter-ego liability. The trial justice concluded that Rhode Island could not exercise personal jurisdiction over defendant.

Our review is de novo. See id.', 'Analysis', 'Before this Court, plaintiff contends that defendant has sufficient minimum contacts with this state to support a claim of general or specific jurisdiction. Notwithstanding these contacts, plaintiff submits that defendant waived, or forfeited, the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction by failing to assert the defense for more than three and a half years and by actively participating in litigation, including depositions and court-annexed arbitration. This case presents this Court with an issue of first impression: whether a defendant in a diversity action may waive or, more befittingly, forfeit the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction through delay or other conduct that demonstrates an intent to litigate. We answer that question in the affirmative.', 'We begin our analysis of the forfeiture issue against the backdrop of personal jurisdiction in this state: “[t]he Due Process clause of the United States Constitution limits the exercise of personal jurisdiction over nonresident defendants to those who ‘have certain minimum contacts with [the forum] such that maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.’” Rose v.

In Hamilton, the defendant raised the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction in its answer and then waited four years before moving to dismiss based on the defense. Hamilton, 197 F.3d at 61. During those four years, the defendant proceeded through discovery, conducted depositions, and successfully transferred the', '-8- case to a different venue. Id. The court concluded that the defendant “could have raised the personal jurisdiction issue [earlier]” and had “several clear opportunities to do so,” but instead, “gambled that it could raise the personal jurisdiction issue on the eve of trial, in case a trial occurred.” Id. at 62. This unwarranted delay and active participation in pretrial proceedings was determined to constitute forfeiture of the defense. Id.; see also Continental Bank, N.A., 10 F.3d at 1297 (holding personal jurisdiction defense forfeited where the defendants “participated in lengthy discovery, filed various motions and opposed a number of motions” and “fully participated in litigation of the merits for over two-and-a-half years without actively contesting personal jurisdiction”).', 'In considering whether forfeiture occurred in this case, we proceed to a similar review of the circumstances examined by the court in Hamilton, beginning with the passage of time between the assertion of the defense in the answer and resort to the defense by motion. The defendant waited more than three and one half years before moving for summary judgment based on lack of personal jurisdiction. “Although the passage of time alone is generally not sufficient to indicate forfeiture of a procedural right, * * * the time period provides the context in which to assess the significance of the defendant’s conduct, both the litigation activity that occurred and the opportunities to litigate the jurisdictional issue that were forgone.” Hamilton, 197 F.3d at 61.', 'During the three and one half years, defendant conducted discovery, appeared at numerous pretrial hearings, participated in arbitration, and filed several motions including a motion to assign the case to a jury trial. The defendant had numerous opportunities to contest the court’s jurisdiction, the most significant of which was prior to consenting to a jury trial. Even before he demanded a jury trial, defendant participated in arbitration.', 'It is antithetical to conclude that a defendant might agree to arbitrate in Rhode Island, thereby consenting to terms', '-9- of the arbitration proceeding, yet remain beyond the jurisdictional reach of the court tasked with enforcing the award. See Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. v. Lecopulos, 553 F.2d 842, 844 (2d Cir. 1977) (holding that arbitration in New York constituted consent to personal jurisdiction in New York).', 'Furthermore, we do not overlook the fact that the results of arbitration were adverse to defendant’s interests. The defendant, confronted with an impending trial, cannot now “pull [personal jurisdiction] out of the hat like a rabbit” in the face of an inhospitable sea. Broadcast Music, Inc. v. M.T.S. Enterprises, Inc., 811 F.2d 278, 281 (5th Cir. 1987); see also Rice v. Nova Biomedical Corp., 38 F.3d 909, 914 (7th Cir. 1994) (“It would defeat the purpose of requiring prompt assertion of the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction if the defendant, having raised an objection to personal jurisdiction at the outset as required, could without any penalty fail or refuse to press it, creating the impression that he had abandoned it, and not seek to correct that impression until * * * [after] an adverse final judgment on the merits.”).', 'Accordingly, a defendant forfeits the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction when the defendant, through delay or conduct, “give[s] a plaintiff a reasonable expectation that it will defend the suit on the merits or * * * cause[s] the court to go to some effort that would be wasted if personal jurisdiction is later found lacking.” Mobile Anesthesiologists Chicago, LLC v. Anesthesia Associates of Houston Metroplex, P.A., 623 F.3d 440, 443 (7th Cir. 2010). Clearly, the elements of forfeiture are present in this case. The defendant proceeded through discovery, arbitration, and extensive pretrial litigation for more than three and a half years, during which he had several opportunities to challenge this state’s personal jurisdiction over him. We can reach no other conclusion but that defendant’s silence in the face of a known right can only be described as forfeiture.', '- 10 -', 'Because the defendant forfeited his jurisdictional defense through unjustified delay and active participation in litigation proceedings, we cannot say that the traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice are offended by requiring him to acquiesce to the jurisdiction of this state. See Rose, 819 A.2d at 1250.', 'Indeed, our adoption of the doctrine of forfeiture appropriately portrays personal jurisdiction for what it is—an individual right that can be surrendered. See Insurance Corp. of Ireland, Ltd. v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, 703 (1982) (“Because the requirement of personal jurisdiction represents first of all an individual right, it can, like other such rights, be waived.”); City of New York v. Mickalis Pawn Shop, LLC, 645 F.3d 114, 133 (2d Cir. 2011) (“Personal jurisdiction, unlike subject-matter jurisdiction, can * * * be purposely waived or inadvertently forfeited.”).', 'Unquestionably, forfeiture occurred in this case.', 'Conclusion', 'For these reasons, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court.

91,No. 2015-216-Appeal. (13-1241-2) In re King J. : In re Saint J. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. The respondent, Jason James (respondent or James), appeals from decrees entered in the Family Court finding dependency as to his sons, King and Saint. The matter came before the Supreme Court on September 28, 2016, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised by this appeal should not be summarily decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and reviewing the memoranda submitted on behalf of the parties, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown. Accordingly, we shall decide the matter at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the decrees of the Family Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'A', 'Dependency as to King', 'The Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) became involved with King and the James family in September 2013, after receiving a call to its hotline alleging that respondent hit King and kicked a door, which struck King. On October 9, 2013, DCYF filed a', '-1- petition with the Family Court alleging that respondent and Ms. Marilyn James neglected and abused King. 1 The petition was later amended to include allegations of dependency. 2 Beginning on January 24, 2014, respondent’s trial as to King’s dependency was held before a justice of the Family Court.', 'The respondent testified first. 3 He stated that, following high school, he entered the United States Marine Corps. After two deployments, he was honorably discharged in 2007. He has since been involved with the Providence Veterans Administration Medical Center (VA) in a program that assists veterans with reintegration after deployment. The respondent testified that he was diagnosed at the VA with major depressive disorder.', 'The respondent testified that, in September 2013, a DCYF investigator, Ms. Michaela Dolan, came to his home. The respondent denied telling Dolan that he suffered from PTSD and should be medicated. Afterwards, respondent met with Christine Baron, M.D. (Dr. Baron) at Hasbro Children’s Hospital.', 'In response to Dr. Baron’s inquiry about bruising on King’s abdomen and rib cage, he testified that he denied seeing any bruises and suggested it could be a rash instead. The respondent also testified that Dr. Baron asked him about the extra digit on each of King’s hands. In his testimony, respondent stated that King had “ten and a half fingers.” When asked if he denied knowing what happened to King’s other “half a finger,” respondent stated that it would be “absurd” to do so. He could not recall what he told Dr. Baron about 1', 'To avoid confusion with Jason James, we will refer to Marilyn James as Marilyn. No disrespect is intended. 2', 'On November 9, 2014, Marilyn admitted dependency as to King and subsequently admitted dependency as to Saint. 3', 'Throughout respondent’s testimony, the trial justice reproached him for his behavior and demeanor while testifying. After numerous disruptions, she ultimately appointed a guardian ad litem on his behalf.', '-2- King’s missing digit and stated that he did not answer Dr. Baron’s questions “because of how she scrutinized me.”', 'Next, a DCYF caseworker, Ms. Stacey Goncalves, testified that she became involved with this case on October 7, 2013. Goncalves said that, at the time, Marilyn stayed with her mother, Ms. Barbara Suggs. On October 11, 2013, Goncalves visited Suggs’s household, where King should have been staying pursuant to a safety plan. King was there and appeared safe. On October 25, 2013, Goncalves again visited Suggs’s house because she was unable to contact her or King’s parents. After not finding King at Suggs’s house, Goncalves went to respondent’s home. She was accompanied by her supervisor, Ms. Denise Zolnierz, and Providence police officers. Goncalves testified that respondent refused to let them enter and would not let them see King to assure them that he was safe. After the fire department and additional police officers arrived, the police gained access to the residence and retrieved King. After this incident, King was placed in a foster home, and Goncalves arranged a meeting with respondent and Marilyn to discuss visitation and a case plan.', 'In her testimony, Goncalves discussed the supervised visits between King, respondent, and Marilyn. The first supervised visit occurred on November 7, 2013. During this visit, Goncalves discussed a case plan with respondent and Marilyn. However, respondent did not want to follow the plan because he did not think that the allegations against him were accurate. Also during that visit, respondent told Goncalves that he removed an extra finger from King’s hand with a knife. Goncalves testified that she told respondent he should have sought medical attention, to which he responded that he knew what he was doing.', 'Goncalves also testified about instances of respondent’s inappropriate behavior. For example, Goncalves noted a visit at which King lightly bit respondent, and respondent then bit', '-3- him back. She also discussed a doctor’s visit on November 26, 2013, when respondent held King upside down. After the doctor and Goncalves asked respondent to stop, he said he would stop only because it made them feel uncomfortable. At this visit, the doctor also recommended that King have his other extra finger removed. However, respondent said that he wanted to wait for King to be able to make his own decisions. 4', 'Goncalves testified about a visit when respondent made comments about “baby snatchers” taking King away, which appeared to upset King. Goncalves cautioned respondent to stop making those comments, but he persisted despite additional warnings. Goncalves ended the visit early because of respondent’s behavior. At another visit, respondent repeatedly lifted King in the air by his hands and wrists. When Goncalves asked him to stop because it was dangerous, respondent told her to stop talking to him because he knew what he was doing. Also during this visit, respondent and Marilyn let King run around the visiting room in just a diaper. When Goncalves asked respondent to dress King, he asked her if she “knew the f**king temperature.” Goncalves recounted another visit when King dropped a toy and respondent “grabbed him by his ankles and lifted him backwards to get the toy from behind the couch.”', 'Goncalves also testified about positive observations from the supervised visits. She noted one visit when respondent brought a toy that appeared to scare King. Goncalves said that respondent gradually introduced the toy to King, to help him overcome his fear. On another occasion, respondent brought a skateboard to the visitation. After being told that he could not use the skateboard in the visitation room, respondent “was good about redirecting and telling [King] not to use it.” Additionally, Goncalves acknowledged that respondent and Marilyn usually brought fruit for King at every visit. 4', 'In April 2014, DCYF filed a motion asking the Family Court to grant consent for the surgical removal of King’s extra digit.', '-4-', 'The last visit that Goncalves supervised occurred on February 6, 2014. The respondent became aggressive towards Goncalves after she told him that King bit another child at daycare. The respondent threatened Goncalves, saying, “Stacey, you know I know where you live and I’m going to take your kid and then I’m going to send every Jehovah Witness in the state to your house.” Goncalves ended the visit and capitol police had to escort respondent out of the building.', 'Finally, Ms. Denise Zolnierz, Goncalves’s supervisor, testified. Zolnierz also discussed the October 25, 2013 incident at respondent’s residence. Her testimony was consistent with that of Goncalves. Zolnierz said that, after entering the residence, she found swords lying on the living-room floor and a bathtub filled with water.', 'Zolnierz testified about another interaction with respondent and Marilyn on the phone. According to Zolnierz, respondent screamed in the background as she spoke with Marilyn. Zolnierz stated that respondent said DCYF “are confused and f**ked up” and called her a “ho.” After this, she met with respondent and Marilyn to address respondent’s disruptive behavior, including his use of inappropriate expressions like “baby snatcher.” Zolnierz also discussed the visitation program at the Providence Children’s Museum because she thought that the program could make the visits more positive. However, respondent did not sign the release to participate in the program.', 'On April 16, 2014, the Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) sought to amend the petition to include an allegation of dependency based on respondent’s mental health issues.', '-5- After considering the testimony of respondent, Goncalves, and Zolnierz, the trial justice granted CASA’s motion to include a dependency allegation as to both King and Saint. 5', 'On May 9, 2014, the trial justice rendered a bench decision granting DCYF’s dependency petition as to King. The trial justice summarized the testimony of respondent, Goncalves, and Zolnierz.', 'After making factual findings, the trial justice found, by clear and convincing evidence, that respondent “failed to provide this child with a minimum degree of care, supervision and guardianship pursuant to the statute.” She also found that respondent “inflicted physical injury upon this child, including the door kicking incident and the cutting off of the digit on his finger.” The trial justice found King dependent as to respondent “given his needs as well as the mental health issues of [respondent].” She determined that it was in King’s best interest to be placed out-of-home and ordered supervised visitation until respondent addressed his mental health issues, completed a psychological evaluation, and attended domestic violence counseling and parenting classes. Accordingly, King was committed to the care, custody, and control of DCYF. The respondent filed a notice of appeal on July 17, 2014.', 'B', 'Dependency as to Saint', 'DCYF became involved with King’s brother, Saint, after his birth on March 18, 2014. DCYF filed a petition alleging neglect of Saint by respondent and Marilyn. As noted above, this petition was amended on April 16, 2014, to include a dependency allegation based on respondent’s mental health issues.', 'On February 11, 2015, a trial to determine Saint’s dependency was held before the same Family Court justice. At the beginning of the trial, the trial justice took judicial notice of the dependency decree in King’s case. 5', 'While the trial commenced with respect to only King, we note that Saint was born on March 18, 2014, and a second petition was brought on his behalf on April 1, 2014.', '-6-', 'A DCYF caseworker, Mr. John Campopiano, was the only witness to testify. He first became involved with King, Saint, and the James family in September 2014. When Campopiano received this case, King and Saint were already in foster care. Campopiano explained that his relationship with respondent “took off in a positive way” and differed from the relationship that respondent had with Goncalves and Zolnierz. He described his experience with respondent as “a more positive, more free-flowing, natural progression.” Campopiano said he did not observe any volatility during the supervised visitations and never had to end a visit early due to respondent’s behavior. He testified that respondent had “always been appropriate with both the children, especially with Saint.”', 'Campopiano also discussed the case plan services that he sought to continue, including a substance-abuse assessment for respondent and mental health counseling for both parents. Campopiano said that he discussed these services with respondent, but respondent did not find them necessary. He also discussed the ordered psychological evaluation that respondent had not completed. Although Campopiano respected respondent’s reasons for not wanting to complete it, he acknowledged that the psychological evaluation was “still a need.”', 'On February 25, 2015, the trial justice rendered a bench decision finding Saint dependent. She summarized Campopiano’s testimony and considered respondent’s failure to adhere to his case plan because he did not think that he needed its services. The trial justice also noted the testimony and factual findings from King’s trial, specifically, the testimony about respondent removing King’s extra digit and his “appalling” conduct towards Goncalves and Zolnierz. Although the trial justice acknowledged that “there is no evidence that Saint has been harmed to the extent that King was,” she said that she would not ignore respondent’s treatment of King.', '-7- Accordingly, Saint was committed to the care, custody, and control of DCYF. The respondent filed a timely notice of appeal on April, 10, 2015.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'Under G.L. 1956 § 14-1-3(6), dependency is defined as:', '“[A]ny child who requires the protection and assistance of the', 'court when his or her physical or mental health or welfare is', 'harmed or threatened with harm due to the inability of the parent or', 'guardian, through no fault of the parent or guardian, to provide the', 'child with a minimum degree of care or proper supervision because', 'of:', '“(i)', 'The death or illness of a parent; or', '“(ii) The special medical, educational, or social service', 'needs of the child which the parent is unable to provide.”', 'In deciding dependency allegations, “the Family Court is required to make its findings by clear and convincing evidence, in accordance with Rule 17(b) of the Family Court Rules of Juvenile Proceedings.” In re Jermaine H., 9 A.3d 1227, 1231 (R.I. 2010). “We have therefore stated that to show dependency, the state must prove by clear and convincing evidence only that a child is actually suffering or is likely to suffer physical and/or emotional harm.” In re Crystal, Joshua, and Jacqueline A., 448 A.2d 1226, 1229 (R.I. 1982). “[I]t is incumbent upon the trial justice to set forth the facts upon which the finding rests.” In re Jermaine H., 9 A.3d at 1231.', ""“This Court's standard of review requires that ‘we examine the record to determine whether legally competent evidence exists in it to support findings made by the trial justice.’” In re Jermaine H., 9 A.3d at 1231 (quoting In re Adner G., 925 A.2d 951, 957 (R.I. 2007)). The trial justice’s “findings are entitled to great weight and will not be disturbed absent a showing that the trial justice was clearly wrong or that material evidence was overlooked or misconceived.” In re Tamika R., 973 A.2d 547, 550 (R.I. 2009) (quoting In re Ephraim L., 862"", '-8- A.2d 196, 200 (R.I. 2004)). Thus, “it is our function to determine whether legally competent evidence exists in the record before us to support the finding, by clear and convincing evidence, that the children were dependent * * *.” In re Jermaine H., 9 A.3d at 1231.', 'III', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Decree of Dependency as to King', 'On appeal, respondent argues that the trial justice’s decisions declaring King and Saint dependent are not supported by clear and convincing evidence. The respondent challenges the trial justice’s finding that he physically injured King based on the alleged removal of King’s extra digit. He contends that DCYF failed to put forth any medical evidence showing that he removed King’s extra digit or that “[his] actions harmed his son in any way.” The respondent also claims that the trial justice’s findings are “rife with extraneous and unproven allegations that existed nowhere in the record.”', 'Our review of the record reveals sufficient evidence to support the trial justice’s finding that respondent inflicted physical injury on King. In reaching this finding, the trial justice relied on the evidence adduced at trial relating to respondent’s removal of King’s extra digit. Goncalves testified that respondent told her that he removed an extra finger on King’s hand with a knife and claimed he “knew what he was doing.” In respondent’s own testimony, he stated that it would be “absurd” to deny knowing what happened to King’s extra digit. Additionally, before us, respondent “acknowledged that he removed something from his son’s hand,” but argued that', '-9- “it was not ‘a finger technically.’” Despite this contention, however, respondent repeatedly referenced it as a “finger” throughout his testimony. 6', 'Further, this Court does not hold the trial justice’s findings to be “rife with extraneous and unproven allegations that existed nowhere in the record.” The respondent challenges the trial justice’s mention of her own child, who required medical attention to have an extra digit removed, arguing, “[t]here was no medical evidence to help the court determine whether the protrusion on King’s hand was an actual digit that necessitated a hospital visit for removal * * *.” We are satisfied, however, that sufficient evidence exists elsewhere in the record supporting the trial justice’s finding that respondent removed King’s finger, harming him.', 'The respondent also contends that the trial justice’s findings were “a distortion of the evidence.”', 'While we note that the trial justice mischaracterized certain testimony in her decision, 7 this Court does not conclude that the minor mischaracterizations are misconceptions of material evidence. The misinterpreted testimony accounts for just two pieces of evidence that the trial justice noted in her decision—a decision that referenced abundant evidence supporting her finding. In addition to the evidence of King’s physical harm, the trial justice considered respondent’s mental health issues in finding King dependent.', 'Specifically, she looked at respondent’s treatment at the VA, his “aggressive, loud and belligerent” conduct with DCYF 6', 'During his testimony, respondent stated that “[h]e had ten and a half fingers” and “[Dr. Baron] never seen [sic] the finger or the missing finger in question.” 7', 'In her decision, the trial justice described an incident with a toy that appeared to scare King and another involving a skateboard as “actions or conduct on the part of [respondent] that this Court finds to be inappropriate, unsafe and at times bizarre * * *.” From this Court’s review of the record, however, these two instances are examples of respondent’s appropriate behavior. In Goncalves’s testimony about the incident with the toy, she said that respondent “was very good about the way he trying [sic] to get him not afraid of it.” Regarding the skateboard incident, Goncalves testified that respondent “was good about redirecting and telling [King] not to use it.”', '-10- employees, his inappropriate behavior towards King, and the appointment of a guardian ad litem on his behalf.', ""We conclude that the trial justice clearly “articulate[d] [her] findings concerning the welfare of the child in light of the parent's alleged misconduct.” In re Crystal, Joshua, and Jacqueline A., 448 A.2d at 1229.

The evidence that the trial justice cited"", '-11- to from King’s case, including the testimony about the respondent’s removal of King’s extra digit with a knife and his “appalling conduct and treatment” towards the DCYF employees, established a likelihood of harm to Saint. Additionally, although the respondent contends that the trial justice solely relied on King’s dependency in making a determination as to Saint, she did consider additional evidence. Specifically, the trial justice considered the respondent’s failure to comply with the case plan and the ordered psychological evaluation and his belief that he did not need the plan’s services.

92,: v. : John Aiello et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court.', 'This case came before the Supreme Court on October 5, 2016, on appeal by the plaintiff, Mathew M. Cote1 (plaintiff), from a Superior Court judgment, following a trial before a justice of the Superior Court sitting without a jury, that dismissed his complaint alleging breach of an implied contract, promissory estoppel, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and unjust enrichment. After a ten-day trial, the trial justice found for the defendants, John (Aiello) and Anna-Maria Aiello (Mrs. Aiello) (collectively, defendants or the Aiellos), on all claims,2 declaring, inter alia, that the plaintiff failed to prove the existence of an implied contract to purchase the defendants’ business, Richmond Ready-Mix (RRM), and that the promises made by Aiello to the plaintiff were not clear and unambiguous declarations to support a claim for promissory estoppel. On appeal, the plaintiff argues that the trial justice 1', 'The parties’ names are spelt differently throughout the Superior Court record. As a result, we will refer to the parties herein in accordance with the caption on the complaint. 2', 'The trial justice did find in favor of plaintiff on the issue of liability on his unjust enrichment claim. However, damages were not awarded, because plaintiff failed to present evidence on the appropriate measure of damages. As a result, that claim was also dismissed.', '-1- erred by: (1) confining her analysis to the 1996 and 1999 conversations between the plaintiff and Aiello; (2) inappropriately speculating about the plaintiff’s willingness to purchase RRM; (3) incorrectly concluding that the plaintiff did not detrimentally rely on Aiello’s promises; (4) overlooking material evidence in considering the plaintiff’s fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims; and (5) applying the incorrect measure of damages to the plaintiff’s unjust enrichment claim. Because we are of the opinion that the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive material evidence and was not otherwise clearly wrong in dismissing the complaint, we affirm the judgment.', 'Facts and Travel', 'The facts of this case recount a story of an employee who succumbed to his employer’s promises about future events that never materialized. In 1986, after graduating from high school, plaintiff began working for Aiello’s then-existing construction company, Aiello Construction. When Aiello closed the doors on that business in 1991, plaintiff was transferred to a sister company, Richmond Sand and Gravel (RS&G). The plaintiff terminated his employment with RS&G later that year because of the manner in which Aiello’s son-in-law, Jeffrey Nero (Nero), was managing the company. Some years later, in May 1996, he was lured back when Aiello presented plaintiff with an opportunity first to return to RS&G and then to transfer to a sister company, RRM. Aiello sweetened the offer by explaining to plaintiff that he could purchase RRM in the future, although they did not discuss any terms of a potential purchase. The plaintiff was led to believe that Aiello owned RRM. He was not alone. Many years later it was revealed that Mrs. Aiello was the sole shareholder of the company, an ownership interest that both defendants had concealed.', '-2-', 'After plaintiff accepted the employment opportunity, he and Aiello continued to enjoy a close personal relationship.3 In 1997, plaintiff was named president and vice president of RRM, and acted as its chief executive officer (CEO). Over the years, Aiello made repeated references to the future, indicating that plaintiff would purchase RRM and Nero would purchase RS&G. For example, in 1999, Aiello declared that when he was ready to retire he would sell RRM to plaintiff at fair market value and would structure a payment plan for him as well. Although statements of this nature were made on several occasions, the details of any potential purchase were never discussed, nor were any contract terms explored by plaintiff.', 'Despite plaintiff’s hard work and loyal service, Aiello sold RRM4 to Peter Calcagni (Calcagni) for $1,829,800 on June 22, 2005. The purchase agreement included a promise that plaintiff would be paid the sum of $50,000—which Calcagni was led to believe was a bonus but was actually a repayment of an outstanding loan from plaintiff to RRM. On June 25, 2005, Aiello informed plaintiff that he had sold RRM to Calcagni. The plaintiff became visibly distraught at this news; and, as Calcagni assumed control of the business, he remained frustrated. The plaintiff continued to work for Calcagni until July 2009, when the assets of RRM were sold in receivership to Michael D’Ambra (D’Ambra).5 The plaintiff currently works for D’Ambra at Rhode Island Ready Mix, the successor company of RRM.', 'The plaintiff filed an action against Aiello on August 8, 2006. The complaint alleged: (1) promissory estoppel; (2) breach of an oral contract; (3) breach of an implied contract; 3', 'More pointedly, Aiello was like a father to plaintiff. The plaintiff and Aiello often ate supper together and attended family gatherings. The plaintiff even had Aiello serve as his best man at his wedding. 4', 'RS&G was also purchased by Peter Calcagni at the same time.

On May 15, 2007, plaintiff filed an amended complaint, alleging the same claims against Mrs. Aiello. The amended complaint also alleged fraud and negligent misrepresentation against both defendants.', 'A bench trial before a justice of the Superior Court commenced on November 30, 2011. The trial spanned ten nonconsecutive trial days, concluding on January 6, 2012. At trial, plaintiff recounted the numerous assertions that Aiello made regarding his future plans for RRM. He testified that in 1996 he was told by Aiello that it would be a “great opportunity” for plaintiff to join the RRM team and that “at some time in the future [plaintiff] would possibly be able to purchase the company.” The plaintiff recalled accepting the offer because “[i]t felt like [he] was coming back to [his] father’s business to help him run it and to take it over at some point.” He testified that, after he was appointed president, vice president, and CEO, Mrs. Aiello said, “Congratulations, it is your baby now.” According to plaintiff, Aiello often declared that “when he was going to retire * * * he would come up with a fair market value of the business and at some point sell the business to [plaintiff].” Nonetheless, plaintiff acknowledged that he also knew that he was under no obligation to purchase RRM.', 'The plaintiff also testified that statements concerning his future ownership of RRM were made in other contexts—recounting that a third party was directed to inquire with plaintiff about whether RRM was for sale6 and that Aiello had counseled him to execute a prenuptial agreement in order to protect himself and RRM.', 'Nero corroborated plaintiff’s testimony. He testified that, like plaintiff, he managed RS&G and was repeatedly told that he could purchase the company after Aiello retired. Nero also explained that the future plans for RS&G and RRM were openly discussed within the Aiello 6', 'When questioned about this dialogue, Aiello testified that he made these statements only in an attempt to dodge negotiations that he did not care to discuss.', '-4- family. At the end of his testimony, Nero claimed that he was “surprised” that Aiello sold RRM because he “always assumed that [plaintiff] would be with [RRM].” Aiello explicitly denied ever stating that plaintiff would have the option to purchase RRM in the future. Mrs. Aiello testified that plaintiff did not accrue any additional authority from his corporate titles. However, their credibility was assailed by the factfinder.', 'Based on Aiello’s statements, plaintiff testified that he acted “like a company owner” and oversaw “the whole operation.” He did not consider other employment opportunities and made numerous loans to RRM in hopes of someday owning the company. These loans totaled approximately $400,000 and were interest-free.7', 'The plaintiff did acknowledge on cross- examination that all of the loans were repaid. Nero corroborated plaintiff’s hard work, testifying that RRM grew in large part due to plaintiff’s efforts.', 'D’Ambra testified that while he eventually revived RRM after the receivership, he and Aiello had previously negotiated a sale of RS&G and RRM in 2005. According to D’Ambra, Aiello did not believe that plaintiff had the ability to buy the company. After the negotiations with D’Ambra fell through, Calcagni purchased the sister companies.8', 'Calcagni testified that he believed Aiello owned both companies. He stated that he had no knowledge of Mrs. Aiello’s ownership until she arrived at the closing to sign the requisite documents. Mrs. Aiello testified that her husband served as a consultant and that she was the sole owner of RRM. However, she acknowledged that the funds from the sale of RRM to Calcagni were commingled with her husband’s proceeds from the simultaneous sale of RS&G, 7', 'According to plaintiff, the Aiellos acquiesced in the loans and purchases, except for the acquisition of a generator. Mrs. Aiello contradicted this testimony, claiming that plaintiff was difficult to work with and often made purchases without authority to do so. 8', 'Calcagni testified that he was predominantly interested in purchasing RS&G, but Aiello informed him that the companies were being sold as a package.', '-5- such that she was unable to quantify the net proceeds. Calcagni testified that the Aiellos took considerable efforts to conceal the sale from their employees. For instance, Calcagni stated that when he inspected the premises, he was not allowed to exit the vehicle. He also testified that the Aiellos crafted a misleading memorandum which stated that Calcagni was a new stockholder in the companies, indicating that Aiello was still involved in the companies. Although Calcagni testified that Aiello assured him that plaintiff would continue to manage RRM and would not take issue with the sale, he described a meeting he had with plaintiff because of his concerns that plaintiff was disgruntled. It was at this meeting that he learned that the $50,000 paid to plaintiff was not a bonus, but was repayment of a loan.', 'Both parties submitted posttrial memoranda; and, on July 22, 2013, the trial justice issued a comprehensive bench decision. The trial justice summarized the testimony and found that plaintiff, Nero, D’Ambra, and Calcagni were credible and honest witnesses. Based on their testimony, she found that “no later than 1999, [plaintiff] genuinely believed he would have the opportunity to buy the business when * * * Aiello retired and that * * * Aiello would help him structure a payment plan.” She added that plaintiff was a double asset to the Aiellos—he was a hard worker, as well as “a potential buyer waiting in the wings until they were ready to sell.”', 'The trial justice found neither defendant to be credible, noting that Aiello was evasive and nonresponsive, sometimes injecting petty, negative comments about other witnesses in an attempt to inject bias into the proceedings.', 'The trial justice concluded that Aiello “disingenuously attempted to minimize his role” in RRM and that Mrs. Aiello assented to her husband’s efforts through her silence and acquiescence. The trial justice was not persuaded that the Aiellos had difficulty working with plaintiff; rather, she was convinced that plaintiff was “encourage[d] * * * into thinking he should throw his heart, soul, and money into” RRM.', '-6-', 'Before turning to the issue of liability, the trial justice characterized the Aiellos’ conduct as “despicable and an egregious breach of personal trust.” Nevertheless, the trial justice rejected all claims, save for plaintiff’s claim of unjust enrichment. On the question of whether there was an implied contract, the trial justice found that in 1996 Aiello spoke in terms of future possibilities and an employment incentive, which she found was mere “puffing.” She explained that plaintiff and Aiello did not discuss any essential terms of the agreement, and the subsequent conduct of the parties did not cure this fatal defect. Referring to the 1999 conversation in which Aiello declared that, when he retired, he would structure a payment plan for plaintiff to purchase the business, the trial justice concluded that this conversation injected even more uncertainty because the meaning of the term “retirement” was unclear; there was no discussion about a succession plan in the event that Aiello died before retiring; and there was no colloquy about financing or the potential purchase price. Because plaintiff testified that he did not consider himself bound to purchase the company, the trial justice concluded that there was no implied contract, as the essential elements of mutual assent and certainty of the essential terms were lacking.', 'The trial justice was unconvinced that plaintiff was ready, willing, and able to purchase RRM. She accepted the testimony of Ralph Shippee (Shippee), a moneylender, who testified to a brief conversation he had with plaintiff prior to June 2005 concerning potential financing for the purchase price of RRM.', 'The trial justice concluded that Shippee would have offered financing to plaintiff, but plaintiff had failed to prove that he would have proceeded with the purchase upon reviewing the actual financing terms. Having carefully reviewed the testimony of the trial witnesses, the trial justice concluded that plaintiff’s implied contract claim must fail.', '-7-', 'The trial justice also rejected plaintiff’s promissory estoppel claim, finding that Aiello’s promises were not clear and unambiguous. The trial justice found that the term “retirement” was an indefinite term that created ambiguity. She found that Aiello’s statements were “at best, discussions of possible future career developments and opportunities” and not promises. Second, the trial justice found no reasonable reliance on these statements by plaintiff because a competent businessman would not rely on “vague statements, love, and affection * * * even in the face of the Aiellos’ continuous bolstering and lulling conduct.” Finally, the trial justice found that there was no detrimental reliance because plaintiff was paid a considerable salary and gained managerial experience during his employment.', 'Next, the trial justice briefly addressed in tandem plaintiff’s fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims. The trial justice noted the general rule that fraud claims cannot be predicated on promises of future action unless the promise is used as a device to accomplish a fraudulent scheme. The trial justice concluded that, on the basis of the evidence presented, the Aiellos did not intend to deceive plaintiff at the time the statements were made. Rather, the trial justice found that in 2005 the Aiellos, faced with financial difficulties, simply changed their minds about selling RRM to plaintiff. Nonetheless, the trial justice did find that the Aiellos deliberately concealed the true ownership of RRM.', 'Finally, the trial justice concluded that plaintiff established a claim for unjust enrichment because the Aiellos were well aware that plaintiff made interest-free loans to RRM on the expectation that RRM someday would belong to him. As a result, the trial justice held that plaintiff would be entitled to reasonable interest on those loans, but she noted that plaintiff failed to present any evidence on what interest rates should apply. She therefore declined to render an award.', '-8-', 'Judgment was entered on July 29, 2013.

Brown University, 692 A.2d 665, 669 (R.I. 1997). “The difference between an express contract and an implied-in-fact contract is simply the manner by which the parties express their mutual assent.” Id.

The', '- 10 - trial justice began by summarizing the testimony of the various witnesses, finding all witnesses—except defendants—to be honest and credible. Accepting the facts as true, it is clear to this Court that the trial justice did not overlook material evidence regarding the parties’ subsequent conduct.9 She noted the “frequent conversations, references, comments, and remarks confirming the future plan, that is, * * * when * * * Aiello retired [plaintiff] would buy [RRM] * * *.” She also referenced plaintiff’s testimony about an “ongoing and continuing series of comments, conversations, and remarks all of which were consistent with what had been stated to him in 1996 and 1999.” The trial justice highlighted the 1996 and 1999 conversations because the record contains scant evidence of other concrete occurrences to serve as a starting point. Although the doctrine of an implied-in-fact contract allows for a wider evidentiary net to prove the formation of a contract, proof of the essential elements of a contract is nonetheless required. Compare Marshall Contractors, Inc., 692 A.2d at 669, with Filippi v. Filippi, 818 A.2d 608, 619 (R.I. 2003) (explaining that the parol-evidence rule limits contractual review of an integrated document to the document itself).', 'The record before us demonstrates that there was an understanding between the parties that plaintiff would eventually own RRM. This understanding alone, however, was not sufficient to create an implied contract.', 'Turning to the 1996 conversation, the trial justice found that Aiello’s offer was framed as a mere possibility of a future ownership opportunity, a tactic often used as a selling point. As plaintiff was a new hire in 1996, she was “not at all persuaded that either of the Aiellos would have gone so far to offer the business to [plaintiff] at that point or that [plaintiff] would have been reasonable in believing that this is what they were doing.” Furthermore, there is no 9', 'The trial justice did state that “[t]he theory of implied contract does not permit a Court to rely on subsequent conduct in order to attribute obligations that the parties did not have in mind in the first instance.” However, this pronouncement was stated in the ambit of plaintiff’s right of first refusal argument, discussed infra.', '- 11 - evidence that any terms of the sale were discussed by the parties in 1996.', 'The trial justice also examined the evidence surrounding the 1999 conversation and found that the discussion gave rise to more uncertainty.

She concluded that the decision to sell RRM to plaintiff rested solely with the Aiellos based on the lack of specificity surrounding those discussions.', 'This Court has declined to find mutual assent on essential terms when “the promises of the parties depend on the occurrence of some future event within the unilateral control of the promisors * * *.” Centerville Builders, Inc. v.

Although we agree with the trial justice that this interpretation would eliminate some of the lingering questions that confronted her, we', '- 12 - agree that she correctly rejected this argument. An implied contract granting plaintiff the right of first refusal is simply not supported by the evidence nor was the claim raised in plaintiff’s first amended complaint. Significantly, paragraph 62 of the first amended complaint alleges that “[t]he actions of Aiello and [plaintiff] exhibited mutual agreement and intent to sell RRM to [p]laintiff, thus there was established a contract for the sale of the business implied in fact.” (Emphasis added.) The plaintiff’s first amended complaint is silent as to any suggestion that defendants gave plaintiff the right of first refusal to purchase RRM. This argument explicitly was rejected by the trial justice, based on the evidence and testimony that was before the court. We see no error.', 'This Court previously has acknowledged that “the resolution of a dispute concerning if and when contract negotiations materialize into a mutual understanding and result[] [in a] binding contract is ordinarily a question of fact for the factfinder.” Marshall Contractors, Inc., 692 A.2d at 670. Having vetted the voluminous trial transcripts, we fail to glean any evidence indicating that the parties agreed on essential terms of a purchase agreement as to establish an implied contract for the purchase of RRM.10 See Opella v.

Accordingly, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not err in concluding that plaintiff failed to establish the existence of an implied contract. 10', 'Since we affirm the trial justice’s finding that plaintiff failed to prove the existence of an implied contract, we find it unnecessary to discuss whether plaintiff was ready, willing, and able to enter into such contract had there been one.', '- 13 -', 'Promissory Estoppel', 'The plaintiff makes a similar argument concerning his claim of promissory estoppel: that the trial justice overlooked material evidence by confining her analysis to the 1996 and 1999 conversations.', 'The plaintiff also contends that the trial justice erroneously concluded that plaintiff did not reasonably rely on Aiello’s promises to his detriment. We do not agree.', 'Promissory estoppel generally is invoked when, for one reason or another, an agreement between two parties fails on an essential element of a contractual claim. Alix v. Alix, 497 A.2d 18, 21 (R.I. 1985). In adopting the Restatement (Second) Contracts approach to the doctrine, this Court has defined promissory estoppel as: “[a] promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance on the part of the promisee or a third person and which does induce such action or forbearance, [and therefore] is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise.” Filippi, 818 A.2d at 625 (quoting Alix, 497 A.2d at 21). Application of the doctrine of promissory estoppel also has been extended “to situations in which the promisee’s reliance on the promise was induced, and injustice may be avoided only by enforcement of the promise.” Id. (citing Alix, 497 A.2d at 21). In Filippi, this Court articulated a three-element approach to promissory estoppel:', '“1. A clear and unambiguous promise;', '“2. Reasonable and justifiable reliance upon the promise; and', '“3. Detriment to the promisee, caused by his or her reliance on the', 'promise.” Id. at 626.', 'In addressing plaintiff’s promissory estoppel claim, the trial justice found that the claim failed on each element. First, the trial justice found that Aiello did not make a clear and unambiguous promise that plaintiff could purchase the business. Specifically, the trial justice found that Aiello’s statements were “too indefinite to constitute a specific term for purposes of', '- 14 - promissory estoppel.” As discussed, the evidence before the trial justice demonstrated that Aiello’s statements concerned future opportunities for employment or the possibility of buying the business, but lacked any certainty and specificity. The trial justice did not overlook material evidence in determining that these statements were likewise too unclear and ambiguous to support a claim of promissory estoppel.', 'Although Aiello often indicated that plaintiff would someday own RRM, the frequency of these remarks does not cure their ambiguity. At most, Aiello’s redundancy created a promise to discuss the purchase of RRM with plaintiff at some point in the future. “Promissory estoppel cannot be based upon preliminary negotiations and discussions or on an agreement to negotiate the terms of a contract.” B.M.L. Corp. v. Greater Providence Deposit Corp., 495 A.2d 675, 677 (R.I. 1985). Because a finding of promissory estoppel can transpose an otherwise gratuitous promise into an enforceable agreement, Hayes v. Plantations Steel Co., 438 A.2d 1091, 1096 (R.I. 1982), this Court is reluctant to expand the doctrine to a promise that is uncertain or indefinite merely because the promise was reiterated on numerous occasions. Because the doctrine of promissory estoppel is aimed at enforcing clear and unambiguous commitments in order to avoid injustice, a strict adherence to the elements of promissory estoppel is required.', 'Even if Aiello’s statements were found to be sufficiently clear and unambiguous promises, plaintiff still bore the burden of proving the remaining elements of promissory estoppel, including detrimental reliance. The trial justice found that it was not reasonable for plaintiff to rely on Aiello’s statements. She held that a “competent businessman” would not reasonably rely on “vague statements, love, and affection” when “the business world is built on written agreements.” We note that approximately nine years elapsed from plaintiff’s return to work at RRM and the time when Aiello sold the business to Calcagni. During that time, with the', '- 15 - exception of the brief eleventh-hour discussion with the moneylender, there is no evidence that plaintiff consulted with an attorney or accountant or initiated or engaged in any discussions with Aiello about buying the company. Futhermore, Aiello’s future plans for RRM were never reduced to writing. The trial justice also found that plaintiff benefited from his position at RRM—gaining considerable experience and earning an acceptable salary—thus defeating the element of detrimental reliance.', 'We are therefore satisfied that the trial justice correctly concluded that plaintiff did not reasonably rely on Aiello’s statements to his detriment.', 'Fraud and Negligent Misrepresentation', 'The plaintiff argues that the trial justice erred in dismissing his fraud and negligent misrepresentation claims. Specifically, he contends that the trial justice “found that both of the Aiellos were dishonest not only in their testimony, but also in their dealings with [plaintiff].” As a result, plaintiff maintains that the trial justice erroneously concluded that the Aiellos simply changed their minds when they decided to sell RRM to someone other than plaintiff. The defendants posit that the trial justice’s credibility findings do not meet the legal requirements of a fraud or negligent misrepresentation claim.', '“To establish a prima facie fraud claim, ‘the plaintiff must prove that the defendant made a false representation intending thereby to induce [the] plaintiff to rely thereon and that the plaintiff justifiably relied thereon to his or her damage.’” McNulty v.

The record is devoid of any evidence that indicates that Aiello’s statements were “made without any intention of performing [them] at the time of making [them].” 37 Am. Jur. 2d Fraud and Deceit § 91 at 126. In fact, the trial justice concluded that the Aiellos “genuinely wanted to groom [plaintiff] as a candidate for buying them out.” The plaintiff has failed to set forth any evidence which indicates that Aiello acted with scienter or knew that his representations were false when made. Cf. Cheetham v. Ferreira, 73 R.I. 425, 429, existing or past fact, and a person has no right to rely on such a promise or statement. A mere failure to perform a promise does not change its character. Moreover, a representation that something will be done in the future, or a promise to do it, cannot, from its nature, be true or false at the time when it is made.

The defendant urges this Court to apply the “raise-or-waive” rule because plaintiff argued in his posttrial memorandum that he should be entitled to interest on the loans he made to RRM. Here, plaintiff requested interest and reimbursement as damages “at the very least” and pointed to RRM’s growth and profitability as evidence that “[h]e conferred an objectively definable benefit upon the Aiellos by allowing RRM to grow and become profitable, undoubtedly increasing its attractiveness to prospective', '- 18 - purchasers.”', 'For these reasons, we are satisfied that plaintiff’s argument on this issue has not been waived.', '“It is well established that ‘[r]ecovery for unjust enrichment is predicated upon the equitable principle that one shall not be permitted to enrich himself at the expense of another by receiving property or benefits without making compensation for them.’” South County Post & Beam, Inc. v.

To recover on an unjust enrichment claim, a plaintiff must prove: “(1) that he or she conferred a benefit upon the party from whom relief is sought; (2) that the recipient appreciated the benefit; and (3) that the recipient accepted the benefit under such circumstances ‘that it would be inequitable for [the recipient] to retain the benefit without paying the value thereof.’” Id.

The parties have not directed our attention to, nor have we uncovered, any case law that articulates a hard and fast rule for the measure of damages on an unjust enrichment claim arising out of interest-free loans. As a result, we are of the opinion that plaintiff’s damages were not necessarily limited to a reasonable rate of interest.', 'We are satisfied, however, that the trial justice did not err in limiting plaintiff’s damages to interest in the context of this case. According to the Restatement (Third) Restitution and', '- 19 - Unjust Enrichment § 49(2) at 176 (2011), “[e]nrichment from a money payment is measured by the amount of the payment or the resulting increase in the defendant’s net assets, whichever is less.” Because the loans were repaid in full, the trial justice’s analysis could have concluded. Supplemental enrichment, usually a form of disgorgement, may be appropriate under certain circumstances—namely, when an individual receives a benefit due to conscious wrongdoing.

The trial justice was unable to conclude that the Aiellos engaged in any deceit or legal wrongdoing, finding instead that defendants simply changed their minds about selling the business to plaintiff. Based on the customary form of compensation for a loan—a reasonable rate of interest on the amount of the loan—the trial justice determined that interest was an appropriate measure of damages. A moneylender generally is not compensated for the positive benefits derived by the loan, such as increased profitability, unless the agreement provides for some sort of royalty.', 'Unjust enrichment is not aimed at placing the benefit conferring party in a better position than had there been a contract or compensation in the first place.', 'Finally, and significantly, even the most generous reading of the record discloses a vague and attenuated evidentiary connection between the plaintiff’s loans and the growth and profitability of RRM. The plaintiff did testify that he made loans to the company in order to enhance RRM’s business and that some loans were provided to allow RRM to undertake certain projects. Nonetheless, the record is devoid of any evidence which correlates the plaintiff’s loans to RRM’s pecuniary triumphs. See Restatement (Third) Restitution and Unjust Enrichment § 51, cmt. f. at 212 (“[A]n objection that profits are ‘remote’ may mean simply that they are impossible to measure with sufficient accuracy; or that they are the product of legitimate contributions by the defendant that should not, in justice, be awarded to the claimant * * * .”).', '- 20 - Thus, we are of the opinion that the trial justice did not inappropriately limit the plaintiff’s damages on his unjust enrichment claim to reasonable interest, which was not proven at trial.12', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment in the case.13 The papers in this case are remanded to the Superior Court. 12', 'Although the trial justice, in a nonjury trial, was vested with discretion to reopen the evidence and take proof on the relevant interest rate, she declined to do so. See State v. DiPetrillo, 922 A.2d 124, 136 (R.I. 2007) (“In a jury-waived trial, a trial justice is vested with broad discretion to hear evidence, pass on the merits of a claim, reopen the proceeding or make additional findings of fact based on the state of the record.” (emphasis added) (citing Connecticut Valley Homes of East Lyme, Inc. v. Bardsley, 867 A.2d 788, 795 (R.I. 2005))). Extensive resources were expended in this case—five years passed before the case proceeded to trial; the trial spanned ten days; and another year and a half elapsed before the trial justice rendered her decision. The plaintiff failed to present any evidence of a reasonable rate of interest during trial or move to reopen the proceedings in order to present such evidence. Furthermore, before this Court, plaintiff seeks a broader measure of damages on the unjust enrichment claim—as opposed to a remand to fasten the actual measure of damages awarded. It is apparent that a reasonable rate of interest fell by the wayside on multiple occasions during this saga. 13', 'In light of our holding affirming the dismissal of plaintiff’s implied contract, promissory estoppel, fraud, and negligent misrepresentation claims, we need not address the trial justice’s advisory findings on damages as plaintiff is not entitled to damages on these claims.', '- 21 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S', 'OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'Mathew M.

93,State : v. : Terrel Barros.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The defendant, Terrel Barros, appeals from judgments of conviction after a jury found him guilty of first-degree murder (count 1), using a firearm during a violent crime (count 2), possessing a firearm after having previously been convicted of a violent crime (count 3), carrying a handgun without a license (count 6), felony assault (count 7), and discharging a firearm during a violent crime (count 8). The defendant received consecutive life sentences for first-degree murder and using a firearm during a violent crime; three consecutive ten-year terms for possessing a firearm after having previously been convicted of a violent crime, carrying a handgun without a license, and discharging a firearm during a violent crime; and a twenty-year concurrent term for the felony assault. This case came before the Supreme Court for argument on September 28, 2016. On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial justice improperly excluded the testimony of Stephen Bodden on the grounds that Bodden effectively invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The defendant argues that the exclusion of Bodden’s testimony was reversible error and, therefore, the defendant is entitled to a new trial at which Bodden would be compelled to testify in front of the', '-1- jury. After careful consideration of the defendant’s arguments and a thorough review of the record, we affirm the judgment of conviction.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Over the course of fifteen to twenty years, Jamal Cruz and Rokiem Henley had grown so close that they considered themselves to be like cousins. On the evening of August 25, 2012, Cruz and Henley, along with some friends, went to the Monet Lounge in Providence to celebrate another friend’s birthday. The two men and their friends partied in the club’s VIP area, drinking and socializing without incident. At 2 a.m., the club’s lights came on to indicate that it was closing time. As Cruz and Henley were leaving the club, there was a “little verbal disagreement” between Cruz and two men—Stephen Bodden and defendant, Terrel Barros—but apparently no physical altercation occurred. With the verbal clash apparently behind them, Cruz and Henley went to the parking lot to retrieve Cruz’s car. Cruz went ahead, first to the valet shack, and then to his car. After ten to fifteen minutes, Henley walked to Cruz’s car, where he saw Bodden approach Cruz and heard him say, “What’s up with that shit that happened in the club?” As Henley continued toward Cruz and Bodden, he heard two gunshots, and he was immediately aware that he had been hit in the leg. Cruz was less fortunate; he had been shot in the stomach, an injury that caused his death shortly thereafter.', 'Patrolmen Daniel Sirignano and Michael Pattie of the Providence Police Department were working a police detail at the Monet Lounge on the night of the shooting. The officers heard the gunshots and instantly reacted. Officer Sirignano was on the scene within seconds; he saw Bodden and Barros get into a Chevrolet Impala and then noticed that Bodden had a firearm that he was trying to conceal. Officer Sirignano detained Bodden and Barros at gunpoint.', '-2- Officer Pattie arrived moments later. Working together, the officers arrested and handcuffed Bodden and Barros.', 'Ultimately, the pair was charged with multiple crimes related to the shooting. 1', 'Over the course of an eight-day jury trial, the state presented evidence that Cruz had identified defendant as the shooter before he succumbed to his wounds. The state also presented an eyewitness who testified that he saw defendant with a gun in his hand. The defendant, however, argued that Bodden was the shooter. Indeed, Officer Pattie testified that, when Bodden was arrested, he said, “It’s me. It’s all me. It’s all mine.” Additionally, it was argued at trial that Bodden’s DNA was found on the gun and defendant’s was not. 2', 'At trial, defendant expressed his intention to call Bodden as a witness. The defendant’s attorney informed the trial justice that he believed Bodden would testify despite the charges that were pending against him relating to the same incident.', 'However, when the prospect of Bodden’s testimony was first addressed at an in-chambers conference, Bodden’s attorney, a member of the Public Defender’s Office, indicated that his client would invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination should he be called as a witness. Accordingly, the trial justice ordered that a voir dire examination be conducted to determine if Bodden would, in fact, invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege and decline to testify.', 'At the voir dire examination, Bodden’s attorney was unavailable. In accordance with the trial justice’s request, another attorney from the Public Defender’s Office was summoned and represented Bodden “on behalf of [the first attorney].” In light of the earlier indication that Bodden would decline to testify, it was no small surprise that, after he was sworn, he began 1', 'The defendant, however, was tried separately from Bodden. 2', 'It is worth noting that the expert witness who testified at trial said that DNA from multiple people was on the gun and that some of the DNA found on the gun matched defendant’s DNA, but he added that there was not enough of defendant’s DNA to positively identify him.', '-3- answering questions. Bodden testified on defendant’s direct examination that defendant did not hand him a gun the night of the shooting. On cross-examination, Bodden further stated that he did not have a gun with him when he arrived at the Monet Lounge that evening. The trial justice then briefly interrupted the proceeding in an effort to confirm that the witness did intend to testify. Surprised by Bodden’s statements, the prosecutor requested discovery, arguing that the state had not been provided with “any information with respect to what Mr. Bodden would testify to.” Likewise, defense counsel requested time to speak to Bodden. 3 At that point, the proceedings recessed.', 'When the matter resumed, a senior member of the Public Defender’s Office stepped in to assist in Bodden’s representation. That attorney informed the court in no uncertain terms that Bodden would indeed invoke his privilege not to testify. When Bodden returned to the stand, he did just that and he did not answer any more questions. The trial justice then excused Bodden, ruling that his testimony “will not be had in front of the jury.”', 'II', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Issue on Appeal', 'Before this Court, defendant raises but a single argument. He maintains that the trial justice erred when he ruled that Bodden properly had invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The defendant insists that Bodden, because he had answered some questions, had waived his Fifth Amendment privilege and that he should have been compelled to testify in 3', 'Oddly, prior to the voir dire examination, the defense represented that it had information that Bodden would testify, but when he actually began to do so, co-counsel for defendant claimed to be totally surprised that Bodden was answering any questions.', '-4- front of the jury. It is important to note that, although defendant has framed the issue as one of constitutional dimension, the constitutional right in question resides in Bodden, and defendant does not have standing to contest Bodden’s Fifth Amendment rights.', 'See United States Department of Labor v. Triplett, 494 U.S. 715, 720 (1990) (“Ordinarily, of course, a litigant ‘must assert his own legal rights and interests, and cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.’ * * * This is generally so even when the very same allegedly illegal act that affects the litigant also affects a third party.”); State v. Ducharme, 601 A.2d 937, 940 (R.I. 1991) (noting that the defendant did not have standing to object to a violation of a co- defendant’s Fifth Amendment rights, even though that violation may have been instrumental in producing evidence that ultimately was prejudicial to the defendant); see also United States v. Seifert, 648 F.2d 557, 560 (9th Cir. 1980) (a nonparty witness’s Fifth Amendment “privilege arises only when he asserts it as to a question put to him, and it is for the court to say whether he is entitled to the privilege”). Thus, in our opinion, the issue before the Court is not constitutional in nature, but evidentiary. Simply put, we must determine if the trial justice should have compelled Bodden’s testimony, thereby allowing it into evidence.', 'B', 'Standard of Review', '“It is well established that decisions concerning the admissibility of evidence are ‘within the sound discretion of the trial justice, and this Court will not interfere with the trial justice’s decision unless a clear abuse of that discretion is apparent.’” State v. Gaspar, 982 A.2d 140, 147 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. Mohapatra, 880 A.2d 802, 805 (R.I. 2005)). “[This] abuse-of- discretion standard includes review to determine that the discretion was not guided by erroneous legal conclusions.” Sweet v. Pace Membership Warehouse, Inc., 795 A.2d 524, 527 (R.I. 2002)', '-5- (quoting Votolato v. Merandi, 747 A.2d 455, 460 (R.I. 2000)). “The trial justice will not have abused his or her discretion as long as some grounds supporting his or her decision appear in the record.” State v. Reyes, 984 A.2d 606, 615 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. Evans, 742 A.2d 715, 719 (R.I. 1999)).', 'C', 'Analysis', 'i', 'As a threshold issue, we must first determine whether defendant’s appeal is properly before this Court. As we have said on innumerable occasions, “a litigant cannot raise an objection or advance a new theory on appeal if it was not raised before the trial court.” State v. Bido, 941 A.2d 822, 829 (R.I. 2008). Moreover, “in order to satisfy the strictures of our ‘raise- or-waive’ rule, an evidentiary objection must be ‘sufficiently focused so as to call the trial justice’s attention to the basis for said objection * * *.’” State v. Diefenderfer, 970 A.2d 12, 30 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. Warren, 624 A.2d 841, 842 (R.I. 1993)). The Rules of Evidence require that a specific ground for an objection must be stated unless the reason for the objection is clear from the context in which it was made. See Rule 103(a)(1) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. After a careful review of the record, we conclude that, despite several opportunities to do so, defendant did not articulate an objection to the trial justice’s decision regarding Bodden’s testimony.', 'After the senior public defender informed the court that Bodden would, in fact, invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege, the trial justice asked defense counsel, “Any comments you want to make?” This brief colloquy followed:', '“[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:', 'We find it extremely', 'disheartening, this chain of events.', '[Bodden’s counsel] was', '-6-', 'present this morning. I was under the impression that [Bodden’s', 'counsel] at some point had contact with Mr. Bodden. I can’t', 'honestly remember if [Bodden’s counsel] told me he spoke to him', 'this morning. I just don’t know. But evidently [Bodden’s', 'successor counsel] became – had ample time to converse with him,', 'and I believe he made it expressly clear when he took the stand', 'that he had the absolute, steadfast desire to testify. The defense', 'posed four or five questions and concluded its inquiry at that point,', 'and then the prosecution began to pose questions on cross-', 'examination.', '“We feel as though he’s still a competent, viable witness', 'that’s extremely important to the defendant’s defense, and wish to', 'call him.', '“* * *', '“THE COURT: * * *. We’re now in the position that the', 'record speaks for itself; namely, that the witness is going to invoke', 'his Fifth [Amendment privilege] with respect to him.', '“We are going to go out into the courtroom and make the', 'record clear in that regard. Anything else?', '“[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: No, Your Honor. Thank you.”', 'Bodden then resumed the stand. Defense counsel attempted to ask the witness three more questions. Bodden’s response to each question was the same; “I invoke my Fifth Amendment.” Once it became clear that Bodden would testify no further, the trial justice ruled that the witness had “effectively and properly invoked” his Fifth Amendment privilege. The trial justice then excused the witness and said that “his testimony will not be had in front of the jury, nor will he be permitted to invoke any Fifth Amendment privilege in front of a jury, as it is inappropriate to do so.” The trial justice then requested that the jury be brought into the courtroom. While all were waiting for the jury to return, another short colloquy occurred:', '“THE COURT: * * *. Do you have your other witness', 'available?', '“[PROSECUTOR]: Judge, we have another witness.', '“THE COURT: You still have the ME. We’ll do the ME.', '“[PROSECUTOR]: Judge, I believe Detective A’Vant is', 'still on the stand.', '“[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I think it’s time for Detective', 'A’Vant’s cross, Your Honor.', '-7-', '“THE COURT: I didn’t know if you wanted to interrupt', 'him for the ME.', '“[PROSECUTOR]: No, Your Honor. Thank you. I’ll', 'have her wait and begin her testimony this afternoon.', '“(Jury enters at 2:56 p.m.)', '“THE COURT: I thank you for your patience, ladies and', 'gentlemen. I can assure you that in your absence we were', 'working.', '“Detective A’Vant.', '“[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Thank you, Your Honor.”', 'The defendant did not object to the trial justice’s decision during or at the conclusion of the voir dire examination. Instead, when asked during the voir dire if he had anything else to say upon learning that Bodden would choose to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege, defense counsel said, “No, Your Honor. Thank you.” And upon conclusion of the voir dire, defense counsel again did not object, but instead continued with his cross-examination of Det. A’Vant. Defense counsel expressed disappointment with Bodden’s decision not to testify, saying it was “disheartening.” Disappointment, however, does not equate to an objection.', 'Defense counsel contends that it did object, citing State v. Baptista, 894 A.2d 911 (R.I. 2006) and Rule 103(a)(1), which says:', '“Error may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits or', 'excludes evidence unless a substantial right of the party is affected,', 'and', '“(1) Objection. In case the ruling is one admitting evidence,', 'a timely objection or motion to strike appears of record, stating the', 'specific ground of objection, if the specific ground was not', 'apparent from the context * * *.” In Baptista, 894 A.2d at 914 n.2, we held that, pursuant to Rule 103(a)(1), the defendant properly preserved his appeal of an evidentiary issue despite not stating a ground for his objection at trial. Also, in Baptista, the defendant had objected twice to the relevant testimony, and we said that the “objections in [that] case were more than sufficiently focused as to direct the trial justice’s attention to the objection’s basis.” Id.', '-8-', 'The defendant’s argument falters because, unlike Baptista, defendant in this case never actually objected either during the voir dire examination or at trial. The central principle of Rule 103(a)(1) rests on the premise that a trial justice may infer the specific grounds of an objection, even when an objecting party does not make those grounds clear. The defendant correctly asserts that the trial justice was on notice that the issue at hand during the voir dire examination was whether Bodden validly invoked his privilege against self-incrimination. Being aware of the situation, however, allows the trial justice to infer only the grounds of an objection that was actually made and does not permit a trial justice to infer an objection in and of itself. Despite expressing disappointment at the turn of events, defendant did not raise any objection to the trial justice’s ruling. Furthermore, the above analysis notwithstanding, defendant’s reliance on Rule 103(a)(1) is misplaced because the rule deals with situations in which “the ruling is one admitting evidence.” Here, however, defendant is challenging the trial justice’s decision to exclude evidence. Thus, it is our opinion that Rule 103(a)(1) is inapplicable.', 'ii', 'Even though defendant maintains that he did not waive his objection below, he nonetheless argues in the alternative that, even if he did not object at trial, this Court should adopt an exception to the raise-or-waive rule that would allow a review of the merits of the objection he now raises on appeal. To that end, defendant proposes that “[f]or capital offenses, due to the high stakes involved when an issue is not properly preserved, * * * this Court [should] adopt the” four-pronged test enunciated in United States v. Krynicki, 689 F.2d 289, 291-92 (1st Cir. 1982). 4 4', 'We recently had occasion to consider adopting the Krynicki test in State v. Florez, 138 A.3d 789, 796 n.9 (R.I. 2016), and “[w]e decline[d] to do so.” The Krynicki court noted that “‘exceptional cases or particular circumstances’ may arise where a court will review questions of', '-9-', 'As discussed above, “[t]his Court staunchly adheres to the ‘raise or waive’ rule.” State v. Figuereo, 31 A.3d 1283, 1289 (R.I. 2011). We have recognized but one exception to the raise- or-waive rule where “basic constitutional rights are concerned.” State v. Gomez, 848 A.2d 221, 237 (R.I. 2004) (quoting State v. Donato, 592 A.2d 140, 141 (R.I. 1991)). “[T]o fall within this exception, the defendant must show: (1) that the error complained of amounts to more than harmless error; (2) that a sufficient record exists to permit a determination of the issue; and (3) that ‘counsel’s failure to raise the issue [before trial] must be premised upon a novel rule of law that counsel could not reasonably have known during the trial.’” State v. Florez, 138 A.3d 789, 796 (R.I. 2016) (quoting Cronan ex rel. State v. Cronan, 774 A.2d 866, 878 (R.I. 2001)). Here, because defendant’s constitutional rights were not violated, nor was the failure to raise the issue premised on a novel rule of law, the narrow exception does not apply.', 'We remain convinced that the raise-or-waive rule is “an important guarantor of fairness and efficiency in the judicial process.” DeMarco v. Travelers Insurance Co., 26 A.3d 585, 628 n.55 (R.I. 2011). The rule should not “be dismissed as a pettifogging technicality or a trap for the indolent; the rule is founded upon important considerations of fairness, judicial economy, and practical wisdom.” National Association of Social Workers v. Harwood, 69 F.3d 622, 627 (1st Cir. 1995). The raise-or-waive rule requires that objections are to be raised at trial so that opposing counsel has “an opportunity to respond appropriately to claims raised.” State v. Burke, 522 A.2d 725, 731 (R.I. 1987). The rule has “the salutary effect of making the * * * trial on the law neither pressed nor decided below.” United States v. Krynicki, 689 F.2d 289, 291 (1st Cir. 1982) (quoting United States v. Miller, 636 F.2d 850, 853 (1st Cir. 1980)). In those exceptional cases, the court applies a four-pronged analysis in determining whether to review issues not objected to at trial: (1) the unpreserved issue must be purely legal and the record requires no further development; (2) the party’s argument is “highly persuasive”; (3) reaching the straightforward legal issue promotes judicial economy and aids the administration of the criminal justice system; and (4) declining to reach the issue “would result in a miscarriage of justice.” Id. at 291-92.', '- 10 - merits the ‘main event,’ so to speak, rather than a ‘tryout on the road’ for what will later be the determinative” appellate review. Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 90 (1977). Accordingly, we again decline the invitation to adopt Krynicki. 5', 'At trial, defendant did not properly articulate the issue he now appeals, nor does his case fit into our recognized exception to the raise-or-waive rule.', 'Therefore, we conclude that defendant’s appeal is not properly before this Court.', 'iii', 'Although we need not reach the issue because it was not raised below, we pause to note, nonetheless, that our review of the record fails to reveal any error. The defendant contends that the trial justice improperly excused Bodden as a witness based upon an erroneous conclusion that Bodden had invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege, when, to the contrary, defendant believes that the witness had waived his privilege by beginning to testify. We reiterate that the decision to exclude Bodden’s live testimony was an evidentiary ruling, and thus falls within the trial justice’s sound discretion. That said, a trial justice’s evidentiary decision is reviewed to ensure that it was not guided by any erroneous legal conclusions. If Bodden properly invoked his Fifth 5', 'In Hormel v. Helvering, 312 U.S. 552, 557 (1941), Justice Black wrote:', '“Rules of practice and procedure are devised to promote', 'the ends of justice, not to defeat them. A rigid and undeviating', 'judicially declared practice under which courts of review would', 'invariably and under all circumstances decline to consider all', 'questions which had not previously been specifically urged would', 'be out of harmony with this policy. Orderly rules of procedure do', 'not require sacrifice of the rules of fundamental justice.” When considering our own rules regarding raise-or-waive, we find that Justice Black’s words continue to ring true. We believe there is value in our “orderly rules of procedure,” and believe that the rules “promote the ends of justice.” In the present case, we see nothing that offends our sense of “fundamental justice,” and therefore decline to recognize another exception to the raise- or-waive rule at this time.', '- 11 - Amendment privilege, then the trial justice was well within the bounds of his discretion when he excluded him as a witness.', 'Even though Bodden began to testify at the voir dire examination, he subsequently invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.', 'Relying on Mitchell v. United States, 526 U.S. 314 (1999), defendant asserts that Bodden should have been compelled to continue testifying because “[i]t is well established that a witness, in a single proceeding, may not testify voluntarily about a subject and then invoke the privilege against self-incrimination when questioned about the details.” Id. at 321 (citing Rogers v. United States, 340 U.S. 367, 373 (1951)). The Mitchell Court, however, went on to instruct that the “privilege is waived for the matters to which the witness testifies, and the scope of the ‘waiver is determined by the scope of relevant cross-examination[.]’” Id. (quoting Brown v. United States, 356 U.S. 148, 154-55 (1958)). That is, the dispositive factor is whether additional questions are required to test the accuracy of what was already disclosed. Cf. 1 Kenneth S. Broun, McCormick on Evidence § 133 at 757 (7th ed. 2013) (at its foundation, the Mitchell rule “rests primarily on the need to avoid leaving a trier of fact with the limited version of relevant information that would be before it if a witness was permitted to at will pick a point at which to invoke the privilege”).', 'The court in Klein v. Harris, 667 F.2d 274 (2d Cir. 1981), articulated an alternative analysis to determine the scope of Fifth Amendment waiver. Specifically, waiver can be inferred only when:', '“(1) the witness’ prior statements have created a significant', 'likelihood that the finder of fact will be left with and prone to rely', 'on a distorted view of the truth, and (2) the witness had reason to', 'know that his prior statements would be interpreted as a waiver of', 'the [F]ifth [A]mendment’s privilege against self-incrimination.”', 'Id. at 287.', '- 12 -', 'Although Bodden answered six questions on direct examination (one of which was stating his name), the trial justice determined that “[t]here was no opportunity whatsoever” for the state to cross-examine him. The trial justice reasoned that “the State was never permitted to confront the witness with the statement that’s been admitted into evidence, ‘It’s me. It’s all me. It’s mine.’ There’s no question that that would’ve been a crucial area of confrontation in cross- examination, not to mention all the other evidence that has been admitted.” Accordingly, in the absence of any relevant cross-examination, the trial justice did not err when he ruled that Bodden properly invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege during the voir dire examination. Furthermore, because Bodden’s limited testimony occurred during a voir dire examination, there is no risk that the finder of fact—in this case, the jury—could have been left to rely on a “distorted view of the truth.”', 'III', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

After hearing the arguments of counsel and reviewing the memoranda submitted on behalf of the parties, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown. Accordingly, we shall decide the appeal at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On November 15, 1994, Sweet executed a promissory note to Boucher in the amount of $80,000, secured by a mortgage on real estate at 54 New London Avenue, West Warwick, Rhode Island. Sweet later defaulted on the note and Boucher commenced foreclosure proceedings on the real estate.', '-1-', 'Boucher advertised notice of the public sale in the Kent County Daily Times. The sale’s terms required payment of an $8,000 deposit at the time of sale, payment of the balance within thirty days after the sale, and an agreement encompassing the terms of sale (sale agreement) to be signed by the successful bidder. Additionally, pursuant to the sale’s terms, the property’s sale was “subject to all taxes, assessments, mortgages, any prior encumbrances and other encumbrances * * *.” The foreclosure sale was held at a public auction on January 7, 1997.

In his motion, Boucher argued that no issue of material fact existed because Sweet acknowledged that he executed and delivered the note to Boucher, he defaulted on the note, and he still owed Boucher the amount claimed.', 'On September 30, 1999, a justice of the Kent County Superior Court granted Boucher’s motion for summary judgment in the amount of $55,532.16, plus interest, attorney’s fees, and costs. 1 Sweet subsequently moved to vacate the judgment, arguing that he never received Boucher’s motion, supporting memorandum, or notice of the hearing on the motion. In August 2000, a hearing justice denied Sweet’s motion to vacate the judgment.', 'Ultimately, after further motion by Sweet, a second justice agreed to vacate the summary judgment and rehear Boucher’s motion. In opposition, Sweet maintained that the disparity between the property’s fair market value of $90,000 and the foreclosure sale price of $35,000 1', 'Sweet was not present at the hearing on the motion.', '-2- was a factor in determining if an impropriety existed in the foreclosure sale. 2 Sweet also argued that Boucher’s violations of the terms of sale—namely, his failure to pay the $8,000 deposit and sign the sale agreement—were improprieties in the sale. He further contended that Boucher’s attempt to collect the unpaid real estate taxes, sewer taxes, and sewer fees violated the terms of sale because the property was sold “subject to all taxes.”', 'The hearing justice issued a bench decision, again granting Boucher’s motion for summary judgment.', 'She found that Boucher’s failure to pay the $8,000 deposit and sign the sale agreement were not “the type of defect[s] in the advertising, in the conducting of this foreclosure sale, that would amount to fraud or collusion.” The hearing justice found the disparity between the appraisal values and the foreclosure sale price insufficient to show an improper or fraudulent sale. Although “[i]nadequacy of price may be considered a factor in determining whether the foreclosure sale was proper,” Sweet did not offer any evidence that the manner in which the sale was advertised was deficient or that Boucher fraudulently conducted the sale. The hearing justice did find, however, that the property’s low purchase price included the property’s unpaid taxes, sewer fees, and sewer taxes. Thus, she excluded those taxes from the judgment. Accordingly, on June 7, 2001, the hearing justice granted Boucher’s motion for summary judgment in the amount of $48,155.35, plus interest and attorney’s fees, totaling $3,237.', 'On June 18, 2001, Sweet appealed. Action on this appeal was stayed since January 2002 due to several ongoing bankruptcy proceedings that Sweet initiated. In October 2015, Sweet notified Boucher that the bankruptcy proceedings were discharged or dismissed, and the parties proceeded with this appeal. 2', 'At the hearing, the parties stipulated that the property’s fair market value at the time of the foreclosure sale was $90,000.', '-3-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', ""“This Court reviews a trial justice's decision to grant summary judgment de novo.” Hyde v. Roman Catholic Bishop of Providence, 139 A.3d 452, 460 (R.I. 2016). “We will affirm a [trial] court's decision only if, after reviewing the admissible evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, we conclude that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Newstone Development, LLC v. East Pacific, LLC, 140 A.3d 100, 103 (R.I. 2016) (quoting Daniels v. Fluette, 64 A.3d 302, 304 (R.I. 2013)). “The nonmoving party bears the burden of showing the existence of disputed issues of material fact by competent evidence; it cannot rest on allegations or denials in the pleadings or on conclusions or legal opinions.” Danforth v. More, 129 A.3d 63, 68 (R.I. 2016) (quoting Takian v. Rafaelian, 53 A.3d 964, 971 (R.I. 2012))."", 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, Sweet argues that the hearing justice erred by not considering Boucher’s failure to adhere to the terms of sale. When the notice and advertisement requirements for a foreclosure have been complied with, the mortgagor must “produce evidence of collusion or other improprieties in connection with the advertisement or conduct of the sale that would have improperly deflated the foreclosure price.” DeLuca v. Klegraefe, 706 A.2d 1351, 1352 (R.I. 1998) (Mem.). Although Sweet acknowledged that an inadequate price alone is insufficient to void the foreclosure, he contended that the aforementioned failures rendered the sale “an improperly advertised and improperly conducted mortgagee’s sale.” Such improprieties, Sweet', '-4- maintained, would allow the court to consider the discrepancy between the price that Boucher paid for the property and its stipulated fair market value at the time of the foreclosure sale.', 'While Sweet cites Galvin v. Newton, 19 R.I. 176, 36 A. 3 (1895), to support his argument that proof of actual fraud is not required to challenge the propriety of a foreclosure sale, the improprieties present in Galvin are clearly distinguishable from the minor deficiencies alleged here. In Galvin, the defendant, the treasurer of the mortgagee-bank, purchased the mortgaged property at a public auction. Id. at 177, 36 A. at 4. The plaintiff-mortgagor alleged that the defendant conducted the sale before an executor was appointed for the deceased mortgagor’s estate, in an attempt to extinguish the latter’s interest in the property. Id. at 177, 179, 36 A. at 4. There was also an allegation that the defendant colluded with another mortgagor who held an interest in the property. Id. at 179, 36 A. at 4. At the sale, the defendant was the only bidder and paid a grossly inadequate price. Id. This Court acknowledged that the inadequate price alone was not enough to impeach the mortgage sale; however, it could be considered alongside the other allegations. Id.', 'We agree with the hearing justice’s finding that the alleged improprieties are not “the type of defect[s] in the advertising, in the conducting of this foreclosure sale, that would amount to fraud or collusion.” Sweet has not raised the sort of allegations present in Galvin. Boucher’s failure to deposit the $8,000 upon sale, pay the balance within thirty days, and sign the sale agreement do not “support an inference that the mortgagee[] had overreached the mortgagor * * *.” Woolley v. Tougas, 61 R.I. 434, 439, 1 A.2d 92, 94 (1938). This is not a case where “[t]he whole transaction, from the advertisement to the delivery of the deed, is so convincing of collusion and unfair dealing on the part of the owners of the property, [the mortgagee], and the', '-5- purchaser, as to render a consideration of questions of law needless.” Nichols v. Flagg, 24 R.I. 30, 32, 51 A. 1039, 1040 (1902).', 'Since “it was incumbent upon [the defendant] * * * to produce evidence demonstrating the impropriety of the foreclosure sale,” DeLuca, 706 A.2d at 1352, and Sweet has not set forth such evidence, we conclude that the hearing justice properly granted summary judgment.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

95,State : v. : Elton G. Edwards. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court.', 'The defendant, Elton G. Edwards (defendant or Edwards), appeals a five-count criminal conviction obtained after a jury-waived trial. This matter came before the Supreme Court on September 28, 2016, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised should not be summarily decided. After considering the arguments set forth in the parties’ memoranda and at oral argument, we are convinced that cause has not been shown. Thus, further argument or briefing is not required to decide this matter. For the reasons outlined below, the Superior Court’s judgment is affirmed.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'This appeal arises from a traffic stop on the evening of August 22, 2008.', 'Two Providence police officers, Lt. (then Sgt.) Richard Fernandes and Officer John Reposa, 1 who were in the same police cruiser, stopped defendant at the intersection of Harold and Valley Streets in Providence.', 'Beyond the stop itself, the parties present largely diverging factual 1', 'Now deceased due to an unrelated incident, Officer Reposa did not testify during trial.', '-1- scenarios. As a result of the incident, on October 31, 2008, the state filed a five-count criminal information against defendant, charging him with felony assault on a police officer (count 1); simple assault on a police officer (count 2); resisting arrest (count 3); driving under the influence of alcohol (count 4); and obstructing a police officer (count 5). The defendant waived his jury- trial right. After a two-day bench trial, Edwards was convicted on all counts.', 'At trial, Lt. Fernandes testified that, at approximately 7:30 p.m. on August 22, 2008, while driving east on Valley Street in his police cruiser, he observed defendant’s vehicle in the opposite lane traveling west. He also testified that defendant passed at least one other car and crossed the street’s double yellow line, nearly striking the police cruiser. Lieutenant Fernandes turned around, activated his emergency lights and sirens, and stopped the vehicle. Lieutenant Fernandes exited the police cruiser and approached the driver’s side of defendant’s vehicle. Simultaneously, Officer Reposa approached the passenger’s side. The defendant occupied the driver’s seat; his girlfriend, Ms. Danika Rollins, sat in the front passenger seat; and Danika Rollins’s aunt, Ms. Carol Rollins, occupied a back seat. 2', 'Standing at the driver’s side, Lt. Fernandes requested defendant’s license, registration, and proof of insurance. Lieutenant Fernandes testified that an “extremely agitated” defendant responded, “F**k you. What are you stopping me for?” Further, he testified that Edwards told him to go f**k himself when he again asked for documentation. According to Lt. Fernandes, defendant slammed his arms against the vehicle’s dashboard.', 'He suspected Edwards was intoxicated as he smelled alcohol on his breath, observed bloodshot, watery eyes, and empty beer bottles throughout the vehicle. Despite Edwards’s behavior, Lt. Fernandes recalled remaining calm, asking Edwards to exit his vehicle. 2', 'The Court intends no disrespect, but to avoid confusion we will refer to Ms. Danika Rollins and Ms. Carol Rollins as Danika and Carol, respectively.', '-2-', 'Lieutenant Fernandes stated that, although he could not recall whether he or Edwards opened the door, defendant removed his seat belt. According to Lt. Fernandes, upon exiting the vehicle, defendant instantly lunged at him. When Officer Reposa came around the car to assist Lt. Fernandes, defendant bit Officer Reposa’s left middle finger. The officers struggled to bring defendant to the ground, attempting to secure him on his stomach and in handcuffs. Defying handcuffs, defendant hit his head on the pavement.', 'The defendant and Officer Reposa exchanged punches, and Lt. Fernandes recalled defendant biting Officer Reposa’s face underneath his left eye. The defendant resisted Officer Reposa’s verbal commands to lie on his stomach.', 'Eventually, the officers pinned defendant down on his stomach, and both officers held him down. While Officer Reposa attempted to handcuff Edwards, defendant again bit him, this time on his forearm. The defendant continued to resist handcuffs, prompting Lt. Fernandes to spray Edwards in the face with “one short [pepper spray] blast.” He further recalled that Officer Reposa retrieved his collapsible baton and struck Edwards’s head several times. By this point, Danika and Carol exited the vehicle. Carol tried to pull both officers away from defendant. Danika yelled, but did not physically intervene.', 'Lieutenant Fernandes further testified that he eventually took Edwards into custody and placed him in the police cruiser until rescue arrived for hospital transport. The officers also arrested Carol.', 'The rescue then transported defendant to Roger Williams Hospital, where Officer Reposa was also treated. Lieutenant Fernandes testified that he left the scene, reported to the police station, and contacted a certified Breathalyzer operator. At the police station, Lt. Fernandes completed his statement and, per protocol, filled out a use-of-force form. During trial, Lt. Fernandes testified to Officer Reposa’s injuries, confirming a scrape on his elbow, and bite', '-3- marks below his left eye, on his middle finger, and on his forearm. Lieutenant Fernandes also noted that defendant bled from both his mouth and head.', 'Next, the state called Officer Michael Troia, a Providence Police Traffic Bureau officer trained in DUI enforcement. Officer Troia testified that at around 7:45 p.m. Lt. Fernandes called him to respond to Roger Williams Hospital because the police suspected that Edwards was intoxicated. Upon his arrival, Officer Troia noted that defendant displayed bloodshot, watery eyes, and he smelled of alcohol.', 'The emergency-room nurse drew two blood vials from defendant. From the hospital, he met with a Bureau of Criminal Identification detective at the police station who secured the blood in a refrigerator. The following Monday, Officer Troia transported the blood to the Department of Health forensic lab. About two weeks later, Officer Troia received the blood test results, which he mailed to defendant’s address.', 'The state then called Ms. Jennifer Finch, the Principal Forensic Scientist in the Department of Health’s Toxicology Laboratory.', 'Ms. Finch testified that she conducted Edwards’s blood tests, which revealed an ethanol presence and a blood alcohol level of ninety- seven milligrams per deciliter (translating to a gram percent of .097 milligrams per 100 cubic centimeters of blood).', 'The defendant first called Danika Rollins, his girlfriend of eight years and the mother of his two children. She testified that, on the night of August 22, 2008, she rode in defendant’s front passenger seat. She recalled traveling home with defendant and her aunt, Carol Rollins, after spending about an hour at a cookout. Danika said that defendant and Carol each had “a beer or two.” She testified that she sat close to defendant and watched “everything that was going on.” She could not recall the cookout’s precise location but thought it was in Johnston.', '-4-', 'Danika testified that Edwards passed another car while he drove down Valley Street. She noted that the police vehicle, traveling opposite them, turned around. Using his loudspeaker, an officer requested that defendant pull over, and defendant complied. Danika testified that a police officer approached the driver’s side of defendant’s vehicle and asked for defendant’s registration. She recalled that Edwards asked why he was stopped; she also stated that Edwards reached into his glove compartment to retrieve his registration when “the cop swore at him.” Specifically, she recalled that Lt. Fernandes asked, “Where is your f**king registration?” Danika stated that the first officer pulled Edwards from the vehicle to the ground and proceeded to beat him. She also testified that Officer Reposa came around the car “out of nowhere” and joined in beating defendant.', 'In her testimony, Danika said that Lt. Fernandes asked only for defendant’s registration— not his license. She recalled that the officer beat defendant with a “black stick.” While Edwards tried to block his face from the force, she and Carol approached, but she said that they retreated to avoid being pepper sprayed. Danika further recalled that, in addition to using a baton, one officer punched Edwards. Additional officers came to the scene, arrested defendant and Carol, and brought defendant to the hospital. She also testified that one officer told her to “get the f**k from over there,” and called her a “n***er.”', 'During cross-examination, Danika testified that Edwards passed the vehicle in front of him on the right. When asked how defendant almost hit the officer’s vehicle if he passed on the right, she testified that at no point did Edwards pass a car on the left side.', 'Danika offered diverging statements regarding who removed defendant from the vehicle. At trial, she testified that the first officer, Lt. Fernandes, pulled Edwards out. In a prior statement given to the police, however, she said that the second officer, Officer Reposa, pulled defendant', '-5- from the vehicle. Danika then answered affirmatively to the question of whether one of the officers just started beating defendant.', 'Again pivoting away from her original testimony, Danika testified that rather than the officer swearing immediately, he first asked, “Where is your registration?” Danika also testified that a police officer (she could not recall which officer) arrested her aunt, Carol. She testified that the officers claimed that her aunt jumped on their backs, but she insisted that Carol minded her own business and merely stated, “Oh, you guys aren’t supposed to do that.”', 'Finally, defendant testified. He said that he left the cookout early because he and Danika needed to get home to care for their infant. The defendant testified that he had one or two beers at the party. He stated that the party was in Lincoln, Rhode Island.', 'According to defendant, he sped a bit on his drive home because he was agitated that Danika made him leave the cookout. On his way home, he noticed a set of traffic lights ahead, where a car was taking a right-hand turn. He went around the car, “and in front of [him] there was a police car.” On cross-examination, defendant clarified that, as the car in front of him approached the turn, he “swerved past it,” but he claimed that he neither entered another lane to pass the car nor nearly struck the police car. Traveling a short distance from the light, he noticed a police vehicle behind him. Initially, he thought that the police were after someone else, and he stopped with the impression that they would pass.', 'However, when the officer used his loudspeaker, Edwards stopped his vehicle.', 'Edwards testified that the police officer approached his car and requested his registration, which he claimed that he handed to the officer. He also recalled that the officer told him his breath smelled of alcohol; Edwards told the officer he was coming from a cookout, where he drank a “little bit.” Edwards said that he asked why he was pulled over, which prompted the', '-6- officer to say, “Give me your f**king registration.” He replied, “You don’t have to swear at me.” Then, Edwards testified that the officer told him to exit the vehicle.', 'According to defendant, while he was unbuckling his seat belt, the officer opened the car door, grabbed him, and threw him to the ground.', 'Contrary to Lt. Fernandes’s testimony, defendant stated: “I was face down while he was beating me, telling me [to] put my hands on my back, and I couldn’t do it. And the only thing I could do is put my hands on my forehead so I wouldn’t get a severe injury after that.” The defendant said that the police officer struck his head with his baton several times, causing multiple cuts. He testified that one of the officers stated, “Put your f**king hands on your back” and “Put your f**king hands on your back, you monkey. Where are you from? You’re going to go back there today.” Further, he testified that one of the officer’s knees was on his back, while the officer punched his face, which gave him a black eye and knocked his tooth out. The defendant could not recall how many officers beat him up “[d]ue to the blood and the severity of hitting [him, he] couldn’t remember anything at that moment.”', 'The defendant denied biting Officer Reposa anywhere on his body. To support this claim, he asserted that, based on the size of his teeth, his bite would have taken off the officer’s flesh. He testified that, because he was removed from the car and brought to the ground, he “didn’t have a chance to do anything.” He could not recall how long the officers beat him.', 'The defendant also claimed that he never struck any police officer that evening. He asserted that he respects police officers, citing a $50 donation he made to a police department en route to the cookout. He claimed that he gave the police money because they do a “very good job.”', '-7-', 'During cross-examination, defendant stated that he thought he was pulled over because of his cracked car windshield. He also stated that the police pepper sprayed him several times while he was on the ground. He testified that he believed Lt. Fernandes made the “monkey” comments, stating he should go back to the “forest [he] came from.” Further, defendant, in his brief, claimed that the officers engaged in creative story telling at trial to conceal their excessive force.', 'The defendant testified that he was handcuffed, placed in the back of the police cruiser, and moved to the ambulance when it arrived. He stated that he did not consume any alcohol from the time the officers removed him from the vehicle until he was at the hospital. He did not deny, but could not recall, that Lt. Fernandes visited him in the rescue vehicle and read him his rights, claiming his severe beating impaired his concentration.', 'When asked whether he remembered getting to the hospital, Edwards said that he remembered a doctor or nurse requesting that he sign a paper, but he cited pain in his hand that prevented his signature. While he also recalled a nurse drawing blood, he insisted “[t]here was no officer at the hospital.” When asked whether Officer Troia retrieved his blood sample from the hospital, he repeated twice, “Everything was premeditated.” He could not recall the nurse’s gender, nor could he recall what was done to his blood after it was drawn.', 'At the close of the bench trial, the trial justice found defendant guilty on all counts. He sentenced defendant on February 3, 2015. For count 1, the trial justice sentenced Edwards to two years at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI), with six months to serve and eighteen months suspended with probation. As to each other count, defendant received an additional year at the ACI, suspended with probation, to be served concurrently. Additionally, the trial justice', '-8- ordered Edwards to complete an anger-management course. The trial justice then stayed the sentence’s execution, and defendant appealed.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', ""“Recognizing that credibility assessments are inherently the function of the trial court and not the appellate court,” this Court affords great deference to a trial justice’s credibility determinations when sitting without a jury. State v. Van Dongen, 132 A.3d 1070, 1076 (R.I. 2016). “[We] will not disturb the trial justice's findings unless they are clearly wrong or the trial justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence on a controlling issue.” Id. (quoting State v. Adewumi, 966 A.2d 1217, 1222 (R.I. 2009)). “When ‘the record indicates that competent evidence supports the trial justice’s findings, we shall not substitute our view of the evidence for his [or hers] even though a contrary conclusion could have been reached.’” Id. (quoting South County Post & Beam, Inc. v. McMahon, 116 A.3d 204, 210 (R.I. 2015))."", 'III', 'Discussion', 'The dispute here arises from two largely diverging recollections surrounding a traffic stop. Careful scrutiny of the record demonstrates that the trial justice’s findings rested on his thorough review of the evidence and his firsthand impression of the witnesses. Even if we can imagine a well-reasoned yet contrary conclusion, it is not the province of this Court to reject or replace the trial justice’s findings when justified by sufficient evidence.', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice misconceived and overlooked material evidence and “was otherwise clearly wrong in his decisions.” Because the testimony each side presented diverges significantly, the trial justice’s guilt assessment turned on his impression of', '-9- witness credibility.', 'Rather than misconceive or overlook evidence, the trial justice duly considered—and rejected—certain testimony, while he considered—and accepted—other evidence.', '“It is well-established that we ‘accord a great deal of respect to the factual determinations and credibility assessments made by the judicial officer who has actually observed the human drama that is part and parcel of every trial and who has had an opportunity to appraise witness demeanor and to take into account other realities that cannot be grasped from a reading of a cold record.’” Van Dongen, 132 A.3d at 1076 (quoting State v. Erminelli, 991 A.2d 1064, 1069 (R.I. 2010)).', 'For example, in accepting Lt. Fernandes’s testimony, the trial justice noted: “[H]e was calm. He did not appear to be arrogant or contemptuous. He was not evasive, especially when he couldn’t remember who opened the door. He was not argumentative, and he answered the prosecutor’s questions directly.” He further observed: “Lieutenant Fernandes did not add or embellish his testimony. His tone and his voice were always civil. Lieutenant Fernandes * * * presented at least a plausible version of events.”', 'In contrast, in recalling the defense witnesses’ testimony, the trial justice noted, “[Danika’s and defendant’s] version of the events, while not identical, differed a little bit, but I am aware that Danika had at least a couple of versions of her story * * * .” She offered conflicting statements regarding whether Officer Reposa or Lt. Fernandes removed defendant from his vehicle. With respect to how Danika reacted when confronted with an inconsistent statement, the trial justice said that he “watched as the witness became increasingly * * * less responsive.” The trial justice further noted that defendant’s testimony that he did not bite Officer Reposa anywhere on his body was “at odds” with photographs, medical records, and Lt. Fernandes’s testimony.', 'Finally, he found defendant’s .097 percent blood alcohol level', '- 10 - inconsistent with defendant consuming “one or two beers.” After an examination of all of the evidence, the trial justice rejected the testimony of defendant and Danika.', 'Importantly, the trial justice’s rejection of defendant’s and Danika’s testimony following a thorough review of the evidence is not akin to misconception or oversight. Rather than point to specific evidence which the trial justice overlooked, defendant takes issue with the trial justice’s interpretation of the evidence before him. The defendant asserts: “Common sense and a careful examination of Mr. Edwards’ [sic] and Ms. Rollins’ [sic] activities before the traffic stop indicate a far more likely version of events: namely, that Detective Fernandes’ [sic] took umbrage at Mr. Edwards demanding to know why he had been stopped, that the detective then became upset, that either he or Officer Reposa then pulled Mr. Edwards from the car and assaulted Mr. Edwards, causing serious injury to Mr. Edwards by striking him on the head with a police asp.” However, defendant mischaracterizes the standard by which we review this case. Rather than scrutinize the record below through the lens of whether “a far more likely version of events” emerges, we are obligated to affirm the trial justice’s findings if grounded in competent evidence. See Van Dongen, 132 A.3d at 1076.', 'The defendant cites precedent to remind this Court that we must “not simply * * * rubber-stamp the trial justice’s findings of fact; rather, our role is ‘to review the record carefully to see if it in fact contains sufficient evidence to support the trial justice’s conclusion.’” State v. Forand, 958 A.2d 134, 138 (R.I. 2008) (quoting State v. Harris, 871 A.2d 341, 346 (R.I. 2005)). Careful scrutiny of the record demonstrates a well-reasoned decision supported by sufficient evidence; indeed, no rubber-stamp is necessary.', 'More specifically, in count 1, the trial justice found defendant guilty of felony assault of a police officer (G.L. 1956 § 11-5-5), relying on Lt. Fernandes’s testimony. Lieutenant Fernandes', '- 11 - testified that when he asked for a license, registration, and proof of insurance, defendant swore at him. He found that defendant then removed his seat belt, exited the vehicle, and jumped on top of Lt. Fernandes. When Officer Reposa walked around the car, a scuffle occurred, leading defendant to eventually bite Officer Reposa in three different areas. The trial justice reviewed hospital records and photographs evidencing these bite marks, which he referred to as showing “unquestionable” injury.', 'Similarly, the trial justice’s guilt finding for simple assault or battery (§ 11-5-3), count 2, rested on sufficient competent and credible evidence.', 'Here, he accepted Lt. Fernandes’s testimony that defendant jumped out of his car and on top of him, which suffices to satisfy the element of an offensive touching upon another’s body.', 'Further, sufficient evidence supported the trial justice’s finding that defendant resisted arrest (G.L. 1956 § 12-7-10). In finding defendant guilty, the trial justice recalled evidence from Lt. Fernandes’s testimony that a scuffle occurred when the officers attempted to handcuff defendant. Lieutenant Fernandes testified at length regarding his and Officer Reposa’s attempt to get defendant on his stomach to complete the arrest, where he actively combatted the officer’s efforts. This evidence fulfills the elements of resisting arrest.', 'The trial justice also grounded his guilt finding for driving under the influence of alcohol (G.L. 1956 § 31-27-2) on sufficient, competent evidence.', 'First, the trial justice recalled defendant’s and Danika’s testimony that, when stopped, they were traveling from a party where defendant drank alcohol. Lieutenant Fernandes spotted defendant driving on Valley Street, a public street in Rhode Island.', 'Lieutenant Fernandes testified that he smelled alcohol on defendant’s breath, and observed bloodshot eyes and slurred speech. Also, the trial justice considered evidence that the rescue transported defendant to Roger Williams Hospital, where', '- 12 - blood was drawn. The blood alcohol test revealed an alcohol content of .097 grams per deciliters (.097 percent), which exceeded the .08 percent minimum statutory amount. This evidence sufficed to justify the trial justice’s guilt finding for driving under the influence beyond a reasonable doubt.', 'Finally, the evidence in this case adequately supports the trial justice’s finding that defendant obstructed officers in executing their duty (G.L. 1956 § 11-32-1).', 'Lieutenant Fernandes testified that defendant defied the officers’ authority and used every effort to avoid handcuffs. Lieutenant Fernandes testified that Officer Reposa came to his assistance and as a result of defendant’s actions, a scuffle occurred where punches were thrown and force was exchanged.', 'Accordingly, a thorough review of the record reveals that sufficient credible and competent evidence supports the trial justice’s guilt determinations on all counts beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial justice did not overlook or misconceive any material evidence in reaching his decision.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the aforementioned reasons, the Superior Court’s judgment is affirmed.

For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the decree of the Family Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'The plight of Briann and Bri’Nayshia first came to the attention of the Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) on August 23, 2012, when DCYF was called to the home 1', 'For the sake of privacy, the family members will be referred to by only their first names. 2', 'The appeals in respect to respondent’s parental rights of Briann and Bri’Nayshia were consolidated for oral argument by order of this Court entered on August 18, 2016.', '-1- of Briann and Bri’Nayshia’s mother in response to an incident that led to the mother’s arrest. DCYF removed Briann and Bri’Nayshia from the home, placed them on a forty-eight-hour hold, and filed ex parte neglect petitions in the Family Court seeking to remove the children from the care of the mother and respondent-father. During this time, the whereabouts of respondent were unknown.', 'A decree was entered by the Family Court on January 17, 2013, finding Briann and Bri’Nayshia to be neglected and committing them to the care, custody, and control of DCYF. On October 27, 2014, DCYF filed petitions in the Family Court seeking to terminate the parental rights of respondent with respect to both Briann and Bri’Nayshia.3 With respect to respondent, DCYF alleged the following grounds for termination: that the children had been placed in DCYF’s custody or care for at least twelve months; that respondent was “offered or received services to correct the situation which led to the [children] being placed”; and that there was not “a substantial probability that the [children would] be able to return safely to [respondent’s] care within a reasonable period of time considering the [children’s] age[s] and [their] need for a permanent home.” G.L. 1956 § 15-7-7(a)(3).4 The respondent contested the petitions and proceeded to trial. 3', 'DCYF filed corresponding petitions in the Family Court seeking to terminate the parental rights of Briann and Bri’Nayshia’s mother. The mother voluntarily consented to the termination of her parental rights and agreed to the open adoption of each child. 4', 'General Laws 1956 § 15-7-7(a)(3) sets forth in pertinent part:', '“(a) The court shall * * * terminate any and all legal rights', 'of the parent to the child * * * if the court finds as a fact by clear', 'and convincing evidence that:', '“***', '“(3) The child has been placed in the legal custody or care', 'of the department for children, youth, and families for at least', '-2-', 'Trial proceedings were held in Family Court on March 16-18 and April 1, 2015. The Family Court justice heard testimony from several witnesses, including Jen Shymanik (Shymanik), a social worker from DCYF, who was assigned to respondent’s case on February 1, 2013.', 'At that time, Shymanik contacted respondent and thus began what can only be characterized as difficult and unsuccessful case planning for a recalcitrant father with mental- health issues.', 'The record discloses that eight case plans had been developed, four for each child. Those case plans included the attainable goals of: obtaining employment, obtaining appropriate housing, gaining financial stability, attending to the girls’ mental-health and developmental needs, and working on parenting through visitation, empathy, and bonding. Shymanik also referred respondent to a psychologist for a parent-child evaluation; however, respondent refused to attend. It was only after Shymanik stressed the importance of the evaluation that in July 2013, respondent agreed to cooperate. The evaluation centered on respondent’s lack of parenting skills and his own mental-health issues. Although the evaluation included a referral for respondent to attend the Families Together program at the Providence Children’s Museum, respondent was ineligible based on his failure to consistently attend his biweekly visits with Briann and Bri’Nayshia. Visitation was problematic throughout case planning efforts. The respondent canceled many scheduled visits with his daughters, asserting that he was ill, he had to work, or that the weather was inclement.', 'twelve (12) months, and the parents were offered or received', 'services to correct the situation which led to the child being placed;', 'provided, that there is not a substantial probability that the child', 'will be able to return safely to the parents’ care within a reasonable', 'period of time considering the child’s age and the need for a', 'permanent home[.]”', '-3-', 'Shymanik estimated that, during her involvement with respondent, he was offered visitation twice a month but that he attended only one visit per month. Shymanik testified that during these visits the girls were “[r]eally affectionate with one another” but there “seemed to be very little bond between [respondent] and the girls. * * * [T]hey weren’t very responsive to him.” Shymanik credited respondent for asking questions about Briann and Bri’Nayshia’s day and stressing the importance of education, but she noted that, in some ways, respondent “showed very limited capacity to parent.” For instance, after Shymanik informed respondent that a nephrologist had diagnosed Briann with hypertension and recommended that she not consume high-fat, sugary, or fried foods, respondent brought fried chicken and french fries for her to eat. Although Shymanik provided respondent with feedback and suggestions for improvement, respondent “consistently ignored” her and on several occasions “became sort of argumentative.”', 'Shymanik testified that, on one occasion, respondent became confrontational when he arrived for a visit and was informed that Briann would be approximately half an hour late because she was attending a friend’s birthday party. Shymanik recalled, “[respondent] * * * had a verbal argument with the clinician and just walked out of the visit.” Thereafter, respondent “refused” to participate in the Families Together program, but visitations continued. Shymanik observed an increase in Bri’Nayshia’s behavioral issues; and, when she brought the problem to respondent’s attention, he “blame[d] [Shymanik] and the foster parents for the way the children behaved.” When Shymanik explained to respondent that he should be more protective of the children because of their developmental and mental-health needs, he replied that the children “didn’t have any service needs at all” and that their behavior arose from lenient parenting by the foster parents. Shymanik informed respondent that his daughters had been diagnosed with communication, behavioral, and medical needs and that Briann and Bri’Nayshia had been', '-4- referred to early-intervention services and enhanced outpatient services. These services were delayed, however, because respondent flatly refused to sign the necessary release forms; requiring DCYF to seek the Family Court’s permission for Briann and Bri’Nayshia to receive these overdue services.', 'In December 2013, Shymanik referred respondent to the Newport County Mental Health Services for a psychiatric evaluation. During the evaluation, respondent took no responsibility for any missed visits and informed the evaluator that he was “doing everything he could” but that DCYF “didn’t want * * * him to have his kids.”', 'With regard to future planning for Briann and Bri’Nayshia, respondent was informed that he needed to ensure that the children would not be exposed to unsafe living conditions. Although respondent admitted his residence “wasn’t an appropriate place” for Briann and Bri’Nayshia, he made no effort to obtain suitable housing.', 'Shymanik testified that, while respondent met certain goals in the case plans such as obtaining employment, his mental-health issues, especially his “combative approach” to disciplining, were continuous concerns.', 'In addition to being concerned about his mental-health, Shymanik testified to her repeated concerns that respondent’s future planning for Briann and Bri’Nayshia included his stated intention to “hand the children over to his sister for her to parent them.”', 'In June 2014, Shymanik and her supervisor met with respondent to discuss the remaining services that were prerequisites to reunification with Briann and Bri’Nayshia. The services included parenting services and consecutive attendance at Briann and Bri’Nayshia’s medical appointments. Shymanik explained to respondent that, if the services were not completed, DCYF would file a petition to terminate his parental rights. The respondent replied, “do what you have to do.”', '-5-', 'Meanwhile, Briann and Bri’Nayshia’s foster families were “very attentive” to their needs. Shymanik reported that Briann was “very connected” to her foster mother and called her “mommy.” Likewise, Bri’Nayshia referred to her foster parents as “mommy” and “daddy.” Bri’Nayshia “hugs them, kisses them, [and] lays her head on their shoulder.” Both foster families expressed a desire to adopt the children.', 'At the conclusion of Shymanik’s testimony, three additional witnesses with personal knowledge of respondent’s character testified about their numerous concerns regarding respondent’s ability to parent. For example, Kimberly Rodrigues (Rodrigues), a former family clinician at Families Together, testified that, in her opinion, reunification “was a risk” for these children. Rodrigues recounted the visitation at which respondent became angry when he was informed that Briann would be approximately half an hour late because she was attending a friend’s birthday party. Rodrigues testified that respondent blamed Shymanik for Briann’s tardiness and stated: “I come from a street background, [and] this makes me want to take matters into my own hands. It wouldn’t turn out good for some people. When I’m provoked, I can be the nastiest person on this earth, and [Shymanik] crossed the line.”', 'On April 24, 2015, the Family Court justice issued a written decision granting the petition to terminate respondent’s parental rights in accordance with §§ 15-7-7(a)(2)(vii) and 15-7- 7(a)(3). In her decision, the Family Court justice found by clear and convincing evidence that respondent was an unfit parent because he was, inter alia, “hostile, argumentative, agitated and even threatened physical harm when he did not ‘get his way,’” and that he “failed to address his parenting issues.” In addition, the Family Court justice found that DCYF had fulfilled its obligation to make reasonable efforts to reunify respondent with his daughters in accordance with § 15-7-7(b)(1), but that respondent’s efforts at reunification were “marginal at best.” She', '-6- concluded that the evidence “overwhelmingly prove[d]” that respondent failed to cooperate with the numerous case plans and services offered by DCYF and that it would be in the best interests of Briann and Bri’Nayshia that they be adopted by their foster parents. A decree was entered on May 4, 2015, from which respondent has appealed to this Court.5', 'Standard of Review', '“On appeal, ‘[t]his Court reviews termination of parental rights rulings by examining the record to establish whether the [Family Court] justice’s findings are supported by legal and competent evidence.’” In re Amiah P., 54 A.3d 446, 451 (R.I. 2012) (quoting In re Victoria L., 950 A.2d 1168, 1174 (R.I. 2008)). “These findings are entitled to great weight, and this Court will not disturb them unless they ‘are clearly wrong or the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence.’” Id. (quoting In re Victoria L., 950 A.2d at 1174).', '“Natural parents have a fundamental liberty interest in the ‘care, custody, and management’ of their children.” In re Amiah P., 54 A.3d at 451 (quoting In re Destiny D., 922 A.2d 168, 172 (R.I. 2007)). “Before terminating a parent’s rights to his or her child, the trial justice must find that the parent is unfit.” Id. (citing In re Pricillion R., 971 A.2d 599, 604 (R.I. 2009)). “In these cases, the right to due process requires that the state support its allegations by clear and convincing evidence.” Id. (citing In re Jazlyn P., 31 A.3d 1273, 1279 (R.I. 2011)). “However, once the trial justice determines parental unfitness, ‘the best interests of the child outweigh all other considerations.’” Id. (quoting In re Jazlyn P., 31 A.3d at 1279). 5', 'The respondent prematurely filed notices of appeal on April 29, 2015. This Court, however, will treat the premature notices of appeal as if they had been timely filed after the judgment was entered. See Russell v. Kalian, 414 A.2d 462, 464 (R.I. 1980) (citing Beauvais v. Notre Dame Hospital, 120 R.I. 271, 387 A.2d 689 (1978)).', '-7-', 'Analysis', 'Before this Court, respondent argues that the Family Court justice erred in terminating his parental rights, specifically claiming that the state failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he was an unfit parent. In addition, respondent avers that the state failed to establish that it made reasonable efforts to strengthen the parental bond and offer services aimed at reunification, pursuant to §§ 15-7-7(a)(3) and 15-7-7(b)(1).6', 'When confronted with assertions such as these, our review of the Family Court’s decision is threefold. “We turn first to the court’s finding of parental unfitness; thereafter, we examine its finding as to the reasonable reunification efforts on the part of DCYF. Finally, our review turns to the Family Court’s determination concerning the children’s best interests.” In re Brooklyn M., 933 A.2d 1113, 1122 (R.I. 2007).', 'Parental Fitness', 'Our careful evaluation of the finding of unfitness made by the Family Court justice, in the face of this evidence, is not one with which we struggle. Pursuant to § 15-7-7(a)(2)(vii), a parent is deemed unfit where the parent “exhibited behavior or conduct that is seriously detrimental to the child, for a duration as to render it improbable for the parent to care for the child for an extended period of time[.]” A finding of parental unfitness under § 15-7-7(a)(2) made by a trial justice is “entitled to great weight and will not be disturbed on appeal unless [it is] clearly wrong or the trial justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence.” In re Jennifer R., 667 A.2d 535, 536 (R.I. 1995).', 'The Family Court justice premised her finding of unfitness on respondent’s refusal to cooperate with DCYF, his sporadic visits, and the unanimous consensus among DCYF service 6', 'The respondent does not contest that Briann and Bri’Nayshia have been in the legal custody or care of DCYF for at least twelve months, pursuant to § 15-7-7(a)(3).', '-8- providers that he is “agitated,” “angry,” and “threaten[s] physical harm when he [does] not ‘get his way,’” such that reunification with his children presents a risk to their well-being. The Family Court justice determined that this behavior and conduct “overwhelming[ly]” established that respondent was unfit to parent Briann and Bri’Nayshia. A thorough review of the record before us supports these findings—particularly the testimony of Shymanik. Although Shymanik testified to respondent’s occasional successes, such as obtaining employment, the majority of her testimony highlighted respondent’s noncompliance with case planning, his defiant refusal to sign medical releases, violent outbursts, frequent anger, and poor interactions with Briann and Bri’Nayshia.', 'Shymanik’s testimony concerning respondent’s mental-health issues and his refusal to accept the mental-health services offered to him demonstrates his unfitness. See In re Ryan S., 728 A.2d 454, 457 (R.I. 1999) (mother’s mental-health problems and her unwillingness to cooperate with recommended services rendered her unfit to parent her son). Shymanik’s testimony was accompanied by significant corroborating evidence establishing that respondent is unfit.', 'See In re Charles L., 6 A.3d 1089, 1093 (R.I. 2010) (affirming the trial justice’s determination of unfitness where parent demonstrated “periods of noncompliance” with treatment plan, “marked by violent outbursts, sudden mood changes, and unpredictable actions and demands”).', 'The respondent’s own statements also belie the notion that he was willing to parent Briann and Bri’Nayshia; perhaps none more than his admission that he would “hand the children over to his sister for her to parent them.”', 'This declaration aptly illustrates respondent’s unwillingness to parent these children and explains their lack of responsiveness to him. We are therefore satisfied that the Family Court justice’s findings with respect to this issue were not clearly erroneous and were supported by clear and convincing evidence.', '-9-', 'Reasonable Efforts', 'In order for the Family Court to terminate a parent’s rights under § 15-7-7 (a)(2)(vii), it is incumbent upon DCYF to establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that it employed “reasonable efforts” to “encourage and strengthen the parental relationship.” Section 15-7- 7(b)(1). In addition, pursuant to § 15-7-7(a)(3), DCYF must establish by clear and convincing evidence that it “offered services that amount to a reasonable effort to correct the situation that led to the children’s removal from the parent’s care.” In re Lauren B., 78 A.3d 752, 760 (R.I. 2013) (citing In re Christopher B., 823 A.2d 301, 315 (R.I. 2003)). Under no circumstance have we enlarged these requirements to a point where DCYF need demonstrate that it took “extraordinary efforts.” Id. (quoting In re Jose Luis R.H., 968 A.2d 875, 882 (R.I. 2009)). Rather, the law requires that DCYF employ “reasonable efforts,” and the reasonableness of such efforts “must be determined from the ‘particular facts and circumstances of each case.’” In re Joseph S., 788 A.2d 475, 478 (R.I. 2002) (quoting In re Kristen B., 558 A.2d 200, 203 (R.I. 1989)).', 'After reviewing the record, it is clear to us that DCYF complied with its statutory obligation to make reasonable efforts to reunify respondent with Briann and Bri’Nayshia. The failure in this case rests squarely upon respondent. The Family Court justice found that DCYF “made extraordinary efforts” to consult and plan with respondent, including: creating four case plans for each child, making suitable arrangements for visitation, and endeavoring to increase the number of visits. DCYF also made numerous referrals for various and badly needed family services, including parenting skills and mental-health counseling. See In re Jose Luis R.H., 968 A.2d at 882 (finding that “reasonable efforts” include making “suitable arrangements for visitation” and providing appropriate services to the family (quoting In re Nathan F., 762 A.2d', '- 10 - 1193, 1195 (R.I. 2000))). The respondent, however, failed to comply with DCYF’s recommendations, declined to follow through with any mental-health counseling, and refused to cooperate with DCYF’s case plans. See In re Michael F., 665 A.2d 880, 882 (R.I. 1995) (concluding that a parent’s “unwillingness to accept help clearly places [the child] at risk of emotional and physical harm”). The Family Court justice concluded that, despite respondent’s “attitude and lack of cooperation,” DCYF persevered in its attempts to work with him for more than two years. Nonetheless, respondent’s efforts were “marginal at best.” See In Raymond C., 864 A.2d 629, 634 (R.I. 2005) (“[P]arents must not only maintain contact with the child and plan for the child’s future return but also ‘perform some minimal act toward the fulfillment of that plan.’” (quoting In re Kristen B., 558 A.2d at 204)).', 'Our review of the record reveals that there is adequate evidentiary support for the Family Court justice’s careful and detailed conclusions. The respondent, however, categorizes these findings as “vague[] articulat[ions]” and suggests that the record reveals that any conduct unbecoming to a parent that he may have displayed is directly attributable to DCYF’s failure to provide him with individualized treatment. To this argument we echo our sentiments in In re Natalya C., 946 A.2d 198 (R.I. 2008), in that “we do not fault the agency when the treatment received does not resolve the underlying problem or when a parent’s recalcitrance to treatment precludes reunification.” Id. at 203 (citing In re Raymond C., 864 A.2d at 633). During two precious years of his daughters’ childhood, respondent failed to obtain safe and adequate housing or otherwise plan for their future. His sporadic efforts, refusal to cooperate with DCYF, and failure to nurture a loving relationship with his children lead us to conclude that respondent is simply unequipped to parent them.', '- 11 -', 'We have long recognized that, in carrying out its responsibilities for child welfare, DCYF need not be burdened with “holding the hand of a recalcitrant parent.” In re Joseph S., 788 A.2d at 478 (quoting In re Kristen B., 558 A.2d at 204). We therefore conclude that the Family Court justice did not err when she found by clear and convincing evidence that DCYF made reasonable efforts to correct the situation that led to the removal of Briann and Bri’Nayshia from respondent’s care.', 'The Best Interests of the Children', 'Once DCYF has “demonstrated parental unfitness and has shown that it made reasonable efforts at reunification, the Family Court then shifts its analysis to consider the best interests of the child or children involved in the proceeding.” In re Brooklyn M., 933 A.2d at 1126 (citing In re Kristina L., 520 A.2d 574, 580 (R.I. 1987)). The best interests of the child or children “outweigh all other considerations.” Id.', 'The Family Court justice concluded that it was “clearly in the best interest of [Briann and Bri’Nayshia] that they be adopted by their foster families.” See In re Shanelly C., 785 A.2d 1129, 1132 (R.I. 2001) (“We cannot disregard the bond [the child] has formed with loving foster parents in a pre-adoptive home.”). Although we remain mindful of the “significance of severing the bond between parent and child,” we are satisfied that the evidence presented in this case supported the termination of the respondent’s parental rights. In re Alexis L., 972 A.2d 159, 170 (R.I. 2009) (“[T]his Court is ever cognizant of the significance of severing the bond between parent and child [; however,] it is in the best interests of children to have a safe and nurturing environment in which to live, learn and grow.”).', '- 12 -', 'Conclusion', 'For these reasons, the respondent’s appeal is denied and dismissed.
